- Miss Arabella is expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

28
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,591
I'll take your coat, sir.

29
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,300
Mr. Pemberton. So nice to see you.

30
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,635
Hello, my dear. Thank you.
You're looking very beautiful, as usual.

31
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,175
Thank you.
Griffin, are the others ready?

32
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,576
They're all in the library except
Master Jack. I'll bring him.

33
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,843
- He should be there, shouldn't he?
- By all means.

34
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,579
- Isn't it pleasant to have snow again?
- Very much...

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,849
Roll it about.

Hey, Griffin. Come on in.

39
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,590
Pour off the water.

40
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,107
Try some soap and water in there
sometime if you really want results.

41
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,907
Soap? You don't need soap.
This is how you pan gold.

42
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,345
Pan gold?

43
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,043
It tells in there.
How to swirl it about...

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,845
...gradually pour off the water...

45
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,582
...until you get down to the nuggets.

46
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,925
Oh. Oh. Of course. Well...

47
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,727
[Griffin] "Bullwhip Brannigan.

48
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,632
Or a son of the mother lode."

49
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,273
Bullwhip took Tom Wingay with him
to the gold fields.

50
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,005
Tom was just my age and he wrestled
with a grizzly bear. Bullwhip did.

51
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,048
The bear got loose and ran away,
so Bullwhip really won!

52
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,108
Mmm. Well, it would be nice,
Master Jack,

53
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,313
if you would become better
acquainted with the classics

54
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,324
rather than wasting your time
upon such trivia.

55
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,555
Trivia? What do you mean, trivia?
It's educational.

56
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,651
How?

57
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,220
I bet you can't show me
in any of those books

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,996
where it tells how to pan gold,
or how to wrestle with a grizzly bear.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,132
Hmm. Quite true. They do, however,
give an amazing insight

60
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:13,406
into the rather peculiar behavior
of growing boys.

61
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:20,480
Shall we be going?
The lawyer is waiting.

62

fifty thousand dollars."

69
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,677
- [Gasps]
- Would you say that again, sir?

70
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,740
Fifty thousand dollars.

Abigail Guckennick.

74
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:06,031
Oh. Miss Abigail Guckennick.
"I bequeath $90,000."

75
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,397
Ninety thousand!?

76
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,134
"To my housekeeper of many years,

77
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,402
guardian of my health
and custodian of my morality,

78
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:20,936
Miss Irene Chesney,
I bequeath $100,000."

79
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,211
Oh... What an angel he was.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,824
"To my butler, Eric Griffin,

81
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,352
who at a young age
promises to surpass his father

82
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,399
and his father's father
in doing the proper thing

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,526
in the proper way at the proper time,

84
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,572
I bequeath $500,000,

85
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,576
in profound confidence that he will not
so much as arch an eyebrow

86
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,477
when he learns of this bequest."

87
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,409
Half a million dollars?

88
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,976
What a kind, saintly man he was.

89
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,454
[Lawyer] "All the remainder of my estate

90
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,620
plus, specifically,
the family residence in Boston,

91
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,561
together with all of its furniture
and furnishings,

92
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:16,260
I bequeath to my two grandchildren,
my sole surviving heirs,

93
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,896
Arabella and Jack Flagg."

94
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:26,245
The document is duly signed,
and is quite legal, I assure you.

95
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:30,772
There never was a finer person born
than the old gentleman.

96
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,613
Rest his good soul.

97
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,209
[Sidwell] Amen to that!

98
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,383
So much for the will.
Now for the facts.

99
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,052
During the later years of his life,

100
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,927
Mr. Flagg lived not only
on borrowed time...

101
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,833
...but on borrowed money.

102
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,701
You mean, he died broke?

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,940
Dead broke.

104
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,738
[Sobbing]

105
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,881
Ornery old coot.
Probably thought it was funny.

106
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,649
[Sobbing]

107
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,395
Even the mortgage
on this house was past due,

108
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,227
long past due.

109
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,768
However, the bank has promised
not to foreclose for 90 days.

110
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,170
[Lawyer] I'm sorry, my dear.

111
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,541
[Sobbing] Think of poor Miss Arabella.
Not even a home to live in.

112
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,075
And a little brother to look out after.

113
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,589
And she's got no training.
Never had to go out and face the world.

114
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,922
What's she going to do?

115
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,780
Excuse me, miss.
Is there anything I can do?

116
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,874
[Laughs]

117
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm sorry, Griffin. I know I shouldn't
be laughing, but I can't help it.

118
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,119
But, miss, this is a serious matter.

119
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,058
Don't you see?
Even writing out his will,

120
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,619
he had to have his own little joke.

121
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,530
Well, if that is what one considers it.

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,501
Well, Grandpa used to say
people are 98 percent water.

123
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,097
If you don't stir them up
once in a while, they stagnate.

124
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,868
The disturbing thing is, miss,

125
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:41,505
that he has left you and Master Jack
without any financial security.

126
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,072
Unprotected.

127
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,984
Well, I think that's what he wanted
most of all.

128
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,522
For us to be free
to make our own lives.

129
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,924
But Master Jack is only 12 years old.

130
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,790
Grandpa was only 11
when he ran off to sea.

131
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:01,162
What about you, miss?
It's different for a young lady.

132
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,665
I'm not afraid, Griffin.

133
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,069
There's a lot of Grandpa in me.
I'll think of something to do.

134
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,505
Lf, uh...

135
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,743
If there's anything you want...

136
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,610
- Griffin?
- Hmm?

137
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,350
What will you do? Get a job
somewhere else as a butler?

138
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,360
I suppose so, miss. I really had not
given the matter much thought.

139
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,795
Do you remember
your ninth birthday party?

140
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,231
You threw a serving tray
through the window

141
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,361
and said you wouldn't ever
be a butler when you grew up.

142
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,597
I remember, miss.

143
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,269
But I had rather hoped
that others had forgotten.

144
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,141
How could I forget that, Griffin?

145
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:52,480
You're the only boy I knew in Boston
who ever broke a window deliberately.

146
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,079
Thank you, miss.

147
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,653
And now, if, uh,
you will excuse me, I shall, uh...

148
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,387
...prepare the dinner menu.

149
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,598
[Sighs]

150
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,506
I don't know, Grandpa. I guess some
people just can't be stirred up, huh?

151
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,870
Miss Arabella! It's Master Jack.
Quickly. Where's Miss Arabella?

152
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,437
Miss Chesney! Now, really!

153
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,212
- I was just in Master Jack's room.
- What is it?

154
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,880
Master Jack. He's gone.

155
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,862
"Dear Arabella. I have set out
to seek my fortune

156
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,265
so you will not
have to take care of me.

157
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,031
When I am rich, I will come back
and take care of you.

158
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,165
Would you please
feed my goldfish? Jack."

159
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,641
- Goldfish, indeed.
- [Sobs]

160
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,238
No, not now, Miss Chesney. Go tell
Harry to get the carriage ready.

161
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,408
We have to find him and
bring him back before it's too late.

162
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,851
Look. I'm afraid he has succumbed
to the California gold fever.

163
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,515
[Arabella] Oh, no,
what are we going to do?

164
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,491
I think I know where I can find him.
With your permission,

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,858
I shall stop him
before he gets too far.

166
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,295
Yes, yes, Griffin. Please do.

167
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,265
Oh, uh, yes, miss.
Uh, right away, miss.

168
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,143
I have it, gentlemen. A ticket.
Gather round, gentlemen, up here.

169
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,238
A ticket for the sailing.

170
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,512
A ticket on the <i>Lady Wilma</i>
to San Francisco.

171
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,351
[Man] Step right in, gentlemen.
Now, this is an unclaimed ticket

172
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,913
that I am going to sell
to the highest bidder.

173
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,583
This is your ticket to fortune,

174
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,958
to the gold fields of California.
What am I offered?

175
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,465
Will some gentleman start this bidding,
say at $500?

176
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,933
- [Man] Five hundred.
- Thank you, sir, $500.

177
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,438
Remember. This is the last ticket
on the beautiful <i>Lady Wilma,</i>

178
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,600
sailing now for San Francisco.

179
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,439
I have five,
I'm looking for 550, anybody?

180
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,878
- [Man 2] I'll make it 550.
- Thank you. $550.

181
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,677
[Auction continues in background]

182
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,806
Stay where you are.

183
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,485
- [Jack] Are you trying to stowaway too?
- Stowaway? Oh, no, lad.

184
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,120
What I needs must shake the
murderous hounds pursuing me.

185
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,060
- Are the police after you?
- Shh!

186
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,259
[Man] Ah. Here, boy.

187
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,038
In with you. Come on. Give me that.

188
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,341
Who will make it 1200? 1200?

189
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,646
- 1200!
- Thank you, sir. 1200.

190
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,152
I have 1200. Who will make it 1250?

191
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,951
Oh, come on, gentlemen.

192
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,855
You can wash that much gold
out of your socks every night

193
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,393
- after you get to California.
- [Laughter]

194
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,057
All right, gentlemen, who will
make it 1250? Going once...

195
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,863
Going twice...
Are you all through, gentlemen?

196
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,268
You're gonna hate yourselves
in the morning.

197
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,206
Going...

198
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,902
...going...

199
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,707
...and gone!
- Yahoo!

200
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,771
[Crowd clamoring]

201
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,751
Oh, yes, sir. Right away.
You got a great wagon there, sir.

202
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,288
Put that in the envelope for you.
There you are.

203
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,229
- Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
- Oh, pardon me.

204
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,662
- I am sorry.
- I'm sure it was my fault.

205
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,667
I'm so excited. I'm going
to California for the gold rush!

206
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,999
Good for you! Oh, my hat.

207
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,837
Well, I'm sorry I was...
But I... Well...

208
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,545
- Your ticket.
- Oh!

209
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,725
The ticket, it's gone.

210
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,756
But I just bought it.
Somebody stole my ticket.

211
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,064
[Shouting] I've been robbed!
Search everybody!

212
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,766
- You, sir. You were over there.
- Yes, I was.

213
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,241
He is absolutely right. He bought
a ticket. I was there. I saw him.

214
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,303
- You just keep out of this...
- I beg your pardon.

215
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,872
I, sir, am Judge Higgins
of the appellate court,

216
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,682
and I demand that you search
every single man along this...

217
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,817
Wouldn't do any good, though,
would it?

218
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,949
Everybody going aboard
is bound to have a ticket.

219
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
- Let us handle it, Your Honor.
- Yes, of course.

220
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,958
Step off the gang plank.

221
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,195
I say, you. Oh, I didn't get your name.

222
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,535
- Brown. Brown, sir.
- Mr. Brown.

223
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,666
Why don't you go over there
with the aid of these two officers

224
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,271
and carefully go through all your
pockets and see if you can't find it.

225
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,442
You were terribly excited.
It's not good to get that excited.

226
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,782
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Your Honor.
- Yes. It's quite all right.

227
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,549
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,687
- [Man 1] Your ticket.
- [Man 2] Thank you.

229
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,925
You, sir. Are you
the captain of this ship?

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Captain Swain.
If you've any business with me,

231
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,198
say your say
and be quick about it.

232
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,966
I have reason to believe
there is a 12-year-old boy

233
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,635
- stowed away aboard your ship.
- I have reasons to believe there isn't.

234
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,909
He is the grandson
of the late Alonzo Flagg of Boston.

235
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,645
Now, I want no part in no stowaway.

236
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,688
[Swain] Will you give me your word,
as a gentleman,

237
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,782
that you and him'll be ashore
before we sail.

238
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,520
Unquestionably.

239
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,287
All right.

240
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,859
I'll show you how to get below.

241
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,924
Thank you.

242
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,107
If the police aren't after you,
then who is?

243
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:30,175
I could a tale unfold whose lightest
word would harrow up thy soul.

244
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,082
Freeze thy young blood.

245
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:38,112
And 'tis better you take heed also,
for 'tis true, lad,

246
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,854
he who runneth with the fox
must beware the hounds.

247
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,020
Or is it dogs?

248
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,929
[Stammering] Yes, well,
I think I'd better be going.

249
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,990
[Door rattles]

250
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,590
[Banging]

251
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,040
Breathe softly and beware.

252
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,842
For it is often said
that jackals run in pairs.

253
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,724
[Jack] Good grief, Griffin.
What are you doing here?

254
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,855
You know him?

255
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,400
You've just knocked out our butler.

256
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,860
Griffin?

257
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,632
Griffin?

258
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,645
- You gave me your word, didn't you?
- I have tried to explain, sir.

259
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,011
You took advantage
of my good disposition.

260
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,346
Well, you'll work your passage
in the bunkers

261
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,787
and you'll rue the day you ever
heard the name of Captain Swain!

262
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,127
I am making a formal request, captain,

263
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,029
that you set us both ashore
at your first port of call.

264
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,293
[Laughs] I'll put you ashore
right enough

265
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,597
but it's what happens
between now and then,

266
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,968
is what you've got to worry about.

267
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,407
Get away from that.
That's not for you.

268
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,111
I appreciate that, sir.

269
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,347
You'll take your scoffings
with the crew,

270
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,413
unless I put you on bread and water.

271
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,948
I think I would prefer that, sir,
if we have a choice.

272
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,020
We'll leave it to the paying
passengers to malign the chow,

273
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,498
if ya don't mind.

274
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,931
If I may make a suggestion, captain.

275
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,943
Rather than waste my talent
in the bunker, sir,

276
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,004
if you would permit me
to prepare and serve your food

277
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,210
in the fully proper manner,
for your own safety, sir,

278
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,549
with the help of Master Jack,
my apprentice.

279
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,614
- You'll do what I say.
- By all means, sir.

280
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,756
Hey.

281
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,593
Have you ever tried
your hand at galley grub?

282
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,736
- Galley grub?
- He knows all there is to know...

283
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,277
...about food.
- Knowing and doing

284
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:25,180
is two different things, especially
for a landlubber put to sea.

285
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,819
My grandfather, sir,
prepared and served the meals

286
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,051
for Admiral Lord Nelson
at the Battle of Trafalgar.

287
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,825
All right.

288
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,888
One chance, I'll give ya.
And one chance only.

289
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,955
Thank you, sir.

290
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,003
And if you don't serve me
a fair to middling meal,

291
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,301
then it's off to the bunkers for you!

292
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,786
"And while the captain had agreed
to set us ashore at first port of call,

293
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,451
he now refuses to release us
from our duties:

294
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,825
Preparing his meals
and tending his cabin.

295
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,763
Consequently, we shall continue
on to the gold fields,

296
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,130
praying that fortune shall smile upon us

297
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,466
and that you may forgive us
the anxiety we have occasioned.

298
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,870
Master Jack has made friends
with an old judge

299
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,306
who has agreed to post this
when we reach Rio."

300
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:29,678
Doesn't that beat all?
The two of them bound for California.

301
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,479
Isn't that just like Griffin?
Even if he were assigned to a rock pile,

302
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,349
he'd make himself indispensable.

303
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,584
I can't get over it.
Griffin and Master Jack.

304
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,287
All alone in that wild country out west.

305
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:48,265
Well, we won't let them be all alone.
You may start packing my things.

306
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,234
- Don't you say you go.
- Why not?

307
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,067
There's nothing I can do here
I can't do in California.

308
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:58,405
- It's not a right place for a lady.
- Oh...

309
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:02,345
- Oh, sorry.
- Some of the stories I've heard.

310
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,942
Men outnumber women
100 to one in San Francisco.

311
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,384
Well, there's nothing wrong
with those odds,

312
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,446
especially when a young lady
has to earn her own living.

313
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,857
Oh, Griffin wouldn't approve
of you going to California.

314
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,385
But I think Grandpa
would approve of it heartily.

315
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,027
He wanted me to be free
to try my wings.

316
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,631
To find my own place
in this beautiful and exciting world.

317
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,903
I'll go lay out my things.

318
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,275
- That's about all.
- Oh.

319
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,974
Tell you what, miss.
Just to make it a clean deal,

320
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,042
I'll add $5 for the frame and picture.

321
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,182
Oh, I wouldn't part with Grandfather
for $1,000.

322
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,556
But if you're
going to California, miss...

323
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,492
Oh.

324
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,656
Well, in that case,
I'll leave him in your custody.

325
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,205
I'll take the five.

326
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,612
<i>Griffin and Jack</i>
<i>who spent theirjourney in the galley</i>

327
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,591
<i>At last were nearing</i>
<i>San Francisco Bay</i>

328
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,596
<i>Their culinary art won over</i>
<i>the captains heart</i>

329
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,361
<i>As the menu grew</i>
<i>more elegant each day</i>

330
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,668
As soon as we drop anchor
in San Francisco Bay,

331
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,372
every blasted member of the crew
is going to be over the side

332
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,039
and headed for the gold fields.

333
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,243
Hasn't been a ship left port in months.

334
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,308
Oh.

335
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,752
Do you have any idea
what time we'll get there?

336
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,280
We should get within spitting distance
during the graveyard watch.

337
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,259
We should get in tomorrow morning?

338
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,319
Tomorrow afternoon more likely.

339
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,695
[Swain] I'm not picking me way
through no floating graveyard

340
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,132
- and early morning soup.
- Oh.

341
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,031
Now, now, now, sonny.

342
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,632
[Swain] A few hours isn't going
to make all that difference.

343
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,145
Why don't you go and start
getting your donnies together?

344
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,443
I'll see you get to shore
in the first boat tomorrow.

345
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,950
- You're very kind, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

346
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,754
[Slurping]

347
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,468
[Jack and Griffin] <i>Oh, Susanna</i>
<i>Oh, dont you cry for me</i>

348
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,663
<i>For Im off to California...</i>

349
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,765
- Well, well. Griffin.
- Uh, by all means, sir.

350
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,369
[Laughs] And my
little friend Jack, huh?

351
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,039
What a beautiful day for singing.

352
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,878
Watch this.

353
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,913
- [Guffaws]
- Very good.

354
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,548
Oh, I'll bet you can
hardly wait to reach port.

355
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,058
Just barely. Are you going up
to the gold fields?

356
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,857
The gold fields?
Oh, I may, eventually.

357
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,229
But there are things in the world
more important than gold, son.

358
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,237
This is a new land, and it needs laws
and courts and justice.

359
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:18,106
Laws, courts, justice. Those are the
things I'm concerned with most of all.

360
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:24,172
Oh, yes. Laws, courts and justice.
Oh, yes, sir.

361
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,877
I really like that Judge Higgins.
Don't you?

362
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,648
Well, I don't know, Master Jack.

363
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,418
Sometimes I think
he tries almost too hard to be friendly.

364
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,016
What's wrong with being friendly?
You told me...

365
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,722
- Wait a minute.
- [Muffled banging, mumbling]

366
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,793
[Groaning]

367
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,500
- Mr. Bartlett, what happened?
- Who did this to you?

368
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,869
- Who did this to you?
- They followed me.

369
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,244
They are on this ship.
The thread of life spins out.

370
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,308
- Did you see who hit you?
- A coward's blow from behind.

371
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,946
When I came to, I was blindfolded.

372
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,583
I could hear the man
ransacking my room.

373
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:12,523
[Bartlett] I suppose you do know
what he was seeking.

374
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,292
[Sighs]

375
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,494
- But he found it not.
- Found what not?

376
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:24,134
Hidden there lies ample bait
to lure the most treacherous of hounds.

377
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,973
A map given to me by a dying man

378
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,879
whom I had befriended
in a boarding house in Salem.

379
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,626
A map... to the mother lode.

380
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,592
Oh. Yes, well, um...

381
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,158
We will report this to the captain
immediately.

382
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,535
Oh, no, it would do no good
for I know not mine enemies.

383
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,700
And I do not greatly trust
that Captain Swain.

384
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,937
Oh.

385
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,174
Well, sir, I'm afraid that
under the circumstances,

386
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,148
there is nothing we can do for you.

387
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,653
Stick with me, you two.
If you'll a willing ear incline,

388
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,157
what's mine is yours
and what is yours is mine.

389
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,489
- You want us to be partners?
- [Bartlett] Aye, lad.

390
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,792
These are the crucial hours
as our journey nears its end.

391
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,823
For mine enemies,
the time is ripe to strike swiftly.

392
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,838
Seize the prize if they can find it
and be gone. What say you, friends?

393
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,902
[Stammering] Oh, uh...

394
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:35,105
I'm afraid that, uh...
we cannot remain with you here.

395
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,149
We have our duties
in the captain's cabin.

396
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,150
Oh, well. No matter.

397
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,120
I will remain locked in here.
You can look in on me occasionally.

398
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,421
- Bring me my remaining meals.
- Oh, by all means, sir.

399
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,494
And if another living soul
should dare to cross that threshold,

400
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,125
t'would be foolishness indeed.
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,897
Griffin! We'll be partners
in the mother lode!

402
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,369
- Shh.
- Master Jack!

403
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,962
Please?

404
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,667
Very well.

405
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,347
Mother lode indeed.

406
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,918
Don't forget my remaining meals.

407
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,910
[Jack] Griffin. Griffin. Hey, Griffin.

408
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,819
- Hmm?
- You can see 'em, Griffin.

409
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,849
Lights across the water. Somebody said
they're on boats in San Francisco Bay.

410
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,090
- Where do you think you're going?
- Don't you want to see them?

411
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,328
Oh, yes. All in due time.
You should be preparing for bed.

412
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,098
Oh, no. Just when we're getting here?
After all these months?

413
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,106
- Don't you realize...
- Master Jack,

414
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:13,941
you're going to have a busy day
tomorrow. You need your rest. Obey.

415
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,007
Oh. I stopped by to tell
Mr. Bartlett. Boy, is he excited.

416
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,052
Just think, Griffin.
If we do find the you-know-what,

417
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,419
and we're partners, we'll be about
the richest people in Boston.

418
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,357
You won't have to be a butler.
You can buy into a business.

419
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,223
Master Jack...

420
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,823
Sit down, Master Jack.

421
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,700
I want to tell you something.

422
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,697
I am proud to be a butler,

423
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,472
as was my father,
as was his father before him.

424
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,206
And, uh, I don't
understand why everybody...

425
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,649
[Swain] Fire! Fire in the hole!

426
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,745
Quick! Up on the deck!

427
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,556
[Swain] Hurry! Hurry!

428
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,292
[Panicked shouting]

429
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,600
It's a fire, a fire, I tell ya!

430
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,073
[Shouting]

431
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,179
Get back, I tell you!

432
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,809
[Man] Bring that over there. That's it.

433
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,911
- Excuse us. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

434
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,694
Abandon ship!

435
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,323
[Higgins] Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

436
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,802
Come on. Be quick. Don't stand there
like a fool. The whole ship's on fire.

437
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,333
Caution, my friend. Caution.

438
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,071
If you have any small thing of value,
you'd better take it along.

439
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,448
Fire! Fire!

440
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,524
Oh. Thank you.

441
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,996
- Turn around. Turn around.
- What? Oh.

442
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,794
I think it's the pistol. If you'd be
so kind as to hold the pistol...

443
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,883
Fire! Fire! Fire!

444
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,114
[Commotion]

445
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,555
[Swain] Hands up on decks! Hands up!

446
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:57,170
Get them buckets moving! Come on!

447
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,467
[Man] It's a false alarm!

448
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,476
It's a false alarm.

449
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,477
Just oily rags. The whole engine room
is full of smoke.

450
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,183
A false alarm?
What are you saying, man?

451
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,283
Some bilge rat done it on purpose?

452
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,953
Good heavens. It's a trick.

453
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,864
- Excuse me.
- Get in there. Come on.

454
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,899
[Coughing]

455
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,441
- Mr. Bartlett!
- What happened?

456
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,273
- Higgins, it was.
- Higgins?

457
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,212
- Judge Higgins?
- Yes.

458
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,444
I turned my back for a second

459
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,180
and he hit me.

460
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,521
[Moaning]

461
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,720
You stay here.
Do what you can to help him.

462
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,233
- Captain Swain.
- Captain's on the poop deck.

463
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,972
- Captain Swain?
- You'll have to see me later.

464
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,978
Some bilge rat took off
in my starboard boat.

465
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,276
That's exactly what I was afraid...

466
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,047
<i>Waiting there just for the findin</i>

467
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,352
<i>Shinin bright</i>
<i>Its nearly blindin</i>

468
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,452

00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,397

471
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,766
<i>Gotta claim my golden mountain</i>

472
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,832
<i>Gold that flows just like a fountain</i>

473
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,903
<i>Ill just spend my time</i>
<i>a- counting California gold</i>

474
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,416
- Step right in! Show on the inside!
- [Singing continues]

475
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,248
Come on in, everybody. Come on in.

476
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,689
<i>California gold</i>
<i>California gold</i>

477
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,353
- <i>California gold</i>
- Oh. Come along. Come on.

478
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,158
<i>Waitinjust for me</i>

479
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,960
[Griffin] Come on.

480
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,831
We shan't achieve our purpose
by standing there.

481
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,338
I'll bet Judge Higgins won't
waste time getting to the gold fields.

482
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,534
However, do you realize
that if we are to find this gold,

483
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,171
- we shall need a grubstake.
- Oh, yes. Hmm...

484
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,776
Look!

485
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,416
Oh! What prices!

486
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,689
My mind will not believe
what mine eyes have seen.

487
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,695
Nor mine.

488
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,425
A-ha.

489
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,938
I believe I have a thought which
obviously will be of service to mankind

490
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,166
and, I think, gain us the money we need.

491
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,680
[Sighs]

492
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:54,514
Permit me, dear friend. I think
perhaps I have more experience.

493
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,574
What?

494
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,781
[Laughs] All the world is a stage,
you know.

495
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,824
Oh. Huh.

496
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,973
Romans, countrymen and lovers.

497
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,645
Griffin, what are you doing?
You just gave me a haircut a week ago.

498
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,450
Shh, Master Jack. Not so loud.

499
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,821
Costly thy habit as thy purse.

500
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,383
Hey! Look what's come to town!

501
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,694
There's nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility.

502
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,701
To be...

503
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,567
To be or not to be?
That is the question.

504
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,298
Um, I was wondering
if any of you gentlemen

505
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,174
have seen a man around town
with a scar on his forehead.

506
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,544
His name is Higgins. Judge Higgins.

507
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,276
- I ain't seen him. Have you?
- No.

508
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,715
- You?
- Uh-uh.

509
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,621
How much you charge for a haircut?

510
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,153
Oh, well, sir. Uh...

511
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,626
For you, I...

512
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,428
Oh, I think the same modest price
as a tub bath. $10?

513
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,490
- I'm first in line, then.
- Oh.

514
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,935
You go over there
and set up as cashier. Sir.

515
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,906
- I'm after him.
- Right. Oh.

516
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,810
Oh, sir. I'm very much afraid
that for you it will be $15.

517
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,848
- [Clears throat] Same for me?
- Well, yes.

518
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,543
[Laughs]

519
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,552
I'll make it ten.

520
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,018
You can even keep your hat on too.

521
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,422
[Laughter]

522
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
Sir?

523
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:52,829
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

524
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,737
And if you poison us, do we not die?

525
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,935
- And if you wrong us...
- [crowd shouting]

526
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,249
This is a respectable place and
I don't want any of your kind here.

527
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,850
[Sam] Don't you ever forget it.

528
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,424
Hey, boss.

529
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,228
I go a little while. Mosey around town.

530
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,533
No. Go back inside. I want to keep
you from getting into trouble again.

531
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,365
Aw, gee, boss. You promised me.

532
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,343
All right. But only for a little while.

533
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,849
And remember,
keep your hands to yourself.

534
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,146
Sure, boss.

535
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,951
Uh, somebody said you been asking
about a man got a scar on his forehead.

536
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,993
Yeah, like down across here,
kind of, sort of?

537
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,359
- Yes, yes.
- Well, have you seen such a man?

538
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,866
- Sort of a big man, had a beard?
- That's right. It's Judge Higgins.

539
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:00,597
We saw him come ashore in
a small boat about sun-up, I'd say.

540
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,968
Do you know where he went?

541
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,940
Well, he tried to sell us his boat.
That's all. We says no.

542
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,909
Then he asks how can he get to Fry Town.

543
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,104
- Thank you, sir.
- No, no.

544
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,115
He asked how would he get to Hang Town.
Don't you remember?

545
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,310
- Fry Town!
- Hang Town!

546
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,444
You get everything wrong.
Don't you...

547
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,751
Thank you, gentlemen. I'm most
grateful for your information.

548
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,793
There will be, uh,
no more haircuts today.

549
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,385
You never listen when people talk!

550
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,240
How are we gonna find out which it is?
Fry Town or Hang Town?

551
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,607
Well, now, Master Jack,
how do you think it can be done?

552
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:46,041
Well, one way, Mr. Bartlett could go to
Fry Town and we could go to Hang Town.

553
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,883
Exactly. And if either picks up
the trail, he can inform the others.

554
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,548
And we can leave any messages
at Sutter's Fort.

555
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,990
Idea, lad, 'tis well said,
and t'were better soon be done.

556
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,357
Hmm.

557
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,988
How much do you think it's worth,
what we have here?

558
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,761
Oh, well now. I certainly think
that's enough to purchase our supplies

559
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,665
and get us started on our way.

560
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,897
Do you have anything
to take your share in?

561
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,430
I saw no need to buy a poke
when I had naught to put in it.

562
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,637
These should do adequately
for the moment. Would you hold on?

563
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,145
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

564
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,044
[Blows]

565
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,347
[Bartlett] Oh.

566
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,382
- Here you are.
- Well.

567
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,328
- Are you the man who cuts hair?
- Correct, sir.

568
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,131
Oh, but I have terminated
my activities for the day.

569
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:44,470
No. I want you to cut my hair now.
For me.

570
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,603
- Mountain Ox.
- Hmm. I reiterate, sir.

571
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,239
I have terminated my activities
for the day.

572
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,443
Oh, and uh, well,
even if I were to continue, sir,

573
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,076
there are other gentlemen...

574
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,655
I don't care about other men!

575
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,989
I tell you to cut hair, you cut hair!

576
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:11,434
Would you please keep
your vulgar hands off my apparel?

577
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,470
[Bartlett] You, sir, are a devil.

578
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:18,736
A born devil upon whose nature
nurture could never stick.

579
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,438
Nobody don't call no names
on Mountain Ox.

580
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,245
- How dare you, sir!
- You big bully!

581
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,114
Why, you little...

582
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,081
[man] He knocked out the Mountain Ox!

583
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,558
[Crowd yelling]

584
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,697
Here's the fella that did it!

585
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,629
[Man] He's out cold!

586
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,965
- [Man 2] You got him a good one!
- [Man 3] He knocked the Ox out!

587
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,567
[Sam] All right. Coming through.
What happened?

588
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,374
[Repeating] Didn't I tell you
to stay out of trouble?

589
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,508
All right, fellas. Get back.
Give him some air.

590
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,678
What happened? How many were there?
Did they gang up on him?

591
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,652
I do hope he's not badly hurt.
I am terribly sorry.

592
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,928
You did this?

593
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,058
Well, sir, you see, um...

594
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,795
Well, to tell you the truth, I...

595
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,427
His name's Bullwhip Griffin.

596
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,871
- You oughta see him wrestle a grizzly.
- Master Jack!

597
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,341
[Crowd laughs]

598
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,945
Bullwhip? My name is Sam Trimble.

599
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,577
Oh! How do you do, sir? [coughs]

600
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,121
I'm the owner
of the Lucky Nugget Saloon.

601
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:42,056
Oh. I'm honored, sir.
Now perhaps you will allow me...

602
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,822
I'll make you an offer.
I guarantee a $2,000 purse.

603
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,092
You take on the Mountain Ox
for the bareknuckle championship

604
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,463
of San Francisco.
Winner take all!

605
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,195
[Crowd cheers]

606
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,270
My friends! My friends.

607
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,281
I am most flattered
and I do thank you

608
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:10,582
but it is impossible as my partners
and I must leave for the gold field.

609
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,817
- Immediately.
- [Crowd groans]

610
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:25,528
He'll be back
and more willing to listen to reason

611
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,198
after he's tramped up enough hills
and missed enough meals.

612
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,653
[Gunshots]

613
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,133
How many want to live?
Hold up your hands, please.

614
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,604
Now!

615
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:15,117
Please, do not complain.
The land belongs to us.

616
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,780
You come take our gold?
[Laughs]

617
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,448
We start taking yours!

618
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,322
It don't come out even, though.
[Laughs]

619
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,496
Eh, Chico?
[Speaks Spanish]

620
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,730
[Bandit] Everybody come down.
Pronto!

621
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,006
[Bandit] Yoo-hoo.

622
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,104
You come out.

623
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,254
Oh! [laughs]

624
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,312
Turn around.

625
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,061
No funny business! Get in line!

626
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,465
- Judge Higgins!
- [Laughs]

627
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,059
Yes. Yes, it is, Jack.

628
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,071
Well, how do you do?

629
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,803
Griffin, I saw you get aboard and
I was hoping we might avoid this.

630
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,640
Oh, naturally.

631
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,740
Uh, please, <i>senores.</i>

632
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,877
First we take care of our business,
then you can talk.

633
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,545
Oh.

634
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,287
Hey, Chico? The ring.

635
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,260
Come on.

636
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,638
<i>Gracias, senores.</i>
You are most kind.

637
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,782
Now to please take off your coats.

638
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,546
- Why would he want us to do that?
- Move!

639
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,916
Oh!

640
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:01,390
In the lining is a good place
to hide the extra gold coins.

641
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,052
[Laughs] I have learned that trick.

642
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,154
No, sir. No, sir.

643
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,166
I have given you my gold,
you have taken my watch.

644
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,933
But I refuse to give up my coat.
You will have to shoot me first.

645
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,372
You make up the rules,
<i>senor,</i> not me.

646
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,275
[Bandit] But I will do anything
to make you happy.

647
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,374
- Oh!
- [Bandit laughs hysterically]

648
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,965
<i>Gracias, senor!</i>

649
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:46,731
<i>Gracias, senores.</i> You have been,
how you say, most generous.

650
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,772
Goodbye!

651
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,872
[Whooping]

652
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,083
[Gunshots]

653
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:10,053
Oh! Now that is marvelous,
absolutely marvelous.

654
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,989
- Oh, do stop that!
- Stop what?

655
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,827
What you're doing. By the by,

656
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,925
it is fortunate that fellow
did not blow your head off,

657
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,802
for I do believe Mr. Bartlett
has a prior claim to that privilege.

658
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,205
- Because of the map?
- [Griffin] Correct.

659
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,041
I now demand you hand it over,
immediately.

660
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,138
- Oh, you do, eh?
- We're partners with Mr. Bartlett.

661
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,116
Oh, you are, huh?
[Laughs]

662
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,381
The reason I didn't want to give up
my coat to that bandito...

663
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,354
I had the map sewn into the lining.

664
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:43,189
And as your friend Bartlett might
have said, there's the humor of it.

665
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,559
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Neither do I.

666
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,090
Oh, you don't, huh? The two of you
working your passage all those months.

667
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:55,229
[Laughs] And the infinite pains
I took to get it.

668
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:59,503
And now we lose it to a bandit
who doesn't even know he's got it!

669
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,311
[Man] You'll get used to things like
this, time you've been here a while.

670
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,478
Will I? You, sir. Will you please
hand down our packs?

671
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,284
Right there. The lad and I will not
continue the journey.

672
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,517
[Jack] But Griffin...

673
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,583
Don't blubber. As we have no gold...
Here, put this on.

674
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,425
We have no heavy coats
to keep us warm.

675
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,657
There.

676
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,759
Thank you, sir. It would be foolish
for us to continue.

677
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:30,296
There. Good day.
Are you ready? Press on.

678
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,876
I don't see why
we couldn't have gone on anyhow.

679
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,208
I mean,
even if the map is gone, that's...

680
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,010
Shh. I do not think
those banditos will ride far

681
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,744
with an unwieldy bundle of jackets.

682
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,918
And if they're just feeling around
for hidden coins...

683
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:50,187
[laughs] They may not
detect the map. Mmm. Come on.

684
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,024
Let's get aboard.
Get that door closed.

685
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,427
No, wait.

686
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,860
Toss it down. That's my bag
right there. Toss it down quickly.

687
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:10,437
Oh, I have
a very important engagement.

688
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,582
[Griffin] It is.

689
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:23,922
Oh, see. Look! Look!

690
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,621
[Laughs]

691
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,464
[Griffin] There we go.

692
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,367
[Higgins] Wise plan, then, Griffin.

693
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,100
Oh, splendid.
Oh, I'll take that now, thank you.

694
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,405
[Higgins] Strange, isn't it,
how our paths continue to cross.

695
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:45,107
Oh, I won't trouble you to help me
into it. Just toss it up gently.

696
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,275
No, sir.

697
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:52,220
I refuse to give you the coat.
You'll have to shoot me first.

698
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,690
- No! Don't shoot!
- Toss up the coat.

699
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,249
[Laughs]

700
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,058
Oh, I have no doubt
that you are a scoundrel, Higgins.

701
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,998
But you're not the type
who would shoot an unarmed man.

702
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:08,128
Well, that is purely
a personal opinion on your part.

703
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:12,767
You're certainly not the kind
to shoot an unarmed man in the back.

704
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,242
Shall we go, Master Jack?

705
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,875
[Stammering] Sir? My back was turned.

706
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,145
Shall I count to three?

707
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,017
- One... two...
- Wait!

708
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,579
No, no, no, Master Jack! Wait!

709
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,783
- Throw, Jack!
- Here!

710
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,520
[Laughs]

711
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,121
Oh, smart boy, Jack.

712
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:41,300
And if I may once again
quote your friend Bartlett,

713
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,272
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

714
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,208
[Griffin] Or as he might remind you,

715
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,872
"The path is smooth
that leadeth onto danger."

716
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:55,543
Oh, and I assure you, sir.
Our paths will cross again.

717
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,349
Our paths... [laughs]

718
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,959
<i>Going from camp to camp</i>
<i>They searched for old Judge Higgins</i>

719
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:08,896
<i>Who kept himself so cleverly disguised</i>

720
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,992
<i>Their quest would not be through</i>
<i>until they found every clue</i>

721
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,801
<i>And every clue was promptly utilized</i>

722
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,049
Let's ask him.

723
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,221
Excuse me, sir.

724
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,820
Sir?

725
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,552
Uh, we wanted to ask
if perhaps you had seen

726
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:43,895
a rather large man pass this way.
His name is Higgins. Judge Higgins.

727
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,127
A-ha.

728
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,569
He was wearing a white suit,
through Hang Town, headed this way.

729
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,198
[Speaks Chinese]

730
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,875
Maybe we should go ask some others.

731
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,778
Very well.

732
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,680
You're just wasting your time.

733
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,083
And just what
makes you say that, sir?

734
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,320
- Don't none of them talk English.
- Oh! Hmm.

735
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:13,328
Y'all want a dish of chow?
Just go in and help yourself.

736
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,058
I always do, every time I pass by.

737
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,432
- Don't they mind?
- Well, now, they ain't never said.

738
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:23,462
At least not so
I can understand them. [laughs]

739
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,872
[Laughs] Yes. I'm afraid
we must be on our way.

740
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,036
Now, hold on now.
This man you're looking for,

741
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,570
he sure sounds like old Cut Eye
over at Shirt Tail camp.

742
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,483
The only trouble is, he's a dentist.
He ain't no judge.

743
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,749
Well now, uh... Are you sure?
Did you meet him?

744
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,850
Meet him? I was the first one
he ever pulled tooth for

745
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,952
after he come over to Shirt Tail.

746
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:50,557
He got me all hooched up so I
wouldn't feel nothing. Look here.

747
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,459
Oh.

748
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,427
Skunk pulled every dagbusted tooth
that had any gold in it.

749
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,669
We thank you, sir,
for the information. Good day.

750
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,249
[Shouting]

751
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,795
It's Judge Higgins they're hanging.

752
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,391
I demand to be heard
and I will be heard.

753
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,364
Open your mouth.

754
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,672
- In. Inside.
- Oh!

755
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,710
Wait!

756
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,144
[Griffin] Please! Wait!

757
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,012
Oh, we've come 50 miles. 50 miles!

758
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,381
We must use your dentist
before you hang him.

759
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,079
[Gasps]

760
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,678
[Moans]

761
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,953
Well, it looks to me like a
compound infection of an abscess root.

762
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,392
- [Higgins] Come closer, boy.
- [Moans]

763
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,556
- Open your mouth.
- No! He can't do that.

764
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,659
- He can't?
- The air. It's very bad on the tooth.

765
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,536
- The air.
- Oh. Oh, yes, yes! The air!

766
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,837
[Moaning]

767
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,211
Don't touch him! A thing like that
could be fatal to a boy his age

768
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,475
if he isn't treated immediately.

769
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,779
What are we gonna do?
We gotta do something.

770
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,581
- We can't let that poor boy suffer.
- Please, please.

771
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,214
You must do something
to help this poor lad.

772
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,582
All right, boys.

773
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,959
Old Cut Eye been duly tried
by miners' court.

774
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,160
And found guilty of thievery,
and sentenced to be hung.

775
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,203
- However, this one time,
- [crowd murmuring]

776
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,762
We gonna temper justice with mercy.

777
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,832
- We gonna let you live long enough
- [moaning]

778
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,310
To pull this suffering boy's tooth.

779
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,408
Why, you'll never regret it, sir.

780
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,816
Thank you, sir. Oh, thank you.

781
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,824
[Crowd murmuring]

782
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,661
I was never so happy
to see anyone in my whole life.

783
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,825
Ow! [whispers]
Do you still have the map?

784
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,597
It's where nobody will find it
in 100 years.

785
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,799
Why don't you tell us where it is?

786
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,809
It won't do you any good
after they hang you.

787
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,573
Get me out of this alive...

788
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,171
...and I promise you the map is yours.

789
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,951
You are absolutely ridiculous. How
can we possibly do a thing like that?

790
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,147
- They'd shoot us all.
- Give me your word

791
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,350
- you'll do what you can.
- Oh, come along, Master Jack.

792
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,758
[Higgins] I have it. I have it.

793
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,888
Tell them I can't pull the tooth
till the swelling goes down.

794
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,989
It'll take several days.

795
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,468
You.

796
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,439
Give us the map first,

797
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,237
and I promise we'll do everything
we can to help you.

798
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,404
- You promise?
- I promise.

799
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,650
You said it was where nobody
would find it in 100 years.

800
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,452
That's the first place we'd look.

801
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,357
Not if I had been buried
with my coat on.

802
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,691
[Laughs] That's very good.

803
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,700
[Griffin stammering] But this map
is no earthly good.

804
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,604
The most important part is missing.

805
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,266
The end of the trail.

806
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,609
Shot away by that insolent varmint
who held up the stage.

807
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,915
You gave me your word
to do everything you can.

808
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,954
- We won't do anything.
- Master Jack.

809
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,791
Quite right.

810
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,021
Wait, Bullwhip! He tricked us.

811
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:44,362
Nevertheless, a gentleman
does not go back on his word.

812
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,904
Get away from that window, sonny.

813
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,409
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

814
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,173
You simply must wait
until another dentist arrives.

815
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,216
But he been convicted.
He gotta be hung!

816
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,376
[Crowd roars]

817
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:06,218
Have you ever been awakened
in the middle of the night

818
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:09,281
by an excruciating toothache?

819
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,157
One that throbs and pounds?

820
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,561
Like 1,000 hot knives
jabbing and searing

821
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,795
until you can feel it
down to your toenails?

822
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,666
[Gasps] It could happen tonight.

823
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,105
Yes, it could. Yes, to you.

824
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,166
Or you.

825
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,907
And you. It could happen
to any one of you.

826
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:36,475
Ah. But how?
How will you feel then, tonight,

827
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:41,320
when you have hanged the only
available dentist this morning?

828
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:45,953
For the time being, he's worth more
alive to us than he is dead.

829
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,429
But he gonna be
under guard every minute.

830
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:53,458
And we gonna get on with the hanging
as soon as another dentist shows up.

831
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,568
Oh, and one thing more.

832
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,540
As head of the miners' committee,

833
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:03,477
I'm ordering you and that boy
to get his grave dug.

834
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,174
[Miner] Have it ready and waitin'.

835
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:11,118
Kind of a reminder to him
that we mean business.

836
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,022
Dig her plenty deep, too.

837
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,788
We're gonna get rid of that crook
once and for all.

838
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,237
You know what was nice
about <i>Bullwhip Brannigan?</i>

839
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,299
Towards the end of the book,
after he built his rock palace

840
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,242
and married the Indian princess...

841
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,940
Indian princess?

842
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,381
- Oh!
- He told Tom Wingay,

843
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,476
"No matter where you travel
in this life,

844
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:48,047
you'll always have a home
to come back to. Here. With us."

845
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,389
Bullwhip, why don't you get married?

846
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,699
Well, Master Jack, for one thing,

847
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,326
I never happened to meet
an Indian princess.

848
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,395
It wouldn't have to be that.
What about Arabella?

849
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,033
Oh, now really, Master Jack!

850
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,136
[Stammering] You shouldn't talk like
that. That's not proper. She's a lady.

851
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,148
- You like her, don't you?
- Look, that is not the question.

852
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,912
You're always peeking
at her picture when I put it up.

853
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,247
Please, Master Jack.

854
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,016
She carries the locket
you gave her in sixth grade.

855
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,647
That is enough.

856
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,887
I thought it would make us
really brothers. Brothers-in-law,

857
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,226
and then if you and Arabella
had a house...

858
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,391
Oh, look.

859
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,333
[Stammering] Look here.

860
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:38,705
- Do you think it's a mother lode?
- Well, you know it could be, Jack.

861
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,176
It certainly could be. Look. Oh!

862
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,173
That's the first time you've
called me Jack, not Master Jack.

863
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,810
We're partners. That is gold! Gold!

864
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,854
Nuggets! Look!

865
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,287
Oh! Oh, look!

866
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,121
It is, it is, it is.
Look at that.

867
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,152
We have to get word to Sutter's Fort.
We have to alert Mr. Bartlett.

868
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,859
Oh, look! We're going to be so rich!

869
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,869
Stop. Careful.

870
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,208
You promised to keep me alive
until another dentist showed up.

871
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,013
Well, we just found out.
Old Bixby, there. He can pull teeth.

872
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,814
Why, he's no certified dentist!

873
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:29,790
He's pulled teeth before.
He can do it again if he has to.

874
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:33,590
- Come on, boys. Let's get on with it.
- You'll trust your teeth with Bixby?

875
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,131
Cut Eye, I don't know
what you're stewing about.

876
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,566
You ain't gonna need no dentist,
not where you're going. [laughs]

877
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,570
[Miner] Strike! Big strike!

878
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,096
A man and a boy was digging a grave!
Hit a vein of pure gold!

879
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,089
- Come on, come on.
- Pete, don't... Hold it.

880
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:04,024
Pete? Pete? Pete.
[Stammering] Don't go.

881
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,459
[Stammering] Don't let loose!

882
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,730
- Don't. You'll...
- [stammering] He'll be all right.

883
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,465
- He's used to this. Don't worry.
- Whoa, boy.

884
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,063
Oh!

885
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,407
[Whinnies]

886
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,709
[Shrieks]

887
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,489
Help! Somebody help!

888
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,461
<i>Sailing up through the Golden Gate</i>
<i>came Arabella</i>

889
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,563
<i>Of whom we momentarily lost track</i>

890
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,542
<i>At once it must be told</i>
<i>She did not search for gold</i>

891
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,603
<i>But to find her butler</i>
<i>and her brother Jack</i>

892
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,868
Thank you.

893
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,439
Permit me, if you will.
My name is Sam Trimble.

894
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,275
Merchant and civic leader
at your service.

895
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:47,758
As one who appreciates the pulchritude
and charm so rare in our young city,

896
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,391
may I say welcome to San Francisco.

897
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,094
Thank you.

898
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:58,038
May I ask what brings such a lovely
young lady alone to a place like this?

899
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,871
Well, I'm not really all alone.
My brother is here.

900
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,605
Oh. Big brother?

901
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,080
Little brother. Twelve years old.
Our butler is with him.

902
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,482
- Gold seekers, by any chance?
- Yes.

903
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,282
Boys, bring those things inside.

904
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,518
There's no point in staying out here
in the wet and cold.

905
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,089
And we'll have to figure out a place
for you to stay, a respectable place.

906
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,291
I'm afraid
there aren't too many of them.

907
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,163
Well, isn't there a hotel?

908
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:29,500
Yes, but you wouldn't want to spend
20 or 30 dollars a night, would you?

909
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,802
There's no telling
when they'll be back.

910
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,537
If the rains ease off, they may stay
in the hills two or three more months.

911
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,135
[Arabella] Oh, really?

912
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:41,172
<i>Winter had blown its icy breath</i>
<i>into the mountains</i>

913
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,277
<i>The miners could not tolerate the cold</i>

914
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:49,154
<i>Their tools were strewn about</i>
<i>while their claims gave out</i>

915
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:53,389
<i>And the gold rush</i>
<i>at last rushed out of gold</i>

916
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:01,492
<i>Bullwhip, Bullwhip</i>
<i>Bullwhip Griffin</i>

917
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:05,268
<i>As homeward their recollections roam</i>

918
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:09,539
<i>Onboard and afloat</i>
<i>Downriver, by boat</i>

919
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:14,242
<i>Upon theirjourney back home</i>

920
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,309
Remember the first time
we saw the lights of San Francisco?

921
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,981
I sure do. Right after that was
when Judge Higgins stole the map.

922
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,252
Now there's a lesson to remember.

923
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:26,818
He was the one with the clever,
crooked, cunning schemes

924
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:31,390
and yet you, Mr. Bartlett and I,
we end up with all the gold.

925
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,102
[Griffin] Come along.
We'll be docking soon.

926
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:39,198
We should put our things together.
Oh, and one other thing.

927
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,176
There is no advantage
to wearing a money belt

928
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,703
if you keep fussing around and letting
everybody know you've got it.

929
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,976
Passenger Griffin!

930
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:52,646
[Higgins] Eric Griffin report
to the captain in the wheel house.

931
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,019
Immediately.

932
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,854
Well, now, that is most peculiar. Huh!

933
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,190
I wonder what the captain wants with me.

934
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,572
Excuse me, sir.
Did you see somebody pass by this way?

935
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,906
[Speaks fake Chinese]

936
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,343
I see. You go back there.

937
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:21,850
All right! You go to our cabin.
I'll see what the captain wants.

938
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,085
Shhh!

939
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,595
- Judge Higgins!
- [Fake Chinese]

940
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,460
I'm gonna have to
ask a little favor of you, boy.

941
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:41,935
[Struggling]

942
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:45,440
Give me your word you won't
call, holler or try to run away.

943
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,533
[Muffled struggling]

944
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,081
I don't want to hurt you, boy.

945
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,751
Now, we've been good friends, remember?

946
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,549
Besides, I'm very grateful
to you and Griffin

947
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:04,218
for excavating my share of the gold
and transporting it from the hills.

948
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,955
Now you listen, Jack. Listen carefully.

949
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,827
It's a very fine point of the law.

950
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,493
But a man's grave is his castle.
Did you know that?

951
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,469
- Mmm...
- Did you know?

952
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:18,166
- No, sir.
- Well, it is.

953
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,767
A man's grave is his castle.

954
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,211
If you find gold in my grave,

955
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,580
it's no more than right that
I should share in part of it, isn't it?

956
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,414
Yes, sir.

957
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,078
You're a smart boy, Jack.

958
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:39,059
I knew you'd see it my way
if I explained it clearly to you.

959
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:48,167
Now, you understand, of course,
that I'm going to have to gag you

960
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:52,401
and tie you up, huh? But we're
still friends, aren't we? [grunts]

961
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,471
Help! Somebody help me!

962
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,106
Help me! Somebody! Help me!

963
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,480
Help me! Bullwhip!

964
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:07,386
- Bullwhip, help! Somebody help me!
- [Higgins] Part of this belongs to me!

965
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,948
Jack? What's the matter? Jack?

966
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,824
Help!

967
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,352
Thank you.

968
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,235
[Captain] Man overboard!
Throw the line!

969
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,497
- [Whistle blows]
- Another man overboard!

970
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,779
Bullwhip, the gold.

971
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,917
It's all right. [coughs]

972
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:21,861
It was Judge Higgins.
He was after me.

973
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,229
- Higgins!
- [Captain] Haul away, men.

974
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,860
Steady, now. Steady on those lines.

975
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:31,134
[Captain] Hold. Easy, now. Steady.

976
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,343
That's it. Steady.

977
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,109
Easy, now. Give me your hand, son.
Easy, now.

978
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:43,151
[Captain] Come on. Up we go.

979
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,653
Easy. There we go.

980
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,815
Let me have that blanket.
Keep you warm, son.

981
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,021
There's a big man...
dressed like a coolie.

982
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:56,030
But he's Judge Higgins.
And he tried to rob me.

983
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,726
Round up the coolies
and take 'em to the wheel house.

984
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,429
All right, folks. Break it up.
Back to your cabins.

985
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,564
- [Captain] We'll be docking soon.
- [Splash]

986
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:14,646
It's not fair. It isn't.
Everything gone.

987
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,208
After all we've been through.

988
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:23,318
- It's all my fault.
- No, come on, now. That's silly.

989
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,883
- Come on. Buck up.
- [Sighs]

990
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,953
After all, we are still in California.

991
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:32,762
And there's still enough gold
for all those who know how to get it.

992
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,767
Fortunately,
we did not lose our scissors.

993
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,110
[Man] All right, boys.
Here's your chance.

994
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,671
In two days, the <i>Robert Emmet</i>
leaves for New York.

995
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,808
Howdy, neighbors.
Where you boys from?

996
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,375
- Charleston, Savannah, New York?
- Boston. Why?

997
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,047
Boston! You gentlemen
are in the best of luck.

998
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,887
I can book you on the <i>Robert Emmet,</i>
leaving in two days.

999
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,393
Step in here,
I'll arrange for the passage.

1000
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,726
- We got the tickets...
- Now, will you wait?

1001
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,789
At the moment, we are hardly prepared.

1002
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,098
$250 each, you can't beat
a price like that to Boston.

1003
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,263
That's quite a few haircuts.

1004
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:14,673
[Stammering] Therefore, we had better
waste no time in setting up shop.

1005
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,836
Thank you. Good evening.

1006
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,247
[Jack] "Haircuts, 50 cents."

1007
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:30,417
Absolutely impossible.

1008
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,484
No waiting, gentlemen.
Step right inside.

1009
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,827
Fifty cents? It used to be $15.

1010
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,697
Times have changed, boy.

1011
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,134
Thousands of men flocking into town,

1012
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:45,401
willing to do anything
just for the price of a square meal.

1013
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,408
[Barber] I'm telling you the truth.

1014
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:51,207
I'll make it 35 cents for each of you.

1015
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,567
[Jack] I'm hungry.

1016
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,028
Yes.

1017
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,497
Oh, well.

1018
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,941
Think about something else.

1019
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,138
But how can I when I'm hungry?

1020
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,182
Well, concentrate your thoughts on...

1021
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:35,316
What would happen if we went in,
ate our fill and then couldn't pay?

1022
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,951
We would be thrown out.

1023
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,756
And none too gently.

1024
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,796
Step inside, gents.

1025
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,459
I'm game if you are.

1026
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,302
We shall risk the consequences.

1027
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,136
All right, gents.
Where else but in the Lucky Nugget

1028
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,268
can you get the best steaks
west of the Mississippi?

1029
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:00,941
See the dancing girls and hear the
Boston Belle. Step right up, gents.

1030
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:04,508
- Come on, Griffin.
- Wait.

1031
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:05,712
[Whistles]

1032
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,089
If we are going to be thrown out,

1033
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,925
at least let it be
from the best place in town.

1034
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:19,029
[Announcer] Hear the only piano
in San Francisco

1035
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:23,197
and listen, listen to the voice
of the Boston Belle!

1036
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,967
Come on, everybody!

1037
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,943
The best show in San Francisco.
Move right on to the inside.

1038
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,780
All right. Come right on in.

1039
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,968
They ate a big meal inside,
run up a big bill...

1040
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,804
- Oh, dear.
- Maybe we better go to the other place.

1041
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,844
We will not. Come along.

1042
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,813
[Shouts]

1043
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,372
I'll throw you out.

1044
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,715
Will you let us through, please, sir?

1045
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,518
- Will you please?
- Ah, Bullwhip!

1046
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,221
[Mountain Ox] I wait a long time.

1047
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,127
You come back.
Now I fix things good.

1048
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,863
I am not aware
of anything that requires fixing.

1049
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:28,027
[Laughs]

1050
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,236
- Who is he?
- The great Bullwhip Griffin.

1051
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,709
I seen him knock out the Mountain Ox
once with his open hand.

1052
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,215
- Why...
- Fight, fight, fight!

1053
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,909
You better leave him alone.

1054
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,976
This time he might close his fist
and you never will come to.

1055
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,850
- Jack!
- [Laughter]

1056
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,760
All right, Bullwhip.

1057
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,922
Close your fist.

1058
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,130
And show everybody
how you knock out Mountain Ox.

1059
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:05,503
Go ahead. Hit me.

1060
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,469
Please hit me!

1061
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:20,477
You do rather tempt one.

1062
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:23,889
- However...
- [Sam] Wait, wait. Hold it.

1063
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:27,656
Ox? How many times have I told you to
stay out of trouble? Quit fighting.

1064
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,130
Now I'm not gonna tell you again!
You two get outta...

1065
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,296
- Bullwhip?
- Yes.

1066
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:38,328
Bullwhip! When did you get back?
It's good to see you.

1067
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,706
- Oh, thank you.
- Everybody, Bullwhip Griffin is back!

1068
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,745
[All cheer]

1069
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,679
Don't fight him here. Not here.
Don't even touch him.

1070
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,079
[Crowd moans]

1071
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,848
Aw, gee, boss.

1072
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,446
Everybody say Bullwhip
knock out Mountain Ox with one hand.

1073
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,821
[Ox] Not even closed fist.

1074
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:01,488
Now you say don't fight.
You break Mountain Ox heart.

1075
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,155
[Crowd murmurs]

1076
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,001
There are men who would pay
thousands of dollars to see this fight.

1077
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:12,632
Thousands of dollars.
You understand, you big ox?

1078
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,073
Yeah, boss.

1079
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,667
Go inside and have a drink.
I'll talk to you later.

1080
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:19,407
Everybody.
The drinks are on the house.

1081
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,506
[Cheering]

1082
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,718
As I said the last time you were here,

1083
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,450
I'm still willing to guarantee
a $2,000 purse.

1084
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,322
Winner take all. What do you think?

1085
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,530
- Naturally, one must discuss that...
- We can't think on empty stomachs.

1086
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,327
Of course not, of course not.

1087
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,766
I'll set you up
a nice, juicy steak dinner.

1088
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:45,705
- And then we'll talk.
- It is a bit past our dinner time.

1089
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,834
Good, good! I'll get a table ready.
[Laughs]

1090
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:52,242
Oh! Oy.

1091
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:57,111
I wish you were Bullwhip Brannigan,
so you could fight the Mountain Ox.

1092
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,745
- Sure you do.
- Boy, that'd serve him right.

1093
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,981
[Laughs]

1094
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,158
[Music plays]

1095
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,943
Jack, this is not a proper place
for a boy of your age

1096
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:32,783
and you certainly should not
display such an interest

1097
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,688
in, um, the ladies who perform here.
[Chuckles]

1098
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,065
[Cheering, applause]

1099
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:50,070
[Ladies] And now, gentlemen,
the moment you have awaited.

1100
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:53,039
Presenting the Boston Belle!

1101
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,633
[Cheering, applause]

1102
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,577
[Piano music plays]

01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:11,887
<i>The nights are bright</i>

1104
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,987
<i>Theyre just as bright as gay Paree</i>

1105
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:20,057
<i>Because the girls of San Francisco</i>

1106
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,764
<i>Do the dance</i>
<i>that youve all come to see</i>

1107
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,900
<i>So if youre new to San Francisco</i>

1108
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:31,935
<i>And want some hometown hospitality</i>

1109
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:36,781
<i>Just pull up a chair, boys</i>
<i>Youre welcome to stare</i>

1110
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:40,481
<i>But open your pokes, boys</i>
<i>and pay for the fare</i>

1111
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:44,651
- <i>The girls of San Francisco...</i>
- Jack! You must not do that!

1112
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,718
Griffin. It's Arabella singing.

1113
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,560
<i>So pull up a chair, boys</i>
<i>Youre welcome to stare</i>

- <i>Because the girls of San Francisco</i>
- Jack!

Jack! Oh! Let me look at you.

1122
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:28,296
[Jack] We found a whole bunch of gold,
but we lost it when I fell in the bay.

1123
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,497
Oh!

1124
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:34,804
Griffin! Oh, Griffin,
you look so different!

1125
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,403
You're tan and I don't think
I've ever seen you without a tie.

1126
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,678
[Stammering] Oh, Miss Arabella,
you should not be here alone.

1127
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,948
Not in a wild town like San Francisco.

1128
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:50,321
- Certainly not in a saloon.
- Oh, Griffin. I'm not alone.

1129
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,384
I'm with you and Jack. As for
singing in a saloon, I love it.

1130
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,556
Gosh, but you look pretty, Arabella.
And you sing good too.

1131
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,963
[Exasperated] Wait a minute!

1132
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,463
[Stammering] The steamship
<i>Robert Emmet.</i>

1133
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,404
It leaves in two days for Boston.
You are going to be on it.

1134
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,204
- Oh, Griffin...
- You can't do that, Griffin.

1135
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,676
Well, well, well. Arabella.

1136
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:16,943
I see you've found your butler and
your brother. I'm very happy for you.

1137
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:20,954
- [Crowd cheering]
- However, the world cannot stand still.

1138
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,953
- You have another number to sing.
- Oh, yeah.

1139
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,087
Well, you two wait right here, huh?

1140
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,291

<i>I had never met before</i>

1143
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:50,216
<i>Then abruptly someone stole a kiss</i>

1144
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,051
<i>I couldnt see who it could be</i>

1145
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:58,718
<i>But I can tell you this</i>

1146
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:04,255
<i>If you would kiss me again</i>

1147
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,129
<i>Whoever you are</i>

1148
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:09,637
<i>Hold me again, whoever you are</i>

Bullwhip? How are you gonna
get the money for Arabella's ticket?

1157
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:08,355
The day after tomorrow, Miss Arabella
and you are going to be on that ship.

1164
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:35,187
[crowd cheering, whistling]

1165
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,726
Well, Bullwhip. What about my offer?

1166
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:44,526
One question.
If I agree to fight the Mountain Ox,

1167
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,864
will you give me $1,000
cash advance immediately?

1168
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:51,633
- No, Bullwhip. Don't do it.
- No, we find it makes a better fight

1169
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:55,039
- winner take all.
- Oh, a better fight.

1170
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,045
[Chuckles] We haven't agreed
there's going to be a fight.

1171
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,514
Oh, well. If you are reluctant,
it really doesn't matter.

1172
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,019
Wait. Let's not quarrel over it.
Uh, Joe.

1173
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,646
It's a gentleman's agreement then.

1174
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,920
You'll fight the Ox, let me
set the time and place. Right?

1175
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:16,259
Oh, well, I'd need a place to train,
a place to stay.

1176
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:20,097
No problem. There's a little room
next to the stables at my hacienda.

1177
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:21,863
[Sam] It's not very fancy, but...

1178
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,371
Tell Mr. Trimble how
you knocked out Mountain Ox.

1179
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,340
Mr. Trimble is not interested
in technique.

1180
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,071
All Mr. Trimble wants is a match.
Right?

1181
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,306
- Right.
- [Man] Hey, Sam?

1182
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,982
Bullwhip, are you out of your mind?

1183
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,387
[Moans] Possibly.

1184
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,255
You can't pull that glove trick
in a bareknuckle fight.

1185
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,490
- That is not important.
- You wanna get yourself killed?

1186
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,157
- Oh...
- [drum roll]

1187
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:56,301
Gentlemen, may I have your attention,
please? An important announcement.

1188
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,437
I'm very happy to announce
that the fight of the year

1189
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:06,776
will take place here at the Lucky
Nugget Saloon one week from tonight!

1190
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:09,282
[Cheering]

1191
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:14,521
A boxing match?
No, gentlemen. A grudge fight

1192
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:18,286
for the bareknuckle championship
of San Francisco

1193
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:24,356
between the present undisputed
champion, the Mountain Ox!

1194
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,992
[Cheering]

1195
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:33,833
Facing the challenger, the only man
who has ever knocked out the Ox,

1196
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:38,140
the legendary and much-talked-about
Bullwhip Griffin!

1197
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,579
[Cheering]

1198
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,153
[Sam] Tickets go on sale tomorrow
for those of you who can afford them.

1199
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,094
Those of you with heavy pokes,
if you want to sign up now,

1200
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:59,156
go over to the bar.
We'll save some good seats for you.

1201
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,333
Bullwhip Griffin?

1202
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:14,143
Do you have even the remotest idea
what you're doing?

1203
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,174
I have seen the Mountain Ox take
three men twice the size that you are

1204
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,154
- and destroy them.
- He's doing it for money, Arabella,

1205
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,055
to send us home.
He doesn't care what happens to him.

1206
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,116
- Oh.
- I wouldn't take that.

1207
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:28,389
That's blood money.
What do you think I am?

1208
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:32,263
I know what you are. You are a lady.

1209
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,267
You don't belong
in a place like this.

1210
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:37,498
No. And neither do you. Come along.

1211
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,740
Come on!

1212
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:52,615
Then he took the glove filled with gold
and he swung it like a blackjack.

1213
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:56,350
My brother Jack
told me the whole story last night.

1214
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,654
Why, that shifty little shyster.

1215
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,389
He had everybody fooled, even the
poor Ox. He never suspected anything.

1216
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,796
So, you see, Sam,
you've got to call it off.

1217
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,561
Well, it really doesn't matter.

1218
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,364
It may not be much of a fight,
probably won't last long,

1219
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,564
but they can't say it's my fault.

1220
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:16,633
Sam? He's not a fighter, he's a butler.
He could get killed.

1221
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:20,147
What are you getting steamed up
about? Why do you need a butler?

1222
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,207
Sam. Here's your money back.
Now call the whole thing off.

1223
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,411
Call it off? Are you serious?

1224
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,650
You and I are in a position
to make some pretty shrewd bets.

1225
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,920
We know something that
those men don't know.

1226
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:36,396
Oh. Well, suppose I go out there and
tell them the same story I told you?

1227
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,831
- No, I wouldn't do that.
- They wouldn't place their bets.

1228
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,529
I imagine they wouldn't
buy tickets for your fight.

1229
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,165
Probably not. They'd be too busy
stringing up your butler by the neck.

1230
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:50,602
Honey, a lot of bets have been made.

1231
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,441
They'd lynch him before sundown.

1232
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:57,845
Well, you'd better think of something.
Or I quit.

1233
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,888
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Uh...

1234
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,480
Look, I'll have the Ox go easy on him.

1235
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:05,116
You know better than that.

1236
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,128
Once the big Ox gets wound up,
there'll be no stopping him.

1237
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:09,720
He'd beat Griffin to a pulp.

1238
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:13,528
Why don't you stay with me? It's
more fun to be on the winning side.

1239
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,766
- You are a beast!
- Maybe so.

1240
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:22,003
But remember I'm still your friend
and if you ever want your job back...

1241
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,553
I always thought you were
real smart about everything

1242
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,723
but this doesn't seem very smart to me.

1243
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:46,699
Master Jack.

1244
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:51,205
Now, I have a feeling that brute force
is not always decisive.

1245
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,866
I shall endeavor to combine agility

1246
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,342
with a certain basic knowledge
of fisticuffs.

1247
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,710
Fortunately, I once read the
<i>Gentlemans Guide to Boxing.</i>

1248
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,308
All he'll have to do
is land just one blow.

1249
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,817
[Arabella] Griffin?

1250
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,787
Griffin? Jack?

1251
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,256
I quit my job and sent word
to the captain of the <i>Robert Emmet</i>

1252
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,294
to hold places on board for us tonight.

1253
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,591
I'm so glad you've come to your senses.

1254
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:19,292
- Yes, well, three places.
- Three places.

1255
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,858
There's more than enough
here for the three of us.

1256
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,234
We could sneak on board
and we'd be out to sea

1257
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:26,296
before anyone realized you were gone.

1258
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:30,538
Miss Arabella, I couldn't do a thing
like that. I've given my word.

1259
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:34,673
What, to Sam Trimble?
Why, he'd double-cross himself.

1260
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:35,909
Well, even so.

1261
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:39,010
Wouldn't you rather break your word
than break your neck?

1262
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,952
Sure.

1263
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:44,423
Well, I am going right down
and book two passages.

1264
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:48,087
You can book as many as you like
'cause I shan't be aboard when it sails.

1265
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,823
Neither will I.

1266
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,890
Oh, dear.

1267
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:57,933
Well, look, even if you are going to
stay here, you're going to need this.

1268
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:01,237
You go out and get killed
and we spend your money? Don't be silly.

1269
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:03,800
How are you going to live?
You have quit your job.

1270
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,073
But I can get my job back.

1271
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:09,378
I will not have you singing in a saloon.
I will not permit it.

1272
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,351
- You will not permit it?
- [Griffin] No!

1273
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,050
Nor do I wish you to associate with
Sam Trimble. The way he looks at you!

1274
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:21,289
Well, for your information,
I like the way he looks at me.

1275
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,160
Master Jack.

1276
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,812
Griffin is jealous.

1277
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:50,286
Well, since you insist on going
through with this fight, Griffin,

1278
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:53,020
I guess we're all in it together.

1279
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,994
All right, gents.

1280
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,198
You all heard what Sam Trimble said.

1281
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,935
He's giving 20-1.

1282
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,173
20-1, mind you,
on the Mountain Ox to win.

1283
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:14,972
- Joe?
- Yes?

1284
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,313
This is the new bookkeeper
to give you a hand.

1285
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,945
Good. Start with those pokes.
Weigh 'em out.

1286
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,115
- And then put 'em in the safe.
- Don't you worry.

1287
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,819
I will take care of everything.

1288
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,593
Gents, gents!

1289
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:34,032
Where's your sporting blood?
Get out those heavy pokes.

1290
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,003
[Sam] I'm offering 30-1
on the Mountain Ox to win.

1291
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:39,005
[Crowd clamoring]

1292
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:03,561
I sure hope the Mountain Ox
would rather dance than fight.

1293
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,435
Very good.

1294
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:13,705
[Arabella] Oh!

1295
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:15,974
[Griffin] Oh!

1296
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:21,312
You know, I haven't quite
figured out how I'm going to win

1297
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,874
- merely by staying out of his way.
- For now, let's just concentrate

1298
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,147
- on how you're going to survive.
- [Moans]

1299
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,689
The first thing I'm going to do
after this is over

1300
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,590
is buy three tickets to Boston.

1301
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,220
Your best chance with the big Ox
is to get him angry

1302
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:37,730
so he loses his temper
and then he goes berserk.

1303
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,233
- I've seen a sample.
- Well, let's get started.

1304
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:42,496
- Fine.
- Come on.

1305
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,164
Now, I'll be the Mountain Ox.

1306
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,843
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1307
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,473
[Grunting]

1308
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,432
Mr. Bartlett!
Hey! Wait till Bullwhip sees you!

1309
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:17,095
Desist a moment, dear lad.

1310
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,572
They hold the stage.
Let them play out the play.

1311
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,475
You didn't hear about what happened to
us, coming back from the gold fields?

1312
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:29,949
No, but let us exchange such tales
within the shadows of this rampart

1313
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:32,508
whilst observing yon gladiators.

1314
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:45,995
This is all we wound up with, but I'm
sure Bullwhip will let you have a third.

1315
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:50,401
Well, thank you,
but by a happy circumstance,

1316
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,998
while being pursued by a grizzly bear,

1317
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,737
a great hairy beast,

1318
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,473
I perchanced to stumble
into a deep hole,

1319
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:05,144
and upon striking the bottom,
struck upon a bed of golden nuggets.

1320
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,481
Of course, it is not the mother lode
we share among us.

1321
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:13,584
And yet, uh, who can gain say?

1322
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,188
Might it not lead on to equal fortune?

1323
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,460
[Arabella] Whoa!

1324
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:24,131
Methinks David and Goliath,
and at 30-1 odds.

1325
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:27,231
Now, let us take our gold
and make haste to the Lucky Nugget.

1326
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,868
Don't you want to talk to Bullwhip,
meet Arabella?

1327
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,775
There is a tide in the affairs of man,

1328
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:34,406
which, taken at the flood,
leads onto fortune.

1329
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,474
Now, let us not tarry
until the tide has turned.

1330
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,077
[Grunting]

1331
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:55,160
Oh, Bullwhip...

1332
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,654
I'm telling you,
it'll be the fight of the year.

1333
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,351
- Good luck, Sam.
- We can't lose.

1334
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,451
Get them seated,
let's get the fight on.

1335
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,588
All right. Take your seats.
The fight will start in a while.

1336
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,029
[Drum roll]

1337
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:36,537
Knock him out, Bullwhip.
I bets my poke on you!

1338
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,980
I got everything I own riding on you.
You just gotta win.

1339
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:44,540
Good luck, Bullwhip.
I'll lose my shirt if you don't win.

1340
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:51,983
Those men who've wagered on me,
they expect me to win.

1341
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,187
So does Mr. Bartlett.
He bet all his gold on you, Bullwhip.

1342
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,164
- On me? To win?
- At 50-1 odds.

1343
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:02,396
This saloon,
his gorgeous hacienda,

1344
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,166
all his gold, he will forfeit to us.

1345
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,504
- And you know that $1,000?
- Jack, you didn't.

1346
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:11,204
No. Mr. Bartlett did it for me.

1347
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:17,748
Oh, well, then.

1348
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:20,480
I shall be forced
to trounce the scoundrel.

1349
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:26,890
[Cheering]

1350
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:49,111
Hold it. Save it for the fight.
Just one blow and it'll all be over.

1351
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,650
[Crowd booing]

1352
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:52,208
[Bell rings]

1353
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:00,520
Go get him, Bullwhip.

1354
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:09,592
There's gonna be one minute
between rounds.

1355
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:14,334
And the round ends when any part
of the anatomy touches the ground,

1356
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:15,966
excepting the feet.

1357
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:18,739
Now I don't want no strangleholds.

1358
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,515
- [Cracking]
- [Booing]

1359
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:25,143
And no stomping a man
when he's down.

1360
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:30,953
Now, let's have a good, clean fight,
and let the best man win.

1361
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,890
[Cheering]

1362
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,737
Now that was not fair.

1363
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:51,744
You simply must observe
the Marquis of Queensbury rules.

1364
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:53,677
Huh?

1365
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:58,048
Stop using them cuss words!
I said a clean fight.

1366
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:14,061
[Bell rings]

1367
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:19,205
[Jack] Come on, Bullwhip! Hit him!

1368
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:20,331
Come on, Bullwhip!

1369
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,125
Hit him! Will ya hit him?

1370
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:52,638
Attaboy, Bullwhip! He can't hurt ya!

1371
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:59,076
Make him stand still so I can hit him!

1372
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,877
No rules says he's gotta.
Let's get on with the fight.

1373
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:06,117
- Boo!
- Boo!

1374
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:10,887
[Sam] Come on, Ox! Move in!

1375
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:24,135
All you have to do
is land one good blow.

1376
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,302
[Sam] Behind you, Ox!

1377
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:29,467
[Laughter]

1378
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:42,548
No, Griffin, no.
Don't stand there. Move around.

1379
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:50,328
Hit him, you big ox!

1380
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,524
[Bell rings]

1381
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:56,865
You big bully!

1382
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,565
[Referee] The winner of round one,

1383
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,574
the Mountain Ox.

1384
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:05,373
[Crowd roars]

1385
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:20,024
Water, quick!
We can't let them see he's out.

1386
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:23,586
20, 21, 23...

1387
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:26,861
- Uh, 22.
- 22? 22...

1388
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,300
- I sure hit him, didn't I?
- You sure did.

1389
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:36,639
25, 26...

1390
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:45,450
[trumpeting]

1391
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:51,287
[Man] Attaboy! Attaboy!

1392
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:56,388
Don't let him get you mad.
Finish him off this round.

1393
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,397
I want to open up the bar.

1394
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:02,201
Dance around. Make him chase you.
Get him mad!

1395
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:05,261
- He's gotta catch you to hurt you.
- He's terrified of you.

1396
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:13,336
[Bell rings]

1397
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:17,810
[Arabella] Move around, Griffin!

1398
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,993
[Bellowing]

1399
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:31,023
Quit playing around.
Get in there and hit him!

1400
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:39,562
[Sam] Now! Hit him!

1401
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,108
[Sam] Ox, will you hit him?

1402
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:14,636
Yoo-hoo! Oxy-Woxy?

1403
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:23,681
You're supposed to be dancing with...
I mean, fighting with Bullwhip, not him.

1404
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:35,724
Why don't you just hit him? Hit him!

1405
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:42,034
[Grunting]

1406
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,711
[Man] Watch it. He's coming back.

1407
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:57,507
[Man] Do it, Bullwhip!

1408
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:03,446
You know, there's a lot more
where this came from.

1409
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,754
May as well be greedy, huh, partner?

1410
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:08,426
[Screams]

1411
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,109
Stop! Wait for him!

1412
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:36,616
Aaahhh!

1413
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,222
- Trip him! Trip him!
- That's a good idea.

1414
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:53,069
I didn't mean him. Come on, Ox.
You're not hurt.

1415
01:41:53,974 --> 01:41:58,502
The winner of round two,
Bullwhip Griffin!

1416
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,672
[Cheering]

1417
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:06,251
- Easy! Take it easy!
- What happened?

1418
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,586
Oh! I don't know
if I can run another mile.

1419
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:11,954
Now, don't get mad.

1420
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:17,456
Who's mad!

1421
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:22,628
Take it easy, Ox.
It's gonna be all right. Take it easy.

1422
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:24,803
Go get him, Bullwhip. You can do it.

1423
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:30,766
[Bell rings]

1424
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:43,556
He's in back of you, Bullwhip!

1425
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:01,532
[Sam] Ha-ha!
You've got him now, Ox! Hit him!

1426
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:05,578
I got him now.

1427
01:43:16,356 --> 01:43:18,415
You've got him now. Finish him off.

1428
01:43:33,807 --> 01:43:36,833
Wait, wait! It's not over.

1429
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:39,902
Both fighters has got one minute
to reach his scratch line.

1430
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,379
Come on!

1431
01:43:44,818 --> 01:43:47,412
[Jack] Bullwhip, Bullwhip!

1432
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:50,012
Bullwhip, don't just lie there.

1433
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,149
[Jack] Bullwhip, wake up!

1434
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,057
You gotta win, you've just gotta!

1435
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:58,325
Ox, get up!
You gotta win or I'm ruined!

1436
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:02,858

29, 30...

1439
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:14,607
- Help me get him to his feet.
- Jack, help me lift him. Uh!

1440
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:19,577
[Trumpeting]

1441
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:27,293
- [Griffin moans]
- Come on, Griffin, get up.

1442
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:34,665
- Good heavens!
- Good heavens! 56...

1443
01:44:35,535 --> 01:44:38,231
- 57...
- Toe the line, Griffin.

1444
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:41,797
59, 60!

1445
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,749
My good man,
were you looking for this?

1446
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,341
[Bell rings]

1447
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:53,818
The winner

1448
01:44:53,887 --> 01:44:59,450
and new bareknuckle champion
of San Francisco...

1449
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:02,927
...Bullwhip Griffin!
- [Cheering]

1450
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:08,101
What are we gonna do, boss?
You're wiped out.

1451
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:12,400
Get the gold out of the safe.
We'll take it out the back way. Go on!

1452
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:45,828
The bookkeeper!
He's stolen all the gold!

1453
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:47,533
He's getting away!

1454
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,873
[Man] Fire! Fire!

1455
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:53,344
The gold. It's ours. Part of it, anyway.

1456
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:28,607
I'm letting you out to fight a fire.

1457
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:30,877
Head for the Lucky Nugget!

1458
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:34,284
Here we go. Come on, let's go!

1459
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,524
Gentlemen... Gentlemen?

1460
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:44,086
- Gentlemen, you are...
- Judge Higgins!

1461
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:47,827
- Let him speak!
- Use your intelligence.

1462
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,870
Do you think I could have run
that fast with all that gold?

1463
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,871
- What'd you do with it?
- On the mule.

1464
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:55,271
I strapped it to the back of a mule!

1465
01:47:16,963 --> 01:47:19,454
What are you doing just sitting there,
you big ox?

1466
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:23,492
- The boss says he's gonna kill me.
- Sam isn't the boss anymore.

1467
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:26,664
- I am. Start carrying things out.
- Sure, boss.

1468
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:55,961
Watch out. It's on fire.

1469
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:23,524
Hey, Bullwhip! Arabella! Look!

1470
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:32,831
- [Jack] It's all the gold.
- Jack! Good boy!

1471
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:37,610
Well, well, well. Good.
You found the gold. Excellent.

1472
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:39,804
Uh-uh!

1473
01:48:43,383 --> 01:48:46,113
[Whistles] Ox? Come here.

1474
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:52,620
Get me those saddle bags.

1475
01:48:54,027 --> 01:48:58,828
You're not my boss no more, see?
I don't take orders from you now!

1476
01:48:58,899 --> 01:49:02,130
- Let him go, Ox.
- Aw, boss!

1477
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:03,533
Let him go.

1478
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:12,273
- Thank you, my dear.
- Remember, I'm still your friend.

1479
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:15,109
And if you ever want your job back,
you just let me know.

1480
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:16,546
[Laughs]

1481
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:20,646
Ox, would you take care
of the mule, please?

1482
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,551
Sure, boss.

1483
01:49:40,273 --> 01:49:44,437
<i>Over the flames and ashes</i>
<i>Bullwhip dreamed a city</i>

1484
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:48,379
<i>Whose charm all other cities</i>
<i>it would dwarf</i>

1485
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:52,350
<i>With buildings fireproof</i>
<i>and social dancing on the roof</i>

1486
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:56,287
<i>And fishermen</i>
<i>with their own special wharf</i>
