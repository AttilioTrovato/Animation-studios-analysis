1
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:11,032
<i>Excuse me, excuse me.
Coming out. Excuse me.</i>

2
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,375
Ooh. Ah...

3
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,381
I think you've hooked
something. Sorry, lady. -Really!

4
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,876
Good mornin', Joe.
-Good morning, Mr. Bolton.

5
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,984
Your horse get a flat
on the parkway?

6
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:27,083
Uh, got left
at the tollgate.

7
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,690
The wife and the
kids said thanks

8
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,220
for the tickets to
the Aspercel broadcast.

9
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:32,231
Glad they liked it.
-They didn't...

10
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,767
but the wife said
say thanks anyway.

11
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:38,032
Sixth floor! Tallyho!

12
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,441
<i>Good morning, Mr. Bolton.
-Good morning, Alice.</i>

13
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,738
Has the day's
hysteria started?

14
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,531
Yes, sir. G. Tomes
said, "Are you here?"

15
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,249
Mr. Pfeiffer sent
up the layouts.

16
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,512
Mr. Willis didn't come in
on account of poison ivy.

17
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,989
And the meeting has been moved
up to 9:15. -N-ni... Holy smoke.

18
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,992
Oh, Mr. Bolton!
-Yeah?

19
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,994
Mr. Bolton!
-What?

20
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,996
Oh, I'm sorry, Alice.

21
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,998
Good morning, Fred.
-Oh, hi.

22
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,296
Let me be the first
to give you the good

23
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,526
news: Mr. Dugan is
coming to your meeting.

24
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,539
Dugan? -Thomas Fitzpatrick
"Eat 'em alive" Dugan...

25
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,700
chairman of the board
of Allied Drug and Food.

26
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:19,040
Mr. Aspercel himself.
-I'm dead.

27
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:23,071
I know, but we're all behind you,
my boy. -It's a good place to be.

28
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,346
I wish
I were there myself.

29
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,353
Good morning, Catherine.
Dugan's coming to the meeting.

30
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,356
I know. The staff s inside
having a nervous breakdown.

31
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:35,121
Yeah, yeah, so am I.
What time is it?

32
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,426
9:07. I've already sent
the material upstairs. Bless you.

33
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,626
This saddle's been making me sneeze
all the way from Westhill.

34
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,465
Did you take your antihistamine?
-Yeah, I've taken seven.

35
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,405
Have a messenger
pick this thing up, take it to the...

36
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:50,568
Oh, Brockenhurst Saddle Shop
on 48th Street.

37
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,578
"Have seam stitched."
Your daughter phoned.

38
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,739
She said, "Daddy would be sure
to get everything all mixed up."

39
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,078
Mmm, that's a smart kid.

40
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,812
Can you imagine Dugan?
-Didn't he give you any warning?

41
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:03,117
No. Don't I get any mail
but bills? This guy can wait.

42
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,522
Pay half of that.
Polite stall letter on that one.

43
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,891
S.J. Clemens Riding Academy.
Didn't I pay this once?

44
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:12,557
No, sir, but you did
shove it aside several times.

45
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,726
Catherine, I spoil Helen,
don't I?

46
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,362
Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

47
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,770
That's what comes of being
mother and father at the same time.

48
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,774
I spoil her double.

49
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:26,437
Good morning.

50
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,612
Fred, what are you gonna do?

51
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,711
All right, Howie, you
don't have the layouts.

52
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,480
<i>All right, now everybody relax.
-Ta-da</i>

53
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:36,784
<i>Pete, I know that you don't have...
-Ta-da</i>

54
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,383
Charlie, what is that? -Kinda leaves
you a little breathless at first, huh?

55
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,452
I said you could suggest
something like this in a drawing.

56
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,124
I have a drawing. -Yeah, yeah,
yeah, but I think three-dimensional.

57
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,566
A drawing couldn't even possibly
convey the impact. -Charlie, l...

58
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,070
I've been working on it
for weeks just to surprise ya.

59
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:55,869
On my own time: Nights, lunches,
coffee breaks. -My drawing's in color.

60
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,740
Look, Charlie, take this thing back,
put it in its space capsule.

61
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,509
You've got to see him work. You put the
pill in here... -Nine hundred dollars!

62
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,846
Oh, we can turn 'em out
cheaper than that.

63
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,852
Catherine, am I
reading this right?

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,252
Here's the address.
-Nine hundred dollars?

65
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,950
That's right.
-For riding lessons?

66
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:12,992
Freddie, please, don't
knock my little man

67
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:13,959
until you see him in action.

68
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,961
How can anybody owe $900
for riding lessons?

69
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,963
You gotta see how he works.
Mimsey, get me a pill.

70
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,965
Who is S.J. Clemens anyway?
I'll have him run in for extortion.

71
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,234
Freddie, just watch
this. This'll really

72
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,436
grab ya. -Charlie,
take this monster...

73
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes, Gladys, I'll tell him.

74
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:31,209
It's upstairs.
Mr. Dugan is in the conference room.

75
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,347
Let's go.

76
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,376
Freddie?

77
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay, bring your friend. It's
too late now. -Mimsey, the pills.

78
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,327
Catherine, if anybody calls,
you know where to locate the body.

79
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,625
Gladys, they're on their way.

80
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,790
Charlie, the next time
I leave you alone with an idea...

81
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,027
But, Freddie, you haven't even
given my little man a chance.

82
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,535
<i>He'll steal your heart away.
Mimsey, the pills. -Sixth floor.</i>

83
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,198
The big pills. They're just like
the little pills, only they're bigger.

84
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,106
Mimsey. Come on, Mimsey.
Get in the elevator, honey.

85
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:06,873
Excuse me, folks. Freddie,
wait'll you see my little man work.

86
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,881
Hey, Mr. Bolton.
I see you got yourself a jockey.

87
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,008
What happened to
the rest of him?

88
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,349
He, uh, just couldn't
pull himself together, Joe.

89
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,219
Come on, Mimsey. Get the pill.
-I'm trying.

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,418
<i>Seventh floor.
-Oh, out. Out, please.</i>

91
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,654
Oh, is this ten?

92
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,663
No, ma'am, seven.

93
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:27,928
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,026
I'm terribly sorry.

95
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,734
<i>I've got it!</i>

96
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,571
Good. Now when I tell ya

97
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,335
to give him the pill,
give him the pill.

98
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,345
You ready?
-Ready.

99
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,949
<i>He's got a short circuit.
-No, that's just a gimmick, Freddie.</i>

100
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,955
We start out with
an inflamed, sensitive stomach...

101
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:53,083
like the guy had an overdose
of salami or somethin'.

102
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,292
And what happens?
The minute the stomach

103
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,425
gives out the alarm, old
Aspercel goes to work.

104
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,193
Ten. Out.
-Give him the pill.

105
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:05,602
Watch this. Old speedy Aspercel
races down the old esophagus...

106
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,108
hits the old alimentary canal
and zoink.

107
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,871
Zoink, what?
-Zoink, it's stuck.

108
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,970
Out.
-Ten?

109
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,107
Twelve.
-Never mind. I'll get out anyway.

110
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,845
I think I'm in the wrong building.
-Zoink!

111
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,812
Instant... Instant...

112
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:31,425
Aspercel, Aspercel When
you're sick it'll make you well

113
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:35,332
Instant relief.
-Ahh!

114
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,390
So this is it?

115
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,393
This is the whole campaign,
the complete Harry Tomes package?

116
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,589
<i>That's it, Tom, and in my opinion...
-Uh-huh.</i>

117
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,326
Anybody got an Aspercel?

118
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,073
Harry, Aspercel's
been a pretty good

119
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:21,802
client over the past
15 years, hasn't it?

120
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,873
Our best, Tom.
-You go along with that, Fred?

121
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,851
Uh, yes, sir.
I certainly do.

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,117
And we've worked pretty well
together over the years, haven't we?

123
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,057
I think we have, Tom.
-Right, Fred?

124
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,616
Uh, yes, sir,
that's right.

125
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,629
Then why are you people
trying to hand me...

126
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:41,690
this imbecilic, half-baked,
old-hat gimmicked-up campaign...

127
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,168
that wouldn't even sell
life preservers in a shipwreck?

128
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:47,434
Where's the imagination around
this place? -Tom, may I say...

129
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,704
Why, this stuff wouldn't even
keep the clients that we've got.

130
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:54,178
I want new markets.
I wanna move up in class.

131
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,216
<i>Tom, may I say...
-Harry, get me thejet set.</i>

132
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,217
<i>I want you to come up
with an idea...</i>

133
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,277
that will give sour stomachs
class and dignity.

134
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,721
Hey, I got a great idea
there, Mr. Dugan. Class.

135
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,924
We could take my little man,

136
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:09,057
put a tuxedo on him,
a high silk hat and...

137
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,154
How's the family?
-Tom, may I say...

138
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:14,166
Harry, I wanna brainstorm.

139
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,670
I want something
that will give us the "in" crowd.

140
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,672
I want to make them wish
that they had excess acidity...

141
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,765
just so they
could take Aspercel.

142
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,572
<i>Tom!
-Harry, that idea...</i>

143
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,443
is lurking at the bottom
of somebody's tired skull.

144
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:32,245
I am giving you people
just 24 hours to dredge it up.

145
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,685
Tom, may I say...
-Harry, don't say anything.

146
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,689
Just start thinking.

147
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:01,479
Aspercel, when you're sick
it'll make you well Aspercel

148
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:04,243
<i>When you're sick it'll
make you well Aspercel</i>

149
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:07,912
<i>When you're sick
it'll make you well</i>

150
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,128
Twenty-four hours,
Harry.

151
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,905
Twenty-four hours, Fred.

152
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,714
Twenty-four hours.

153
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:46,424
<i>Judy Gardner!
Heels down, Judy!</i>

154
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,997
<i>Barnaby, sit tall!</i>

155
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,965
<i>Work with your horse,
not against him.</i>

156
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,595
Pick him up, Jana.

157
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,868
Helen. Helen Bolton,
will you ride with Jana and show her?

158
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,709
Remember: If you wanna learn
how to go over fences...

159
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,714
<i>first you've got to learn
how to ride.</i>

160
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,886
Very good!

161
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,384
Okay, that's enough
for today, kids.

162
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,855
Now those of you who are
putting your horses away...

163
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,561
be sure that
the stalls are closed.

164
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:33,071
Barnaby, let me see
your horse for a minute.

165
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:40,004
Go ahead. Ask Suzie.
-About fathers?

166
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,741
Why not?
She had one, didn't she?

167
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:46,251
Tomorrow we'll try a different bit.
He's not happy with this one.

168
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,253
Suzie.

169
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,023
Suzie what?
-Well, it's that big problem again.

170
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,027
I know. Helen wants
a horse of her own...

171
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:59,155
more than anything in the whole wide
world. -Well, she should have one.

172
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:03,032
You said yourself
she's the best rider in the class.

173
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:06,094
And all I said was, "She ought to try
the favorite father treatment."

174
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,367
I couldn't, Judy.

175
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,569
<i>And just what is this favorite
father treatment? -It's simple.</i>

176
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,112
All you do is
put a rose at his dinner plate...

177
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,013
<i>bring him a cold martini
and say...</i>

178
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,109
"Daddy, tell me every single thing
that happened at the office today."

179
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:23,553
Then what? -Then he says, "Let's
talk about something else."

180
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,114
So you talk to him
about buying you a horse.

181
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,285
I couldn't do
all that stuff.

182
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,386
Why not,
for pete's sake?

183
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:33,921
My father and I
understand each other.

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,130
Judy, I think this is something
that Helen should decide for herself.

185
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:40,138
Come on, boy.
Come on.

186
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,471
<i>There's Daddy!
What's he doing here?</i>

187
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,776
Wait a minute, Suzie.
I want you to meet my father.

188
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,078
<i>Talk to him. Talk to him!</i>

189
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,221
Daddy!

190
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,723
Oh, hi, hi.
-What are you doing here?

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,755
Daddy, you're not getting allergic
to me, are you? -Those clothes, honey.

192
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,765
Did you bring your antihistamine?
-Yeah, yeah.

193
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,097
Where's the office?
-Right there.

194
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,432
Oh. -I wish you had told
me you were coming.

195
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,136
The class just finished, and

196
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,769
I've been dying to
have you see me ride.

197
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,292
Honey, I wanna see
you ride. I really do,

198
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,744
but I've got a briefcase
full of homework.

199
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,746
I just came by
to deliver this saddle...

200
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,476
and to tell S.J. Clemens
the rules on highway robbery.

201
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,042
<i>I'm Miss Clemens.
May I help you?</i>

202
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,784
How do you do, gðice Clemens?
Where's your father? -My father?

203
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,588
S.J. Clemens, the owner
of this pirate's den.

204
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,958
I'm S.J. Clemens.

205
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,264
Suzie, this is Daddy.
Daddy, this is Suzie.

206
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,428
You know, the one
I'm always talking about?

207
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,868
How do you do, Mr. Bolton?
Now, about this pirate's den.

208
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>I assume you're objecting to
the charges on your statement.</i>

209
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,714
I think I'll go put this saddle
in the tack room.

210
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,353
You sure
you're S.J. Clemens?

211
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,356
If you refer to the statement,
Mr. Bolton...

212
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,622
you'll see there's an unpaid balance
for the past seven months.

213
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,629
No way to run a business,
Miss Clemens.

214
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,722
You should've gotten ahold of me
personally and chewed my head off.

215
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,381
I intended to. Most
parents come down here

216
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,964
occasionally to see
their children ride.

217
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:23,407
I can't even see my child in
jodhpurs without sneezing.

218
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:26,934
I'll draw up a detailed statement
and send it to you.

219
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:30,176
In the meantime,
I've got work to do.

220
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,480
<i>Miss Clemens!
Miss Clemens, wait a moment!</i>

221
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,885
Look, I apologize.

222
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,889
I had a miserable day
in the city...

223
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,891
and I took it out
on the first available person.

224
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,395
I shouldn't have blasted off that way.
-That's quite all right.

225
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,330
We get used to tantrums
dealing with children all day.

226
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,638
Well, you finally
met Suzie.

227
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,197
Yes, yes.
Finally met Suzie.

228
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,837
Daddy?
-Yeah.

229
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:04,178
Uh, Daddy, we've always had
the kind of relationship where...

230
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,083
if one of us wants to ask something,
we just go right ahead and ask.

231
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,087
Right?
-Right.

232
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:11,589
Well, what I wanna ask...
-Uh-huh.

233
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,421
Uh, what I want
to ask you is...

234
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,256
Yes?

235
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:21,529
Uh, how did things
go at the office today?

236
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,592
What?

237
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:27,264
Or, would you rather have
a cold martini first?

238
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,277
Honey, I'd rather have
a cold martini period. Slide in.

239
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,912
<i>In the best of families.
In the, uh...</i>

240
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:45,048
All things being considered,
I like Aspercel because...

241
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:49,117
it's status, upper crust,
carriage trade, money in the bank.

242
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,221
It's a traditional, uh...

243
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,062
l-in the best...
In the best of families...

244
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,729
In the best of families,
it's a...

245
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,329
<i>family tradition.</i>

246
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:05,434
Aspercel

247
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,445
For relief.

248
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,815
Herbie, we just might have
something here. Let's see.

249
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:19,520
In the best of families,
it's a family tradition... Aspercel...

250
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,686
for relief.

251
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,239
Aunt Martha, you
think I should bring

252
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,038
him another martini
with a rose this time?

253
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,946
I think it's a little too late
for that, dear.

254
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:48,112
What's he doing in there?
He's been there ever since dinner.

255
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:52,283
He's creating...
something about sour stomachs.

256
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:55,691
Carry Aspercel.
I'm getting punchy, Herbie.

257
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,695
Hey, bury it deep, huh?

258
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,889
Okay, Aunt Martha...

259
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,127
you can stop lurking about
out there with Helen.

260
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:07,332
Whatever it is, hit me with it now
while I'm weak and helpless.

261
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,034
Oh, we weren't lurking, dear.
-Mm-hmm.

262
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,373
We were merely
waiting patiently.

263
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,879
What is it you'd like to buy
that we can't possibly afford?

264
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,380
Oh, well...
-Well, dear...

265
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,680
No, Aunt Martha, I'll tell him.
After all, it's my problem.

266
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,720
<i>Daddy, I want...
-No, dear, I said I'd tell him.</i>

267
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,381
If you tell him... -I'm sure it
would be better if I told him.

268
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:27,221
Well, somebody tell me, okay?
I mean, flip a coin.

269
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,727
I've got to get back
to work some time tonight.

270
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:33,431
Daddy.
-Mmm?

271
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,303
Daddy, I want a horse
of my own more than

272
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,271
anything I've ever
wanted in the whole world.

273
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:44,537
Suzie says, if I had a horse of my own,
it would give me confidence...

274
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,374
<i>and I'd be in the ribbons
at the really big shows.</i>

275
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:52,383
And...
-And, uh, how much will it cost me?

276
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,579
Well...
-Hundred dollars?

277
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,589
Well, dear.
-Two hundred dollars?

278
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,690
Close to 2,000...

279
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:04,195
<i>for a good one.</i>

280
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:09,098
Two... Two thousand...
dollars!

281
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,105
Do you... have...

282
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:21,374
any idea... how thin
the financial ice is around this place?

283
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,008
<i>I mean, I mean, a few items,
like, the mortgage and two cars...</i>

284
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:29,885
and a private school and $900
for riding lessons and now you're...

285
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,968
<i>Freddie, we've been
skating on thin ice</i>

286
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:33,982
<i>for years. -Well,
we're about to get wet.</i>

287
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,460
Well, suppose we do this...
-No, Aunt Martha, Daddy's right.

288
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,294
<i>We can't afford a horse.</i>

289
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,460
I was silly to ask. I never should have
brought up such a foolish thing.

290
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Really, I am.

291
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,879
She really wants that horse,
doesn't she? -Yes, dear.

292
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,649
Two thousand dollars.

293
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:10,093
Is she really that good? -Why,
she's the best in her class, Freddie.

294
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:15,090
<i>First place,
junior equitation.</i>

295
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,328
And if she had her own horse,
she could graduate to hunters.

296
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:20,497
Uh, they jump over fences
and things, dear. -Huh.

297
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:23,098
For $2,000,
I'll jump a few fences myself.

298
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:27,111
Now, Freddie. -I don't know why she's
so steamed up about a horse anyway.

299
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,307
A boy, I could understand. Now, if she
had a boy problem, I could help her.

300
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,316
Oh, Fred.

301
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:35,512
She has got a boy problem.

302
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:39,413
She what?
-She's terrified of boys.

303
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:41,426
She thinks
she's homely.

304
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,595
Homely?

305
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,858
Helen thinks
she's homely.

306
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,957
But, Aunt Martha,
she is a beautiful girl.

307
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:53,334
Oh, yes, Fred. I know this,
and you know this, but Helen doesn't.

308
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:56,465
Oh, try to understand.
It's just part of growing up.

309
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,806
You see, that's why
her riding is so important.

310
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:03,372
It gives her poise,
a sense of accomplishment.

311
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:05,383
Homely.

312
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:10,719
Well, I'll try to figure
something out.

313
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,723
I knew you would, Freddie.
-Yeah.

314
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,725
I knew it.

315
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,728
Now, do you want me
to clean up this mess?

316
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:22,028
Aunt Martha,
this mess is what's left of my career.

317
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,399
No, no, just go on to bed
and let me pull the temple...

318
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,667
down around my own
shoulders, all right? -Oh.

319
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:32,040
Would you like a glass
of warm milk?

320
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:35,171
Wouldn't help.
Good night, Aunt Martha.

321
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,813
Good night, Fred Bolton.

322
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,411
Good night,
Aspercel account.

323
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,424
Good night, Tom Dugan.
Good night, everything.

324
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:51,656
Aspercel, Aspercel,
when you're sick, it makes you well.

325
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,359
When you're dead,
you're dead.

326
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,732
That's...

327
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:01,272
A gimmick!

328
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,205
A gimmick, a gimmick, a gimmick.
My kingdom for a gimmick.

329
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,280
A horse!

330
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,293
Herbie! Herbie, hey,
bring that back here.

331
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,295
Hey, Herbie!

332
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:34,299
Herbie, this could be it,
the gimmick.

333
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,307
And it's a double play:

334
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:41,005
<i>A horse for Helen,
high society for Dugan.</i>

335
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,181
Now if we want
the class market...

336
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,915
we've got to make Aspercel

337
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,582
the "in" pill from
Bar Harbor to Biarritz.

338
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,747
We've got to give our product
social acceptance, a new image.

339
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:52,922
What we want, Mr.
Dugan, is to have the

340
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:55,021
name Aspercel associated
with high society.

341
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,959
We wanna do that in
such a way that the

342
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,825
general public is not
aware that it's happening.

343
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:01,832
That means we go
the subliminal r...

344
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,368
And where do we begin
this campaign of ours, Mr. Dugan?

345
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:08,202
Where society's social season
begins: At the horse show.

346
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:12,437
I said, at the horse show!
Show.

347
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,809
What we do, we shoot
for free publicity...

348
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,110
at horse shows
all over the country.

349
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,285
Picture a beautiful young girl
on a fabulous horse.

350
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,787
Everywhere they appear,
the eyes of the social world...

351
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,790
are on that girl
and that horse.

352
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,952
Their picture is on the fashion page.
They're in the best magazines.

353
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:31,360
The class trade
is captured.

354
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,389
And what is the name of that
fabulous horse? "Aspercel", Mr. Dugan.

355
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,459
That horse's name
is Aspercel!

356
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:42,337
What do you think of it, Mr. Dugan?
-I like it.

357
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,342
You like it?

358
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,004
Yes, sir, I like it.

359
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,481
We could get free play
in all the class media:

360
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,576
<i>Vogue, Harper's Bazaar,
Illustrated London News.</i>

361
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:58,589
Hit TV, and if
the gimmick works, we can expand.

362
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:02,218
<i>Enter a boat in the America's Cup race.
Call it the Aspercel.</i>

363
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:06,060
Good, good. Sponsor a car
in the Indianapolis 500.

364
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:09,760
How about a wrestler named "Aspercel
the Terrible"? -You keep rubbing.

365
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:13,202
For the culture nuts,
the Aspercel Philharmonic.

366
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:16,605
Terrific. -It's endless, but
we'll start with the horse.

367
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,802
Ya buy the best one
you can find.

368
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:22,005
Who we gonna get
to ride it?

369
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:24,015
Helen Bolton...

370
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,017
my daughter.

371
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:29,384
She's a champion, Mr. Dugan.
Won all kinds of prizes.

372
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,322
Okay, but register the horse
under your daughter's name.

373
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:36,157
Keep Allied Drug out of the picture.
-Yes, sir.

374
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,219
Tell Harry Tomes
to make you a vice president.

375
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:41,733
Good id...
What'd you say, Mr. Dugan?

376
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,633
I don't like doing business
with small fry.

377
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:46,637
And call me Tom.

378
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,737
Yes. Yes, sir.

379
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,743
Tom.

380
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,563
<i>Has all
the modern refinements:</i>

381
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:15,191
<i>Outside-inside feed bin;
heavy-duty suspension;</i>

382
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,916
<i>handles like a sports
car; and a quick</i>

383
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,566
loading ramp that
comes right down there.

384
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:21,128
<i>This is
the star's dressing room.</i>

385
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,573
Herbie!

386
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:29,672
Come on, Herbie.
Come here. Come on, boy.

387
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,876
That's Herbie.
-Oh, very elegant.

388
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,885
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,887
And not everything
meets the eye.

390
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,719
Would you step back over there
just a little bit more, please?

391
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,726
Yeah, that's it.
Now, watch.

392
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,598
You won't believe this,
but I designed it myself.

393
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,697
No, no, no, I believe it.

394
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,975
Just a little oasis for the
riding contestant's father.

395
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,177
Would you care to join me?

396
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:09,512
Ah, it's a...
I know it's a little fancy.

397
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,522
You don't think it'll scare
the horse, do you?

398
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,525
No, I'm sure he can take it.
He's a very special horse.

399
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,993
Yeah, well, for 5,000 bucks,
he should be.

400
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,996
Well, you told me
to get the best, Mr. Bolton.

401
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:22,363
Oh, yes. No argument, gðice Clemens.
That I did, that I did.

402
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,868
Besides, that's not high
for a double champion. -No.

403
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,888
He won both the
junior hunter and

404
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,839
equitation medals at
Harrisburg last year.

405
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,535
Uh-huh. -Well, he's really
very good, Mr. Bolton.

406
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,307
I'm sure he is, gðice Clemens.
He's also very late.

407
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,439
He forgot at what time
he was supposed to show up.

408
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,450
Well, it's a long haul
from Pennsylvania.

409
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,713
Yeah, hey, while we're waiting, you
wanna watch television? -No, thank you.

410
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:45,314
You will help me celebrate. -I did
my celebrating when I got your check.

411
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,052
Yeah, well, I can't blame you
for that.

412
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,890
Besides, I've got to get back
to my Saturday cross-country class.

413
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:54,831
You know, I think I'm as excited
about getting this horse as Helen is.

414
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,835
Daddy, he's here. He's here!

415
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,064
<i>I think he's here.
-That's him, all right.</i>

416
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,197
<i>Hey, that's him,
all right, Helen!</i>

417
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:15,351
Okay, over here. That's fine.
-Bring him out on this side.

418
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,354
That's fi... That's...
Stop! Stop!

419
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,694
We'd about given you up.
-Yeah.

420
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:35,335
The whole trip, he's been
banging away like that.

421
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:38,308
A nine-horse trailer
all to himself...

422
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:41,813
<i>but it ain't good enough for him.</i>

423
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,646
<i>Let's get his royal
highness out of there</i>

424
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,142
<i>while I still got
some trailer left.</i>

425
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,951
Oh, Daddy,
he's beautiful.

426
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,584
He's all yours.

427
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,629
Uh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

428
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:01,131
Aren't you
supposed to unpack?

429
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:04,498
Listen, mister, it took
a breast hitch in front.

430
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,470
<i>Two guys shoving at the back
to get him in. You get him out.</i>

431
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,167
Do you want me to get him out?
-Oh, no. No, no.

432
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:13,734
We, uh, have to live
with him, we mi...

433
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:17,077
Might as well start now.

434
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:20,175
Daddy, please let me.
-No, no, no. I'll handle it.

435
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,620
<i>Look out, dear.
Don't let him hurt himself.</i>

436
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,631
I'll try not to,
Aunt Martha.

437
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,294
<i>Now, uh...</i>

438
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,031
Aspercel, you just relax.
Just relax.

439
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:42,300
Everything's gonna...
I'm the friendly type.

440
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,774
<i>Gesundheit!</i>

441
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:48,335
Hey, this horse is allergic to people.

442
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,347
<i>I'll give you
an antihistamine, old boy...</i>

443
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:53,350
but I think you'd better consult
your own physician.

444
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,479
We're just gonna
unhook this...

445
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,990
No, you're right.
We're gonna unhook...

446
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,233
Well, you old guzzler.

447
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:11,667
Is it all right for him
to drink beer, Suzie?

448
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:15,173
One palmful
for medicinal purposes is okay.

449
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,174
How about that?

450
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,736
Yeah.

451
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,748
Unhook... Now, now, that's enough.
You're gonna...

452
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:30,951
Take that off there.

453
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:34,481
That's nice and easy.
Let's take a walk.

454
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,594
Here he comes.

455
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:46,838
Aspercel, meet your new boss.
-Hello, Aspie.

456
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:50,397
You're beautiful,
just beautiful.

457
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,069
Aw.
-I think he's returning the compliment.

458
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,705
Mister, you sure got
a way with horses.

459
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,874
Yeah, I do, don't I?

460
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,042
I mean, I'm happy to make
this discovery myself.

461
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,767
Oh, Aunt Martha, would
you help this discerning

462
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:03,417
young gentleman to
a bit of refreshment?

463
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:06,719
<i>Come along, young man.
-Thank you.</i>

464
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:13,731
All right, honey, would you show Aspie
his accommodations?

465
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:26,967
<i>It's stuck.
-Oh.</i>

466
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:30,947
It's new.
-Aspie!

467
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,780
Hey!

468
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:41,385
<i>Did you see that, Daddy?
Did you see him jump the fence?</i>

469
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,394
How about that?
-Aspie!

470
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,995
You know, I think
he's decided to stay.

471
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,869
Judy!

472
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:28,201
There's Judy Gardner, Daddy.
Beep your horn.

473
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,935
Hi.
-Hi.

474
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,312
My brother Ronnie.

475
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,940
Ronnie, Helen Bolton.

476
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:40,484
<i>Hiya, Mr. Bolton.
-Oh, hi.</i>

477
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,146
That's what's-her-name, isn't it?
-Yes, dear.

478
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:46,156
We'll see you at the in gate
after you've unloaded. -Okay.

479
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:18,680
<i>How are you, Aspie? Did you
enjoy the ride? -Zip-a-dee-doo-dah</i>

480
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:20,691
Zip-a-dee-day My, oh, my
-Shouldn't we get him out?

481
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,693
First things first,
honey.

482
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:31,359
<i>Is anybody ready to eat? -Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention, please.</i>

483
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,631
<i>Class 34,
hunter seat equitation...</i>

484
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,037
<i>has been rescheduled.
-Daddy, that's me.</i>

485
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:39,099
<i>We have tomato sandwiches.
-It can't be. You've got an hour yet.</i>

486
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:42,340
<i>I repeat: Class 34
has been rescheduled.</i>

487
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:46,077
And liverwurst.
Herbie. Herbie!

488
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:50,281
<i>Exhibitors in this class to the
in gate in three minutes, please.</i>

489
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,846
<i>Three minutes, Daddy.
-Don't panic.</i>

490
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,858
Get your saddle.

491
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,700
All right, Aspie, move over.
Give me some room.

492
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,896
Back it up. That's it.
Easy does it.

493
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,906
Easy does it.
Attaboy, attaboy.

494
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:11,465
Move it around now.
Bring it around here, honey.

495
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:14,706
Okay, now, give me that.
I got it.

496
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,713
Honey,
take this, uh, uh, thing.

497
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,718
Daddy, it's on backwards.
-What?

498
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,721
A-are you...

499
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:30,421
<i>I've got it now.
-Class 34, riders to the ring, please.</i>

500
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,230
Daddy,
I'm gonna be disqualified.

501
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,063
No, you're not, darling. You're not
gonna be disqualified. We'll make it.

502
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:39,831
Have you got it?
-Almost there.

503
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,299
All aboard.
Here we go.

504
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,571
Okay, get up. Get up. What?
-Where's the bridle?

505
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,170
Daddy, I have to have a bridle.
-Of course you do, honey. Where is it?

506
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:54,241
<i>Class 34, class 34,
hunter seat equitation over fences.</i>

507
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,651
Daddy, I'll never make it.
I haven't even got my number.

508
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,656
Uh, honey, I'll put this on. You
go get the number. -All right.

509
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,662
Okay.
All right, boy.

510
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,797
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth now. Spread your teeth.

511
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,808
May I help, sir?
-Spread, spread. What?

512
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:21,437
Can I help you here? -Oh, yes,
yes. Can you unscramble this thing?

513
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,447
I think so.

514
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:26,450
Well, we're kind of
in a hurry.

515
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:30,284
These things are pretty tricky
till you catch on.

516
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,890
Not that I'm
the horsey type...

517
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,121
but I get dragged to these shows
so I had to learn somethin'.

518
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,299
You know, actually,
I could do without horses...

519
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,630
but the only way I get
to have a sports car...

520
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:47,536
<i>is if I haul my sister to these shows
so my folks won't have to do it.</i>

521
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,971
<i>Uh-huh.
-Could I have the breast hitch, please?</i>

522
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,533
What's that? Oh, oh, oh.
The better hitch. Yeah.

523
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:00,247
<i>Daddy, I got it!
Number 313.</i>

524
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:03,913
I hope it's not bad... luck.
-Well, hi.

525
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,706
I guess you're ready, sir.

526
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,424
Ronnie, I'm speechless
with admiration.

527
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,325
<i>Last call, Class 34.
-That's us.</i>

528
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,329
Okay, up you go.

529
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:16,060
Where does
this thing go? Oh.

530
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,204
You're off, sweetheart.
See you after the event.

531
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:23,206
Good luck.
-Yeah, good luck.

532
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:27,210
<i>Aunt Martha, did you find Herbie?</i>

533
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,714
All he left is two pickles
and a hard-boiled egg.

534
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,716
Thanks, Ronnie.
Let's hurry.

535
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,789
I'm sorry, Suzie.
Everything went wrong.

536
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,793
It's all right.
You're on last.

537
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,886
Now take a couple
of deep breaths.

538
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,363
<i>Count to ten and relax.</i>

539
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,366
<i>Relax, Helen! Relax!</i>

540
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:00,737
Is Helen going to jump over all those
sticks? -Yeah, that's the general idea.

541
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:04,248
<i>First exhibitor,
number 183...</i>

542
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:07,113
<i>Janet McGrath,
riding Sullivan.</i>

543
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,347
<i>The exhibitors today,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

544
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,857
<i>will follow in the order
indicated in your programs.</i>

545
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:55,626
They're all doing very well,
aren't they, dear?

546
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,998
Well, the judge doesn't look
too impressed.

547
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>You know, Tom Dugan's
become a fanatic.</i>

548
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:03,897
He's got himself a rule book
and a schedule of shows.

549
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,637
He sent me a memo
a yard and a half long.

550
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,770
Wants Helen entered
in every medal class possible.

551
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,338
Medal class, dear?
What's that?

552
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:15,182
Sort of championship events. There are
about half a dozen of'em each season.

553
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:19,690
If she wins three medals,
she goes to the world series:

554
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,521
The International Horse
Show at Washington. -Oh.

555
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,085
Helen's going
to Washington?

556
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:29,031
That's what Dugan says in his memo.
-Oh, how nice.

557
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,694
She'll love
the Smithsonian Institute.

558
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:35,865
<i>Last exhibitor in Class 34,
number 313...</i>

559
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,874
<i>Aspercel?</i>

560
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:40,001
<i>Aspercel, ridden by Helen Bolton.
-Oh.</i>

561
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:42,012
Here she comes.

562
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:08,732
No, Aspie. No, no.

563
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,849
Beautiful, beautiful.

564
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:31,393
Oh, that's sensational.

565
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,369
<i>Stay.
-Great!</i>

566
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:42,429
Great! Atta girl!
Ha, ha!

567
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:45,135
Oh.
-Hey, wasn't she great, huh?

568
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:48,701
Uh, the horse is very good, sir.
-You bet he is.

569
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,714
<i>That completes the class,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

570
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:54,741
<i>All exhibitors
back in the ring, please.</i>

571
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,884
Aunt Martha, she's gonna
win. She's gonna win.

572
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:58,949
Ha, ha. But keep
calm, keep calm.

573
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:03,050
<i>Number 128 and number 313
are excused.</i>

574
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:07,427
<i>All other entries will please line up
in numerical order.</i>

575
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:09,523
Excused?
What's excused?

576
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,069
Well, she's out.
Eliminated.

577
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:14,161
Why?

578
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,206
<i>Well, shejust wasn't
good enough, sir.</i>

579
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,724
<i>Wasn't good enough? She won!</i>

580
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,175
Where's that umpire? -The
blue ribbon goes to...

581
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:22,178
Fredrick,
control yourself.

582
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:28,479
<i>Second place goes
to number 132...</i>

583
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:32,353
<i>Rio Latch,
ridden byJudy Thom.</i>

584
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,357
<i>Third place, number 250.</i>

585
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:37,360
A great start
for my vice presidency.

586
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,988
<i>Fourth place, number 129,
Big Chief.</i>

587
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:43,864
What happened?
Why wasn't she good enough?

588
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:48,429
Well, sir, first, she tried
to put the horse in the wrong pattern.

589
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,100
Then she panicked
and decided he knew more than she did.

590
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:54,474
<i>From then on,
she was just a passenger.</i>

591
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:57,139
That's what the judges call
a push-button ride.

592
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,673
<i>Push-button?
-Yes, sir.</i>

593
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,312
Well, don't let it throw ya,
Mr. Bolton. She'll do better next time.

594
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,223
Thank you, Ronnie.

595
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,727
Aunt Martha, find Helen
and cheer her up, will ya?

596
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,730
<i>I'll meet you back at the trailer.
-Well, where are you going, dear?</i>

597
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,732
To have a word
with S.J. Clemens.

598
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:20,170
Let him know who's boss,
Barnaby. Good.

599
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:24,007
Bring him on
through again.

600
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:31,007
<i>Very good. Now bring him
down here and stop for a minute.</i>

601
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,074
Oh, hey, that's great.

602
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:37,087
Now you go out there,
and you knock 'em dead.

603
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:39,817
Uh...

604
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:44,157
Miss Clemens. -Mr. Bolton, if you're
worried about Helen, she's fine.

605
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:47,425
I told her that, well, everybody
loses on their first time out.

606
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,614
Oh, well, I'm
very pleased that

607
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:51,730
Helen is happy.
However, I would like...

608
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:55,170
She's right over there at the soft
drink stand. -No, I'm looking for you.

609
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,300
Miss Clemens, I'm a little
concerned about the fact that...

610
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:00,975
all of a sudden my
daughter is something

611
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,574
called a push-button
passenger.

612
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,275
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

613
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,909
She was just
a little nervous. That's all.

614
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,510
All right, well, she's a nervous
push-button passenger...

615
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,522
on a $5,000 horse.

616
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,787
Let me ask you
a logical question now, gðice Clemens.

617
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,794
What happened?

618
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,592
I mean, what...
I thought you told me she was good.

619
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:25,625
Well, she is. All she needs is, well,
a little more practice.

620
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,536
Give her a few months.
-Months!

621
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,939
Are you one of those parents
who has to win every time?

622
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:34,603
Well, of course, I'm not,
but I don't have months, gðice Clemens.

623
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,226
<u>I mean, not if she's gonna win</u>

624
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,773
three medals and
qualify for Washington.

625
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,340
Washington?

626
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:43,444
Oh, you are one.
The worst kind.

627
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,136
If-if I weren't so
fond of Helen, I'd...

628
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,752
Well, now, just a minute.

629
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:50,157
Oh, all you need is a...
is a bullwhip and a pair of jackboots.

630
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:53,220
Now it's all very well for you.
-Excuse me, Mr. Bolton.

631
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:55,765
I promised Barnaby
I'd watch this go-round.

632
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,307
<i>Trot your horses, please.</i>

633
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:10,271
That's very good, Barnaby.

634
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:20,890
Miss Clemens, what would happen
if you gave Helen a lesson every day...

635
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,892
including Sundays?

636
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:27,729
She might start winning.
She's got natural talent.

637
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:32,065
She's got a good animal,
but she needs work on basics...

638
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:34,070
simple horsemanship.

639
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:38,074
She's gotta develop
a partnership with that horse of hers.

640
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,474
Will you do it?

641
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:43,741
Do what?
-Whatever you said.

642
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,251
Every single day,
and don't ask me why.

643
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:49,252
Why?

644
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,422
I like you, S.J.

645
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:56,159
Is it a deal?

646
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,162
It's a deal.

647
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:18,844
That's absolutely t... t...

648
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:23,046
Now you try it again and
don't depend on the reins.

649
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,886
Balance, legs. Make him know
what you want him to do.

650
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,689
Okay, I'll try.
Come on, Aspie. Communicate.

651
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:57,182
You know, I've been sitting on this
bony fence for almost a month now...

652
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,189
watching you and Helen.

653
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:02,420
And I've been asking myself
a question... about you.

654
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:05,519
I know, Mr. Bolton.
I've been watching you sitting here...

655
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,087
on this bony fence every day
for the past month...

656
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,326
and I know
the exact question.

657
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,369
You do?
-I do.

658
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:16,770
Helen, that's much better.
Now take him through again slowly...

659
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:18,775
without the jump.

660
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:25,043
Question: How come
a pretty girl like you:

661
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:28,483
A. Isn't married?
B. Isn't engaged?

662
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:33,046
C. Prefers a quiet evening
at home with a good book to A or B?

663
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:36,150
That's very close.
How come?

664
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,396
Two years ago, I was one day away
from getting married.

665
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,401
His name was Archer Madison.

666
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,598
And he had several million dollars
more than was good for him.

667
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:54,338
Whoops, I'm sorry. I knew I shouldn't
have asked. -No, no, no, that's okay.

668
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,007
Balance, Helen.
Balance.

669
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:01,518
Archer looked so beautiful
on a horse.

670
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:04,520
He rode on
the U.S. Equestrian Team.

671
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:06,584
So, well, it would have been

672
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,581
a perfect marriage
the way Archer saw it.

673
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:13,528
We would tour the world
together forever... on horseback.

674
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:16,361
But that wasn't the way
you saw it.

675
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:20,200
Not quite. I didn't want the patter
of little hooves.

676
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:24,537
I wanted a two-footed family with
an ever-faithful, true-blue helpmate...

677
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:28,544
and all the rest
of the cornball trimmings.

678
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,981
You're okay, S.J.

679
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,617
That's enough, Helen.
Walk him for a while.

680
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:44,917
When I return tomorrow,
we can discuss your early childhood.

681
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,078
You won't have to
come back, Mr. Bolton.

682
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,160
Helen's graduated.

683
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:54,838
I've entered her
in the Oak Valley show.

684
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:57,874
I think now she's ready
to start winning some ribbons.

685
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,385
Isn't it beautiful, Daddy?
-Honey, it is absolutely gorgeous.

686
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:54,556
Look at that. Our first medal.
-Oh, it's marvelous.

687
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,726
Two more, then on to Washington.
-Washington? Mr. Bolton...

688
00:45:57,802 --> 00:46:01,238
<i>Suzie, from now on, it's Fred.
-Okay, everybody.</i>

689
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:03,239
Cheese.

690
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:33,569
Hi.

691
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,639
Uh, hi.

692
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,074
Wait a minute.
You're putting it on backwards.

693
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,016
You know, you look
kinda flaked out.

694
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:50,076
Oh, it's just a cramp.
L-it's gone now.

695
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:53,089
Oh.

696
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:56,957
Bolton, I've had my agents
checking on you lately.

697
00:46:57,027 --> 00:46:59,052
You're tensing up.

698
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,758
Why don't you kick the horse show habit
for a couple of weeks and relax?

699
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:04,164
I'm having a wonderful time,
Ronnie.

700
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,260
Yeah?

701
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:10,603
Uh, would you like a root beer?
-Uh-uh.

702
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:17,202
I'll tell you what. I'll take charge
of this case personally.

703
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:19,511
How about a movie tonight?

704
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:23,110
A movie? Me?
I mean, us?

705
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:25,280
Then afterwards,
maybe a pizza or somethin'.

706
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:29,884
I really have to practice.
-Well, let the horse practice.

707
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,896
Thanks, Ronnie, but I can't tonight,
really. -Then how about Friday night?

708
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,296
Friday's the show
at Rockford.

709
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:38,961
Then Saturday, for sure.

710
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:40,970
And no excuses.

711
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:44,707
Okay.

712
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:47,608
I'll come by for ya around 6:00.
And you be ready. Ya got it?

713
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,771
Oh, and good luck.
-Huh?

714
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:53,044
On your medal class.
-Oh.

715
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:04,627
When nothing's feelin' well

716
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:06,959
I said, a-reach
a-reach, brother

717
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:08,965
A-reach for Aspercel

718
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:10,694
Did you write that, boss?
-Sure I did.

719
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:13,362
That's pretty good. -Yeah, yeah,
you know, I used to play guitar.

720
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:18,602
Hello, Freddie.
-Well, well. Well!

721
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:21,770
Well, Mr. Dugan,
this is a pleasant surprise.

722
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:25,645
Ah, Aspercel, meet your sponsor,
Mr. Thomas Dugan.

723
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:27,877
Mr. Dugan, this is
your four-footed, subliminal gold mine.

724
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:29,886
I'd like to speak to you
privately, Freddie.

725
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:33,913
Uh, privately.
-About this subliminal gold mine.

726
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,425
Sure thing, Mr. Dugan.
Hank, walk him around a little bit.

727
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:39,690
Then saddle him up, will ya?
-Sure, boss. Come on, meatball.

728
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:43,028
Uh, Hank,
his name's Aspercel.

729
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,694
Yeah, I know. How come you picked
a stupid name like that?

730
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:48,738
A lousy stomach pill,
no less.

731
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:52,537
Hank thinks he's a comic.

732
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,773
<i>I only keep him around
because the horse laughs at his jokes.</i>

733
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:59,043
Well, I've been working on a brochure
of our progress so far, Mr. Dugan.

734
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,107
Soon as the dust settles
just a little bit, I want you to...

735
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:03,915
The dust has already settled,
and most of it's on you.

736
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:07,549
<i>What's that? -I'm gonna give
you a chance to level with me.</i>

737
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,659
I think this whole campaign
is something you cooked up...

738
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,597
<i>just so your daughter
could get a horse for nothing.</i>

739
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,635
Now wait a minute. I've got faith
in this idea. -I don't want faith.

740
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:23,071
I want that international
class publicity you promised to get me.

741
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,769
<i>I want Vogue and Harper's Bazaar,
the Illustrated London News.</i>

742
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:29,574
I want TV cameras,
and what do I get?

743
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:32,445
After two months of hard work,
you come up with this:

744
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,849
"Miss Helen Bolton won
first prize last Saturday...

745
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:37,910
mounted on "Aspirin'."

746
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:40,286
Oh, that's a hot item
to bounce offTelstar.

747
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:42,990
Now I have gotten
better stuff than that,

748
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:45,624
and you know it.
That's a dirty curve.

749
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,425
I didn't come here to argue.
-Then lay off.

750
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,261
<u>What did you say?
-I said lay off!.</u>

751
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,096
<i>I got a great idea
here, Mr. Dugan,</i>

752
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:52,860
<i>and you're smart enough
man to know I have.</i>

753
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:54,870
Now give it a chance
to build.

754
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:56,968
I'm going on the road
next week. I'm gonna

755
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,999
see editors in Cleveland,
Detroit, Chicago.

756
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:00,924
If I don't flood the
class media by the time my

757
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:02,773
little girl gets to the
Washington International...

758
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:04,939
<i>you can have myjob,
the vice presidency...</i>

759
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:07,950
You have a lot of confidence,
haven't you? -You bet I have.

760
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:14,557
No.
No, I haven't.

761
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,321
I'm just as insecure as the next guy,
but get off my neck.

762
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:19,328
Give me a chance
to make this thing work.

763
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:23,358
All right. All right!

764
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:27,302
You get your little girl to Washington.
She needs two more medals.

765
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,168
She'll get one of
them this afternoon.

766
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:30,966
She'll get the other one
next Friday at Rockford.

767
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,566
<i>That doesn't sound
as insecure as the next guy.</i>

768
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:36,238
<i>Well, fortunately,
I'm not riding the horse.</i>

769
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:39,646
Oh, yes, you are.
There's a lot riding on that horse:

770
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:42,083
The Allied Drug account,
your job with Tomes.

771
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,245
Oh, I'm gonna keep my eye
on that horse.

772
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:47,256
I only hope he's strong enough
to carry the load.

773
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:33,267
<i>Next exhibitor,
number 189, 1-8-9...</i>

774
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:36,101
<i>Aspercel, ridden by Helen Bolton.
-Come on, Aspie.</i>

775
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,300
Make me look good.
We've got to win this one.

776
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:42,903
<i>Good luck, Helen.
-Good luck, Helen.</i>

777
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:48,181
<i>Will all entries in Class Number Three
move back into the ring, please?</i>

778
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:14,175
<i>Winner of the A.H.S.A.
Hunter seat medal class...</i>

779
00:53:14,248 --> 00:53:17,240
<i>is Miss Helen Bolton,
riding Aspercel.</i>

780
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,316
Come on, honey.
How about a nice,

781
00:53:34,317 --> 00:53:36,000
big smile? Right over
this way. That's it.

782
00:53:37,638 --> 00:53:41,938
Fred, give her a hand.
We won. We won.

783
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:46,245
We haven't won yet,
Suzie.

784
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:17,276
Hello?
Oh, hi, Daddy.

785
00:54:17,344 --> 00:54:18,976
Are you still in
Chicago? -Yeah, I'm

786
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,609
still here. I'll be
home tomorrow night.

787
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:24,708
I'm just phoning to,
uh, well, find out how everybody is.

788
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:27,777
Oh, everyone's fine, just fine.
-Good, good.

789
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:32,053
I lost at Rockford.
-Oh.

790
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:35,892
But it's okay, Daddy. I'll still get
to Washington. So please don't worry.

791
00:54:35,963 --> 00:54:38,898
Oh, I'm not worried, honey. -Suzie
checked all the entries at Millbrook...

792
00:54:38,966 --> 00:54:41,457
and she says I'll be better than
any of the other kids. -Uh, Helen...

793
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:44,470
So I'll get that last medal.
I promise.

794
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:47,234
Honey, I'm not worried...

795
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:51,904
Look, I just phone to-to
find out how everybody is. That's all.

796
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:56,211
Everyone's fine.
-Well, good, good.

797
00:54:56,283 --> 00:54:59,150
Look, I'll see you tomorrow
night, okay? -Okay, Daddy.

798
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:01,983
Okay. Don't you worry about
Rockford. That's an order. All right?

799
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:04,820
I'll try. -All right, honey.
I'll see you tomorrow night. Bye.

800
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:07,383
See you, Daddy.
-Bye.

801
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:47,500
Hello, everybody.
I took an early plane.

802
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:54,173
Helen!

803
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:57,276
Aunt Martha!

804
00:55:59,213 --> 00:56:01,147
Herbie?

805
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:40,176
Hey, anybody.
I'm home.

806
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:50,155
Oh, yeah, I'm home,
all right.

807
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:04,403
Well, look who's here.
Loser of the week.

808
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:08,737
Back to your paddock, chum.

809
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:12,370
And no beer for you.
You blew Helen's medal but good.

810
00:57:12,446 --> 00:57:17,110
One more like that, it's
the glue factory for both of us.

811
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:20,585
Oh, I know, I know. One of the judges
had a thing against gray horses, huh?

812
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:27,284
And, uh, your cinch
was too tight. Yeah.

813
00:57:30,898 --> 00:57:32,564
And right at the moment,
Aspie, I don't feel

814
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:34,231
the need for any of
my four-footed friends.

815
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,531
<i>Just get lost, will ya?
Gojump a fence or something.</i>

816
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:45,741
Okay, all right...
I'm sorry!

817
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:52,012
Hey, Aspie, come on back.
You can have a swallow.

818
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:54,213
I gotta live with myself.

819
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:07,395
Hey, stop sulking.
I apologize.

820
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:13,796
Hey, you're takin' this thing
a little big, aren't ya? Huh?

821
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:24,347
Beer, Aspie!
Ice-cold beer!

822
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:31,086
Aspie! I apologize!
Aspie!

823
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,996
This is no time to be
running away from home!

824
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:47,230
Aspie!

825
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:52,872
Your favorite brew!
Zesty, tangy, full-bodied!

826
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:57,316
Hey, look at the frost
on this can!

827
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,519
Aspie! Come on, baby!

828
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:05,023
Come home!
Everybody loves ya!

829
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,437
I am never gonna speak to you
again as... long as I live!

830
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:21,507
Come on. Admit it.
You weren't mad.

831
00:59:21,575 --> 00:59:25,409
You were just exercising
your sense of humor.

832
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,879
Boy, boy, l... I tell...

833
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:31,281
I'm through playing games, Aspie.
L... I know you.

834
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:34,809
I'd reach up for your mane
and... pfft... you'd be gone.

835
00:59:34,888 --> 00:59:39,257
Okay, so you're not gone.

836
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,385
But after what you put me through,
don't be surprised...

837
00:59:41,462 --> 00:59:45,091
if you get a very formal
Christmas card and no present.

838
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,225
You don't mind if I put this rope on?
Nothing personal.

839
00:59:48,302 --> 00:59:50,236
Okay.

840
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,201
You know somethin',
old paint?

841
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:02,510
We're a long way
from our diggin's.

842
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:06,676
You wouldn't...

843
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:09,950
You wouldn't give a guy
a lift, would ya?

844
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:19,294
Come on. We can give it
a try anyway.

845
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,096
Now, I don't have what
you'd call a good seat, Aspie.

846
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:25,138
No points in equitation,
but, uh...

847
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,608
Now, just stand
right there, okay? Ah.

848
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:52,727
Don't look at me like that.
They do it all the time in the movies.

849
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:59,428
Okay. Steady.

850
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:02,737
Easy now, Aspie. No!

851
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:05,243
No, boy, no!
Aspie!

852
01:01:05,312 --> 01:01:10,113
Hey... come back!
Back up! Whoa!

853
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:13,414
Okay, don't move, pal, huh?

854
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:21,757
No... no!
You're moving! You're...

855
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,423
Okay, you win.
We'll both walk home.

856
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:35,501
Soon as I see where we are.

857
01:01:44,551 --> 01:01:49,147
Okay, wise guy. Why didn't you
do that in the first place?

858
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:55,321
Ah!

859
01:01:55,395 --> 01:02:00,492
All right, uh, old paint.
Easy!

860
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:02,666
He's not in the Walsh's field.

861
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:04,765
No, of course not!
He's been kidnapped!

862
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:07,466
Oh, Aunt Martha, maybe
he just wandered off or something.

863
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,475
Oh, with the study
window wide open and your

864
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,409
father's clothes scattered
all over the place?

865
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,276
I'm going to look for him on the fire
road. -No, no, no, you wait right here.

866
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:16,327
We'll both go and
look for him in the

867
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:18,307
car just as soon as...
Oh, hello. Police?

868
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:22,583
This is Martha Ramsey
at the Bolton house on Westhill Road.

869
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,386
I'd like to speak to the person
in charge of stolen horses.

870
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:30,658
Stolen horses?
Oh, oh, yes, I see. Yes, ma'am.

871
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:36,033
Right out of your stable?
Yes. Yes, yes, go ahead.

872
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:39,766
Gray coat, brown eyes...

873
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,037
and a small scar
on his right flank.

874
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,237
Yes, ma'am, I've got it.

875
01:02:45,312 --> 01:02:47,041
And don't you worry.
We'll search every

876
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:48,770
back road in the
county till we find him.

877
01:02:57,457 --> 01:03:00,204
You know somethin', Aspie?

878
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:02,952
This beats the horseless
carriage any day.

879
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:08,297
No traffic. No, uh, noise.

880
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,302
No smog.

881
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:13,990
Wouldn't it be great if we had

882
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:15,941
an 8:15 horse to
commute to the city, huh?

883
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:18,944
<i>Peaceful, serene.</i>

884
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:26,383
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Easy! Easy!

885
01:03:26,453 --> 01:03:29,479
All right, all right. Off that horse!
-No!

886
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,150
Hey, hey! Look out!

887
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:36,218
Stop! Stop!
You're under arrest!

888
01:03:36,296 --> 01:03:38,491
<i>Stop!</i>

889
01:03:44,204 --> 01:03:46,798
Whoa!

890
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,507
Help!

891
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,443
<i>Halt!
-Stop!</i>

892
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:56,812
Pull over!
-Slow down!

893
01:03:56,883 --> 01:04:00,478
Whoa, baby! Whoa!
Whoa, boy!

894
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:02,681
Boy, I'd like to see
that guy's license.

895
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,418
No!

896
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:13,630
Whoa, boy! Whoa, buddy!
Come on, baby! Stop!

897
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:19,297
Come on, baby!
Let's stop for a beer, huh?

898
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,431
Sorry!

899
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:24,636
Hey, you! Pull over!
-I'm trying, you idiot!

900
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,047
Whoa, buddy! Aspie!

901
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:34,053
Oh! Ooh!

902
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,224
That's a nice jump.

903
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,233
Watch the trees!
Whoa!

904
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:06,580
Whoa, boy!

905
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:07,984
<i>Aspie, no!</i>

906
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:12,825
No! No!

907
01:05:12,893 --> 01:05:15,828
Wh... whoa!

908
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:46,784
Okay, cowboy, don't move.
You're under arrest.

909
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:57,869
Sergeant! Sergeant!

910
01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:00,771
Charlie, are you outta
your mind? Sergeant!

911
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:02,422
<i>Hey, that's good,
Freddie. Now, keep</i>

912
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,004
<i>shakin'the bars like a
wild gorilla. Get a shot.</i>

913
01:06:04,077 --> 01:06:06,705
<u>Now, listen, Charlie. They got you
down here for you to identify me!</u>

914
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,714
Now, go out and start identifying.
-Lower angle.

915
01:06:08,782 --> 01:06:10,716
Give 'im the teeth there, Freddie.
-Ch...

916
01:06:10,784 --> 01:06:12,718
Charlie, I know
what you're up to.

917
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:15,050
Free publicity. You're gonna spread me
through the papers, aren't ya?

918
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:16,935
Yeah, can't ya
see the headlines?

919
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:18,750
"Aspercel ad exec
steals his own horse."

920
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:22,488
Charlie, you idiot!
I've got a family to think of.

921
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,894
I am thinkin' of your family.
Tomes will make ya a partner for this.

922
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:29,902
Okay, Charlie! You spring me
right now or you are fired!

923
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:33,030
You too, Alex! Sergeant!

924
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:36,769
Sergeant!
-Freddie! Sergeant!

925
01:06:36,843 --> 01:06:38,777
You gonna tell him who I am, Charlie?
-Yeah.

926
01:06:38,845 --> 01:06:40,312
I'm gonna tell 'im
you're the guy who's

927
01:06:40,313 --> 01:06:41,780
choking me. Alex,
get a picture of this.

928
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:44,578
"Irate citizen
chokes his best friend."

929
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:48,781
Sergeant! Sergeant!

930
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:51,983
Hey, hey, hey, hey! -All right, all
right. All right! What's goin' on?

931
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:55,858
<i><u>Sergeant, I demand you
force him to identify me.</u></i>

932
01:06:55,929 --> 01:07:00,628
What's my name?
-I don't know. Big Chief Horse Blanket?

933
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,363
Sergeant, my name is Fred Bolton.
I live on Westhill Road...

934
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:08,931
<u>Are we gonna start that again? Now,
can you identify this man or can't you?</u>

935
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:10,909
Never saw him
before in my life.

936
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:12,809
We're takin' pictures
for a magazine article.

937
01:07:12,879 --> 01:07:15,473
"Crime in the suburbs."
-Sergeant, let's be...

938
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:17,482
Look at these shorts!

939
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,017
Now, would a
self-respecting thief go

940
01:07:19,018 --> 01:07:20,485
around stealing horses
in shorts like this?

941
01:07:20,553 --> 01:07:24,148
Why not?
-Because it's insane!

942
01:07:24,224 --> 01:07:26,522
<i>Hey, there's a fresh angle.
Call the psychiatric ward...</i>

943
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:28,686
and see if they misplaced
one of the patients.

944
01:07:30,597 --> 01:07:33,589
Okay, that's enough.
You and the beard, out!

945
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:35,897
Certainly, sir.
Just one more picture. Alex.

946
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,403
Sergeant, Sergeant, please...

947
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:40,838
Sergeant, call my house
just one last time.

948
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:43,171
Now, my aunt is bound
to be there by now. She'll identi...

949
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:46,406
<u>Alex!
She'll identify me!</u>

950
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,413
She'll also tell you
who that creep is.

951
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,711
Name-calling will
avail you nothing, sir. Come on, Alex.

952
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:53,252
Charlie Blake!

953
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,515
Ha, ha! Ha, ha! See that?
See that? He knows his own name!

954
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:57,254
Of course, I know my name.

955
01:07:57,255 --> 01:07:58,921
But what's your name?
That's the question.

956
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,926
Thanks for your cooperation,
officer. Come on, Alex.

957
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,962
Sergeant, Sergeant, don't
let him out of this building.

958
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:05,190
They're gonna make a fool
of me in the newspapers.

959
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:08,200
That won't be no uphill
battle. Believe me. -Oh!

960
01:08:08,268 --> 01:08:10,202
<i>Hey, Sarge.
-Yeah, Eddie.</i>

961
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:11,402
The lady from Westhill
Road just called.

962
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:12,534
She came home and found
the horse in its stable.

963
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:14,539
Did ya ask her?
Did ya tell her?

964
01:08:14,607 --> 01:08:17,542
Well, I told her we got a suspect here
who says he's your nephew.

965
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:20,841
Yeah? -And she says, "My nephew
isn't a suspect. He's in Chicago."

966
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:24,816
But l-l-l-I took an early...

967
01:08:24,884 --> 01:08:28,342
I demand that I call her
back immediately!

968
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:31,948
Too bad, Mac.
You just ran out of phone calls.

969
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,119
<u>Why don't you make yourself comfy?
You've had a very busy day.</u>

970
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,071
As if I didn't have enough problems...

971
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,079
without you running away.

972
01:08:54,147 --> 01:08:56,115
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

973
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:58,742
Don't you ever
do that again.

974
01:08:58,818 --> 01:09:00,979
And now
for five minutes of the latest news.

975
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,114
On the lighter side,
Connecticut's first horse-napping...

976
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,124
in many years is solved.

977
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:08,558
Aspercel,
a well-known jumping horse...

978
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:12,792
returned late this afternoon
to his owner, gðice Helen Bolton.

979
01:09:12,866 --> 01:09:15,494
Aspie, that's us!
-But here's the topper.

980
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,581
The alleged horse stealer

981
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:19,595
turns out to be the
young lady's father...

982
01:09:19,672 --> 01:09:22,300
Mr. Fred Bolton
of Westhill Road.

983
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:26,038
Don't ask us why, folks.
We can't figure it either.

984
01:09:26,112 --> 01:09:27,659
On the international scene,

985
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,206
things are not
proceeding quite as well.

986
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:40,283
<i>Oh, Aspie, it was one of
daddy's publicity things.</i>

987
01:09:43,696 --> 01:09:46,893
<i>Ronnie!</i>

988
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:10,990
Hey, tiger, that you?
That man is here.

989
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:14,754
Hi, Ronnie.
-Well, hi.

990
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:16,762
Hey, why aren't ya dressed?

991
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:20,322
Dressed? -Well, it's Saturday.
Remember our date?

992
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,860
Oh, yes, uh, it is Saturday.

993
01:10:24,938 --> 01:10:27,873
Hey, uh, you aren't
standin' me up, are ya?

994
01:10:27,941 --> 01:10:31,570
Well, Ronnie, you see,
Aspie disappeared this afternoon.

995
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,908
You are standin' me up!

996
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,744
And I have to wait for Suzie.
-Suzie!

997
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,808
She's coming over to see if
Aspie's all right. -Aspie!

998
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:42,548
I'm sorry.

999
01:10:42,622 --> 01:10:45,216
Oh, you're sorry. Hey, that's great.
That takes care of everything.

1000
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,555
All my plans,
my whole Saturday.

1001
01:10:47,627 --> 01:10:49,561
Look at me.
I even wore a tie.

1002
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:52,496
Isn't there anything you
think of besides horse shows?

1003
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,768
I hate horse shows!

1004
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:59,168
What?
-I hate 'em!

1005
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:02,208
Well, then, for pete's sake,
why do ya keep goin'?

1006
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:06,405
If I don't win at Millbrook,
I won't win another medal.

1007
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,107
<i>And if I don't win another medal
and go on to Washington...</i>

1008
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,345
my father will lose
his job and...

1009
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:14,477
And... l...

1010
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:17,022
I'm sorry you had
to wear a tie for nothing!

1011
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,684
Well, I didn't mean to...
Get out of the way, will ya?

1012
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,387
Hey, wait a minute!

1013
01:11:31,337 --> 01:11:36,206
What the heck was that all about?

1014
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:47,916
Uh, Mr. Bolton,
we'd, uh, like to apologize, sir.

1015
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:49,517
You do and I'll never
buy another ticket

1016
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:51,047
to your annual clambake.

1017
01:11:51,124 --> 01:11:53,615
Hmm.
-Souvenir.

1018
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:03,895
Well, good night, gentlemen.
-Uh, good night, Mr. Bolton.

1019
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,666
Uh, I'll return
the costume tomorrow.

1020
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:13,608
It was a pleasure booking you.
-Yeah. Ha, ha.

1021
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,708
Uh, if I decide to steal another horse,
I'll call ya.

1022
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:36,258
Mr. Bolton?

1023
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:40,966
Oh, hi, Ronnie. Yeah, I thought that
was your car out there.

1024
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,065
What are you doing?
Waiting for Helen?

1025
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:46,441
No, sir.
I was waiting for you.

1026
01:12:46,512 --> 01:12:51,176
There's somethin' I gotta say, even
if it does get ya upset. -Upset?

1027
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:55,517
You may really get mad,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1028
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:58,216
Mr. Bolton,
I've always admired you.

1029
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,953
Is that supposed
to make me mad?

1030
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:02,574
I always thought you
were a real nice guy

1031
01:13:02,575 --> 01:13:04,121
and a real swell father.

1032
01:13:04,197 --> 01:13:07,291
I admired you.
-Until tonight?

1033
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:10,564
Yes, sir. I mean, I don't want to
tell you what to do, but...

1034
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:12,633
But I know when I
have kids, if there's a

1035
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:14,630
situation where they
don't wanna do somethin'...

1036
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:16,675
well, I'd never
make 'em do it...

1037
01:13:16,743 --> 01:13:18,409
even if the only reason
they were doin' it

1038
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,076
was so I wouldn't lose my job.

1039
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,876
Lose my job? -Shh! She's crackin'
up, Mr. Bolton. She really is.

1040
01:13:22,949 --> 01:13:24,917
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What are we...

1041
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:28,351
Are we talkin' about Helen?
-Yes, sir.

1042
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:31,481
I've always admired you, Mr. Bolton...
-You said that. Sit down, Ronnie.

1043
01:13:31,557 --> 01:13:34,355
Now, suppose you tell me
everything you know.

1044
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:37,988
Well, all I know is...
-And slowly.

1045
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:40,282
Well, all I know is
we had a date tonight,

1046
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,501
and I showed up with
a tie and everything...

1047
01:13:42,568 --> 01:13:45,002
and I asked her why
she was standin' me up.

1048
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:47,005
Then she started ravin'
about winnin' medals...

1049
01:13:47,073 --> 01:13:50,065
and how she had to go to Washington
or you'd lose your job.

1050
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:52,373
And then
she started bawlin'.

1051
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:06,523
Oh, hi, Daddy.
Aunt Martha's at her

1052
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:09,390
garden club, but your
dinner's on the stove.

1053
01:14:09,462 --> 01:14:13,228
I seem to be coming down
with a cold.

1054
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:16,097
Uh, how come you never told me
you hated horse shows?

1055
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:21,004
What? Who told you that?

1056
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:23,907
Ronnie told me that.

1057
01:14:25,645 --> 01:14:27,636
Oh, Daddy.

1058
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:31,844
And, uh, what's
this nonsense about, uh...

1059
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:34,386
my losing my job?

1060
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:37,105
It isn't nonsense, Daddy.

1061
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,756
I heard what Mr. Dugan
said at Lakeville.

1062
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:42,226
I didn't mean to listen.
I just heard.

1063
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:51,495
Well, I don't care
what Mr. Dugan said.

1064
01:14:52,672 --> 01:14:55,140
You know,
a job's just a job.

1065
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:58,109
But what's here at home...

1066
01:14:58,177 --> 01:15:01,340
between...

1067
01:15:02,849 --> 01:15:04,783
That's what's important.

1068
01:15:04,851 --> 01:15:08,912
I mean, that's important.
I'm not gonna lose that.

1069
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:15,920
You're not gonna ride
in any more horse shows.

1070
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,662
Oh, Daddy.

1071
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:28,199
Daddy, I can get to Washington.
-No.

1072
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:32,802
Suzie... She's coming over here.
She was gonna work with me all week.

1073
01:15:32,879 --> 01:15:35,143
Daddy, if I practice...
-No!

1074
01:15:35,214 --> 01:15:38,149
Even if I want to?
-Now, listen, you try to con me...

1075
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:41,380
I'm gonna take you across
my knee like I used to.

1076
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,321
You never took me over your knee.
-Well, I should have.

1077
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:48,451
Now, you, uh, wipe that smeary face
and get outside.

1078
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:51,122
Ronnie's waiting on you.

1079
01:15:51,197 --> 01:15:55,065
But I look terrible, and he's
wearing a tie. I'm not even dressed.

1080
01:15:55,134 --> 01:16:00,128
Somehow I don't think
it'll matter. Now, go on.

1081
01:16:07,213 --> 01:16:11,309
Daddy, will we have
to sell Aspie?

1082
01:16:11,384 --> 01:16:13,198
Are you kidding?
Of course, we're not

1083
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,013
selling Aspie. He's a
member of the family.

1084
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,251
Ronnie!

1085
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:34,701
Well, Herbie, I wonder
how the market is...

1086
01:16:34,774 --> 01:16:38,733
for slightly used
vice presidents.

1087
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:52,386
So?
-He's fine.

1088
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,655
Only a few scratches. That's all.
-Good, good.

1089
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:59,960
Now all I have to do is figure out how
to feed him on my unemployment check.

1090
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,763
You'll find a way.
-I do have one angle.

1091
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:07,431
I'm thinking of joining the circus
as a bareback rider.

1092
01:17:07,507 --> 01:17:10,999
Don't knock it. Aspie and I went over
a seven-foot wall this afternoon.

1093
01:17:11,077 --> 01:17:16,208
Seven feet? -And one inch!
The police measure everything.

1094
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,546
Aspie went seven feet.

1095
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:25,819
I personally went ten feet
for a flash finish into a lath house.

1096
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:27,974
You will tell me,
old boy, won't you,

1097
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:30,056
when you plan to, uh,
stop that fast again?

1098
01:17:30,129 --> 01:17:32,324
Fred?
-Yeah?

1099
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:36,300
Supposing Aspie did make it.
To Washington, I mean.

1100
01:17:36,369 --> 01:17:38,894
No, no, no. Helen's through
riding in horse shows.

1101
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:40,905
And I'm through
on Madison Avenue.

1102
01:17:40,973 --> 01:17:43,498
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself and listen.

1103
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,227
Sorry for myself?
-Supposing Aspie were

1104
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,878
entered in the open
jumper championship.

1105
01:17:48,948 --> 01:17:50,939
Why do you say
I'm sorry for myself?

1106
01:17:51,017 --> 01:17:54,953
Because I like you.
Because I like Helen.

1107
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:59,185
I like Aunt Martha and Aspie
and Herbie and the whole insane setup.

1108
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,557
And maybe I have an idea
to save it. That's all.

1109
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:06,689
You know, you look rather fetching
when you get all steamed up like this.

1110
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:11,931
Listen. Do you have any idea how
many horses there are...

1111
01:18:12,004 --> 01:18:15,337
in this whole wide world
that can jump seven feet?

1112
01:18:15,408 --> 01:18:20,436
A handful. Aspie may have the stuff
to go for the biggest prize of all.

1113
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:24,279
The open jumper championship.
-That's impossible. He's a kid's horse.

1114
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,284
I mean, just because he was
on the lam from the cops...

1115
01:18:26,352 --> 01:18:28,286
If he did it once,
he can do it again.

1116
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:31,846
And if he made it to Washington
as an open jumper...

1117
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:34,552
Wow! That's
really big league.

1118
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,346
<i>And you get a thousand
times more publicity</i>

1119
01:18:37,347 --> 01:18:40,065
<i>than with Helen in a
junior class, right?</i>

1120
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,066
Well, sure, but...

1121
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,160
Aspercel,
open jumper champion.

1122
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:49,298
How would Allied Drug like that
for a subliminal commercial?

1123
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:53,004
You know, you might be
in the wrong business.

1124
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:57,516
Is it a deal then?
-Yeah, it's a deal.

1125
01:19:01,053 --> 01:19:05,990
Well, you get
a good night's rest, Aspie.

1126
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:10,358
We've got big plans for you.
Good night.

1127
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:13,694
Good night. Uh, so soon?
Can I buy ya a beer?

1128
01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:15,700
Uh, cup of coffee?
Glass of milk?

1129
01:19:15,768 --> 01:19:19,169
No. I want to get
a good night's rest myself.

1130
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:21,035
We haven't much time.

1131
01:19:21,036 --> 01:19:22,833
I want to put Aspie
in training tomorrow.

1132
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:25,001
You really think
he has a chance?

1133
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:28,569
Naturally I want to get
an expert opinion before we go too far.

1134
01:19:28,648 --> 01:19:30,843
Your opinion
is good enough for me.

1135
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:34,147
There's one man who can
tell us in a minute. I want to get him.

1136
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,314
Then get him.
You're the boss.

1137
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:42,385
Fred?
-Yeah?

1138
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:45,362
I'm sorry I said you were
sorry for yourself. I didn't mean it.

1139
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:47,865
Yes, you did, and I was.

1140
01:19:51,604 --> 01:19:53,834
Oh, uh, S.J., uh...
-Yes?

1141
01:19:53,906 --> 01:19:56,306
J-just one question.
-Yes?

1142
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,400
Why are you being
so helpful?

1143
01:19:58,477 --> 01:20:00,604
Hmm?
-Well, I mean...

1144
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,478
Uh, who are you
doing all this for?

1145
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:07,849
Couldn't be Helen. She's out of it now.
-I guess so.

1146
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,821
Not Tom Dugan.
You don't know him.

1147
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,188
No. No, that's true.

1148
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:15,386
Not Aunt Martha, is it?

1149
01:20:15,461 --> 01:20:17,656
No. No, it's not Aunt Martha.

1150
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,255
No, no.

1151
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:24,792
Well, I guess that only
leaves one conclusion, doesn't it?

1152
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:29,034
Yeah, I guess it does.

1153
01:20:29,108 --> 01:20:31,099
I must be doing it
for the horse.

1154
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:36,607
I like you, S.J.
-I must go.

1155
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:42,416
Helen and, uh, Aunt Martha
and Herbie like ya too, S.J.

1156
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:45,321
Good night.

1157
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:52,030
The whole family
likes ya, S. J!

1158
01:21:05,244 --> 01:21:09,442
<i>This will have to be moved
about 18 inches.</i>

1159
01:21:09,515 --> 01:21:11,380
Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, honey.

1160
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,850
I got tied up at
the office. Am I late?

1161
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:15,887
No, you're just in time.
They're gonna try him now.

1162
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,889
Yeah, for what?
The pole vault?

1163
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:21,791
<i>That thing looks ten feet high. -No
more than five-and-a-half feet, Daddy.</i>

1164
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:23,795
Isn't this the craziest?

1165
01:21:23,863 --> 01:21:26,127
Is that the expert fellow out there?
-Yeah, that's him.

1166
01:21:26,198 --> 01:21:27,728
Wait till you meet
him. He's so handsome

1167
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:29,258
you're gonna go all swoony.

1168
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:31,394
I'll try to bear up.
Where's Suzie?

1169
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,995
She's in the barn with Aspie.

1170
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,605
Hey, you sure
this guy's an expert?

1171
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:43,147
He used to be
on the United States Equestrian Team.

1172
01:21:43,215 --> 01:21:45,376
Now he's
a professional coach.

1173
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:49,888
He knows more about jumpers than
practically anybody around. -Hmm.

1174
01:21:49,955 --> 01:21:54,415
<i>Uh, Mr. Madison?
I'd like you to meet my father.</i>

1175
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,826
<i>Oh!
-Daddy, this is Archer Madison.</i>

1176
01:21:57,897 --> 01:22:00,388
<i>How do you do, Mr. Bolton?
-Mr. Madison.</i>

1177
01:22:00,466 --> 01:22:03,264
I've been looking over your horse.
If he's as good over the fences...

1178
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,326
as he looks in the stall,
you might have something.

1179
01:22:05,404 --> 01:22:07,338
Well, good, good.
I hope so.

1180
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:09,931
<i>Here they come!</i>

1181
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,206
I'll check with you later.

1182
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:16,248
Archer Madison?
-Isn't he devastating, Daddy?

1183
01:22:16,315 --> 01:22:19,580
<i>Devastating.</i>

1184
01:22:19,652 --> 01:22:24,055
Hey, he's... He's the one that Suzie
almost got, uh... -I know. She told me.

1185
01:22:27,493 --> 01:22:31,429
How could she ever have
cooled it with anyone so gorgeous?

1186
01:22:31,497 --> 01:22:34,057
Well, if she cooled it,
it looks like he's heating it up again.

1187
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:38,536
<i><u>Oh, Daddy, he's just giving her some
last-minute instructions.</u></i>

1188
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:41,266
<i>Maybe that's what it looks like
to you, but if you ask...</i>

1189
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,400
What... what do you mean,
instructions? About what?

1190
01:22:46,478 --> 01:22:50,244
Hey! What is she doing?
-Well, she's gonna ride him.

1191
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:53,479
Suzie? -All the top riders
were booked for Washington.

1192
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,486
So it had to be Suzie
or else.

1193
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,647
Well, that fence
is too high for her.

1194
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:02,558
Daddy, Suzie knows what
she's doing, really.

1195
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:11,260
<i>Now, watch your rhythm.</i>

1196
01:23:11,337 --> 01:23:13,965
<i>Rhythm. That's what
these placing poles are all about.</i>

1197
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:15,973
<i>After the brush
there are three beats.</i>

1198
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:18,532
One, two, three!

1199
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,084
You got left behind.
Try it again.

1200
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:33,322
What is he doing now?
He's raising it higher!

1201
01:23:38,464 --> 01:23:41,160
Remember what
those cavallettis are for.

1202
01:23:44,637 --> 01:23:46,571
<i>That's better.</i>

1203
01:23:54,013 --> 01:23:56,607
You're behind the motion.
Get with the horse. -Right.

1204
01:23:56,682 --> 01:23:58,616
Watch it!

1205
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:07,382
Are you all right, Suzie?
You're sure?

1206
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,393
Yes, I'm all right. I'm all
right, Fred. -You hurt?

1207
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,225
It was so stupid of me.
Could we try it again, Archer?

1208
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:14,232
Yes, of course.
-Try...

1209
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,895
Nothing doing! The whole deal is off.
What are you trying to do, kill her?

1210
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,029
I'm merely trying to help her
get to Washington...

1211
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:22,938
which for some mysterious reason
she seems to want.

1212
01:24:23,008 --> 01:24:25,067
Now, come on, Suzie. I'll
give you a leg up. -Suzie!

1213
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:29,877
Suzie! I don't think you should.
-I'm all right, Fred, really.

1214
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:33,484
Now, knees tighter this time.
-Okay.

1215
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:35,486
I'll get it good this time.

1216
01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:39,115
She's okay, Daddy.
Come on.

1217
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,095
All right, Suzie.
Get with it now.

1218
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:07,351
That's much better.

1219
01:25:07,419 --> 01:25:09,512
<i><u>Okay, that'll be enough.</u></i>

1220
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:25,695
Well, what do you think, Archer?

1221
01:25:25,771 --> 01:25:28,365
I think you've been doing too much
teaching and not enough riding.

1222
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,536
But you still
have a talent.

1223
01:25:32,611 --> 01:25:37,412
It's a 300-to-1 shot,
but she does have a chance.

1224
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:40,316
And if you want me to help, I will.
The decision is yours.

1225
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:44,447
Well, come on, young lady.
Let's cool off this horse of yours.

1226
01:25:52,498 --> 01:25:55,058
On to Washington, Freddie?

1227
01:25:55,134 --> 01:25:57,967
Suzie, I can't let you risk your neck
to save mine with Tom Dugan.

1228
01:25:58,037 --> 01:26:02,167
You're just afraid that
Aspie and I will be a flop.

1229
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:05,176
Are you demented?
I think you're both great.

1230
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:07,974
Then you're afraid you won't
be able to sell Mr. Dugan.

1231
01:26:08,047 --> 01:26:10,379
Oh, that's no problem.
I mean, it's a natural, but...

1232
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:14,977
Then let's stop horsing around.
On to Washington, Freddie?

1233
01:26:17,122 --> 01:26:19,818
On to Washington, Suzie.

1234
01:26:19,892 --> 01:26:21,883
Good.

1235
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,361
Oh! Isn't this
beautiful, Freddie?

1236
01:27:02,434 --> 01:27:04,698
Yeah, yeah, this is
the big league, all right.

1237
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,174
<i><u>Ladies and gentlemen...</u></i>

1238
01:27:10,242 --> 01:27:14,144
<i>welcome to the Washington
International Horse Show.</i>

1239
01:27:19,451 --> 01:27:22,420
<i>Circling the ring now

1240
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:27,050
<i>are the distinguishedjudges
for this evening's events.</i>

1241
01:27:36,735 --> 01:27:38,669
Does jumping start now?
-I don't know.

1242
01:27:38,737 --> 01:27:40,671
No, ma'am. These are just
the opening ceremonies.

1243
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:43,867
Ceremonies. -The first jumping
class doesn't start till later.

1244
01:27:47,312 --> 01:27:49,712
Uh, stay here, everybody.
I'm gonna see if Suzie needs anything.

1245
01:27:49,781 --> 01:27:52,215
Freddie, sit down.
You just saw Suzie ten minutes ago.

1246
01:27:52,284 --> 01:27:55,583
You'll only make her nervous.
-Yeah, right, right.

1247
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:57,645
<i>During the next
seven days and nights...</i>

1248
01:27:57,723 --> 01:28:02,558
<i>over 120 class competitions
will be held in this arena.</i>

1249
01:28:02,628 --> 01:28:04,755
<i>Among the classes

1250
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:08,926
<i><u>class 56, ladies,

<i>the Forest Hill Hunt Club

1254
01:28:32,591 --> 01:28:34,786
<i>By the end of the week,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1255
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:39,092
<i>we will have determined the grand
international open jumper champion.</i>

1256
01:28:39,164 --> 01:28:41,081
<i>This award will be
given to the horse that</i>

1257
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,998
<i>has won the greatest
number of points...</i>

1258
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,832
<i>in the entire
open jumper division.</i>

1259
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:49,635
<i>In these classes,
each knockdown is four faults.</i>

1260
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:53,542
<i>Touches without a knockdown,
no penalty.</i>

1261
01:28:53,612 --> 01:28:57,446
<i><u>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
class 72...</u></i>

1262
01:28:57,516 --> 01:28:59,950
<i>open jumpers, bonus point.</i>

1263
01:29:00,018 --> 01:29:04,887
Okay. Okay, everybody.
Suzie's event. Fingers.

1264
01:29:04,957 --> 01:29:08,825
<i>Our first exhibitor,
number 111, Ann's Joy...</i>

1265
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:12,955
<i>owned and ridden
by Miss Ellen Farrell.</i>

1266
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:19,299
Lieutenant Mario Lorendo at your
service, senorita. -Suzie Clemens.

1267
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:35,886
Your first international?
-Yes.

1268
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:39,788
I'm very nervous.
-This is my sixth international.

1269
01:29:39,858 --> 01:29:43,817
And I am very nervous too.

1270
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:57,006
<i>Number 111, eight faults.</i>

1271
01:29:57,075 --> 01:30:02,274
<i><u>Eight faults, eight faults.
-The next exhibitor, number 744...</u></i>

1272
01:30:02,347 --> 01:30:05,407
<i>the Chilean champion,
Rascala...</i>

1273
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,749
<i>owned and ridden
by Lieutenant Mario Lorendo.</i>

1274
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:23,031
Isn't he a beautiful horse, Daddy?
-Beautiful horse.

1275
01:30:56,868 --> 01:31:00,463
He's terribly good, isn't he?
-Terribly.

1276
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:15,478
<i><u>Number 744, Rascala, four faults.</u></i>

1277
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:19,285
L-is Suzie next?
-No, ma'am. She's the last entry.

1278
01:31:19,358 --> 01:31:21,758
Last entry.
-Just keep 'em crossed, Aunt Martha.

1279
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:15,568
<i><u>Number 117, eight faults.</u></i>

1280
01:32:15,647 --> 01:32:18,115
If Suzie doesn't come on soon,
I'm gonna be a basket case.

1281
01:32:18,183 --> 01:32:23,951
<i>And now, the last exhibitor,
number 320, Aspercel... -Already?</i>

1282
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:27,389
<i>Owned by Miss Helen Bolton,
ridden by Miss Suzie Clemens.</i>

1283
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,859
<i>Okay, Aspie, let's go.</i>

1284
01:32:37,169 --> 01:32:41,037
<i>Whoa.</i>

1285
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:55,486
Come on, Aspie.
Show 'em how.

1286
01:34:13,532 --> 01:34:18,196
Well, coach? -I didn't particularly
like that third fence, Suzie.

1287
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,830
You took a chance with it,
but you got away with it.

1288
01:34:28,513 --> 01:34:33,678
<i>Number 320, Aspercel,
ridden by Miss Suzie Clemens...</i>

1289
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,982
<i>a clean round,
no faults.</i>

1290
01:34:36,054 --> 01:34:37,988
No faults!
-Daddy, no faults!

1291
01:34:38,056 --> 01:34:40,456
Of course, no faults!
That's my girl Suzie.

1292
01:34:40,525 --> 01:34:43,289
<i>Yeah!
-Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1293
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:48,594
<i><u>the winner in class 72,
open jumpers, bonus point...</u></i>

1294
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:53,866
<u>first place, number 320, Aspercel,
ridden by Miss Suzie Clemens.</u>

1295
01:34:58,743 --> 01:35:01,268
Congratulations, senorita.
-Thank you!

1296
01:35:01,346 --> 01:35:04,179
Wasn't he a doll?
-You both were.

1297
01:35:22,267 --> 01:35:24,531
Is it all over?
Is she the champion?

1298
01:35:24,603 --> 01:35:26,537
This is just a preliminary
round, ma'am. -Prelim...

1299
01:35:26,605 --> 01:35:28,539
She gets five points for this win.
-Five points.

1300
01:35:28,607 --> 01:35:32,668
There's still six days to go.
-Six days. I hope I make it.

1301
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:43,740
Good luck, pal. Hello.
-Hi.

1302
01:36:43,815 --> 01:36:45,749
Helen decided you and I
should have dinner.

1303
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:48,980
Oh, Freddie, why don't you go to
a restaurant and eat sensibly?

1304
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:50,988
I'm too jumpy
to eat sensibly.

1305
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:53,820
Everybody thinks I'm becoming
completely unglued, you know that?

1306
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:56,360
You really are,
aren't you? -No, no.

1307
01:36:56,361 --> 01:36:58,829
Only when I see you
go over those fences.

1308
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:01,525
I go over
every one of them with you.

1309
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:04,261
I'm getting psychological
saddle sores from watching.

1310
01:37:04,335 --> 01:37:06,269
Oh.
-Open your mouth.

1311
01:37:06,337 --> 01:37:08,271
Big bite. Open your mouth. Come on.
-Oh, no.

1312
01:37:08,339 --> 01:37:10,933
There ya go.

1313
01:37:17,048 --> 01:37:18,896
You know, you're
the only woman

1314
01:37:18,897 --> 01:37:20,745
I've ever met who
looks beautiful chewing.

1315
01:37:26,224 --> 01:37:29,716
Uh, Suzie, l...

1316
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:34,094
Maybe I should wait on the moonlight
and music bit, but, uh...

1317
01:37:34,165 --> 01:37:37,657
I, uh...

1318
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:41,069
Every time I see ya go over those
fences I figure I better hurry.

1319
01:37:41,139 --> 01:37:45,940
But l... -No, no, no, no. Don't stop
me, because I might never get this out.

1320
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:49,343
Suzie...
-Ah! Good luck, senorita.

1321
01:37:49,414 --> 01:37:51,507
Good luck, Mario.
-Senor?

1322
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:53,608
<i>Yeah, yeah.
-Buena suerte.</i>

1323
01:37:53,685 --> 01:37:56,711
<i>Ah, gracias, gracias.</i>

1324
01:37:56,788 --> 01:38:00,087
Suzie?
-Yes?

1325
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:02,592
Suzie...
-Suzie, Mr. Bolton.

1326
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,061
They just posted
tonight's course. It's a monster.

1327
01:38:06,131 --> 01:38:09,965
These first two fences are easy,
but the third one is a...

1328
01:38:10,034 --> 01:38:12,264
I think you better pay
a little attention, young lady.

1329
01:38:12,337 --> 01:38:17,468
Fred, I'm sorry. -No, no, go ahead.
I just came to wish you good luck...

1330
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:19,055
<i>As I say, the
first one is easy.</i>

1331
01:38:19,056 --> 01:38:20,568
Watch going into the
second. -And share dinner.

1332
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:23,671
<i>Don't let him pick up
too much speed.</i>

1333
01:38:23,748 --> 01:38:26,512
<i>Now, as soon as you land,
you take a sharp turn to the right.</i>

1334
01:38:26,584 --> 01:38:28,518
You're gonna need all the impulsion
you can get over this third one.

1335
01:38:28,586 --> 01:38:29,951
Now, the fourth
one... that's pretty

1336
01:38:29,952 --> 01:38:31,316
straight, but you've
still got to watch...

1337
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:34,722
<i>Look at the size of this spread.</i>

1338
01:38:34,793 --> 01:38:36,761
<i>Ever seen a spread
that size before?</i>

1339
01:38:43,468 --> 01:38:45,459
Hey, Freddie!
Just the guy I'm lookin' for!

1340
01:38:45,537 --> 01:38:48,768
Come on, Alex. I wanna get
a shot of you and Dugan right here.

1341
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,774
Well!
-How do you do? How do you do?

1342
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,104
Glad you could make it.

1343
01:38:52,105 --> 01:38:53,367
I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

1344
01:38:53,444 --> 01:38:56,777
You know my wife?
-How do you do, gðo Dugan?

1345
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,112
We're gonna knock 'em
dead tonight.

1346
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:01,118
Aren't we gonna knock 'em
dead tonight?

1347
01:39:01,186 --> 01:39:03,245
We're gonna try to
knock 'em dead tonight.

1348
01:39:03,321 --> 01:39:05,289
I'll see you.
-Yes.

1349
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:09,258
Freddie, where'd you go?
Come here. Freddie!

1350
01:39:11,329 --> 01:39:13,354
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1351
01:39:13,431 --> 01:39:15,865
we have reached
the climax of the

1352
01:39:15,866 --> 01:39:18,300
Washington
International Horse Show.

1353
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:21,668
The next event
will be a jump-off...

1354
01:39:21,739 --> 01:39:24,799
<i>between Aspercel and Rascala.</i>

1355
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:29,245
<i>In this week's competition,
these two finalists...</i>

1356
01:39:29,314 --> 01:39:32,579
<i>have tied in total points.</i>

1357
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:37,019
<i>Thus, the winner of this event will be
the grand champion jumper...</i>

1358
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:40,956
<i>of the Washington
International Horse Show.</i>

1359
01:39:41,025 --> 01:39:45,018
<i>For this event, we have departed from
the standardjumping course...</i>

1360
01:39:45,096 --> 01:39:49,430
<i>by adding the great wall
as a final barrier.</i>

1361
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,731
<i>In case of a tie,
the wall will be raised...</i>

1362
01:39:52,804 --> 01:39:55,967
<i>for a secondjump-off against the clock.
-Excuse me, please.</i>

1363
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,498
<i>In just a moment now,
the open jumper grand championship.</i>

1364
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:04,207
How's Suzie? -Oh, calm as...
Well, this is it, isn't it?

1365
01:40:04,282 --> 01:40:06,944
Certainly is.
-Yep.

1366
01:40:07,018 --> 01:40:10,078
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our finalists have flipped a coin.</i>

1367
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:12,822
<i>And number 320,
Aspercel, ridden by</i>

1368
01:40:12,823 --> 01:40:15,490
<i>Miss Suzie Clemens,
will be first to go.</i>

1369
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:24,648
All right, meatball.
It's a little tougher

1370
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:26,963
than the others,
but you can do it.

1371
01:41:47,285 --> 01:41:51,949
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.</i>

1372
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:55,151
<i>Aspercel, ridden
by Miss Suzie Clemens...</i>

1373
01:41:55,226 --> 01:41:57,751

a perfect score.</i>

1374
01:42:02,233 --> 01:42:07,034
<i><u>Now, our second finalist,
number 744...</u></i>

1375
01:42:07,105 --> 01:42:10,973
<i>Rascala, ridden by
Lieutenant Mario Lorendo.</i>

1376
01:43:00,558 --> 01:43:05,052
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, remember,
there are no penalties for touches.</i>

1377
01:43:05,129 --> 01:43:10,761
<i>Rascala and Lieutenant Mario Lorendo,
a clean round, a perfect score!</i>

1378
01:43:10,835 --> 01:43:16,137
<i>We have another tie. In a few moments,
there will be a secondjump-off.</i>

1379
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,449
Look what they're doing
to the wall.

1380
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:35,288
<i>Now the great wall is being
raised to a height of seven feet.</i>

1381
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:37,486
Nobody's gonna
get over that thing alive.

1382
01:43:37,562 --> 01:43:39,996
Relax, Daddy.
-Relax, relax.

1383
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:43,192
Look who's talkin',
the program twister.

1384
01:43:46,704 --> 01:43:48,638
Stay.

1385
01:43:56,114 --> 01:43:58,082
Good luck,
Senorita Suzie.

1386
01:43:58,149 --> 01:43:59,810
Good luck, Lieutenant Mario.

1387

<i>In this secondjump-off,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1388
01:44:02,887 --> 01:44:06,755

will be the deciding factor...</i>

1389
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:10,089
<i>ifboth horses have
equal faults or clean rounds.</i>

1390
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:12,629
<i>First to go will be Rascala...</i>

1391
01:44:12,697 --> 01:44:14,824

-Whoa.</i>

1392
01:45:06,784 --> 01:45:10,777

-Four faults.

01:45:54,165 --> 01:45:58,158
<i>Now it's against the clock.
-And she still has the wall.</i>

1399
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:19,287
Beautiful!
Clock?

1400
01:46:31,736 --> 01:46:35,399

01:47:55,886 --> 01:48:00,823
You know, you could do a lot worse
than making Fred Bolton a partner.

1411
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:03,086
Hmm?
-Never mind. I'll tell ya later.

1412

<i>Yes, thank you. Thank you.</i>

01:48:43,401 --> 01:48:45,369
Yes, we did rather well
out there.

1420
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:48,098
<i>All right, folks, can we get
a little room here, please?</i>

1421

1430
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:19,467
No, just Lieutenant.
-Yeah, all right.

1431
01:49:19,537 --> 01:49:21,471
All right, come on.
Let's get you over here.

Congratulations, Mr. Bolton.
This must be a very big night for you.

Well, it's, uh... It is. It is.
-Good night, sir.

1439
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,394
Shall I take him
to his stall, Mr. Bolton?

1440
01:49:46,464 --> 01:49:49,490
Uh, no, I'll take him.
I'll take him.

1441
01:49:52,303 --> 01:49:56,933
<i>Come on. Let's get a little
closer there, folks, for a picture.</i>

1442
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:01,273
Come on, Aspie. Let's, uh, open up
some oats and celebrate.

1443

Well, Aspie, you did it.

1446
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:20,758
Won the big event.

1447
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:23,823
Well, saved my job,
the Allied Drug account.

1448
01:50:26,136 --> 01:50:30,163
So how come
I feel so miserable?

1449
01:50:30,241 --> 01:50:32,368
Feel like we won the battle
and lost the war.

1450
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:40,109
<i>So there you are.</i>

1451
01:50:40,184 --> 01:50:43,119
Well, hello there and congratulations.
-And where were you?

1452
01:50:43,187 --> 01:50:46,020
Oh, uh, here, there.
I was, uh...

1453
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:48,490
standing among your admirers,
waiting to congratulate you.

1454
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,527
That's enough.
-Oh, you were, were you?

1455
01:50:50,594 --> 01:50:53,062
Yes, yes, I was there,
but you were, uh, tied up.

1456
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:58,158
I'm sorry, Freddie. Everything happened
so fast. I was looking for you.

1457
01:50:58,235 --> 01:51:01,568
It was no wonder you couldn't see me
with your Mr. Madison...

1458
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:04,267
smothering you with
those victory kisses.

1459
01:51:04,341 --> 01:51:07,276
Oh, Freddie!

1460
01:51:07,344 --> 01:51:11,906
You really are an ever-faithful,
true-blue, cornball type.

1461
01:51:11,982 --> 01:51:15,509
Cornball?
-I'm so happy I could cry.

1462
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:18,146
That was just my way
of thanking Archer.

1463
01:51:18,222 --> 01:51:21,350
Without him, we wouldn't
have won or anything.

1464
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:24,952
Yeah?
-That's all. I promise.

1465
01:51:25,029 --> 01:51:28,465
Now, wasn't there something
terribly important...

1466
01:51:28,532 --> 01:51:31,524
that you wanted
to tell me...

1467
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:34,696
but never got
the chance to?

1468
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,138
Yes, there was.

1469
01:51:37,207 --> 01:51:39,198
Yes, there is.

1470
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,938
Come here.
Come here. Suzie.

1471
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,582
Suzie?
-Mm-hmm.

1472
01:51:46,650 --> 01:51:50,552
<i>I'm gonna talk fast. Suzie, l...
-Suzie! Daddy!</i>

1473
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:52,987
We've been looking
all over for you!

1474
01:51:53,057 --> 01:51:56,356
L... I'll come back later.
-No, no, honey. Honey, come back now.

1475
01:51:56,427 --> 01:51:58,207
And you started
the whole thing,

1476
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,988
so don't give me that
fake surprise bit.

1477
01:52:00,064 --> 01:52:02,191
He finally got around to it.
-Finally.

1478
01:52:02,266 --> 01:52:05,201
Oh! Suzie,
I'm so happy for you.

1479
01:52:05,269 --> 01:52:07,703
Daddy!
When's the wedding?

1480
01:52:07,771 --> 01:52:09,705
The wedding?
-The wedding?

1481
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:13,402
Oh, Daddy. -Well, you made
it a pretty short courtship.

1482
01:52:13,477 --> 01:52:15,411
Does save a lot of dialogue
though, doesn't it?

1483
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:17,276
Hey, Freddie, come on!
Dugan wants pictures

1484
01:52:17,277 --> 01:52:19,074
of everybody with
the soup bowl here.

1485
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:22,175
Get the trophy. Suzie, you hold it.
Let's get you right close to the horse.

1486
01:52:22,252 --> 01:52:25,346
That's it. In closer.
Beautiful. Stay like that.

1487
01:52:25,422 --> 01:52:28,050
Come on. Everybody close
together. Alex, you set now?

1488
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:31,822
<i>Look this way like
a big happy family.</i>
