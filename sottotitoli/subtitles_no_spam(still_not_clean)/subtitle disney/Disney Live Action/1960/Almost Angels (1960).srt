1
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Maybe you can hear the train
entering the station,

2
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
bringing the choirboys home to Vienna
after their four-month tour of America.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
- Hello, Max.
- Oh, good to see you.

4
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
- And you, Herr Director?
- How are the boys? Are they well?

5
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
They are fine, all of them.
Don't they sound like it?

6
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,000
- Welcome back, Max.
- Freddy. Hi, boys.

7
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,400
- Hello, Peter. Had a good time?
- Yes, thanks, sir.

8
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
All ready for school tomorrow, huh?

9
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
Harry, Welcome home.

10
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
- Skip,
- I brought him for you.

11
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Thanks.

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
I wish I could go to America.

13
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
How do you get in the choir?

14
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
You give an audition.

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
What's an audition?

16
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
You sing for the teachers
and Director Eisinger.

17
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
A song, you mean?

18
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Mm. I've got to find my parents.

19
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Hey, I can sing.

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You can?

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Can I join the choir?

22
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Will you be going on another trip soon?

23
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,800
- I guess so.
- Where to?

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
I don't know.
Japan, maybe, or Australia.

25
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,800
- Dad, Mother,
- Peter, darling.

26
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Hello, son.

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Hey, Toni.

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Come on.

29
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,000
A fine thing.
So busy you can't even say hello, huh?

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sorry, Dad. Hello.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dad, have you ever been to Australia?

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Of course not.

33
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Now, listen, Toni,
I've got a big surprise for you.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Guess what?

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
You're going to drive the train
into the shed.

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
How about that, huh?

37
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,800
Mom, they're going
to Japan and Australia next.

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Oh, are they, dear?

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
You always say I sing well, don't you?

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, Toni, you'll be driving a train
like this yourself one day.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
Maybe even bigger. So now's the time
to learn, come on. First lesson.

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Pull that.

43
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Very good. All right, you can sit down.

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Uh, Felix Meinl, please.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,400
Now, Felix, I want you to sing
a C-major scale, all right?

46
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
- Yes, sir.
- Now.

47
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
That's Felix now. Pretty good, eh?

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,200
- Your boy sung yet?
- No.

49
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,400
- Only two vacancies, you know.
- Only two?

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Listen.

51
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
Good.

52
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you hear that?
Clear as a bell.

53
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,600
- How old is your boy?
- He'll be 1 2 in January.

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,200
They like them young, you know.

55
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
Felix isn't ten yet.

56
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,800
I wouldn't worry.
It's the voice that matters.

57
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
It's a nice-looking building, isn't it?

58
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,200
I wish they could live at home, though.

59
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
They look after them well.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
That's Friedel now.

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Your boy?

62
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
He's an orphan.
Sings in the village choir.

63
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm the organist.

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
- He sings well.
- I taught him everything he knows.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
What's he doing?

66
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
That's just what
I told him not to sing.

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,600
I like it. It's fun.

68
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe.
But it won't get him into the choir.

69
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Your boy?

70
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,800
You have a song there,
haven't you?

71
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, then.

72
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
- When did this come?
- Yesterday.

73
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
- Huh?
- Well, you were tired last night.

74
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
Vienna Boys Choir?

75
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Augarten Palace? What's this?

76
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,600
"In connection with the audition
given by Toni Fiala..."

77
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,800
What audition?
Did he give an audition?

78
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
- Yes, he did.
- When?

79
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Last week.

80
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
- He sang beautifully.
- Oh, did he?

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
And may I ask who arranged it?

82
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, I did, of course.

83
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
I wrote to Herr Eisinger,
the director, and he...

84
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Fixed it all up on your own,
without a word to me.

85
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
- Behind my back.
- Well, I had to.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
I knew you'd never let him go.

87
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, did you?
Well, you could've asked me.

88
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
And what would you have said?

89
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
I'd have said no.
What do you think I'd have said?

90
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,600
This all comes of...,

91
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
This all comes
of you playing the piano.

92
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
I should have stopped it years ago.

93
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
What do you mean, stopped it?

94
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
You talk as if music
is something to be ashamed of.

95
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,400
Well, I know what's
good for my son, that's all.

96
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
You know,

97
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't know anything about him.

98
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Toni's my son, too. Don't forget that.

99
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,600
- And it's me he takes after, not you.
- Oh, does he?

100
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Yes, he does.
Toni was born to sing.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He has real talent,
and I want him to develop it.

102
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
And I want him to go to a proper school
and learn a proper trade.

103
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,400
And that is what he's going to do,

104
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,600
But this is a proper
school. Don't you understand that?

105
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
He'll get a good education,
besides singing in the choir.

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Until his voice breaks.
They'll throw him out.

107
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
No, they wouldn't.
He could stay.

108
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
And how am I supposed
to pay for all this?

109
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
You don't pay.
It won't cost you anything.

110
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,400
- Herr Eisinger told me.
- Don't believe it.

111
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Where do they get the money
to run the place?

112
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
From their concerts.

113
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
All over the world people go
to hear the Vienna Boys Choir.

114
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Toni could travel, see other countries.

115
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, he's not going.

116
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Music, singing. Standing up
on a platform in a sailor suit.

117
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
I won't have it.

118
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh, why can't I make you understand?

119
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Toni loves music.
It means something to him.

120
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
He's different from other boys.

121
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
- I don't want him to be different.
- Well, I do.

122
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
One day, he'll be famous.

123
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Composing maybe,
or playing in a great orchestra, like...

124
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Like your brother
with his trumpet.

125
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,200
A dance band in Prater Park on
Saturdays and Sundays, if he's lucky.

126
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Well, that's not
going to happen to Toni.

127
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Dad, please.

128
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm late for work.

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But, Dad,

130
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
To be a Vienna choirboy...

131
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Dad,

132
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,000
There were eight boys there,
and they only wanted two.

133
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
And they chose me.

134
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Well, now they can
choose somebody else.

135
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,000
Dad, please, you've got to let me go.

136
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Toni, come on up.
We'll talk about it some more tonight.

137
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
If you think I'll change my mind,
you're wrong.

138
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Come on.

139
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
So if you'll get
the parts together, Joseph?

140
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
- I can go to the library now.
- All right.

141
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
- You are Toni, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

142
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Here's Director Eisinger.
This is Toni Fiala, sir.

143
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, yes, of course.
Good morning, Frau Fiala.

144
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
- Good morning, Herr Eisinger.
- Toni.

145
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
- This is my husband.
- How do you do, sir?

146
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
- Your first visit, of course.
- Yes, it is.

147
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
He's quite happy now,
about Toni's coming here.

148
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Good. I'm sure you won't regret it.

149
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
He'll be in the choir
under Herr Heller here.

150
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How about his ordinary lessons?

151
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
You don't have to worry
about that, Herr Fiala.

152
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,600
- We have first-class teachers.
- He's had proper schooling up to now.

153
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure he has.

154
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,200
You understand, of course,
he'll be on probation for a month

155
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,400
before we accept him
as a permanent choirboy.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,400
If he works hard at his music,
shows promise, then he stays.

157
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,800
He'll work hard. Won't you, Toni?

158
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,600
And if he's no good,
you throw him out?

159
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, that goes for me, too.

160
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,200
If he doesn't get on with his schooling,
I'll pull him out.

161
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
- Now you remember that, Toni.
- Yes, Dad.

162
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Uh, Peter? Peter.

163
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is Toni Fiala.
He'll be in your choir.

164
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

165
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Will you look after him
till he knows his way around?

166
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

167
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Goodbye, dear.

168
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Work hard.

169
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Bye, Dad.

170
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
Bye, son.

171
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I'll show you
where to put your things.

172
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
That's all right.
But listen as you play.

173
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Train your ear
as well as your fingers.

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes, sir.

175
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
A good ear will
help you sing well, too.

176
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
It was you
in the eighth bar, wasn't it?

177
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Yes, sir. I sang a B natural.

178
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,600
That's right.
Sing the bar again, please.

179
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
That's it.

180
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,400
Now, there was something wrong
in bar three.

181
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,400
Let me hear it from the start again.

182
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Well?

183
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Put your hand up.

184
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Put it up.

185
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
I thought it was you, Toni.

186
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Know what was wrong?

187
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
I think I sang D sharp
instead of E.

188
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm sure you did. All right.

189
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,200
But always put your hand up at once
if you know you've made a mistake.

190
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
Don't wait for me to spot it.

191
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,800
I want you to know
you're wrong yourself.

192
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

193
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Good. And now,
come out in front, all of you.

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,800
But no, no, no, leave your music.

195
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Let's see how you manage
when you're all together.

196
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
Come on, come on. Come, come.

197
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Right?

198
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,600
Now then, group one, on the upbeat.

199
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
And hit that first note
good and firm.

200
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
Group two,
you come in on bar five, all right?

201
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
No, no, no. Those top notes.

202
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Not through the nose.

203
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Take a breath, deep,
down here, like this.

204
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
And then sing out through your mouth,
good and full, right?

205
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
Take it from the beginning.

206
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,000
You should be outside.
It'll be dark soon.

207
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,600
Yes, sir.

208
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Arithmetic?

209
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
- Do you enjoy reading this?
- No, sir.

210
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
What are you trying to do?
Get ahead of the others?

211
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Oh, no, sir.
They're all better than me.

212
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,400
And my father says,
if I don't do well in class...

213
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
Come along.

214
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
Naturally, your father wants you
to do well with your schoolwork.

215
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,400
- He'll take me away if I don't.
- I know.

216
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,200
- Are you working hard?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Peter Schaefer says,
I just don't work fast enough.

218
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
But then, he's so smart.

219
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,800
Peter is very fortunate.

220
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,400
He's got a quick, clear mind,
and a wonderful feeling for music.

221
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you think
he'll be famous some day?

222
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Well, he's a very gifted boy.

223
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
He can even compose music.
Did you know that?

224
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
And to be able
to do arithmetic, too...

225
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Cheer up, Toni.
Know who that is?

226
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's Franz Schubert, isn't it?

227
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,800
- He was a Vienna choirboy.
- Was he?

228
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Has the choir been going on
as long as that?

229
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
Much longer. Nearly 500 years.

230
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Schubert was a choirboy in 1 808.

231
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Well, not so very long ago, really.

232
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,600
And do you know something, Toni?

233
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,200
He wasn't any good
at arithmetic, either.

234
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
He only wanted to sing and write music.

235
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
Know this?

236
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,800
Schubert wrote this
while he was still a choirboy.

237
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
- He did?
- And plenty more.

238
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Music seemed to pour out of him.

239
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
He just couldn't write it down
fast enough.

240
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
And then, one day,

241
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,200
his father came to the school
and looked at his school record.

242
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
It was terrible.

243
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,200
He told the director
he was taking his son away.

244
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
- And did he?
- No.

245
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,400
The director persuaded him
to give Franz another chance,

246
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,200
and so he stayed.

247
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,400
Do you think the director
could persuade my father?

248
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Maybe your grades will improve.

249
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
Do you know this?

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes, sir.
That's Schubert's The Linden Tree.

251
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
Hello, Peter.

252
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,400
This is one of your favorites.
Come and join in. It'll help Toni.

253
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
You sing the alto line, Peter.

254
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
I've always sung the lead.

255
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
It's a little high for you now.
Try the alto this time.

256
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,000
Good. You sing well together.

257
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,800
When you're a famous conductor,
don't leave Schubert out, Peter.

258
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
You know what he meant.

259
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
There's still some light.

260
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Peter, take Toni out for some
fresh air before bedtime, hm?

261
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes, sir.

262
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
But why do you blame me?
He asked me to sing.

263
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
That's my song. I've always sung it.

264
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Herr Heller said
we sing well together.

265
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Look, I'm the leader in this choir.
I will be for a year yet.

266
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
And I'm not singing any duets
with any new kid.

267
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Hey, over here,

268
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Hey, leave that alone.

269
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Is it yours?

270
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Yes. My dad gave it to me
last Christmas.

271
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,000
It's got two wavebands,
seven transistors.

272
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Boy, I never saw one
like this before.

273
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
- How do you turn it on?
- No, don't.

274
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A radio?
You're not supposed to have it here.

275
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,400
It's mine, Peter. I'm taking it home
with me this weekend.

276
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Anyway, I wasn't playing it.

277
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Come on, Peter, let's have some music.

278
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,800
- It's against the rules.
- There's nobody around.

279
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,800
No, don't do it.
We'll get into trouble.

280
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,800
You'll get into trouble.
It's your radio.

281
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
Give me that,

282
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Try and get it.

283
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Watch it,

284
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Hey, Toni.

285
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
You're wanted in the director's office.

286
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,000
What for?

287
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Can't you guess?

288
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Come on, hurry up.

289
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
It wasn't only me.

290
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
You're the one who got caught.

291
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,400
Go on.

292
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Do you think he'll tell?

293
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
How do I know?

294
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
Come in.

295
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, Toni, you've completed
your period of probation.

296
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Herr Heller came in to see me,
and we had a long talk about you.

297
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,400
I've studied your report card.
Your grades are not too good.

298
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,200
Although, your teachers assure me
that you are determined to improve.

299
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
And so...

300
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,400
...we have decided to accept you
as a Vienna choirboy.

301
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Well?

302
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,000
- You mean I can stay?
- We want you to stay.

303
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Hey,

304
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,600
Peter, I can stay,
Herr Eisinger told me I can stay.

305
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
What about last night?
Did you talk?

306
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,000
He didn't even ask me.
Herr Heller was there too.

307
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm sure he hadn't said anything.

308
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
That's 'cause it was you.

309
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
Anyway, I'm really in the choir now.

310
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,400
And we're giving a concert in two weeks
at the children's hospital,

311
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
and Herr Heller says
I'm going to sing a solo.

312
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
- For eight bars?
- No, a whole song.

313
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,600
And we're all going
to dress up for it.

314
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
It's called The Postman.
Do you know it?

315
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Yeah. Yeah, I know it.

316
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
I've got to find Friedel
and tell him I'm staying.

317
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,000
You know the cue
for you and Peter to come in?

318
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,600
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

319
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
I've never sung
to an audience before.

320
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,000
Not a solo.

321
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, get into it.

322
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,000
- lt feels too big.
- lt is too big. It was made for me.

323
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I always sang The Postman song.

324
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm sorry, Peter.
It was Herr Heller's idea.

325
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Maybe you won't sing it.

326
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Maybe you'll miss your entrance cue.

327
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
Heller wouldn't like that, would he?

328
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Peter,

329
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,000
Peter, let me out,

330
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Unlock the door. Please, Peter.

331
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,400
Ferdy, go and see
what's keeping Toni and Peter.

332
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Yes, sir.

333
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Where's Toni?

334
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
- I've locked him in.
- What?

335
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
Just to scare him.

336
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,000
Peter, Please open the door,

337
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Don't worry,
I'll let him out in time.

338
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Our mail is on its way

339
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Go on, Peter, let him out now.
It's his first solo.

340
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
All right.

341
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
OK, Toni...

342
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Look.

343
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,400
His back is bent beneath the load

344
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,000
The letters, we're awaiting

345
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,600
The news, anticipating

346
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,600
My goodness, we all feel the same

347
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,600
It's time the postman came

348
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,800
Again.

349
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,800
It's time the mailman came

350
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Our watches say the same

351
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,800
The letters, we are awaiting

352
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,800
The news, anticipating

353
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,600
My goodness, we all feel the same

354
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,400
It's time the postman came

355
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Here's mail for one and all

356
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Now answer to my call

357
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
For you, a letter

358
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,200
And, for thee
a package from across the sea

359
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
The parcels, fascinating

360
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,400
And letters here are waiting

361
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,600
So gather round and you shall see

362
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,600
Here's mail for one and all

363
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
So gather round and we shall see

364
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
There's mail for one and all

365
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
- Toni.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I want to talk to you
about your entrance today.

367
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
Don't you think it was
a little bit foolish of you?

368
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Peter.

369
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,600
That stunt of young Toni's,
spectacular, but a little dangerous.

370
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
Did you know about it?

371
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Yes, sir.

372
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,200
Of course, he swore you didn't.

373
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
He said he thought it up
all by himself.

374
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,200
But he might have fallen, you know.

375
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm sorry, sir. It was my fault.

376
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,800
Well, maybe.

377
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,600
I don't expect you to be
a flock of angels,

378
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
even though you sing like them.

379
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But you are the eldest, Peter.

380
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,000
All right.

381
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
Anyway, his solo was good, wasn't it?

382
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Yes, it was.

383
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Take a little interest in him
and help him along, if you can.

384
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
Good.

385
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
Why are you learning that?

386
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm supposed to sing it
at High Mass, Sunday.

387
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,600
But it's so hard.
I'm not really good enough.

388
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,200
Who says so?

389
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Come on.

390
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,200
So, it was all your own idea, was it?

391
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
What?

392
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh, climbing in through the window.

393
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes. 'Course it was.

394
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,200
Come on, sing.

395
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,600
No. No, no, no.
You're taking it too slow.

396
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,800
Sorry.

397
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
Again, from here.

398
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
Stop fidgeting.

399
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,200
Why don't they
give us cushions to sit on?

400
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,400
Be quiet.
Remember where you are.

401
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,000
I know that all right.

402
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
How much longer?

403
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,400
He sings again, doesn't he?

404
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
I think so.

405
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
- Toni.
- Yes?

406
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,200
- Where's Peter? Have you seen him?
- No, I haven't.

407
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,000
He hasn't eaten his lunch yet.

408
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,800
Go and look for him,
will you, please?

409
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,600
- OK, I will.
- Hey, wait for me.

410
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,400
Might have been Heller himself.

411
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,200
- Best orchestra I ever heard.
- Especially the strings.

412
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,200
No, Give it back,
it's none of your business.

413
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It's a song. Words and all.
Is it yours, Peter?

414
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,800
Let me see.

415
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,200
Come on, boys, let's sing it.

416
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,600
OK.

417
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
- You'd only laugh.
- Why should we?

418
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
Come on, Peter, you conduct.

419
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,200
Go on, Peter.

420
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah, give us the note.

421
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,600
All right...

422
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,600
...but if you laugh...

423
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,200
...I'll murder the bunch of you.

424
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
All right, here's the note.

425
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,600
Now.

426
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,400
Oh, once upon a time

427
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,600
There lived a hen, and every day

428
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,400
As hens will do, an egg she'd lay

429
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,400
And thought she was sublime

430
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,400
And nearby was a stream

431
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,200
And in the stream there lived a trout

432
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,200
Who very calmly swam about

433
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,000
And listened to her scream

434
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,400
The trout said to the hen

435
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,800
Why such a fuss for just one, dear?

436
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,200
I lay a million eggs a year

437
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,000
And never flip a fin

438
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Nor end up in a tin

439
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,200
Never mind, let's do it again.

440
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,400
He's frowning terribly, Mom.

441
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,800
Aw, don't you worry, dear.

442
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,400
I'll deal with him. Come on.

443
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,600
Hello, Dad.
It's not very good, is it?

444
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,400
It's not good at all.

445
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,400
But look, dear,
just because they say his...

446
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,800
What is that you were playing?

447
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,200
That? Oh, it's Mozart.

448
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,800
Do you have a lesson every day?

449
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,600
- Most days.
- Besides your singing?

450
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,000
We sing every day, of course.

451
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,800
Will you take that...
thing on the tour with you?

452
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
I suppose so, if I go on the tour.

453
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
What do you mean?
You are going, aren't you?

454
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,600
I don't know.
They might not let me, because of that.

455
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,000
You mean because
your arithmetic's not so good,

456
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
they'll stop you
from going on the tour?

457
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
That's a fine thing, isn't it?

458
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Well, I won't have it.

459
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,200
But you always said
if his schoolwork wasn't good, you...

460
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,800
Never mind what I said.

461
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,600
The boy's a musician,
any fool can see that.

462
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,400
And I'm not having them
spoil his chances

463
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,000
for the sake of a lot of figures.

464
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Dad, you mean it?

465
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
You leave it to me, son.
I'll talk to that director of yours.

466
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,600
Come on, now.

467
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Let's hear some more music.

468
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,400
Arithmetic,

469
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,600
No, no, no, not that.

470
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,800
Sing.

471
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,000
But, Herr Fiala,
when Toni first came here,

472
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,600
it was you who insisted
it was his schooling that mattered.

473
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
A man can change his mind, can't he?

474
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,000
But in three or four years' time,
when his voice breaks...

475
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,800
Arithmetic, who cares
if he's not so good at it?

476
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,800
He's not going to be a bank clerk
or a lawyer or a bookkeeper, is he?

477
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,600
Possibly not.

478
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Let me tell you, that boy's got talent.

479
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,200
And if you can't see it, I can.

480
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,600
I'm sorry, Herr Eisinger.

481
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,200
I'm afraid my husband
is rather outspoken.

482
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,600
I know my own mind, that's all.

483
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,400
But you understand, don't you, that
the final decision must rest with me?

484
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
All the other boys are going,
aren't they?

485
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,200
As it happens, yes.

486
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,400
Their schoolwork was satisfactory.

487
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,000
And Toni's wasn't? All right, then.

488
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,400
But I want him to go on that tour,
and that's final,

489
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,600
Your husband may not be a musician,

490
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,000
but he knows
how to change his tune, doesn't he?

491
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,600
Alas, my love

492
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,000
You do me wrong

493
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,000
To cast me off discourteously

494
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:58,200
And I have loved you so long

495
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Delighting in

496
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,800
Your company

497
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Greensleeves

498
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,800
Was all my joy

499
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,400
Greensleeves

500
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:26,000
Was my delight

501
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,400
Greensleeves

502
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,200
Was my heart of gold

503
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,600
And who but my Lady

504
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,400
Greensleeves

505
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,400
Very nice, fellows.

506
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,200
But you haven't told us yet
where we're going on tour this year.

507
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,800
- You must tell us now.
- Please, sir.

508
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,400
All right, all right.

509
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,000
We're going to lndia,

510
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Japan and Australia.

511
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,800
I told you it was gonna be Australia,

512
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,600
I'm gonna buy a boomerang.

513
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
And now about the Strauss opera.

514
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,000
I've picked the cast
and the director has approved it.

515
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Peter, this time
you'll play Kipfel the baker.

516
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
It's within your range and not too high.

517
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,400
Yes, sir.

518
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Uh, Friedel,

519
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,400
you'll be Mitzi,
the baker's daughter, all right?

520
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,800
Yes, sir.
Who's going to be my boyfriend?

521
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,600
Franz...

522
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Let's see, now...

523
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Oh, yes. That'll be you, Toni.

524
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,800
Joseph, you'll play the dandy.

525
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,200
Ferdy, you are the policeman.

526
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,800
And, Gerhard, you'll be
the captain of the guard.

527
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,200
Yes, sir.

528
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,400
Hey,

529
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,400
They should be turned up,
shouldn't they?

530
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,000
Don't take them off, I'll pin them.

531
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Come here, Friedel.

532
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,600
Stand still, will you?

533
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,600
That's right.

534
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,600
Oh, Mitzi, will you marry me?

535
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,200
Isn't she sweet?

536
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,000
May I see you home?

537
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,200
Has it really broken, Peter?

538
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,600
Maybe it's just the top notes.

539
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,000
You could fake them.

540
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,400
No.

541
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,600
It's gone.

542
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
What are you going to do?

543
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,600
You know the part.

544
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,400
Here.

545
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey, Toni,

546
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,800
What's the matter?

547
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,600
It's... It's Peter.
His voice is gone.

548
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,600
- Gone?
- lt's broken. He can't sing anymore.

549
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,800
- Not at all?
- I heard it. Just now.

550
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,800
But if he can't sing...

551
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,400
He said I'd have to play for him.
I know the part.

552
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,000
Where is Peter?

553
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
He ran out. What should we do?

554
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,600
Nothing yet. And don't tell anyone.

555
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,200
How many vacancies
are there this time?

556
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Only two, I think.

557
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,000
Three.

558
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,200
Hey, Joseph. Have you seen Peter?

559
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,400
Peter? No, I haven't.

560
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,200
Peter.

561
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,600
Bet I can beat you to the top.

562
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,200
Bet you can't.

563
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,600
Come on, then.

564
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,000
Go.

565
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,400
What's the matter?

566
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,600
Didn't eat your spinach today?

567
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm sorry, Peter.

568
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,800
- What for?
- Ferdy told me.

569
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

570
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,400
I heard it, too, just now.

571
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,200
Oh, well.

572
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,200
That happens to all of us
sooner or later.

573
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,200
Are you sure it's gone?

574
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm not a choirboy anymore.

575
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,000
That's not everything.

576
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,600
I'll have more time for composing,
learning to conduct.

577
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I'll go to the conservatory.

578
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,200
But, Peter, what about the tour?
You won't be able to go.

579
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,400
Maybe it's just a cold.
Maybe it'll be back tomorrow.

580
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,600
Peter, where are you going?

581
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,600
You can't see Herr Heller,
he's gone downtown.

582
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,400
I'll see him when he comes back, then.

583
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,800
Don't tell him, Peter.
Please don't tell him.

584
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Why not?
I can't sing anymore.

585
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,200
I know, but maybe there's a way.

586
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,800
Anyway, don't tell him yet.
Please, Peter.

587
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,600
I've got to tell him.

588
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,200
We'll think of something.

589
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,600
With the dress rehearsal tomorrow?

590
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,400
Why don't you grow up?

591
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,800
Hello, Peter.

592
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,000
Have you come to lend us a hand?

593
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,000
Sir, I wanted to talk to you.

594
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,400
Right. Won't be a minute.
Hey, catch this cable.

595
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,000
Is it something urgent?

596
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,800
Well...

597
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,200
Now, plug it into the wall, over there.

598
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,200
He'll never get away with it.
They'll notice.

599
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,200
Not if we work it right.

600
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,800
He'll just have to keep his mouth shut
until we leave, that's all.

601
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,200
That'll take some doing.

602
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Not if we all help him.

603
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,800
He won't let us. He'll tell Heller.

604
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,400
That's why we've got to hurry.

605
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
It's worth it, isn't it?
To have him on the tour with us.

606
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,800
They'll send him back
as soon as they find out.

607
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,200
All the way from lndia?

608
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
What will he do, then? He can't sing.

609
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,800
He can help Herr Heller, look after
the music, that sort of thing.

610
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,400
What about tomorrow, though?
The dress rehearsal?

611
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,600
He has to sing a solo.
That's sure to give him away.

612
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,800
Ferdy's gonna sing for him.

613
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,000
What?

614
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,000
- Shh,
- How?

615
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,400
I've thought it all out.
There's a way.

616
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,400
Sir, I just wanted to...

617
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,000
It won't take a minute,
then I'll be down.

618
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,200
Yes, sir.

619
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,000
So, that'll do it.

620
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,800
Come and have a look at it
from out front.

621
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,400
Can I say something, please, sir? I...

622
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,400
Max?

623
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,000
I'd like to check
all the concert dates with you.

624
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,600
- Right now?
- ln my office. Do you mind?

625
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,200
- Of course not.
- Please, sir...

626
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,000
Stay and help them here, Peter.
I'll be right back.

627
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,200
Yes, sir.

628
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Oh, Peter,

629
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,600
I was looking at the song you wrote.
It's very promising.

630
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,000
Thank you, sir.

631
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,800
Why not put it in as an encore
now and then, Max?

632
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,200
I'd like to. How about it, Peter?

633
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,400
That'd be wonderful, sir.

634
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,200
- Good.
- Come along then, Max.

635
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Hey, hey, what's this?

636
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,400
We just wanted to look
at the stage, sir.

637
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,600
All right, but don't get in the way.

638
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,400
Hey, Peter,

639
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,400
- We've got to talk to you.
- What about?

640
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,400
Up in the attic. Come on.

641
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,400
Hey.

642
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,600
You're doing great, Peter.
I'm sure they'll think it's you singing.

643
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,000
I'll never keep it up.

644
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,200
Yes, you will. You're doing fine.

645
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
Is something wrong?

646
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,000
- I'm sorry, Peter.
- Oh, go away.

647
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,800
I was trying to help you.

648
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:50,400
And I ended up making a fool of myself,
in front of everybody.

649
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,000
But, if you'd only kept it up...

650
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,600
How could I? He knew, Heller knew,

651
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,400
I'll take the blame. I'll tell him.

652
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,800
Oh, go away. Get out, will you?

653
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,400
Hello, Toni.

654
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,200
It was my idea.
Peter had nothing to do with it.

655
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,400
I talked the others into it
so he wouldn't miss the tour.

656
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,600
I know.

657
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Why didn't you tell me
about your voice?

658
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,000
We've both known it was going
for some time, haven't we?

659
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,600
It was just bad luck
it should happen now,

660
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,000
but you should have told me.

661
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,000
I tried to yesterday
when you were fixing the lights.

662
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,400
Then Herr Eisinger came in
and talked about my song.

663
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,400
I see. That did make it tough for you.

664
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,400
It's not my voice that matters.
That happens to all of us.

665
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It was being left behind, just when...

666
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,600
Just when what, Peter?

667
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:26,400
I'd planned to start writing on
the tour. Really work at composition.

668
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,400
- You could do that here.
- I know, but...

669
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
But what?

670
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,200
I wanted you to help me. You...
You understand.

671
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And you know what I'm getting at.

672
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,400
Well, maybe when I come back.

673
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,000
Try to see it straight, Peter.

674
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,200
This isn't the end for you,
it's the beginning.

675
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,600
It's fun being a kid, but...

676
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,800
Well, till now
you've only been rehearsing.

677
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,200
See what I mean?

678
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:09,000
Anyway, we'll talk about it
some more tomorrow.

679
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,000
Naturally, it's a shame
that this should happen now.

680
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,000
But, for Peter,
there are compensations.

681
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,600
He'll still live here,
he'll work at the music conservatory.

682
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,800
He is talented, no doubt about that.

683
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,400
There's a great promise there,
as Max says.

684
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,600
Which is why I think he deserves
special consideration.

685
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,000
And that's not favoritism.
It's simply doing our job,

686
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,800
to encourage outstanding talent
when we find it.

687
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,400
I agree with that, of course.

688
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,200
He's still only a boy, don't forget.

689
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,800
He's not sure of himself yet.

690
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,400
He's a little scared of growing up.

691
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,800
So, just for a while,
he still needs other boys around him,

692
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,800
the boys he's worked and played with
for the past four years.

693
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,200
And that's why I say
he should come on this tour.

694
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
But, Max, we simply can't afford it.

695
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,800
Not as a passenger.
I'm not suggesting that.

696
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,800
- As what, then?
- As my assistant.

697
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,000
Let him be deputy conductor.

698
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,400
Well, that's certainly
a revolutionary idea.

699
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,800
He could do it.

700
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,000
His knowledge and understanding
are remarkable for his age.

701
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,600
And his technique's not bad at all.

702
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,400
The choir conducted
by one of the boys themselves?

703
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,400
That might be quite effective.
But would it be good?

704
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,800
It could be.
He wants to conduct and I'd coach him.

705
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,400
And it'd give him the belief in himself
he needs so badly at this moment.

706
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,400
Well, gentlemen,

707
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,800
what's our decision going to be?
