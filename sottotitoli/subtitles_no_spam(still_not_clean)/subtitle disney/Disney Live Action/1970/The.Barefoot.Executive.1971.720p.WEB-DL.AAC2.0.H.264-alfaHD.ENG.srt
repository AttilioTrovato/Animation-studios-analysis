1
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:26,518
He's gonna make it right to the top.

2
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:30,493
That crazy movin' groovin' kid
who just won't stop.

3
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:34,794
He's gonna rearrange
the good ol' status quo.

4
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,629
And get it all together.

5
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:39,932
With the things he's got to know.

6
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:44,439
He's gonna make it He's gonna make it.

7
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:48,240
He's gonna take this
cockeyed world and shake it.

8
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:52,613
He's gonna show them
he's a winner in the end.

9
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,447
With a little bit of luck.

10
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:58,750
And a little bitty barefoot friend.

11
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,462
When they start rappin'
that he's too young.

12
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:11,559
He makes his mind up
that he'll wind up number one.

13
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:15,663
And the whole wide world
will know that he's around.

14
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,201
Though other cats get uptight
and try to put him down.

15
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:25,181
He's gonna make it He's gonna make it.

16
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,118
He's gonna take this
cockeyed world and shake it.

17
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:33,351
He's gonna show them
he's a winner in the end.

18
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:35,325
With a little bit of luck.

19
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:39,424
And a little bitty barefoot friend.

20
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:38,517
When they start rappin'
that he's too young.

21
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,890
He makes his mind up
that he'll wind up number one.

22
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,863
And the whole wide world
will know that he's around.

23
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:51,459
Though other cats get uptight
and try to put him down.

24
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,201
He's gonna make it He's gonna make it.

25
00:02:56,274 --> 00:03:00,233
He's gonna take this
cockeyed world and shake it.

26
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:04,145
He's gonna show them
he's a winner in the end.

27
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,183
With a little bit of luck.

28
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,481
And a little bitty barefoot friend.

29
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:20,658
- He's gonna make it.
- Little bitty barefoot friend.

30
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:24,259
- He's gonna make it.
- Little bitty barefoot friend.

31
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:28,203
- He's gonna make it.
- Little bitty barefoot friend.

32
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:33,040
- He's gonna make it.
- Little bitty barefoot friend.

33
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:35,739
Little bitty barefoot friend.

34
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,638
Hi, Mark.

35
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,178
Come on, Jen.
It's almost over.

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,583
I'll be there in a minute.
I told Steve I'd wait for him.

37
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:18,781
I suppose he's at that
crummy night school again.

38
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,291
Roger, everyone can't be a Stanford man.

39
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,088
Unfortunately.

40
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:26,494
But he drives everyone nuts.
Especially Uncle.

41
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:28,657
Well, he won't bother him tonight.

42
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,828
Anyone who graduates

43
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:33,803
from the Moonrise Night School
on Melrose Avenue

44
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,432
is certainly not gonna
make it at the network.

45
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,907
- Hi, Rog.
- Steve, it's about time.

46
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:42,572
Yeah. We had this guest lecturer.
This guy had a great idea about a story

47
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,207
on Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog.
It was a great idea.

48
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,615
- Don't mention it tonight.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:50,176
- Hey, how's the show going?
- Not very well.

50
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,746
- I haven't heard any laughs.
- I'm not surprised.

51
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:55,554
I saw it, it's a bomb.
If Wilbanks'd just listen to me.

52
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,686
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

53
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,423
Who's saying anything?

54
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,003
Thank you. Thank you.
How'd you like...? What did you...?

55
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:10,837
Did you...?
Harry, what did you think?

56
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,969
Regardless of my personal
feelings, Mr. Wilbanks,

57
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,377
I think this show will have
a very good rating.

58
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:20,506
What do you mean, "regardless
of your personal feelings"?

59
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:24,646
Well, I... I just don't happen
to like TV very much, that's all.

60
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,655
He doesn't like TV.
He's the morning program director.

61
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:31,160
- Steve, please be quiet.
- Charming.

62
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,697
I mean, simply charming.

63
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,232
- Loved it.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,463
- Some of them liked it.
- Jen, telephone.

65
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,197
Of course they seemed to like it.

66
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,671
He's vice president
in charge of programming.

67
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,834
Can you imagine what he'd do
if someone didn't seem to like it?

68
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,368
Yes, operator. Mr. Wilbanks,
international calling.

69
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,245
- It's Farnsworth.
- Farnsworth. That vulture.

70
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:55,377
- Now, really, he isn't that bad.
- Yes, he is. I know that man.

71
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:59,116
Every time he thinks I'm in trouble,
he calls me up and congratulates me.

72
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,956
I tell you, he does it every time.
Hello, Farnsworth.

73
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,622
What a show, Francis.
What a show.

74
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:11,601
- Thank you, Farnsworth.
- It was so, so... different.

75
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,298
- Different?
- Yes, absolutely.

76
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,841
Incidentally, Clifford dropped by.

77
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:22,005
He sends regards from his
entire staff at Continental.

78
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,982
- Hiya, Francis.
- Hello, Clifford.

79
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,245
Well, I'm glad you liked it, Farnsworth,

80
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,514
because, you see,
what I was trying to do...

81
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:32,783
We'll have lunch and talk about it.

82
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,849
Well, good night, Francis,
you old scoundrel.

83
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,919
You've done it again.

84
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:45,633
Well, I know I'm in trouble.
They both congratulated me.

85
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:49,070
Well, don't worry. It's what
our big brass thinks that counts.

86
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,368
But what do they think?

87
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,875
There hasn't been a word
from New York. Roger!

88
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,912
- Yes, sir?
- Don't sneak up on me.

89
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,469
Get me New York.

90
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:59,374
They're lolling around there
in the lap of luxury.

91
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,884
We put on a new show.
The president of the network

92
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,217
doesn't call and tell me
what he thinks of it.

93
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:07,280
- Hi-line, Crampton, New York.
- Good boy. He gets right...

94
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:10,225
- What did you think of it?
- Well, the...

95
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:12,319
- The audience liked it.
- Yes, they did.

96
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,796
But I'm still worried.

97
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,959
Uncle Francis, I think you
always over-worry our first show.

98
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,263
Is that what you think?

99
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,531
Well, let's hope
that's the case this time.

100
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:23,233
Yes, sir, here he is.

101
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,867
Hello, chief!
How'd you like the show?

102
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,878
Just fine, Wilbanks. Fine!

103
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,675
Is there somebody there with you?

104
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:33,444
Our sponsors are here.
They watched the show with me.

105
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:37,614
The sponsors are there. Well,
what did they think of the show?

106
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:40,589
They thought it was fine too, just fine.

107
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:44,059
- How'd the showing go out there?
- Fine, just fine.

108
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,120
Several people laughed so hard
they fell off their chairs.

109
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,395
In fact, some of them
are still applauding.

110
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,337
Well, the ratings
will be out in the morning.

111
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:01,139
- They'll tell us the story, Francis.
- Yes, they certainly will.

112
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:05,274
- Good night, Francis.
- Good night, chief.

113
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,415
Cut!

114
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,545
Not now, for heaven's sakes.

115
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,886
Ratings. That's all
they think about are ratings.

116
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,792
We get great audience response.
You heard them clapping yourself.

117
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,887
And they're worried about the ratings.

118
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:22,432
It's enough to give a man
nervous prostration.

119
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,230
You look a little pale.
Maybe I should get your pills.

120
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,271
Yes, I feel a little pale.
Get my pills.

121
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,136
Love that casting, Francis.
Love that casting!

122
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,575
Yeah, wasn't it good? The fellow
with the hat? Didn't you like him?

123
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:36,442
Jen, what'd you think of the show?

124
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,982
Well, I thought it had
certain possibilities.

125
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,574
Did you? I'm glad to hear...

126
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:45,782
- I thought next time, you could...
- Post! Not tonight!

127
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,093
He never listens.
He'll never listen!

128
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:51,753
Steve, did you slip him a note?

129
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,957
Jen, all he needs
is one good program idea.

130
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,693
Steve!

131
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,676
Mertons, will you stop blowing
that infernal horn?

132
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,314
- Wanted you to know I was here.
- I know you're here.

133
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,190
The neighborhood knows. You'd
think you were picking up your date.

134
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:26,253
And will you stop with the dusting?
I'm in a hurry today!

135
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,729
Yes, boss.

136
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,906
Charlie, get off your bicycle,
and put that paper on the porch.

137
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,842
I'm just sick and tired of digging it
out of the bushes every day.

138
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,410
Careless, incompetent kids,

139
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,647
grow up that way,
then come to the networks.

140
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,712
No wonder we're having these problems.

141
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,384
Say, boss, would you ask Wilma
to move her car?

142
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,450
No, Wilma can't move her car!

143
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,587
You've got a reverse gear in this thing.

144
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,461
Yeah.

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,763
Hey, my bike!

146
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,879
- My bike! My brand-new bike!
- Now look what you've done.

147
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,041
Yeah, careless, incompetent kids?

148
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:22,381
Not him. You!
Well, don't worry about the bike...

149
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:23,943
But the papers.

150
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,989
If I don't deliver them,

151
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,855
I won't win that trip to Catalina.

152
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,595
I've been working all year
on that trip to Catalina.

153
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:36,224
Well, he's been working
all year on the...

154
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,235
Put the darn papers in the car!

155
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:44,263
How I ever let myself get saddled with
my wife's relatives, I'll never know.

156
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,584
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi, Jen.

157
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,651
I, got something here for Wilbanks.

158
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,631
Steve, you're supposed to
deliver the mail, not read it.

159
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,860
- It doesn't hurt anything.
- Keep moving.

160
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,062
Mr. Wilbanks should be here
any second.

161
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:16,072
You know how upset he gets
when he sees you hanging around.

162
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,437
He's not in yet?

163
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:19,999
I can't say I blame him
after that show last night.

164
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,773
Steve, please just forget
about last night's show.

165
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:26,715
Okay. I've seen disasters in my time,
but that one really takes the cake.

166
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,383
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

167
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,285
- Did you happen to get my note?
- Yes.

168
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:35,450
Every time I put my hand
in my pocket, I got your note.

169
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:39,519
Now you listen to me, Steven. I'm not
interested in your theories on ratings.

170
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,395
And I'm certainly not interested
in doing a show called

171
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,129
Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog,
whatever that is.

172
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,197
What is it?

173
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,742
Well, sir, it's very interesting.

174
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,779
You see, we had a guest speaker
from our school last night.

175
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,280
A Mr. E.Z. Potter.
You've probably heard of him.

176
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:00,374
- E.Z. Potter?
- Yes. He's from up north.

177
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,316
- Up north? Where up north?
- Tulare.

178
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:04,547
- Tulare?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:09,116
He's got a surefire approach
for making a top-rated TV show.

180
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,388
- He does?
- And it's very logical too.

181
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:14,397
It's been historically proven
that the American people

182
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,696
have always preferred stories
about, number one, Abe Lincoln,

183
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:20,896
number two, doctors
and number three, dogs.

184
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,940
So the most popular
and highest rated show of all,

185
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:26,670
would be a show about
Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog.

186
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,508
And that is the kind of a show

187
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,573
your TV friend from Tulare
wants me to make?

188
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,245
Well, actually, he's not
in TV, sir. He's in radio.

189
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,685
- Radio?
- Yes.

190
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,849
- They don't have a TV station up there.
- They don't?

191
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,826
Abraham Lincoln's doctor's dog?

192
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,384
- Yeah.
- Title's kinda long,

193
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,987
but it sounds like a good idea.

194
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:50,056
Wait in the car.

195
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,728
Now you listen to me, Post.
You get this straight.

196
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,831
Your job here is to deliver the mail.

197
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,570
And that is all you are to do
is to deliver the mail.

198
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:02,839
I am not interested
in your quacky theories

199
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:06,747
that come from your quacky teachers
that teach in your quacky night school.

200
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:10,150
Yes, sir. But actually, in this
case, it wasn't a teacher.

201
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:14,487
I know what he was!
He was a radio man from Tulare!

202
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,294
Anything important, Jen?

203
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,558
Yes, sir. Mr. Crampton
called from New York.

204
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,861
He did?
Well, why didn't you tell me that?

205
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,300
When the president of the network calls,
don't let me stand around

206
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,066
talking about
Abraham Lincoln's dog's doctor.

207
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,507
Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog, sir.
There's a difference.

208
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,602
I don't care what it is.
How long ago did he call?

209
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,442
- About an hour ago.
- An hour?

210
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,176
You should've called me at home.

211
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,013
Well, I did, but you weren't there.

212
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,519
Your wife said you were
out on some deliveries.

213
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:46,522
Yeah... deliveries, yeah.
Well, get him on the phone.

214
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,922
He said it wouldn't be
necessary to call back.

215
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,257
Just pick him up
at the airport next Tuesday.

216
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:55,355
He didn't want to talk to me?
Did he see the ratings?

217
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,697
I imagine he had,
because he asked if you had.

218
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:01,499
- He did? Where are they?
- No, they're in the other pile.

219
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,040
Why didn't you say so?
I'm under pressure.

220
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,239
- Well, he's sure in a bad mood.
- Steve!

221
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:15,012
Why did you bring up Abe Lincoln's
doctor's dog on a day like this?

222
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,485
- No!
- I was just trying to help.

223
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,022
Nothing wrong with that.

224
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,853
These are terrible!
These are catastrophic!

225
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,087
- Just relax. You'll be fine.
- Sure.

226
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,255
You just got excited. You took
too much oxygen in your system.

227
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,060
I had an aunt who had that problem.

228
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,567
Used to help to blow into
a paper bag. Ever tried?

229
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,159
I never tried that. Helped?

230
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,898
- She just blew right in...
- Yes.

231
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,236
- Don't you have anything to do?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:40,436
- Well, do it!
- I'll see you tonight, Jen.

233
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,980
Jen, you know I never interfere in the
personal lives of my employees, but...

234
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:49,418
how can you stand
that boy? Blow into a paper bag.

235
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:53,218
I don't know. I guess
I'm just kind of hooked, sir.

236
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:59,588
There, there, Mama.
Everything is gonna be all right.

237
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,893
You'll get over it, Mama.
Don't worry.

238
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:02,966
What's the matter?

239
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,763
We've got to go to San Francisco.

240
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:17,445
Hi. Hey, what's the matter
with the Bernaduccis?

241
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,949
They have to go to San Francisco.

242
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:23,282
That's what they said. So what's
the matter with San Francisco?

243
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,413
Hey, what's everybody sniffling about?

244
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,424
Mr. Bernaducci's been transferred.

245
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,359
With all that fog and dampness,
they can't take Raffles.

246
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,488
He gets colds too easily.

247
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:37,398
And after having him all these years.

248
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:40,266
Don't take it so hard.
What'd they do, stick him in a zoo?

249
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:44,000
- No.
- Did they put him away or something?

250
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,304
No, not that!

251
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,847
Jen, you didn't take him?

252
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,482
No!

253
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:00,615
Well, I couldn't let them
put him in a zoo.

254
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:03,285
I'd have found that real easy to do.

255
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,865
- Do you think he'll be happy here?
- I don't know why you're bothering.

256
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,137
He'll be nothing but trouble.

257
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,734
Steve!

258
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,149
Will you listen to me?

259
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,310
He only had three people
in this world up until tonight.

260
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,377
Mr. And Mrs. Bernaducci and me.

261
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:34,117
Now he only has me
and I'm not going to let him down.

262
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:36,216
You're treating him like a human being.

263
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,956
He's just a hard-to-get-along-with,
miserable, spoiled chimp!

264
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,897
Seems to me you're the one
acting hard to get along with.

265
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,834
I'm sorry. Look, can we
just stick him in the bedroom?

266
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,871
I'm not going to do any such thing.

267
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:51,635
He has been through enough today
without locking him in some bedroom.

268
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,304
Now you just go in and watch TV
with him while I finish dinner.

269
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,661
- What are you doing to him?
- I didn't do anything to him.

270
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,071
He can't see the TV from there.

271
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:46,529
"Mother Carey's Chickens."

272
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,626
I guess you know,
you're witnessing one of the wildest

273
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:54,432
slam-bang football games
played anywhere.

274
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,881
Snapped to Humphrey.
He fakes a handoff...

275
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,189
Leave it alone.

276
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:16,749
What did you do to him now?

277
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,954
Nothing.
I didn't do anything to him.

278
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,122
Steve.

279
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,862
You changed the station.
You can't do that.

280
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,597
What do you mean, I can't do that?

281
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,196
If he likes a program and you change it,

282
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,606
he gets all upset.
He does it to me all the time.

283
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:35,144
Well, he's not gonna
do it to me. Jen.

284
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,340
Steve, just try and be
a little patient, okay?

285
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,542
Patient, my foot.
You expect me to sit here

286
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:44,144
and watch a lousy show
called Mother Carey's Chickens?

287
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,679
Well, it's over anyway, so
it doesn't make any difference.

288
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:51,524
It makes a lot of difference.
That chimp is spoiled rotten.

289
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,324
He's not spoiled. He's lonely.

290
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,592
Now, let him have his
own way tonight, okay?

291
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,464
Steve, would you please pour
the wine? Dinner's ready.

292
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,770
Stay tuned to this station
for Star Journey

293
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,243
which follows immediately.

294
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,478
Star Journey's coming on.
They expect that to rate number one.

295
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,540
Good. I want to see that.

296
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:19,180
Episode of The Maxwell Family,
the program for all ages.

297
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:23,192
Maxwells. If you think we're gonna
watch that soap opera, you're crazy.

298
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:28,531
- What happened now?
- It's that creep.

299
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,567
He doesn't want to watch Star Journey.

300
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:33,432
- Steve, he's not a creep.
- Well, he sure acts like one.

301
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:37,296
He did it again.
Jen, will you do something?

302
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:40,275
Steve, just let him have
his own way tonight, okay?

303
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,802
You mean we can't watch Star Journey
on account of that crummy chimp?

304
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,543
Just tonight. Please?

305
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,279
All right.

306
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,812
With all the pets in the world,

307
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,882
you gotta end up with a chimp
that likes bad TV!

308
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:06,931
Mother Carey's Chickens
and The Maxwell Family?

309
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,631
Well, who would ever figure

310
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,230
that those two shows would end up on top?

311
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,799
Nobody in this town, that's for sure.

312
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,712
- Hi, Rog.
- Keep moving.

313
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,923
Mother Carey's Chickens
and The Maxwell Family?

314
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:48,578
- Look, aren't these cute?
- Yeah, they're real cute.

315
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:52,376
- Steve, show some interest.
- I said, they're real cute.

316
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,849
I think I'll get them all.

317
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,752
Why don't you guys beat it?

318
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:03,315
We like the chimp, mister.

319
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,818
Now don't do that.
Come on.

320
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:39,352
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for watching The Fastest Gun.

321
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:42,193
It is your loyal viewing
that has made our program

322
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:45,360
one of America's
top-rated shows.

323
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,638
What are you doing here?

324
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:01,479
I thought I'd spend a
little time with your roommate.

325
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:04,019
- Well, how'd you get in?
- The landlady.

326
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,056
- She's real nice.
- She sure is.

327
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,727
- Can you beat that?
- Beat what?

328
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,231
Nothing.

329
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,562
- Hey, Jen?
- What?

330
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:21,070
I know we're gonna go out for supper
tonight, but let's just skip it.

331
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,969
Well, how come?
Why should we?

332
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,531
Well, there's some shows
I wanted to see tonight.

333
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,874
We'll call Chicken Lickin',
it'll be just as much fun, honest.

334
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:37,880
Why, that little son of a gun.
He picked them all!

335
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:41,315
7:30 to 12:00.
Holy smoke, he knows!

336
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,784
Jen?

337
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:45,720
- He knows.
- Who knows?

338
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,950
Animals.
Just like in the westerns.

339
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:51,688
Nobody sees the rattlesnake because
he's hidden behind the sagebrush.

340
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:55,220
It's the horse who rears
and saves the cowboy's life.

341
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:58,096
- He knows!
- I hope so.

342
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,972
You're gonna thank
your lucky stars I came along.

343
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,539
You'll kiss the ground I walk on.

344
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:10,841
I will?

345
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:15,076
He knows. He knows!

346
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,790
If it happened once,
it might be an accident.

347
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,762
But he picks the number one show
every single night! He knows!

348
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:36,934
Hey. He knows.

349
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:56,517
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Well, that's just wonderful.

350
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:59,790
- Now may I see your driver's license?
- Sure.

351
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:04,623
Thank you. Okay.

352
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,842
You look just like a friend of mine.

353
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,919
- Steve!
- For you!

354
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:34,520
Steve, they're beautiful!

355
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:37,598
But you really shouldn't
have spent the money.

356
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,534
Don't worry. There'll be a lot
more where that came from.

357
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:44,267
You know, it's a funny thing. Everything
seems to be going wrong for you.

358
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:47,071
One day you turn a corner
and your whole life changes.

359
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,772
All of a sudden you got the world
in your hip pocket.

360
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,713
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

361
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:59,013
Raffles?
Hey, where is he, Jen?

362
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:02,252
- He's with Roger.
- Roger?

363
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:04,316
Yeah, they left about ten minutes ago.

364
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:05,918
Why? What for?
Where'd he go?

365
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:07,224
They went for a walk.

366
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,026
He went for a walk with that creep?

367
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:11,499
I told you before, he's not a creep!

368
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:14,628
How could you do this to me?

369
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:36,455
- Hi, Rog.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

370
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:38,858
You were taking a walk.
I thought I'd join you.

371
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,421
You know, there is something
really weird going on here.

372
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,761
What?

373
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:47,132
I... I think that chimp
actually likes TV.

374
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:50,899
You've gotta be kidding.

375
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:53,636
No, he actually seems to be entertained.

376
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,577
- Look, he really likes it.
- No, no. It's just the lights.

377
00:26:56,646 --> 00:27:00,173
Certain light attracts certain animals.
That's a scientific fact.

378
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,911
I never heard that.

379
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:05,182
You didn't know that?
I thought everybody knew that.

380
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,348
I learned that at Moonrise Night School.

381
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,915
On Melrose Avenue?

382
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,152
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

383
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,755
I've never seen him act like this.
What did you do?

384
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:19,427
I didn't do anything to him.
Look, he's gone mad!

385
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:22,096
Well, you must've stepped
on his paw or something.

386
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,834
How could I step
on his paw from over here?

387
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,136
Good heav...

388
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:32,847
Excuse me. Here, let me
help you. I'm terribly sorry.

389
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,644
Good. We got it.

390
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,815
Come on, fellow.
We're all through here.

391
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,484
Vicious little...
Keep that ape away from me.

392
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,357
- Come on. Over here.
- On the table.

393
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:48,488
Thank heaven you're here.
You can't believe what happened.

394
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:51,966
- We're not finished yet.
- Rog, don't worry about a thing.

395
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:54,469
We've got the bail.
We'll have you out in no time.

396
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:58,405
How could you let me be associated
with a beast like that? He's a monster.

397
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:02,070
He's not a monster. Something
just got into him, that's all.

398
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:19,590
Maybe he just doesn't like basketball.

399
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:22,689
He doesn't?
I happen to like it very...

400
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:26,694
That thing's not a monster?

401
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,034
That's gonna cost you 75 bucks.

402
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:33,036
- For what? That?
- Come on, fella.

403
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:36,010
It's gonna cost at least 75 bucks
to get that thing fixed.

404
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,479
Okay. Who do I pay
to bail the chimp out?

405
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:42,882
- We take care of it right here.
- Wait a minute. What about me?

406
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:44,476
Gee, I'm sorry, Rog.

407
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:47,182
I'm out of money.
I gotta get some more. Don't worry.

408
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:51,684
You're bailing that chimp out and
letting me stay here in this dump?

409
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:53,422
Wait just a minute, mac.

410
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,590
This is a pretty nice place.
We happen to like it down here.

411
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:58,827
Well, you have to. I don't.

412
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,065
Steve, we aren't gonna leave Roger here?

413
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:05,505
Gee, we've gotta be realistic
about this thing, Jen. I mean...

414
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:08,510
It's Roger or the chimp,
and this is no place for a chimp.

415
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:11,513
Well, it's no place for me, either!

416
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:13,515
Wave goodbye to Uncle Roger now.

417
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:18,711
Miserable chimp.

418
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,852
- Poor little guy.
- Poor little guy, my foot.

419
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,019
It's back to the Bernaduccis for him.

420
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,120
No, wait a minute.
You can't do that.

421
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:29,028
What are you getting excited about?

422
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,760
- I need him!
- You need him?

423
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,825
I mean, I don't need him.

424
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:35,928
Why would you wanna give
a poor little guy like this away?

425
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:37,404
I mean, that's inhumane!

426
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,840
Inhumane?
He's the one that's inhumane.

427
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,003
He's already broken two TV sets
and a plate glass window.

428
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,310
Look, Jen, maybe he's trying
to get something out of his system.

429
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,442
Just give him a few days.
He'll be okay.

430
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,217
Okay, I'll give him till Saturday.

431
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:55,689
Good. By Saturday, he'll be
acting like a different chimp.

432
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,283
I guarantee it.

433
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:32,488
- I just can't understand it.
- Understand what?

434
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:35,326
Why he'd give me tickets
to take you to the ball game.

435
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,662
That's because you
don't understand Steve.

436
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,827
He has a lot of nice qualities about him.

437
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,701
Like what?

438
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:44,501
Well, he's charitable.

439
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:46,872
He gave you tickets
to take me to the game.

440
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:50,174
Yeah, but I still think
there's some motive behind that.

441
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:53,340
And he's honest.
Nobody can say he's not honest.

442
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,680
And as far as being trustworthy,

443
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:58,516
I don't know anyone
I would trust more than Steve.

444
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:00,579
And he's loyal and brave and...

445
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:04,457
Jen, will you forget it? You're
making him sound like a boy scout.

446
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,965
Come on, Raffles.

447
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:55,607
You have to believe me. I've got a
scientific approach to rating TV shows.

448
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:59,205
It'll revolutionize this whole industry.
We can put UBC right on top.

449
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,113
Jen, I'm going to be very busy today.

450
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:06,622
Will you see to it that I am not
disturbed unless absolutely necessary?

451
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,086
I've got the key to this industry,
and he won't listen to me.

452
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,791
Steve, just leave
Mr. Wilbanks alone today.

453
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,891
Mr. Crampton's coming in
from New York,

454
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,458
and he's nervous as a kitten.

455
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:22,937
Wait a minute.
Crampton's coming in tomorrow?

456
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:26,373
That's perfect. Look,
I won't be able to see you tonight.

457
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,910
I've got some homework I want to do.

458
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,517
The programs of this station...

459
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:49,190
Okay, 12:30 to 1:00, channel 18.

460
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:52,200
Okay, that does it.
You can go to bed now.

461
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,860
You've had a hard day's work.

462
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,872
And if this doesn't convince them,
I don't know what will.

463
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:02,677
"Dear Mr. Crampton."

464
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:06,010
As a loyal member of the United
Broadcasting Corporation,

465
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:11,247
I must tell you that I seem
to have a strange ability

466
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,221
which enables me to pick the shows

467
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,087
"the American people like best."

468
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:28,830
Hey, Mertons, the old limo's
looking pretty slick.

469
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:31,840
It better.
I have to pick up the big man.

470
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,604
Yeah, I heard about that.
Hey, listen.

471
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,804
Would you mind slipping this to Crampton?

472
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,141
No, I can't do that.

473
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:41,877
If the boss caught me passing your
notes to the chief...

474
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,010
Don't worry. I got something big.

475
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:47,579
It's our chance to put the network
on top. I can prove it to Crampton.

476
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:50,683
Our network on top?

477
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,352
Forget it.

478
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,026
Guess I was mistaken.
You're another one of those.

479
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,567
Wait a minute.

480
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,061
Another one of those what?

481
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:05,039
One of those who has something
against young people.

482
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,099
I never said that.

483
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:09,872
What's wrong with a young
man getting ahead, anyway?

484
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:13,473
I mean, didn't William Pitt
become prime minister of England at 24?

485
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,244
What about Alexander Hamilton?

486
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:18,082
He signed the Declaration
of Independence at 19.

487
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:21,453
Alexander the Great. How old
was he when he conquered Macedonia?

488
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,954
- I forget.
- And Louis XIV.

489
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:27,929
The greatest ruler France had. You know,
he became king at the age of four.

490
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:28,997
Four?

491
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:32,626
There was even a British king who
took over when he was nine months old.

492
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:36,695
I can go through history and show people
that became great leaders at early ages.

493
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:39,640
Yeah, but what's that got to do with...

494
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:43,145
Here he comes. I know you'll find
the time to slip it to Mr. Crampton.

495
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,112
- Morning, Mr. Wilbanks.
- Morning.

496
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,081
- Have a nice trip.
- Have a nice trip?

497
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,742
I'm only going to the airport.

498
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,480
Well, have a nice trip to the airport.

499
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:55,456
Something must be wrong, Wilbanks.
We're always third in the ratings.

500
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:59,017
Which would be all right, but
there are only three networks!

501
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:02,963
We come up with loser after
loser, disaster after disaster.

502
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:06,559
But chief, I've been through
47 pilot films this year...

503
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:09,799
Well, maybe it's your staff.
Have you got experienced people?

504
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:12,102
Well, experience is hard
to come by, chief.

505
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,575
All you've got available
to you are young kids,

506
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:17,704
running around, trying to tell
you how to run your business.

507
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,510
Speaking of kids telling you
how to run your business,

508
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,210
this is for you, Mr. Crampton.

509
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,651
Is that from Steven Post?

510
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,850
Why would you bother the chief with that?

511
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,257
Isn't it bad enough
that I'm bothered by him?

512
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:35,195
He says he's got a foolproof method
of determining the top-rated programs.

513
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:37,425
He's ambitious.

514
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,866
He's rated all of last night's shows.

515
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:42,928
"Check with the overnight ratings.
You'll see I'm right."

516
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,836
Don't pay any attention to that kid.

517
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:49,003
He'll drive you nuts. He's 21 years old,
and thinks he should run the network.

518
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:51,945
Well, I don't think age has
anything to do with it, boss.

519
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:54,778
- I didn't ask you!
- What's wrong with a young man

520
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:57,046
running the network?
Look at William Pitt.

521
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,953
He was only 24,
and he was president of England.

522
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:04,049
And Alexander the Great. How old was he
when he conquered Macedonia?

523
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,721
How would I know?
Just drive the car.

524
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:10,254
Look at all them little kids
that was kings of different countries.

525
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,927
Like this little kid
that was only four years old,

526
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:16,130
and he was king of France.
And there's one kid,

527
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:19,106
he was the king of England,
he was only nine months!

528
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:24,078
Nine months? A person became
king of England at nine months?

529
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,115
I don't remember anything about that.

530
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,047
You don't?

531
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,512
- Tell him to drive the car.
- Drive the car.

532
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,094
You rated every show
exactly like our rating service.

533
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,067
How'd you do that, young man?

534
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,763
I guess I just have an instinct
for what people like.

535
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,466
He's got an instinct for
getting people in trouble.

536
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,541
Just a minute.

537
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,599
- You can't listen to punks.
- Francis.

538
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:57,943
Francis!

539
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:01,608
I'm out here to replace
some shows that...

540
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:03,811
Well, they're not doing too well.

541
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:06,446
How would you like to look
at some new films with me?

542
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:08,854
- I'd be honored.
- That's carrying it too far.

543
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:11,359
I think I could do a lot better
if I took them home.

544
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:13,987
My powers of concentration
are stronger that way.

545
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:15,997
Never mind.

546
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,693
No film leaves this studio.
That's company policy.

547
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,236
He's right.
Just be in our viewing room at 6:00.

548
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:25,673
Francis, we'll see how good
the boy really is.

549
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:46,317
That looks good.
It's encouraging.

550
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:50,489
Yeah, I think we're on the right track.

551
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:53,296
- What was that?
- What?

552
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:54,734
What was that?

553
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,932
One of our plumbers, sir.
He's a terrific little guy. Really.

554
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:01,340
Shortest plumber I've ever seen.
I hope you're paying minimum.

555
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,503
- I don't hire the plumbers.
- You coming?

556
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:06,412
- I'll be right up.
- Find out who hires plumbers.

557
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,967
Stan, don't use the mail elevator
for a couple of minutes.

558
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,902
- I got some important stuff on it.
- Sure, Steve.

559
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,819
Jen! Hi.

560
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:21,755
What have you been up to?
I've been looking for you all day.

561
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:25,658
Kind of in and out.
You know how it is. What's up?

562
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:29,391
Well, I wanted to talk to you.
I'm worried about my chimp.

563
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:32,332
He's calmed down like
you said, but maybe too much.

564
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:36,132
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't seem to be himself.

565
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,605
He has no energy, no spunk, nothing.

566
00:39:38,674 --> 00:39:40,972
He's even stopped watching TV.

567
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,739
He probably got a hold of
bad bananas or something.

568
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:46,247
Bananas?
Would they bother a chimp?

569
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,648
Sure. If he got a hold
of some bad ones, they would.

570
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:59,388
Steve, what's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.

571
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,692
I gotta go to that screening.

572
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,732
You know, big shots and everything.

573
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:06,632
It's already started.
What are you standing here for?

574
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:09,865
I was just waiting
for some mail to come up.

575
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:12,066
Then you have to push the button.

576
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,642
Yeah. I was just thinking
about doing that.

577
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,349
What is the matter with you?

578
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:24,648
You act like you're
trying to get rid of me.

579
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,247
Jen, you know
I'd never do a thing like that.

580
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:32,620
If you want a ride home,
you better come on.

581
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:34,356
Okay.

582
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:40,793
You know, Steve,
sometimes you act really weird.

583
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:45,704
I'll see you later, Jen.

584
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,792
Is that you, Post?

585
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:12,527
Yes, sir. Sorry I'm late.

586
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,535
Yes. Well, we're showing a few scenes

587
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,434
from The Happy Harringtons first.

588
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:19,303
We're confident
it's our strongest replacement show.

589
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,343
But feel free to have your own opinion.

590
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,843
Thank you, sir.

591
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:31,978
- What was that?
- I didn't say anything.

592
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,988
I get asthma every once in a while.

593
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:37,617
You better have that checked.
That's the worst I've heard.

594
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:43,561
Post, if you don't like
the show, just say so!

595
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,463
I'm sorry, sir.

596
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:48,230
I, I think I'll get my asthma spray.

597
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,534
I keep it in the projection booth.

598
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:54,201
Why would he keep his
asthma spray in the projection booth?

599
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:58,610
- Well, he... I don't know.
- You don't know.

600
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:01,206
Can you ever answer anything
but "I don't know"?

601
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:02,443
- Stevie.
- Hi, Tom.

602
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:04,782
What do you got,
a replacement for Wilbanks?

603
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:07,118
No, he's a pet.
I'm watching him for a friend.

604
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:08,656
Hey, he's really great.

605
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:11,215
I gotta go back.
How about him watching from here?

606
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:13,227
- He won't be any problem.
- Sure.

607
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,958
I'm glad to have someone to talk to.
It gets lonely in here by yourself.

608
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,432
Now, don't let me down.
Thanks a lot, Tom.

609
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:23,631
Sure, Steve.

610
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,005
UBC proudly presents...

611
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:39,515
Devil Dan!

612
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:44,320
Dumb kid. I told him to save
this for the last, chief.

613
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:46,588
I'm sorry about this. Save it!

614
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:49,893
I know it isn't much,
but we have to look at them all.

615
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:51,432
Don't save it!

616
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,433
Devil Dan?
Audience appeal?

617
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:00,907
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Not at all.

618
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:03,604
Devil Dan would start
this network to the top.

619
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,045
Yes, well, my boy,
I think we at the network

620
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,310
have our fingers
on the pulse of the public,

621
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:10,284
and it reads Happy Harringtons to us.

622
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:14,982
But sir, people just won't buy that
stuff anymore. That show is a dog.

623
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:17,651
Well, yes, we do appreciate
your suggestion.

624
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:21,059
If we ever need you again,
we'll be sure and get in touch.

625
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:26,633
- Ruthless, bald audacity.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

626
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:28,932
That boy is blind to everything human...

627
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:30,904
Figure a way to quietly get rid of him.

628
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:32,065
I can handle that.

629
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:36,077
I'm going east, I'll take care
of things there. Get hold of publicity.

630
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:39,308
The Happy Harringtons
are replacing Riot Squadron Saturday.

631
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:41,246
Tell them we want a big splurge on it.

632
00:43:41,317 --> 00:43:44,013
Right, chief. I'll take care
of it on this end. Right.

633
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:46,554
They just won't listen.
Nobody will listen.

634
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:49,147
They were nice enough
to ask you to see the film.

635
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:51,693
You gave them your opinion,
they didn't like it.

636
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,228
- You can't blame them.
- But they're wrong, Jen.

637
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:56,389
Well, how do you know they're wrong?

638
00:43:56,465 --> 00:44:00,265
I just know it. I really know it!

639
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:03,735
And I know of a way
to make them listen too.

640
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:03,325
Can I have your attention?
Your attention.

641
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:06,334
Thank you. I want you all
to make yourselves comfortable,

642
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,370
and I want you to enjoy yourselves.

643
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:12,737
But I would suggest that you hold
your applause until after the show.

644
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:15,368
That way you won't miss any of the jokes.

645
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:30,122
Ladies and gentlemen,
stay tuned for UBC's hilarious new show,

646
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:33,821
The Happy Harringtons!

647
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:36,456
UBC proudly presents...

648
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:41,394
Devil Dan!

649
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,030
- Devil Dan?
- How did that happen?

650
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:47,633
What's going on here? In all my years,
I've never seen this happen.

651
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,905
It's those boobs
in the transmitting room.

652
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:52,776
I'll get to the bottom of this
if I have to fire every one.

653
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:54,315
Get me a phone.

654
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:57,147
There's no sense in calling anyone.

655
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,244
You see, I changed the program.

656
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,221
You?

657
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,157
Yes, sir. I know it may seem
a little upsetting right now,

658
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:07,923
but believe me, it's in the
best interest of the company.

659
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:12,365
Do you realize that you have
altered the will of a network?

660
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:15,870
And I, I suppose you want me to resign?

661
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:18,031
No. You're fired.

662
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,872
Mr. Wilbanks,
New York on the phone.

663
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:29,145
That's Crampton!
What am I going to tell Crampton?

664
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:37,720
- Steve.
- Hey, look, Jen, don't worry.

665
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:40,091
Everything's gonna be okay, really.

666
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,368
Big dummy.

667
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,701
You see?
That's what happens

668
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,900
when you have a Moonrise Night School man

669
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:55,569
in the network business.

670
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:57,874
Why don't you shut up?

671
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:22,363
- Where are you going?
- I guess I'll get a hamburger.

673
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:24,565
Well, I'm kinda hungry too.

674
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:27,867
Look, Jen, maybe you'd
better go back inside.

675
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:29,501
I mean,

676
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:32,706
I'm not really the most popular guy
in the world right now.

677
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:51,761
You really want a hamburger?

678
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,961
You look kinda funny riding back there.

679
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:57,437
Who said I was afraid of looking funny?

680
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:15,351
Holy mackerel!

681
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:18,749
Good morning,
Mr. Wilbanks!

682
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:25,727
Mr. Wilbanks!
Say, that was really something.

683
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,770
A real touch of genius.
Congratulations.

684
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:31,196
Thank you.

685
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,406
- Good morning.
- Morning.

686
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,909
Hey, that was terrific.

687
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:39,141
How'd you come up with something
like that? Congratulations.

688
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:41,307
I beg your pardon?

689
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:47,182
Very clever, Wilbanks.
Congratulations.

690
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:49,952
Thank you. Thank you.

691
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:52,687
- Just a minute.
- Can you tell me what all...

692
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:55,696
- Mr. Wilbanks, New York.
- Hello?

693
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:59,325
What time do you get to work? I've
spent half the day trying to reach you.

694
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:02,029
You see, there's a
three hour time difference,

695
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:05,733
and where it's 12:00 noon
in New York, out here it's only...

696
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:08,935
Don't tell me what time it is
in New York. Get him!

697
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:11,571
- Who?
- Who?

698
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,706
Haven't you read the trade papers yet?

699
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:16,216
Trade papers?

700
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:22,023
- Wilbanks?
- No! How...

701
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,719
- Wilbanks, are you there?
- Yes, I'm... I'm here.

702
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:27,921
Well, listen, sign him to a contract.

703
00:49:27,996 --> 00:49:30,624
We don't want anyone
stealing him from us.

704
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:33,224
But, chief, I fired him.

705
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:36,100
- You what?
- Well, don't you remember?

706
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,696
I told you on the phone,
and you told me...

707
00:49:38,774 --> 00:49:40,901
Don't tell me what I told you.

708
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:44,104
I know what I told you.
Just get that boy back.

709
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:47,245
He's a genius!

710
00:49:47,316 --> 00:49:49,284
I'll certainly do my best, chief,

711
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:50,750
but I don't know whether...

712
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,548
Of course you don't know whether.

713
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,647
I'll be out tomorrow.
Have that boy in your office at 1:00.

714
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,157
And have the press there.

715
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:59,853
From now on, I'll manage this myself!

716
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:02,829
On behalf of the board of
directors of this network,

717
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:06,698
I take great pleasure
in the following announcement.

718
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:09,931
Steven Post has been made
our new program director.

719
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:13,736
- A boy that age, program director?
- What's the matter with a boy that age?

720
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:15,003
Look at William Pitt.

721
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:17,739
He was prime minister
of England when he was only 24.

722
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:22,147
And Alexander the Great? How old
was he when he conquered Macedonia?

723
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:24,242
No, we here at the network

724
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,153
are convinced that Steven Post
is a young man of unique talent,

725
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,714
well-qualified to join
the executive team

726
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,818
that will lead UBC to the very top.

727
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,022
If the kid's going
to be program director,

728
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:37,963
what's going to happen to Wilbanks?

729
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:41,594
We haven't forgotten
Mr. Wilbanks. He's moved on too.

730
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,369
He'll be vice president
in charge of cultural relations.

731
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:49,137
- What's that?
- We'll let Wilbanks explain.

732
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:52,874
- What is it, Mr. Wilbanks?
- That's very...

733
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:57,817
You see, whenever we have the...
I don't know what it is.

734
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,757
Steve, it's so wonderful.

735
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:09,821
Yeah.
Yeah, well...

736
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:12,093
Mr. Crampton thought
I ought to have a place

737
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,431
where I can kinda, entertain and stuff.

738
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,733
On account of my new job, you know?

739
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:18,898
Steve, I'm so happy for you.

740
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:21,943
You should be so proud of yourself.

741
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,444
And just think,
you did it all on your own.

742
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,879
Yeah.

743
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:41,526
Hey!

744
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:48,625
Come on, sweetheart.
Thattaboy. Come on, baby.

745
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:51,468
Thattaboy. There you go.

746
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,566
Yeah, I love you too.
Watch the movie.

747
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:02,005
How about this one, Post?

748
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:04,109
- I don't know yet.
- He doesn't know yet.

749
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:06,677
No, he wants to run it.

750
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,500
- It's good.
- Another winner.

751
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:21,593
Yeah, yeah, he likes it.

752
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,604
Yeah.

753
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:51,029
Congratulations, Steve.

754
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:54,333
On what?

755
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,166
On the award you're gonna win tonight.

756
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,707
Hey, look, Jen, I haven't won that yet.

757
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,836
Well, you will. If you're
not TV man of the year, who is?

758
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:06,039
Jen...

759
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:10,016
When are you gonna tell me
about those locks?

760
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,986
There?

761
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:14,885
I can't.

762
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:17,322
Well, you see,
it's kinda like my war room.

763
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:19,223
It's where I make all my decisions.

764
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:21,558
It's...
It's very private.

765
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:26,256
Well, do I ever get to see?

766
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:29,963
Yeah, I'll show you sometime.

767
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:34,505
- Steve, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

768
00:53:34,576 --> 00:53:37,602
- I was just thinking.
- About what?

769
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:41,047
It's a lot of stuff
you wouldn't understand.

770
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:43,277
I might.

771
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:47,152
Well, I was thinking about people.

772
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:49,918
People like Vasco da Gama.

773
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:51,959
- Like who?
- Yeah, he was a discoverer.

774
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:54,518
- He discovered the West Indies.
- I know, but...

775
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:57,588
Isn't it just as good to
discover something as invent it?

776
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,065
- I guess.
- Where would we be

777
00:53:59,134 --> 00:54:01,295
if people didn't discover things?

778
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:05,703
Just like some great scientist who...
Well, maybe he's not so great,

779
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:08,709
but he discovers a lab assistant
who's doing all the work.

780
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:11,041
But the scientist
takes all the credit. Why?

781
00:54:11,112 --> 00:54:13,205
Because he discovered him.

782
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:15,772
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that, is there?

783
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,019
No, I guess not.

784
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:23,490
Good. That's the way
I had it figured.

785
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:43,771
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

786
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:46,313
the most coveted prize of all:

787
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:49,509
TV's "Man of the Year" award.

788
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:51,518
And the winner is...

789
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:58,515
Steven Post,
Yeah! Yeah!

790
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:01,528
President of the
United Broadcasting Corporation.

791
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:03,063
President?

792
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,897
Vice president.

793
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,276
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

794
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:25,251
I mean, vice president.
But at any rate,

795
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,222
Steven Post is television's
man of the year!

796
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:55,879
And now the key.

797
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:05,249
Congratulations, Crampton.

798
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:08,125
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You have a fine young man.

799
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:10,255
Thank you, Clifford.
We're proud of him.

800
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:13,995
You should be. Your sponsors seem
to like him. Gave him a nice little car.

801
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:16,469
Yes, he's a man who's
going right to the top.

802
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:19,166
The very top, indeed.

803
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,832
Francis.

804
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,410
Excuse us, girls.

805
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:29,414
We gotta do something about that boy.
We've built a Frankenstein.

806
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:32,942
- We have. He's already got my job.
- But now it's getting serious.

807
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:35,615
- Now it's getting serious?
- How does the boy do it?

808
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,714
I don't know how.

809
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,385
I just know he's not smart enough
to do it on his own.

810
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:41,861
- What have you done about it?
- What should I do?

811
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,058
- I'm in cultural relations.
- The basics, man. The basics.

812
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,863
Have you searched his office,
grilled his secretary,

813
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:49,767
tapped his phone, had him followed?

814
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,705
No. Wouldn't that be unethical?

815
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:54,867
Unethical?
Get with it, Wilbanks.

816
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:57,935
It's a desperate situation.
It requires desperate means.

817
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:00,243
Find out how that boy is doing it!

818
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,301
Hasta la vista, Senor Post.

819
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:03,972
Hasta, hasta.

820
00:58:34,843 --> 00:58:36,674
Hello in there.

821
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:43,079
Can you hear me?

822
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:46,418
Are you a prisoner?

823
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,651
Knock twice if you can hear me.

824
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:58,054
Thank heaven.

825
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:02,628
I'm a friend.

826
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:05,468
I beg your pardon?

827
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,135
He sounds gagged!
That dirty, ruthless...

828
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:15,246
Hey, I'm back!

829
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:27,292
Okay, okay!

830
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:31,888
Okay! Don't go wild!

831
00:59:36,237 --> 00:59:37,397
Hey, take it easy.

832
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:44,939
Wait a minute. Not the ballet.

833
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:47,675
That'll wreck your taste for sure.

834
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:50,547
You're supposed
to pick the top-rated shows.

835
00:59:50,618 --> 00:59:53,485
You got that finger of yours
on the heartbeat of America.

836
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:55,182
Don't louse it up!

837
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,759
I'll put on some coffee, then we'll
take a look at those new pilots.

838
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:05,093
You want some pizza
tonight? I got two kinds.

839
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,896
Plain and with pepperoni.
You want the pepperoni?

840
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:11,405
Okay, you get the plain one.

841
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:31,118
Okay, it's ready!

842
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:00,853
All right. Showtime.

843
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:13,633
Now, one of these days, I'm
gonna show you how to thread this thing.

844
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:16,135
I keep forgetting that.

845
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,403
It'd sure be great if you
could pick another Devil Dan.

846
01:01:57,578 --> 01:02:00,206
Who was in the room?
That's what I wanna know.

847
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:02,078
Well, first of all,

848
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,142
there were three television sets
in front of three chairs.

849
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:09,178
- Three sets?
- Yeah, and a projector and a screen.

850
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:12,249
Then there was this tree with
a whole bunch of bananas on it.

851
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,295
Bananas? Ba...
That could be it.

852
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:17,729
- Bananas could be brain food.
- Yeah. They are.

853
01:02:17,799 --> 01:02:20,290
Jen, get me Dr. Schmidt
in Research on the phone.

854
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:22,802
- I'm sure he's gone home.
- I know he's gone home.

855
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,997
Get him on the phone.
He's probably got...

856
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:27,041
- What is it, Roger?
- It's not bananas.

857
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:29,599
It's that phantom roommate
he keeps locked up.

858
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:32,339
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't see him.

859
01:02:32,413 --> 01:02:34,540
They were talking,
but I couldn't see him.

860
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:37,812
Well, let's get down to basics.
Tell me what you did see,

861
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:40,683
and don't tell me about the
thing around your leg again.

862
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:42,950
It was weird.

863
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:45,822
Whoever it was was wearing
a little red cap

864
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:47,451
with a blue bon-bon
on the top.

865
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:51,294
- It was just gliding along.
- Hello? Hello?

866
01:02:51,366 --> 01:02:54,233
There were empty banana skins everywhere.

867
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:59,035
And then, this hairy arm
grabbed me right in the closet.

868
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:02,702
It was hideous. There
was no head, no body, no feet.

869
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:05,268
- Hello?
- Just a hairy arm.

870
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:08,213
Jen, what are you doing?

871
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:11,513
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Schmidt, Francis Wilbanks.

872
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:15,283
Tell me, doctor, are bananas brain food?

873
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:19,759
Bananas? Brain food?
Well, I couldn't say for sure,

874
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:23,854
but I do recall a certain tribe in New
Guinea who subscribed to the theory

875
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:26,195
that bananas were indeed, a brain food.

876
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:36,706
- Hi, Jen.
- Hello, Vasco da Gama.

877
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:38,109
- What?
- You know.

878
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:40,511
He was the one who
discovered the West Indies.

879
01:03:40,581 --> 01:03:44,677
He was a discoverer. Discoverers
are just as important as inventors.

880
01:03:44,752 --> 01:03:48,381
Like the mad scientist who keeps
his assistant locked in the basement.

881
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:50,515
I didn't say anything about a scientist.

882
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:52,525
- I want my chimp.
- What?

883
01:03:52,593 --> 01:03:54,788
I know, Steve.

884
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:57,456
They never listened to me, Jen.

885
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,659
They wouldn't have for a million years!

886
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:01,292
Steve, open this door.

887
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:03,564
I didn't even have a car.
I had a motorcycle.

888
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:07,938
Now I got a DeTomaso Mangusta.
A brand-new DeTomaso Mangusta.

889
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,842
I mean it, Steve.
Now, you open that door!

890
01:04:12,346 --> 01:04:15,406
Look, Jen.

891
01:04:16,451 --> 01:04:18,510
I did it for you.

892
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:23,387
I mean, why would you ever
want to marry a mail boy?

893
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:27,326
I kidded myself, but that's
all I knew I'd ever be.

894
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,062
You never said you wanted to marry me.

895
01:04:35,136 --> 01:04:37,229
Well...

896
01:04:37,872 --> 01:04:40,136
That's because I was a mail boy.

897
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:43,644
I mean, I didn't even have a car.

898
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:45,144
Just a motorcycle.

899
01:04:46,714 --> 01:04:50,115
I told you before, there's nothing
the matter with a motorcycle.

900
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:58,151
I guess he recognized your voice.

901
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:04,228
I'm kinda glad you...
you found out. I...

902
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:07,267
I was trying to figure out
a way to tell you.

903
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:15,437
You see, Jen, it is working.

904
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,978
He is happy.

905
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:19,979
Look, we could have it all.

906
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:22,914
I'm not hurting anybody, either.

907
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:25,316
I guess you've been
treating him pretty good.

908
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,385
Why don't...

909
01:05:28,456 --> 01:05:31,186
Why don't we just keep it in the family?

910
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:33,659
Okay, he can stay.

911
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,162
But remember, I get visitation rights.

912
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:38,756
Yeah.

913
01:05:41,035 --> 01:05:43,731
Hey, Steve.
Hey, you're looking really sharp.

914
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:45,396
- New job.
- Yeah.

915
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:48,306
What happened to that chimp
you used to bring around?

916
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:49,843
Not so loud. Not around here.

917
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:53,472
Yeah? I mean, he sure
liked Devil Dan, didn't he?

918
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:56,346
I mean, I've never seen
anything like it. He just...

919
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:04,523
The manager said room 1123

920
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:07,117
is directly across from Post's apartment.

921
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:09,389
- Now we'll see.
- See what?

922
01:06:09,463 --> 01:06:11,590
I can understand your skepticism, Uncle.

923
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,657
This has been a gigantic puzzle,

924
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:16,168
but I put the pieces together,
and they all fit.

925
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:18,364
Fit, my foot.
This is ridiculous.

926
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,545
I didn't believe a mail boy could do it.

927
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:26,603
I'm not gonna believe a chimp can do it.

928
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:29,479
- It's a wild goose chase.
- You mean, wild monkey chase.

929
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,609
It's not funny.

930
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:35,315
- Stop that simple laughing.
- Sorry, boss.

931
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,587
I don't like this.
I don't like it at all.

932
01:06:43,664 --> 01:06:45,757
There must be something criminal.

933
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,233
Uncle, we're not doing anything criminal.

934
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:51,237
Then why do I feel like a peeping Tom?

935
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:57,103
Okay. Look.

936
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:09,050
Well, so what? It's just
that mail boy sitting there

937
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:11,489
all by himself, looking at TV.

938
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:15,628
Look. Quick, quick! Look.

939
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:23,832
Good heavens.

940
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:30,740
I think we finally
may be getting somewhere.

941
01:07:50,097 --> 01:07:52,657
Here! See what I mean?
See what I...

942
01:07:55,703 --> 01:07:58,433
Yes, I do.
He's watching Smuggler's Gold.

943
01:07:58,506 --> 01:08:00,269
That's the number one-rated show.

944
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:04,004
That's what I've been trying to tell
you. The chimp is picking the shows.

945
01:08:04,078 --> 01:08:08,208
Well, we can't really tell. He might
not even know what he's looking at.

946
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:10,773
A commercial break.

947
01:08:20,294 --> 01:08:22,387
Wilbanks, he knows!

948
01:08:22,463 --> 01:08:27,093
He really knows. He got
a beer during the commercial.

949
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,765
Proof positive.

950
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,934
That's a sure sign if I've ever seen one.

951
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:40,707
Wilbanks, get that chimp.

952
01:09:06,974 --> 01:09:09,033
- What are we doing here?
- Just follow me.

953
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:13,103
I didn't get where I am without
planning ahead. Come on.

954
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:22,721
Hey, boss, don't ya think
it'd be better if I stayed here

955
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:26,089
- and cut people off at the pass?
- Cut them off at the pass?

956
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,958
You don't want people
bothering you out on the ledge.

957
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:31,862
Will you stop that
silly talk and come on?

958
01:09:31,932 --> 01:09:34,264
But, boss, I...
I get sick when I look down.

959
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,461
Well, then look up.

960
01:09:35,536 --> 01:09:37,527
I have the same problem when I look up.

961
01:09:37,605 --> 01:09:40,904
Get prepared to be sick.
I can't handle that chimp by myself.

962
01:09:40,975 --> 01:09:41,975
But, boss...

963
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:14,900
Will you stop that simple wheezing?

964
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:18,308
I can't help it. This always
happens to me at high altitudes.

965
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:22,110
You're only 200 feet up.
Let go of me.

966
01:10:22,183 --> 01:10:24,777
Ohhhhh!

967
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:36,292
I told you to stay with me.

968
01:11:01,856 --> 01:11:04,222
A-Hello, little fella.

969
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,657
Let's go for a walk?
That's a good fella.

970
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:09,059
That's the worst experience I ever had.

971
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:11,757
Yeah. The door, the door. Come on.

972
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:17,032
Boss, the door is locked.

973
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:19,436
Well, of course it's locked.

974
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,337
You don't expect him to leave it open

975
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:24,434
with a valuable chimp
like that in here, do you?

976
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:30,407
We're not going out there again, are we?

977
01:11:30,484 --> 01:11:32,247
Why not? The chimp isn't afraid.

978
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:34,583
He's used to swinging
around in high places.

979
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,179
Come on!

980
01:11:43,464 --> 01:11:46,262
No! Now you
did it with that wheezing.

981
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,824
- You scared the chimp.
- Sorry, boss.

982
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:51,804
Sorry doesn't feed the bulldog.

983
01:11:52,506 --> 01:11:54,201
Where'd he go?

984
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:03,911
- There he is.
- Where?

985
01:12:05,986 --> 01:12:08,352
Boss, help!

986
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,861
Stop wheezing!

987
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:18,728
What are you doing?
Wait!!

988
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:24,536
Help!
Not the tie, not the tie!

989
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,904
Get the...
Get the...

990
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:37,674
Just watch it..

991
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:41,546
Now, don't touch me.
Just don't touch me.

992
01:12:41,622 --> 01:12:43,283
Yes, boss.

993
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:47,691
I can't understand
what happened to your car.

994
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:49,854
I guess they had
to gas it up or something.

995
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,455
- That's okay. I'm in no hurry.
- I better check.

996
01:13:02,643 --> 01:13:04,873
How did you get down here?

997
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:13,448
No.

998
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,852
What do we do now?

999
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:34,072
Now don't panic.

1000
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:36,234
We'll just crawl back in the kid's room.

1001
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:40,269
He's bound to have a phone and we'll
call somebody and have them get us.

1002
01:13:57,297 --> 01:14:00,289
I left that darn window open too far.

1003
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,699
No more open window for you.

1004
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:07,868
I'll see you later.

1005
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:17,015
How'd he get back in there?

1006
01:14:17,084 --> 01:14:18,676
How would I know?

1007
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:20,652
This is locked too.

1008
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:22,552
What do we do?

1009
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:24,318
Well, maybe he can unlock it.

1010
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:26,325
He seems able to do everything else.

1011
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:28,054
For the last time,

1012
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:29,789
will you stop that wheezing?

1013
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:34,095
Little fella?
Turn the handle.

1014
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:36,568
You're gonna love it.
That's it. Yes.

1015
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:39,936
There you go. Yes. Yes.

1016
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:45,734
- You're not gonna start that?
- I can't help it, boss.

1017
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:47,405
We don't have to stand up again?

1018
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:49,847
Of course we have to stand up!
Get up! Get up!

1019
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:53,910
Maybe we can attract some attention,
help get off of this thing.

1020
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:57,548
Boss, this is awful.

1021
01:14:57,624 --> 01:15:00,491
Stop hiccupping! First you
wheeze and then you hiccup!

1022
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:02,893
I can't help it.
I hiccup when I get nervous.

1023
01:15:04,498 --> 01:15:08,332
Stop it! I can't stand it!
Don't you understand that?

1024
01:15:08,402 --> 01:15:11,496
- Just try holding your breath.
- That never works with me.

1025
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:14,507
Maybe if you get me a glass
of water. That sometimes helps.

1026
01:15:14,575 --> 01:15:17,408
All right. I'll get...
How can I get you a glass of water?

1027
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,207
I can't...

1028
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:22,077
Come on! Glass of water.

1029
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:31,056
It's an ambulance, police cars.

1030
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:34,026
Well, you wanted to attract attention.

1031
01:15:39,566 --> 01:15:43,002
Here we go again.
K-7, this is 10-Sugar-Charlie.

1032
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,765
Come in.

1033
01:15:44,838 --> 01:15:46,601
We're here. The report checks out.

1034
01:15:46,673 --> 01:15:50,006
We got a couple of nuts
trying to commit suicide.

1035
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:52,375
Give me that thing.

1036
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:56,109
All right, now, just...
just take it easy up there.

1037
01:15:56,183 --> 01:16:01,416
Everything's gonna be all right.
Above all, don't jump.

1038
01:16:01,488 --> 01:16:04,321
He thinks we're gonna jump.

1039
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,689
No, we're not going to jump!

1040
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:13,489
Hey, boss, I'm losing my buttons.

1041
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:36,312
We almost lost one that time.

1042
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:39,188
This is gonna be a tough one, Vince.

1043
01:16:39,259 --> 01:16:42,319
Here, take this outta the way.
Take it over to the truck.

1044
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:45,697
Bring them in.
Bring them on in.

1045
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,936
Hey, the fire engines are stopping here.

1046
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:57,533
Do you smell smoke?

1047
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:00,671
No, I don't smell smoke.
The building isn't on fire.

1048
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:03,045
Stop the wheezing, will you?

1049
01:17:03,116 --> 01:17:07,450
Please stop! First you wheeze,
then hiccup, then wheeze again!

1050
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:10,081
You're enough to drive anybody nuts!

1051
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,125
- I am, am I?
- Yes!

1052
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,592
Well, you're my boss.

1053
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:16,526
Maybe I shouldn't say this,

1054
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:19,794
but you've been complaining
ever since we've been up here.

1055
01:17:19,866 --> 01:17:22,130
If you don't like the way
I wheeze and hiccup,

1056
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:24,693
why don't you go find
your own ledge to stand on?

1057
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:26,966
What?

1058
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,477
Maybe they're coming to rescue us.

1059
01:17:35,549 --> 01:17:38,985
They're not coming to rescue us.
That's our news helicopter.

1060
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:41,111
Our own network is taking pictures of us?

1061
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:43,179
That's exactly what I mean.

1062
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:46,522
We interrupt to bring you
a newscast of a suicide try

1063
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:49,721
on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.

1064
01:17:49,796 --> 01:17:53,232
Isn't it sad how many nuts
are running around loose today?

1065
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,165
It certainly is, sweetheart.

1066
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:58,227
Our special UBC helicopter
enables us to bring you

1067
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:01,365
an exclusive close-up view
of the pair attempting suicide.

1068
01:18:01,441 --> 01:18:03,500
These pictures, live from the scene.

1069
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:06,512
There you are.
Another first for UBC.

1070
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,480
No!

1071
01:18:18,358 --> 01:18:21,225
Now I've had experience
of this type of thing before.

1072
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:23,661
Anything can make them panicky and jump.

1073
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,960
May I have the mike, please?

1074
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:27,898
Now, gentlemen, remain calm.

1075
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:30,095
No problem can't be solved.

1076
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,604
Will you listen to me,
gentlemen, now? I repeat:

1077
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:35,005
There is no problem
that cannot be solved.

1078
01:18:35,075 --> 01:18:37,202
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

1079
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,939
Sounds like some kind
of a foreign language.

1080
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:42,777
Now, it must be very cold up there.

1081
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:44,908
Why don't you go in and get some coffee?

1082
01:18:44,985 --> 01:18:47,613
It's Father O'Leary
from St. Timothy's.

1083
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:49,019
What's he doing here?

1084
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:52,024
He probably came over
to talk us out of suicide.

1085
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:54,754
He can talk me out of it real easy.

1086
01:18:54,828 --> 01:18:56,659
Now hang on, men.

1087
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,995
- Hang on for one more minute.
- The life net's ready now.

1088
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,535
Good. Very good.
Come with me, Vince.

1089
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:05,628
I'm ruined. I'm ruined!

1090
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:07,867
What's Crampton gonna say?

1091
01:19:07,941 --> 01:19:09,636
You lame brain.

1092
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:13,168
You thick-skulled, pin-headed,
dim-witted bumbler!

1093
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,075
Hey, boss, look. A net.

1094
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:23,182
You don't suppose they expect us to jump?

1095
01:19:23,256 --> 01:19:26,555
No, that's probably
just there for safety.

1096
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:29,424
If Father O'Leary gets up here,

1097
01:19:29,496 --> 01:19:32,624
I'm gonna have him
sneak me out the back way.

1098
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,601
I helped him with his bazaar last year.

1099
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:39,833
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Stop right
where you are. Don't move!

1100
01:19:39,906 --> 01:19:43,000
- Father O'Leary!
- Where?

1101
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:45,601
I wanted to go out the back way!

1102
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:46,976
Over that way!

1103
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:49,675
That's it.

1104
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:55,745
Ease it over here.

1105
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:00,916
Why would he try to commit suicide?

1106
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:06,189
Get the chimp!
Get the chimp! It's not bananas!

1107
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:07,995
It's not bananas, it's the chimp!

1108
01:20:08,068 --> 01:20:11,401
He picks the shows, believe me.
He knows. It's the chimp.

1109
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:14,907
Bananas don't have anything
to do with it. Get the chimp.

1110
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:19,469
It's the chimp.
He's the one. Help! Help!

1111
01:20:20,447 --> 01:20:23,314
There was a chimp,

1112
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:26,910
came down the building before
they discovered those guys up there.

1113
01:20:26,987 --> 01:20:28,648
It belonged to Steven Post.

1114
01:20:28,722 --> 01:20:30,952
Steven Post?
The TV wonder boy?

1115
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:33,584
- There's the other one.
- This one was out with him.

1116
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,457
What were you doing up there?

1117
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,554
I was walking along on the tenth floor

1118
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:39,531
and I seen this nut out on the ledge.

1119
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:42,432
So I went out there to try
to talk him out of jumping.

1120
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:44,936
- Then this window got stuck...
- Wait a minute.

1121
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:47,701
You didn't happen to see him.
You work for Wilbanks.

1122
01:20:47,774 --> 01:20:50,800
- Everyone knows that. Come on.
- Talk him out of jumping?

1123
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:53,505
Please, what are you talking about?

1124
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,377
All right!
Hold it! Hold it!

1125
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:58,077
Look. We're gonna arrive
at the truth of this thing,

1126
01:20:58,151 --> 01:21:00,346
so you might as well tell us now.

1127
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:05,050
Well, my boss wanted me to
help him get this kid's chimp.

1128
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:08,458
The chimp belongs to Steven Post?
What'd he want him for?

1129
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:11,759
Come on! Out with it!

1130
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:14,198
Well, it sounds kinda crazy but,

1131
01:21:14,267 --> 01:21:17,566
my boss thinks the chimp
can pick the best TV shows.

1132
01:21:17,637 --> 01:21:21,095
Pretty funny?

1133
01:21:39,559 --> 01:21:41,151
- Excuse me!
- Yeah, what?

1134
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:44,026
This story about a chimp
selecting our TV shows.

1135
01:21:44,097 --> 01:21:48,033
- What about it?
- Well, do you believe it?

1136
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:51,764
Of course, I believe it.
I knew it all the time.

1137
01:21:57,444 --> 01:21:58,877
Madam?

1138
01:21:58,945 --> 01:22:02,346
What do you think of the rumor
of a chimp selecting our TV shows?

1139
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:05,578
A chimp picking TV shows?
Ridiculous.

1140
01:22:05,652 --> 01:22:07,916
Well, you know
how those rumors get started.

1141
01:22:07,988 --> 01:22:09,615
- I know I...
- Wait a minute!

1142
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:13,716
Those stations have been switching and
canceling my favorite shows for years.

1143
01:22:13,793 --> 01:22:16,284
Maybe a chimp is behind this mess.

1144
01:22:16,363 --> 01:22:17,455
- No.
- It's a plot.

1145
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:19,590
- You're all in on it.
- We have nothing...

1146
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:22,396
I am so sick and tired of liking a show

1147
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:25,461
and having it pulled off
the air or put in another time.

1148
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,200
- Madam...
- It drives you crazy.

1149
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:31,370
I'm getting to the point, I'd like to
take the TV and throw it out the window.

1150
01:22:31,444 --> 01:22:33,639
The last show I liked,
they took off the air.

1151
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:37,080
The minute I got to like it, off the
air. How do I know what happened?

1152
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,845
I don't know what happened to John.

1153
01:22:46,393 --> 01:22:49,226
Has the man from the Justice
Department arrived yet?

1154
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:50,957
- Everybody's here, sir.
- Good.

1155
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:52,293
That's good.

1156
01:23:02,676 --> 01:23:05,372
Gentlemen, television
has had problems before.

1157
01:23:05,445 --> 01:23:07,709
We can work this one out
if we keep cool heads!

1158
01:23:09,716 --> 01:23:12,480
"Keep cool heads."

1159
01:23:12,552 --> 01:23:17,387
Your Wilbanks says you've
got a monkey picking programs,

1160
01:23:17,457 --> 01:23:20,290
and you want us
to "keep cool heads."

1161
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,158
- I was delirious.
- Don't give us that!

1162
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,993
For ten years you've been
the third-rated network.

1163
01:23:26,066 --> 01:23:29,467
Suddenly, you jump to number one.
Now, there has to be a reason.

1164
01:23:29,536 --> 01:23:31,663
You don't have the personnel to do that.

1165
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:34,138
Just a minute.
I've plenty of personnel.

1166
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:35,435
- I have...
- Shut up.

1167
01:23:35,508 --> 01:23:38,409
Mr. Crampton.
We've had a tacit understanding

1168
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:40,912
to share technological advances.

1169
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:43,882
It seems to me that you've
betrayed that understanding.

1170
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:46,510
- We have not.
- Just a minute.

1171
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:49,020
I must speak for the Justice Department.

1172
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:52,855
We can have no understandings
between networks,

1173
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:55,759
- tacit or otherwise.
- Come on, Harry.

1174
01:23:55,829 --> 01:23:59,492
How can the Department call
a little chimpanzee a tech...

1175
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:02,660
- So there's a chimp.
- Then there is a chimp?

1176
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:07,604
Gentlemen, please.

1177
01:24:07,674 --> 01:24:09,904
Admittedly, there is a chimp.

1178
01:24:09,976 --> 01:24:11,910
And he does like TV.

1179
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:14,776
And it seems he does
prefer the top-rated shows.

1180
01:24:14,848 --> 01:24:18,614
And he does go to the refrigerator
and get a beer during the commercials.

1181
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:22,246
Gentlemen!

1182
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:28,356
If the American people ever
found out that a chimpanzee

1183
01:24:28,428 --> 01:24:33,593
was selecting programs,
it would be the end of TV.

1184
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:35,225
Gentlemen.

1185
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:39,135
I have a simple solution
to the whole problem.

1186
01:24:39,205 --> 01:24:44,074
- Yes?
- We must destroy the chimp.

1187
01:24:44,144 --> 01:24:47,079
No, no.
I can't see it at all.

1188
01:24:48,114 --> 01:24:50,708
- We can't do that.
- No. We couldn't...

1189
01:24:50,784 --> 01:24:54,811
Why, we'd have those societies for the
prevention of things all over our backs.

1190
01:24:54,888 --> 01:24:57,220
That would be the end
of our dog food accounts.

1191
01:24:57,290 --> 01:25:00,817
- I think I have an idea.
- I hope it's better than the bananas.

1192
01:25:00,894 --> 01:25:03,055
It's practical and humane.

1193
01:25:03,129 --> 01:25:06,223
You see, a chimp belongs in a
jungle, not in a network office.

1194
01:25:06,299 --> 01:25:08,767
We know that, Dr. Schmidt.
That's the problem.

1195
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:12,032
What we do is buy the chimp,
return him to the jungle.

1196
01:25:12,105 --> 01:25:14,869
He'll be happy, the networks
will continue on as usual

1197
01:25:14,941 --> 01:25:17,808
and we will be rid of
Steven Post once and for all!

1198
01:25:17,877 --> 01:25:19,777
Brilliant, Schmidt, brilliant.

1199
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:22,007
Bravo! Beautiful!
That's the one.

1200
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:26,280
We certainly have the money.
And every man has his price.

1201
01:25:32,258 --> 01:25:36,456
So that's what they think?
Every man's got his price.

1202
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:39,396
Well, don't worry. I don't.

1203
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,201
Steve, why don't we take him
and blow this place?

1204
01:25:43,269 --> 01:25:44,668
Forget this whole rat race.

1205
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:47,502
I don't want them to put him in a jungle.

1206
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:52,341
Jen, they can't get to me.
I can't be bought.

1207
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:56,572
$500,000.

1208
01:25:57,751 --> 01:25:59,150
Right.

1209
01:26:00,353 --> 01:26:04,016
$500,000. That's a...
That's a lot of money.

1210
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:07,787
Well, of course it's a lot of money.
How can you even hesitate?

1211
01:26:07,861 --> 01:26:10,887
- Well, I don't know...
- Your future is on the line.

1212
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:12,261
Now you listen to this.

1213
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:14,994
You turn us down,
you'll never work again.

1214
01:26:15,068 --> 01:26:18,629
Come on. Be smart, boy.

1215
01:26:20,273 --> 01:26:22,833
- I... I have a problem.
- A problem?

1216
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:25,537
Yes, sir. You see, someone else
is involved and I...

1217
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,807
Son, no more bickering.
All right.

1218
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:31,146
This will be our final offer.
Take it or leave it.

1219
01:26:31,217 --> 01:26:33,276
One million dollars.

1220
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:43,385
One million dollars.

1221
01:27:05,718 --> 01:27:07,913
You did it.

1222
01:27:08,588 --> 01:27:12,285
- You took the money.
- One million dollars, Jen.

1223
01:27:13,526 --> 01:27:15,756
You know what they're
going to do with him.

1224
01:27:16,362 --> 01:27:18,091
It was take it or leave it.

1225
01:27:18,164 --> 01:27:21,827
Besides, maybe a chimp
does belong in the jungle.

1226
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:25,769
- Not that one.
- Jen.

1227
01:27:26,673 --> 01:27:31,576
We can get married now.
We've got everything.

1228
01:27:33,413 --> 01:27:36,041
I thought we did for a while.

1229
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:38,715
Now we have nothing.

1230
01:27:41,721 --> 01:27:44,713
I don't even think
I like you very much anymore.

1231
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:48,614
Boss. What I don't
understand is why do you have to go?

1232
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:51,623
Well, it's just too important a mission

1233
01:28:51,691 --> 01:28:53,921
to trust to, underlings.

1234
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:56,553
Yeah, but all
the other networks are here.

1235
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:59,792
I get it.
You don't trust each other.

1236
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:04,066
Well, of course we trust each other.

1237
01:29:04,137 --> 01:29:07,072
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

1238
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:10,735
It's just that we're getting together
to have a little, outing.

1239
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,472
Yes. And you're in charge
while we're gone.

1240
01:29:13,546 --> 01:29:16,276
Me in charge?
You're kidding?

1241
01:29:16,349 --> 01:29:18,783
We've never been more serious!

1242
01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:21,718
Well, what am I supposed to do?

1243
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:25,485
Absolutely nothing. If anyone asks a
question, you don't know the answer.

1244
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:27,924
Anyone wants a decision, stall.

1245
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:31,395
Don't do anything at all!
Do you think you can handle that?

1246
01:29:31,464 --> 01:29:33,455
Yeah.

1247
01:29:43,676 --> 01:29:45,268
Now what?

1248
01:29:48,715 --> 01:29:51,684
Mr. Wilbanks,
can I talk to you for a minute?

1249
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:54,015
- About what?
- Well...

1250
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:56,715
You see, I was wondering
if maybe you'd reconsider.

1251
01:29:56,789 --> 01:29:59,849
I give you the million dollars back,
you give me the chimp?

1252
01:29:59,926 --> 01:30:03,987
Well, certainly not, Post.
Are you crazy? A deal is a deal.

1253
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:07,794
- That's all there is to it!
- Of all the nerve!

1254
01:30:44,037 --> 01:30:45,368
All set, Uncle.

1255
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:49,397
Mertons is in charge till we get
back. Help him all you can.

1256
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:52,735
Mertons is in charge?

1257
01:30:58,284 --> 01:31:00,980
Now, open the door, Roger.

1258
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:27,342
Gee, I'm sorry, Steve.

1259
01:31:27,413 --> 01:31:30,007
But I guess you can't have everything.

1260
01:31:31,017 --> 01:31:34,646
Boy, I'd sure do it different
if I had another chance.

1261
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:53,962
Boy, you gentlemen sure
picked an isolated spot.

1262
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,941
I don't think this place
has ever been explored.

1263
01:31:57,009 --> 01:31:59,910
Well, don't worry, about the chimp.

1264
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:02,140
He's used to fending for himself.

1265
01:32:02,215 --> 01:32:04,115
Okay, if you'll clear this area,

1266
01:32:04,183 --> 01:32:07,949
I'm gonna open this and there's gonna
be suction. I don't want to lose you.

1267
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,181
Right. We'll watch it from back there.

1268
01:32:10,256 --> 01:32:13,555
Okay, take it easy back there, gentlemen?

1269
01:32:13,626 --> 01:32:16,823
And by all means, don't
touch any of those levers.

1270
01:32:16,896 --> 01:32:20,491
Don't worry about that chute. It's
guaranteed to open in ten seconds.

1271
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:23,034
Don't touch that lever..

1272
01:32:23,102 --> 01:32:26,128
That's a no-no.
Don't do that. No, no, no.

1273
01:32:26,205 --> 01:32:28,571
- Are you comfortable, chief?
- Just fine.

1274
01:32:28,641 --> 01:32:30,905
As soon as the chimp is out,
we'll have lunch.

1275
01:32:30,977 --> 01:32:32,911
- That'll be nice.
- All right.

1276
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:34,674
Here we go. Open up.

1277
01:32:34,747 --> 01:32:37,978
Out we go. Jump. Jump.

1278
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,348
When you throw him out,

1279
01:32:40,419 --> 01:32:43,252
be sure you throw him far enough
so he's in the pictures!

1280
01:32:43,322 --> 01:32:45,950
Here we go. Out we go. No?

1281
01:32:46,025 --> 01:32:48,721
- Will you throw him out?
- I don't think he wants to go.

1282
01:32:48,794 --> 01:32:52,161
I don't think he wants to go.
Put your foot out. Here we go.

1283
01:32:52,231 --> 01:32:55,166
- Get rid of him!
- Foot up. Come on. Get out.

1284
01:33:02,008 --> 01:33:04,374
Mr. Crampton!

1285
01:33:04,443 --> 01:33:07,503
Mr. Crampton!

1286
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:40,501
I think I can explain this, guys.

1287
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:45,108
We were cruising up there
at 2,000 feet, and the wind...

1288
01:34:04,637 --> 01:34:07,697
Hello? Steve!

1289
01:34:07,773 --> 01:34:10,640
Yeah. Yeah. I...

1290
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:14,077
I seem to be calling
for a friend of yours.

1291
01:34:14,146 --> 01:34:16,979
Say, this is gonna be hard to believe

1292
01:34:17,049 --> 01:34:19,745
but you remember that chance
you were talking about?

1293
01:34:19,819 --> 01:34:22,617
Well, ya got it!

1294
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:24,815
Yeah!

1295
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:28,621
It was that simple. I gave Mertons
the million, and he gave me the chimp.

1296
01:34:28,694 --> 01:34:31,128
It must have been tough
to give up all that money.

1297
01:34:31,197 --> 01:34:35,258
Mertons needed it to finance a force
to find Wilbanks and the rest of them.

1298
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:38,770
You know, when you think about
it, it wasn't even my money.

1299
01:34:38,838 --> 01:34:41,898
It was yours. He's your chimp.

1300
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:45,068
You mean, I gave up a million bucks?

1301
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:47,544
Yep.

1302
01:34:47,613 --> 01:34:51,743
You know what, Steve? I don't
even think we're gonna miss it.

1303
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:53,614
And now an exclusive.

1304
01:34:53,686 --> 01:34:56,382
Steven Post,
television's man of the year,

1305
01:34:56,455 --> 01:35:00,152
resigned his position today
as vice president of UBC,

1306
01:35:00,226 --> 01:35:02,786
and took as his bride,
Miss Jennifer Scott,

1307
01:35:02,862 --> 01:35:05,797
his private secretary
and childhood sweetheart.

1308
01:35:05,865 --> 01:35:08,265
Their honeymoon destination is unknown,

1309
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:10,427
but wherever they go, their many friends

1310
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:13,802
wish this storybook couple
the storybook ending:

1311
01:35:13,873 --> 01:35:17,070
That they live happily ever after.
