00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,503
Yeah, Eddie?

170
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:53,201
I've got it in front of me.
It's nothin' to worry about.

171
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:57,906
I just don't like these
enthusiastic amateurs.

172
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,575
Will you believe me?
He's gonna fade. He's a lightweight.

173
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:03,846
I hope you're right.

174
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,252
Haven't I always been so far?

175
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:10,122
You take care of everything over there,
I'll take care of this end, OK?

176
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:19,967
[Curator] We come now to
our always popular Borgia exhibit.

177
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:24,598
You remember that the Borgias
dealt in a most uncompromising way

178
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:29,338
with their enemies, frequently
lacing their wine with poison,

179
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:33,439
as we see here
in this charming little dinner party.

180
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:34,915
[Curator] On occasion,

181
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:38,977
they resorted to even more
drastic methods of dispatching a victim.

182
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:43,617
This painting illustrates a legend
that Lucrezia Borgia

183
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:48,494
once transformed
an unfaithful suitor into a dog.

184
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:50,998
Excuse me, uh, sir, but what's this ring

185
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,696
with what looks like
a bug or somethin' on it?

186
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,173
That's a scarab. The ancient Egyptians
employed it often as a talisman.

187
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:02,803
You'll notice in the painting,
Lucrezia's wearing the same ring.

188
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,814
According to the legend,
her powers of transmutation

189
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,907
stemmed directly from it.

190
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,578
This may or may not be,
but the museum has seen fit

191
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:13,213
to put further safeguards on it.

192
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,689
The last curator of the museum,
Dr. Plumcott

193
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,386
told me of an incident
you'd find hard to accept

194
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,363
since it defies scientific explanation.

195
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,401
Is this valuable?

196
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,767
It'd be impossible to estimate its value.

197
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:31,306
The ring is priceless.

198
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:35,777
[Curator] We'd best be moving along if
we're to finish the tour before closing.

199
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,761
- It's a piece of junk.
- Junk? What do you mean, junk?

200
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:59,562
The curator at the museum
said this was priceless.

201
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:01,728
And priceless is a lot of loot.

202
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,034
This dame, Lucy "Borgeria,"

203
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,971
used to doll up with this garbage.

204
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,942
- Borgia.
- Her too.

205
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,444
This was one of her prized possessions.

206
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,640
She wore this only on state occasions.

207
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:15,240
Who am I gonna sell it to?
Another museum?

208
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,378
Diamond rings, emerald rings,
those things I can move.

209
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,479
- Make us an offer, Mr. Roschak.
- A grand. Yeah.

210
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:22,888
Get outta here.

211
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,826
Anything. We gotta make a livin',
like the next guy.

212
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:29,558
I told you, there is no market
for beetle rings. Get lost.

213
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:40,999
Oh, boy. Uh...
Gingerbread Rocky Road slush.

214
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,442
Uh...

215
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:46,003
Kumquat Bavarian chocolate
with lime mint and, uh...

216
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,106
Don't tell me.

217
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,244
Pine-scented gooseberry.

218
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,015
That's only 43.

219
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,579
You sure?

220
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,124
I was counting.

221
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,888
What'd I leave out?
Don't tell me. I know.

222
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,492
Oh, boy. Uh...

223
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:03,191
Let's see now.

224
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,332
Avocado surprise.
Well, what'll it be?

225
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,371
Vanilla.

226
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,338
Vanilla.

227
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,103
I run through 44 flavors,
you come up with vanilla.

228
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,843
What an imagination.

229
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,973
You want any marshmallow on that?
Chocolate sprinkles?

230
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,683
Any gum balls or anything in it?

231
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,119
Just the vanilla.

232
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:33,022
Vanilla. Here you go. 15 cents.

233
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:34,926
Pennies. Swell.

234
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:38,489
My dad's gonna be on TV tonight.
Don't forget to vote for him.

235
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,535
Swell.

236
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:44,740
You know what a dime looks like?

237
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,367
Little silver thing you can carry around.

238
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:54,714
If I have to run through 44 flavors
for that kid again, I'll go banana nut.

239
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:58,015
How do you like that?
Only gave me 14.

240
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,247
[Dog barks]

241
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,152
Let him go.

242
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:20,068
- Where do these go?
- Back in the truck.

243
00:16:20,142 --> 00:16:24,010
It needs to have that barren look,
showing the ravages of crime.

244
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,411
Could have some impact.

245
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:29,349
His wife is also his campaign manager,
so try to keep the lid on her.

246
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:30,646
Campaign manager?

247
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,348
She's more like Sarah Bernhardt
in "Housekeeping Can be Fun".

248
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:36,391
Wait a minute. What is that?

249
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,924
That's Daniels' kid.

250
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:41,622
Try to work him in.
We'd like to show the family.

251
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:43,187
Yeah?

252
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:46,962
- My husband's always been civic-minded.
- That's true.

253
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:50,267
But when I pointed out
the challenges that lay ahead, he...

254
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,433
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

255
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:58,947
You're acting like Sarah Bernhardt
starring in "Housekeeping Can Be Fun".

256
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,381
We do not eat junk foods
in this house between meals.

257
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,920
- Since when?
- Since we're gonna be on TV.

258
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,980
Which tie do you like?
The navy blue or the navy blue?

259
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,889
- The navy blue.
- Thank you.

260
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,451
You're not going to wear that shirt
on the show.

261
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,293
Brian, change your shirt.

262
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:19,391
- Change your shirt.
- [Radio] Prescott Museum robbery.

263
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,266
The exact value of the ring
has not been determined.

264
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:23,996
You could use that in your...

265
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:27,941
...it was one of the museum's
most valuable pieces.

266
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,741
If I get cauliflower ear,
it's gonna be your fault.

267
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:33,145
Wilby, what's wrong?

268
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,843
That could be the Borgia ring they stole.

269
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:37,510
The Borgia ring?

270
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:39,247
It's the one that...

271
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,356
- Brian, why aren't you in school?
- It's summer vacation.

272
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,588
Go straighten your room up, OK?

273
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:49,597
I straightened it up last month.

274
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:53,294
Then change your shirt like Mom...
Because I said so.

275
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,998
Rejections will make me grow up
to be inhibited and a non-achiever,

276
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,131
and it'll be his fault.

277
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:04,869
- Just say it.
- I'm not sure you'd understand.

278
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:09,111
- I'll understand.
- I'm really not so sure...

279
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,652
You'd understand.

280
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:14,588
When I was a teenager, I...

281
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:17,717
accidentally took an old ring
from the Prescott Museum.

282
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,523
There was a strange
Latin inscription on it.

283
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,393
Like what?

284
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:24,193
I'd rather not say.

285
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,397
Anyway, when I found the ring at home, I...

286
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,040
I read the inscription a couple times...

287
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,439
And?

288
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,412
And I turned into a dog.

289
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:43,209
[Laughs] Oh, Wilby.

290
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:47,381
There was a big shaggy dog next door,
and I became that dog.

291
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:50,752
Wilby, uh...

292
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:54,054
are you sure you're feeling all right?

293
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,858
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

294
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:58,399
I'm glad you did because sometimes,

295
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:01,493
we let little things nag at us
when it's nothing.

296
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,973
Do you realize if someone reads that
inscription I could turn into a dog?

297
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,702
I love that tie on you.

298
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:11,041
It just brings out the color in your eyes.

299
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,546
Did you hear what I said?

300
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,276
Yes, I did.

301
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,649
We're just going to pretend
that you never said it.

302
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,556
Excuse me, sir.

303
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:25,060
Me?

304
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:28,029
Forgive me, but might I have
a moment of your time?

305
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,032
Allow me to introduce myself.

306
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,728
Dr. Sturdivant,
on sabbatical from the Sorbonne.

307
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:36,260
Oh, I'm Tim, the ice cream man
from Dolly Dixon's.

308
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:40,139
I seem to have overextended myself
in my travels

309
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,704
and I find that I'm temporarily
financially embarrassed.

310
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,874
- If you know what I mean.
- No.

311
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,250
Therefore, I am forced to part
with this family heirloom

312
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:54,017
at a fraction of its real value.

313
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:56,820
Oh.

314
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:58,588
It's a ring.

315
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:00,493
Very discerning of you, sir.

316
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,997
It's also a princely relic of antiquity.

317
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:05,364
Yeah? Is it?

318
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,562
Gee, I wonder if Katrinka'd like that.

319
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:08,934
Katrinka?

320
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:13,032
Katrinka Muggelberg.
She's in pies down at Dolly's.

321
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:14,406
This is her right here.

322
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:17,002
She's captain
of the Southside Steamrollers.

323
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,173
Cute little thing, isn't she?

324
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,876
Isn't she, though?

325
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,614
I'm sure a lady like her would be
simply enchanted by that ring.

326
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,680
- You think so?
- In fact...

327
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:32,160
her gratitude would be unbounded.

328
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:34,059
Unbounded?

329
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:38,026
Yeah. Gee, how much you want
for that thing?

330
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:44,131
Well, circumstances force me
to sacrifice it for $500.

331
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,406
$500... dollars.

332
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:49,536
Dollars?

333
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:51,011
Yes.

334
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,273
Oh, well, uh...

335
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,945
I was lookin' for a blue one.

336
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,715
$500.

337
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,949
Would you spring for five bucks, mac?

338
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:03,083
Five bucks?

339
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,922
Oh.

340
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,929
It does have a little
blue in it, doesn't it?

341
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:11,326
Say, you take pennies?

342
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,494
25...

343
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,300
Now, you just be yourself there,
Mr. Daniels.

344
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,364
I'll ask your wife a few questions,

345
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,705
then we'll bring the cameras into the den.

346
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,507
- Sort of surprise you at work.
- All right, places.

347
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:28,139
Five, four...

348
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:32,177
three, two, one.

349
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:33,517
You're on the air.

350
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,388
Welcome to "Meet Your Candidate".

351
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,919
This morning we're going to meet
Wilby Daniels and his family.

352
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,522
Mr. Daniels is the man
who many people feel,

353
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,091
is undertaking the impossible task

354
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,299
of trying to unseat
long-established D.A. John Slade.

355
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:54,139
My name is Wilby Daniels, and I'd like
to take this opportunity to...

356
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,203
- Brian, don't stare at me, all right?
- I wasn't staring.

357
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,680
Hello.

358
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:05,118
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce myself.

359
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,156
My name is...

360
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:13,726
[announcer] But the name John Slade
is familiar in this town.

361
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,061
It may be difficult
for the man at the polls

362
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:18,828
to switch from long-established
voting habits

363
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:22,133
to put an unknown man
in this responsible office.

364
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:25,174
Oh, here's Mrs. Daniels now.

365
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,573
- How do you do, Mrs. Daniels?
- How do you do?

366
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:31,410
We understand you're
Mr. Daniels' campaign manager.

367
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:34,279
[Mrs. Daniels] I felt it
incumbent upon myself,

368
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,148
as a wife and as a woman,

369
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,919
to place my shoulder to the wheel
alongside my husband,

370
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:46,792
and I urged him to pick up the gauntlet
that lay before him.

371
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:51,732
And I assured him that as his wife
and his counselor,

372
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:54,668
I would be by his side

373
00:22:54,737 --> 00:23:00,141
down the long, dark corridor
that lay ahead.

374
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,475
What do you do when you're not
running his campaign?

375
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:07,175
I love to paint and I read.

376
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:13,983
I, uh... I find the Lake poets
very, uh... scintillating.

377
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,827
I wonder what that guy meant.

378
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:21,989
"Her gratitude will be unbounded."

379
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:25,159
Pretty sharp, huh?
Hey, look.

380
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:27,430
There's some writing on the back.

381
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:34,205
"In canis corpore transmuto."

382
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,709
Wonder what that means?

383
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,180
I'll tell Katrinka it's "I love you"
in Swahili. She won't know.

384
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:45,347
Fellow citizens, for many years now...

385
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:47,286
You're getting a little gray, Dad.

386
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:50,215
Fellow citizens...

387
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,231
No!

388
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,304
You look just like Elwood.

389
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,539
I am Elwood.

390
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:13,878
Elwood? Elwood?

391
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,953
And now I'd like you to meet...

392
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,512
Stay, Pop.

393
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,358
Brian, where's your father?

394
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,756
Uh, he had to go.

395
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,703
- Go get Daniels.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:37,865
Well, we'll meet Mr. Daniels later.

397
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:41,035
This, I presume, is your son Brian
and the family dog.

398
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,078
Mrs. Daniels?

399
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,517
What's the dog's name?

400
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:52,248
- Bowser.
- Elwood.

401
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:53,888
How's that?

402
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:57,024
- Uh, Elwood.
- Bowser.

403
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,960
He'll answer to almost anything.
Won't you, old boy?

404
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,724
Does your dog do any tricks?

405
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,891
Well, I guess so.

406
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,426
Sure.

407
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:08,026
No.

408
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:09,594
Who said "no"?

409
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:12,072
We're picking up a ghost somewhere.

410
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:16,908
Seems to be several opinions here.
Does he or doesn't he do tricks?

411
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:19,971
No tricks.

412
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,210
- There it is again.
- Come on boy, speak.

413
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:23,752
Speak, boy.

414
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,253
Come on, boy, speak.

415
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:29,648
Come on. Speak.

416
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,626
- Speak, boy. Come on.
- Woof.

417
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:33,286
Woof?

418
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:34,591
Woof?

419
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:38,267
This has gotta be costing Daniels votes.

420
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:42,034
Loni, get Daniels or we'll
have to leave the air.

421
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,733
Elwood!

422
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,332
[Whistles]

423
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,676
Elwood.

424
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:52,839
Hey, Elwood.

425
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,544
Hey!

426
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:58,952
Elwood! That's not your house.

427
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,649
[Wilby] I gotta get outta here.

428
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:01,815
Elwood!

429
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:04,553
Hey, watch out!

430
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:10,156
I've had enough of this.

431
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:15,631
Elwood!

432
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:20,471
I'm sorry, Admiral.
I was just chasing Elwood.

433
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:23,910
Why don't you stop by the truck,
I'll get you a free rum baba.

434
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:25,678
Elwood!

435
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:28,342
[Admiral] Out of my flowers,
you molting rug.

436
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:29,885
That goes for you too.

437
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,283
Hold it, Elwood.

438
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:35,347
Just leaving port, Admiral.

439
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,484
If I catch you in my flowers again,

440
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,927
I'll put you both in dry dock for a month.

441
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:42,988
Get in there, Elwood.

442
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,463
I don't know what's gotten into you.
You really made the admiral mad.

443
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:52,498
You know you ruined his flowers.
You're lucky I don't spank you.

444
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:56,204
Stop this truck. Let me out of here
or I'm gonna deck ya.

445
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,043
After all I've done for you,
is that any way to talk?

446
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:01,743
You got a lot of nerve
talkin' to me like...

447
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:06,815
Elwood, how'd you learn to talk?

448
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:10,347
I started out with "ga-ga,"
and worked my way up to "din-din."

449
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:12,789
He can talk.

450
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,830
Do that again. Say "ga-ga."

451
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:16,194
"Ga-ga."

452
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:17,664
Say "din-din."

453
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:19,065
"Din-din."

454
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:22,298
- [Wilby] What's the use?
- I don't believe this. Wait.

455
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:25,363
If you can talk like that,
we can get into show business.

456
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:28,535
We can make a fortune.
We can get on TV, too.

457
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:32,741
You can have your own talk show.
"Here's Elwood!" We can make millions.

458
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:37,184
Of course, I want to be fair about this,
so I figure I'll give you 10%.

459
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,619
What do you think? Elwood.

460
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:44,292
Hey, Elwood, wait a minute.
I'll tell you what. I'll give you 20%.

461
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,295
You can have steak every night.
Wait a minute. Elwood!

462
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,167
Elwood! Elwood!

463
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:06,641
- [Woman screams]
- Sorry, ma'am. Elwood!

464
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:13,513
Elwood?
You hear me? Elwood!

465
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:16,553
[Dog barks]

466
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,617
[Wilby] Oh, no.

467
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:20,093
Stay, boy.

468
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,928
Nice dog.

469
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,093
Nice doggy.

470
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,601
Watch out.
Now, wait a minute.

471
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:35,041
That smarts.
Don't do that.

472
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:46,477
Nice dog.
You can have your house back now.

473
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:50,558
Nice doggie.
Just relax now.

474
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:52,184
[Dog barks and growls]

475
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,030
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Can you run a commercial?

476
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:03,333
We ran eight commercials,
two standbys and a test pattern.

477
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:04,566
There's Pop now.

478
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,741
Places, everybody.

479
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,779
- Cameras on the door here.
- On the door.

480
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,246
Faster, Pop.

481
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:22,786
Hi, there.

482
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:28,525
My name is Wilby Daniels
and if I'm elected your D.A.,

483
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:31,032
I promise to bring order out of chaos.

484
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,568
And I further promise that if elected,

485
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:36,571
I will call for an immediate
grand jury investigation

486
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,699
into links between a known felon,
Eddie Roschak,

487
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:42,972
and the incumbent District Attorney,
John Slade.

488
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:50,878
There's been a dramatic increase
in the crime rate.

489
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,648
My first...

490
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,623
I know what you're gonna say, Eddie,
and I keep tellin' you,

491
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:00,491
you got absolutely nothing to worry about.

492
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:03,191
You say!
He's coming on awful strong.

493
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:07,669
- He's naming names. I don't like it.
- Talk's cheap.

494
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:10,501
He can make charges all day
but he's gotta prove 'em.

495
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:13,235
If he gets elected, we are in trouble.

496
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,176
- Both of us.
- He's not gonna get elected, Eddie.

497
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,145
Take my word.

498
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:22,284
You know, maybe Daniels could use
a little mud on him,

499
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:24,114
just as a precaution.

500
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,983
Mud? On Daniels?

501
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:30,116
Sure. Everybody's got a skeleton
in their closet. Everybody.

502
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:32,717
Get something on him.

503
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:36,253
Something that'll chop him off
right at the knees.

504
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:40,301
I don't want you runnin' away again.
We got too much at stake here.

505
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,238
Let's start your career by going to
Harry's Bar and getting some change.

506
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,969
Are you still mad over
the percentage split?

507
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:49,978
I'll make it 50-50.
This better be a good show.

508
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:55,545
- What do you say, Harry, old buddy?
- No dogs.

509
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:59,418
Just a minute, Harry. This is no dog.

510
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,683
Well, what is it?

511
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:04,454
Harry, this happens to be the world's
only talking dog.

512
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:07,553
Perhaps you didn't hear me. No dogs.

513
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,396
I'm telling you, this dog is as smart
as anybody in this place.

514
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,901
Out!

515
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,437
We're marching to different drums, Harry.

516
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:18,167
Just a minute. Elwood, come on.

517
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,401
Folks...

518
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:25,376
I have with me here today
Elwood, the talking dog.

519
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:29,484
I got five bucks that says
this dog can talk

520
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:31,520
as well as anyone in this room.

521
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,681
Do I have any takers?

522
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:35,451
Everybody in here's a chicken?

523
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,756
Oh, yeah?

524
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,818
Make it 20, buster.

525
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,497
20? You hear that, Elwood?

526
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:48,168
Okay, Harry, here you go.
You're covered on that.

527
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:51,674
OK, Elwood. Come on, boy, put 'em up.
Right up there.

528
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,233
Folks, this is Elwood, the talking dog.

529
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:59,304
He will now give his rendition
of "Mary Had A Little Lamb."

530
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,609
Elwood, take it away.

531
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,143
A little louder.

532
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,551
I'll just get him started.

533
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,220
Mary had a little lamb.

534
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:14,661
Its... Mary...

535
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:18,633
Look Elwood,
we got 20 bucks ridin' here, so...

536
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:20,828
could you just come up with it?
We, uh...

537
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:24,169
Just tell the folks how
you ask for your dinner.

538
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,229
Say "din-din."

539
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:31,807
Tell you what, tell Harry "ga-ga."
Just tell Harry "ga-ga."

540
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,348
Look.

541
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,748
Why don't you go down to the dog's bar

542
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:38,651
and see if he can get you to bark?

543
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,313
Just a minute now.

544
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,325
Tell you what, you move your lips
and I'll talk for you.

545
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:46,829
Just watch this.
Mary had a little lamb.

546
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,057
Its fleece was white as snow.

547
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:51,430
Everywhere that Mary...

548
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,298
They're not buyin' it, Elwood.

549
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:01,070
20 bucks.

550
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,581
This is serious.

551
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:12,120
That ring is floating around someplace.

552
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:15,487
If somebody reads the inscription,
I'm a shaggy dog again.

553
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,423
Who knows when that will happen?

554
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,893
Maybe when you're taking
the oath of office.

555
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:23,126
- That'd be a crack-up.
- [Wilby] Very funny.

556
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:27,260
The prospect of my taking
an oath of office seems highly unlikely.

557
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:32,036
You can't go through life not knowing
when you'll turn into a dog. Right?

558
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,973
Right!

559
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:36,637
- We've got to find that ring.
- And find it fast.

560
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:39,181
Where do you start looking
for a hot ring, Pop?

561
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:42,581
Pawn shops, swap meets, places like that.

562
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:44,517
Admiral, I can't talk to you now.

563
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,521
I have some important things to do.

564
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:49,786
You're guest speaker
at the Daisies at eight bells.

565
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:53,454
I am here to see
that this time you're on time.

566
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:56,020
I'm sorry. I forgot.

567
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,626
[Mrs. Daniels] And I am
especially honored

568
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:03,798
to introduce our guest speaker
this afternoon,

569
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:06,273
our Daisy of the Day.

570
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:10,335
Because of the special attachment
I've had with this gentleman

571
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,938
over the last few years.

572
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,449
As you're all aware,

573
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:17,748
Mr. Daniels is running for
the office of District Attorney,

574
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,620
and I know whereof I speak
when I tell you that he is a man

575
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:24,592
of the highest moral fiber,

576
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,993
a man of unquestioned integrity

577
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:31,830
and a man dedicated to the task
that lies before him.

578
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:33,163
Mr. Daniels.

579
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:42,437
Thank you very much.

580
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,172
- How's it goin', Elwood?
- Hi, Katrinka.

581
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,481
We're out of kumquat and guava sherbet,
but the rest is here.

582
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,987
Fine. Say, Katrinka, I, uh...

583
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,183
I have a little something for you.

584
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:58,921
If it's another souvenir pillow
from Grand Rapids, forget it.

585
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:02,726
- Actually, it's a ring.
- Look, Jim...

586
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,892
- It's Tim.
- Yeah. Tim.

587
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,834
Just 'cause I waved at you once
at the roller games...

588
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,597
I've been meanin' to tell you,

589
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:13,039
you're the best darn skater
that the Steamrollers have.

590
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,407
Yeah, I know.

591
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,646
But like I say,
just 'cause I waved back at you,

592
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,410
don't mean it's ring time.

593
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:23,884
It's not a ring, actually.
It's just a present, that's all.

594
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:26,419
Here.

595
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:30,590
Just what I always wanted, a bug ring.

596
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,321
Where's the cracker jack?

597
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,522
What's this writing in here mean?

598
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:39,193
- I'm not sure.
- "In canis corpore transmuto."

599
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:42,203
"In canis corpore transmuto."

600
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:48,710
[Wilby] What can you, the voters, do
about this deplorable state of affairs?

601
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:51,906
Come election day,
vote those people out of office,

602
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:54,677
and bring back respectability
to this community.

603
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,446
Oh, thank you, Mr. Daniels.

604
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,182
Now, the song chairman will lead us
in a chorus of "The Daisy Hymn."

605
00:36:00,256 --> 00:36:02,247
All right, ladies.

606
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:05,522

- So, who do you like in the election?
- Daniels.

624
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:37,216
I agree, but he ain't got a chance
against Slade's machine.

625

♪ Down by the old mill stream

685

Everybody.

♪ Where I first met you

687
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,710
I think it'd be kinda nice if I helped you

688
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:28,444
and this albino footstool
to your truck, okay?

689
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:34,122
Let's talk this over.

690
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:39,654
I wanna tell you something.

691
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:43,597
That 40 bucks is comin' out
of your first million. Come on.

692
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:46,866
Maybe next time I should wear a disguise.

693
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:51,100
Next time, comb your hair.
That would be disguise enough.

694
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:53,802
How much do they want for the brooch?

695
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:57,312
We're not shopping for a brooch.
I've gotta find that ring.

696
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,349
- Before I turn into a dog again.
- All right, I'm sorry.

697
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,385
If you turn into a dog again,
can we go hunting together?

698
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:05,318
No, we cannot go hunting together.

699
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:07,618
Will you chase Mrs. Metzler's cat?

00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:17,158
I don't get much call for tomato licorice.

702
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm gonna let this one go to you
for just a nickel.

703
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:25,234
- Five pennies.
- What flavors you got, mister?

704
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:27,367
Oh, boy. Flavors.

705
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:32,107
You got your vanilla, chocolate,
strawberry, maple dribble, you got...

00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:33,876
What are you doin' around here?

707
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,214
I'm looking for a ring with a beetle on it.

708
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:38,913
Supposed to be a secret.

709
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:40,478
A ring with a beetle on it?

710
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:43,525
Gee, I gave one like that
to my girlfriend the other day.

711
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:44,582
You did?

712
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,061
She's not exactly my girlfriend.
You see...

713
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,119
Pop!

714
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:51,792
You don't have to spread it around.
Tattletale.

715
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:57,502
This gentleman unknowingly gave you
a ring that belongs to me.

716
00:42:57,573 --> 00:43:01,737
That is, I'm not the legal owner,
but I need it.

717
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:03,278
Tough.

718
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:06,838
This is a personal matter.
It'll have to wait till after work.

719
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,975
I'm prepared to offer a reward.

720
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:10,485
Like how much?

721
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:13,818
I get a quarter for cleaning the garage,
to give you an idea.

722
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,323
A thousand dollars.

723
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,792
A thousand dollars?
For that ring?

724
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:23,696
$2,000. It doesn't matter.
I just have to have that ring back.

725
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:27,327
You just got yourself a ring, buster.

726
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,199
Try the other hand.

727
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,642
I know I had it when I finished
the lemon meringues.

728
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,149
And then I...

729
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,185
Think.

730
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:45,311
Think $2,000.

731
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:48,186
If I find it, mister,
can I have the reward?

732
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:51,784
I don't care who gets the reward.
I just have to have that ring back.

733
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:56,526
Let me see.
I remember I put the ring on this shelf

734
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,658
after I finished the special order.

735
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,898
Could've fallen into the mixing vat.

736
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,104
What special order?

737
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,541
For the hotel. It's already gone out.

738
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:10,010
The hotel.

739
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:30,957
Honey?

740
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:34,833
If I find the ring,
could I keep the $2,000?

741
00:44:43,312 --> 00:44:45,007
No, this way.

742
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:53,549
[Excited screams]

743
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:10,771
Madam!

744
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,003
What is going on here?
Let me have that pie.

745
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,685
Ladies, please.
Stop this immediately.

746
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:27,655
Hit my girl with a pie, will ya?

747
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:31,386
[Auctioneer] Sold for $100.
Thanks, kids.

748
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,362
Remember, all proceeds
go to John Slade's war chest.

749
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:38,093
So let's all give big
for Honest John. Right?

750
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:43,236
- What is offered for this gorgeous pie?
- It's going very well.

751
00:45:43,306 --> 00:45:46,833
- Of course it's going well.
- Anyone else? $120. Thank you, sir.

752
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:48,467
$200.

753
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,104
Stop!

754
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:05,191
Ladies. Ladies.

755
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:08,556
Hold it. Hold it!

756
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:11,759
- Shut up.
- You won't find the ring this way.

757
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:14,563
That's my Pop.

758
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,500
You monster.

759
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,660
- Look at this.
- What?

760
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:45,223
That's the same ring you got in the museum.

761
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:48,361
Yeah. I wonder how it got
in this cherry pie?

762
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:51,804
What difference does it make?
You sold it once, sell it again.

763
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,474
Yeah.

764
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:59,842
- Sorry about the noise out there.
- I'll handle it myself.

765
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,380
[Auctioneer] I got $250.
I have $260. Any more?

766
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:08,685
Sometimes people forget their position.

767
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:15,928
- Things got a little out of hand.
- We were just looking for...

768
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:19,126
- It was not our intention to do this.
- Daniels!

769
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:21,601
This time you have gone too far.

770
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,198
You are a disgrace to your profession
and the entire city.

771
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:27,640
You should be run out of town.

772
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,749
Excuse me, sir,

773
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,983
but might I have a moment of your time?

774
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:44,253
Allow me to introduce myself.

775
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:47,228
I'm Dr. Sturdivant,
on sabbatical from the Sorbonne.

776
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,295
Since I find myself
temporarily out of funds,

777
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,029
I'm forced to part
with this family heirloom...

778
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,703
at a fraction of its real value.

779
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:02,107
I wonder if you might be interested
in this princely relic of antiquity.

780
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:05,606
I'm sure I would be.

781
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:22,255
- Come on.
- Okay.

782
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:29,763
I heard on the news you recovered
the ring from the Prescott museum.

783
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,170
What's it to you?

784
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,640
It's personal.
I need to talk to someone.

785
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,974
The lieutenant'll be out soon,
they're identifying it now.

786
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:39,674
- I can't take a chance...
- Wait over there.

787
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:50,720
This is the ring, all right.
No doubt about it.

788
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:53,887
I'm rather relieved just
to get it out of circulation.

789
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:57,524
It's reputed to have
rather supernatural powers.

790
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,067
You see this inscription.

791
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,628
What's it all mean?

792
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,570
There goes Pop again.

793
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,130
Oh, Wilby, no!

794
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,302
- [Policeman] Some kind of spell?
- [Curator] Exactly.

795
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:12,279
The Renaissance aristocrats
were partial to spells.

796
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:14,509
As good as poison any day.

797
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:21,688
All right, boy. Heel.

798
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:24,920
- [Curator] You remember Dr. Plumcott?
- [Policeman] Yes.

799
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:28,157
Well, he was most interested in this ring.

800
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,721
He told me of an incident, some years ago,

801
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,133
of a young man who was
actually turned into a dog

802
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:37,070
through the strange powers of this ring.

803
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,403
You don't really believe that.

804
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:42,239
Not really, but still I'm careful.

805
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:45,474
I don't like to repeat it too often
lest I become sensitized

806
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,413
and turn into a dog myself.

807
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,484
Daniels is a dog, huh?

808
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,855
That's right.
Sometimes Daniels is a real live dog.

809
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:00,623
And look. This ring does it.

810
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:04,727
Remember his TV show,
the one that we couldn't understand?

811
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:08,961
That dog was Daniels.

812
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:10,767
And it happened two other times.

813
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:16,278
At the Daisies, Daniels disappears
and that same shaggy dog shows up?

814
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,711
The same thing happens today
at the police station.

815
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:24,583
Daniels disappears,
and there's that same shaggy dog?

816
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:33,659
If you don't believe me,
get him over here and see for yourself!

817
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:46,465
Daniels, I want you to drop out of
the race. Use any excuse you want.

818
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:50,706
No way, Mr. D.A. I'm in this thing
to the finish. I don't make deals.

819
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:55,845
I'll tell you something else,
I'm gonna win this election.

820
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:59,183
My first act will be to
call a grand jury investigation

821
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,917
into your criminal connections
in this town.

822
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:05,983
If that's all we have to talk about,
our discussion is closed.

823
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:09,497
Is this the ring you were looking for
at my pie auction?

824
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,663
Yeah, that looks like it.

825
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:20,800
You're sure?
It has an inscription.

826
00:51:20,876 --> 00:51:24,209
- It says "canis corpore transmuto."
- Give me that!

827
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,578
"In canis corpore transmuto."

828
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,844
[Laughs]

829
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:36,249
Woof.

830
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,751
Grrrr.

831
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:41,996
- [Slade laughs]
- Oh.

832
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:45,230
Come in here, please.

833
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,967
Raymond, this dog has no license,

834
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:52,030
and is in violation of the leash law.
Call the pound.

835
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:56,066
I already did, sir.
The truck is waiting outside.

836
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:57,407
Get out of my way.

837
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:01,050
Grab that dog!

838
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,918
- [Wilby] Excuse me, ma'am.
- [Woman screams]

839
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,784
[Wilby] Watch out!

840
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,395
Oh, boy.

841
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,908
You! Follow that dog.

842
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,882
Right, Mr. Slade. Get going.

843
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,787
If he gets away, it's back
to the complaint desk for you.

844
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,483
It's the dog.

845
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,736
Thanks, pal.

846
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:40,874
Those idiots at the pound
don't know where he is,

847
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,181
but I'll tell you this, Chief.
That brute is mad and vicious.

848
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:48,213
I'm going to need the help
of every squad car to find him.

849
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,952
[Sirens]

850
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,833
- Could I ask you something, sir?
- Yes.

851
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,033
Why don't we make a public announcement

852
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,009

01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:16,054
No, you don't.

1026
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:18,725
Sit. Stay.

1027
01:07:25,273 --> 01:07:28,868
Okay, I'm with you guys.
We're breakin' outta here.

1028
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:36,176
Come on, gorgeous.

1029
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:38,284
Thanks, big boy.

1030
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:42,588
- Let's go, brother.
- We're never going to make it.

1031
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,928
- Make it fly, pal.
- Don't crowd me. I'm almost through.

1032
01:07:49,998 --> 01:07:52,432
Mr. Howie, your coffee's gettin' cold.

1033
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,027
Mr. Howie?

1034
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:00,773
What are you doing down there,
Mr. Howie?

1035
01:08:01,776 --> 01:08:04,438
That big dog told me to stay.

1036
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:10,875
[Dog #4] I'm through.

1037
01:08:12,253 --> 01:08:14,881
All right, everybody under the wall.

1038
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:19,587
Move it, shorty.

1039
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:28,235
And I'm sure the big dog
is in the kennel where he belongs.

1040
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,951
[Wilby] There's our getaway truck.
Follow me.

1041
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,079
Everybody in. I'm driving.

1042
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:51,491
Hurry up. Move.

1043
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:58,428
[Tires screech]

1044
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,299
[Phone rings]

1045
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:09,434
Animal shelter.

1046
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,707
- You received the governor's orders.
- Yes, sir.

1047
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,611
And you carried them out.

1048
01:09:14,682 --> 01:09:17,583
Well, um...

1049
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:19,882
- Did you or didn't you?
- We've, uh...

1050
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,548
We've had a breakout, sir.

1051
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:24,956
- A breakout?
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:29,053
All the dogs drove off in our truck.

1053
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,827
[Slade screams incoherently]

1054
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:49,912
[Dog #3] Well, now,
this is more like it, see?

1055
01:09:51,519 --> 01:09:54,249
It's sure great to be out again.
Right, Curly?

1056
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:55,616
Yeah, I guess so.

1057
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,955
What's the matter, sweetheart?
You sound down in the chops.

1058
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,756
There's a ring I need.

1059
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,127
Yeah? What kind of ring is that?

1060
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,031
Well, it's very old and has a beetle on it,

1061
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:09,434
and my opponent has it,
and I've got to get it.

1062
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,673
I don't care if you have to call out
the National Guard.

1063
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,470
Just find that dog.

1064
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:19,073
So long, gang.
You got a better chance without me.

1065
01:10:19,147 --> 01:10:22,913
Thanks. We won't forget
what you done for us.

1066
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:25,145
[Dog #4] Tail up, pal.

1067
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,818
[Dog #1] Say guys, that kid's
really got problems.

1068
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,791
Then we give him a lift, see.

1069
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,057
After all, he gave us a leg up.
Know what I mean?

1070
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,688
Yeah.

1071
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,491
[Admiral] Hey, you there!

1072
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:43,469
Out of my flowers.

1073
01:10:46,808 --> 01:10:49,072
Heave to, or I'll fire.

1074
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:56,381
That sounded like the admiral's shotgun.

1075
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:59,885
Yes, it's the same
wooly mammoth, I tell you.

1076
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:02,479
Yes, white and shaggy with black markings.

1077
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:04,548
What difference does the color make?

1078
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,693
[Knocking]

1079
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:09,229
Brian, open up. Let me in.

1080
01:11:09,297 --> 01:11:10,628
Look, it's Pop.

1081
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,966
- Hurry up. Give me a hand.
- Oh, darling.

1082
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:20,030
- OK. Pull. Watch out.
- We were so worried about you.

1083
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:21,541
What's happening?

1084
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:23,076
Slade's got the ring.

1085
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:25,738
Unless I can get it back,
he's gonna rub me out.

1086
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,544
- Oh, no.
- [Tires screech]

1087
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,085
There's police. Lots of 'em.

1088
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:36,919
[Sirens]

1089
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,154
There's a van.
Looks like the SWAT team.

1090
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:44,027
- I gotta get out of here.
- What are you gonna do?

1091
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,431
I don't know how, but I'm gonna nail Slade.

1092
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:50,335
That's the way to go.
Lassie and Rin Tin Tin wouldn't give up.

1093
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:53,602
[Dispatcher] 13-L-21, come in.

1094
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,672
There's a policeman coming.

1095
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,873
- I'm on my way. Good-bye, honey.
- Good luck.

1096
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,916
Hurry, Pop. He's here.

1097
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:03,473
[Knocking]

1098
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,877
- Take care of your mother, son.
- Okay, Pop.

1099
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:13,488
Good evening, ma'am.
There's a mad dog in the area.

1100
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,120
A mad dog?
I love dogs, you know.

1101
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:19,462
Big dogs, small dogs,
medium dogs. Even mad dogs.

1102
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:22,230
Sometimes, they're not mad.
They're just cranky.

1103
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,362
But I really love dogs, any kind of dog.

1104
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:27,465
I think I love dogs more than people.

1105
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:29,934
Elwood!

1106
01:12:31,212 --> 01:12:32,804
Not a peep out of you.

1107
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,372
You can have my wallet.
There's not much money.

1108
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,940
Take my credit cards...

1109
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:42,715
What are you doin'
in the park muggin' people?

1110
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,851
I am not mugging anybody
and I am not Elwood.

1111
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:50,057
I may look like him, but I am actually
Wilby Daniels. Is that clear?

1112
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:52,793
Daniels? Sure. Gotcha.

1113
01:12:52,867 --> 01:12:55,734
OK, now I'm going to take this
from the top.

1114
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,635
There's this Borgia ring, see.

1115
01:12:57,705 --> 01:13:00,799
A ring? Yeah, sure.
I gotcha, Elwood.

1116
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,409
- Daniels.
- Okay.

1117
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:09,579
Not many years ago,
when I was still a kid...

1118
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,882
When you were still a kid.

1119
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:17,357
So Slade got hold of the ring, see.

1120
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:20,588
Now he's trying to win this race
by elimination.

1121
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,721
My elimination, you understand?

1122
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:24,788
- You got any questions?
- Questions.

1123
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:27,831
A few crossed my mind.

1124
01:13:27,902 --> 01:13:30,769
Elwood... Mr. Daniels,

1125
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,034
couldn't we go back to selling ice cream?

1126
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:37,669
Later. I have to get Slade and Roschak
before they get me.

1127
01:13:37,745 --> 01:13:39,975
Can you understand?
You're gonna help.

1128
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,846
Right, me. Me?

1129
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:49,380
Ahhh.

1130
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,070
[Wilby] So far, so good.
Quit trying to steer.

1131
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:05,901
- [Tim] I'll get off.
- You're not going anywhere.

1132
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:09,501
- [Wilby] I need you as a witness.
- Let me sit on the seat for awhile.

1133
01:14:22,957 --> 01:14:25,755
Elwood, look,
get somebody else to help you.

1134
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:27,886
I get up early. I need 8 hours sleep.

1135
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:30,157
[Wilby] There is no one else, and no time.

1136
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:32,825
- Where are we going, anyway?
- Not us, pal. You.

1137
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,267
You're gonna beard the lion in his den.

1138
01:14:35,336 --> 01:14:36,428
Me?

1139
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,075
Wanna watch the ruts?

1140
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:44,336
[Slade] "In canis corpore transmuto."

1141
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:49,783
[Door bell]

1142
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:01,384
- You Slade?
- Yes. Who are you?

1143
01:15:01,462 --> 01:15:02,952
Don't matter.

1144
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:06,931
Listen, I got a message
for you from Fast Eddie.

1145
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:09,629
He says, "You're off the gravy train."

1146
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:15,139
No more gravy.
You got it?

1147
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:17,410
No more gravy.

1148
01:15:31,492 --> 01:15:33,756
- [Wilby] Did he buy it?
- I don't know.

1149
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:35,625
- What?
- I don't know.

1150
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:39,967
If I got him pegged right, his next stop
is Roschak's warehouse.

1151
01:15:40,034 --> 01:15:41,831
- Good.
- We're gonna be there.

1152
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:43,928
We are?

1153
01:15:44,005 --> 01:15:45,700
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1154
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:48,805
You wanna put both hands on the wheel?

1155
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,187
[Wilby] We can get in through
that window on the roof.

1156
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:05,087
We can?

1157
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,234
- I'll stay here and keep a lookout.
- Come on.

1158
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,777
[Wilby] Come on.

1159
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:33,480
- I'm allergic to height. I can't...
- Move it.

1160
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:51,030
Here, Pop.

1161
01:18:05,046 --> 01:18:07,378
It's better if you don't look down.

1162
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:09,177
Hey, you're right. It is.

1163
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:15,951
- [Wilby] You all right?
- I'm all right.

1164
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,670
[Wilby] You're almost there.
Keep coming.

1165
01:18:35,543 --> 01:18:36,874
Shh.

1166
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:44,082
[Wilby] Follow me.

1167
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,278
[Whistle]

1168
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:52,722
- Oh, no. Isn't that your kid?
- Don't make any noise.

1169
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:56,894
Brian, look out.

1170
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:07,039
I told you to stay home.

1171
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:09,633
Should've sent me to obedience school.

1172
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,143
What're we doing up here?

1173
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:13,544
[Wilby] This is Roschak's theft ring.

1174
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:15,605
We gotta prove that Slade's in on it.

1175
01:19:15,683 --> 01:19:18,811
Excuse me.
Now the kid's here, I'll split.

1176
01:19:18,886 --> 01:19:21,787
- [Wilby] Stay here. Follow me.
- [Tim] Right. Uh-huh.

1177
01:19:21,856 --> 01:19:24,290
Spendin' most of my life on all fours.

1178
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,466
[Wilby] Be quiet.

1179
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,320
Shhh. These men are killers.

1180
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,727
- Isn't that our TV set?
- That's it.

1181
01:20:08,803 --> 01:20:11,567
Bet they got all our other stuff too.

1182
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:19,613
- Is our car here, Pop?
- Probably sold it days ago.

1183
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,618
[Man] I think we lifted that 'Vette before.

1184
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,351
[Roschak] Paint it and change
the serial number.

1185
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:34,122
- Keep your eye out for some Porsches.
- [Man] We got some spotted.

1186
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:36,459
- Good night, Mr. Roschak.
- Good night.

1187
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,401
Hear that?
We could bust 'em easy with that.

1188
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,133
[Wilby] That doesn't prove
Slade's involved.

1189
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,837
But that could.

1190
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,678
I wonder how these things work?

1191
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,186
[Loud music]

1192
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,552
Turn it off!

1193
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,273
What do you want to do
with the tape recorder?

1194
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:22,206
Get it in Roschak's office.

1195
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,306
Tim, you gotta get him away from there.

1196
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:58,004
Right.
Now, what I'll do... me?

1197
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:04,183
- Me?
- Right now.

1198
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,297
Go back.

1199
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,993
But he's got a knife.
He could...

1200
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:31,468
Your "shasfras" down there at
the "ricktofrasen" is condensing.

1201
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:32,570
The what?

1202
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:36,413
Your "shasafras" at the "ricktofrasen."
Got a big gnarl in the tube.

1203
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,712
Could back up on ya.

1204
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,848
Who are you?

1205
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:43,948
Me? I'm Roschak's new man down here.
I just came on.

1206
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:48,052
If you don't "gaffenhausen" that
alternator, it's gonna get on the floor.

1207
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,326
Ever have "creoblustate" on your shoes?
Gotta burn 'em.

1208
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:54,527
I saw it eat a saddle right out
from under a jockey one time.

1209
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:57,264
Goes like that. Turns it blue.

1210
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:00,870
You wanna come down there,
take a look at it?

1211
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,876
Why don't you leave that knife here?

1212
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:14,779
Right down here's that "glutenhauser"
I wanted you to look at.

1213
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:17,154
You come right there.
Don't get too close.

1214
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:20,160
I don't want to get
"creoblustate" on your shoes.

1215
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,025
Look in there, give it a little...

1216
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,797
We got him, Pop!

1217
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,463
You knocked him out cold
in the "freidenglar".

1218
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:32,768
"In canis corpore transmuto."

1219
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,705
I wouldn't say that too often.

1220
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,574
- Why not?
- The professor was always careful.

1221
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:41,308
He was afraid he might become sensitized
and turn into a dog himself.

1222
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:44,283
Rubbish!
"In canis corpore transmuto."

1223
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,745
[Beeping]

1224
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,611
- What are you doin' here?
- Open up.

1225
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:20,278
All right.

1226
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:52,175
Uh-oh. Now Pop's stuck in there.

1227
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,923
Roschak, I want a word with you.

1228
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,858
Not very smart to come down here.

1229
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:04,659
If you've got some idea of cutting
me out, I wanna hear it from you.

1230
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:07,326
Not from one of your messenger boys.

1231
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:08,960
What are you talkin' about?

1232
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:12,097
One of your punks came to my house.

1233
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,836
He started to lean on me
and tell me, and I quote,

1234
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,901
"You're off the gravy train."

1235
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,143
[Laughs]

1236
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:24,981
Oh, John, John, John. Relax.

1237
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:27,749
It's business as usual with us.

1238
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,653
If you didn't tell him, who did?

1239
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:34,161
Beats me, but if I find out,
I'm gonna scratch him permanently.

1240
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,992
Could have been that Daniels guy.

1241
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:41,001
But he would have to have
proof in court, right?

1242
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,663
- Why am I telling you? You're a lawyer.
- Right.

1243
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,208
I've got a bottle in the other room.
Let's have a drink.

1244
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:54,878
To another good year.

1245
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,520
- How'd that dog get in here?
- [Slade] Dog?

1246
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,819
That's Daniels.
Stop him. He's got everything on tape!

1247
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,091
- [Roschak] That's Daniels?
- Shoot him.

1248
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:12,655
[Gunshots]

1249
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:19,629
Take it.

1250
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,971
Grab one of those cars.
I'll draw them off.

1251
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,941
They're coming.

1252
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,006
Woof, woof.

1253
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,808
Woof, woof?

1254
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,246
After him!

1255
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,889
Come on. Pop told us to get a car.

1256
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,229
All right, Daniels.

1257
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:24,630
Come on out.

1258
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:30,066
Get it over with.
You haven't got a chance.

1259
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:33,043
I've got the ring.

1260
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,672
You've got nothing.

1261
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,390
[Dogs bark]

1262
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,863
Hey, this what you lookin' for, pal?

1263
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,874
That's it. Thanks.
You have no idea.

1264
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,308
Forget it.
It's on us, sweetheart.

1265
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:05,504
We take care of our own, see.

1266
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,172
So long, pal.

1267
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:26,190
Now hurry.

1268
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:44,244
Hey! Get us outta here.

1269
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:50,814
Steady.

1270
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:10,872
- What was that?
- Daniels, you ninny! After him!

1271
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,682
- You got the tape recorder?
- Got the ring?

1272
01:29:16,183 --> 01:29:19,584
It's going to be put away where nobody
will get a hold of it again.

1273
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,794
- Faster.
- There's a red light coming up.

1274
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:34,630
I don't care what's coming up.
Just keep on going.

1275
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:39,602
[Sirens]

1276
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:49,449
Tell them who I am.
Say it's official business.

1277
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,091
Can I see your driver's license, sir?

1278
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,366
Officer, District Attorney
John Slade is back there.

1279
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,168
We're on official business.

1280
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,140
He is?

1281
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:23,238
Blah.

1282
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:33,419
Well, what are you starin' at?

1283
01:30:34,795 --> 01:30:38,629
Hang onto that. Don't let anybody
touch it till the grand jury hears it.

1284
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:44,430
Mom, we're home,
and dad's not a dog anymore.

1285
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,617
Three loaves of rye bread,
cold cuts, the dip,

1286
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:11,563
a cherry pie, some paper plates
and cups, napkins.

1287
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,657
- Hi.
- How ya doin', partner?

1288
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,498
Hi, Elwood.
Mr. District Attorney.

1289
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:19,061
We're shopping for our announcement party.

1290
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,439
- Well, we'll be there.
- And take good care of my buddies.

1291
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,808
- Anything they want.
- Bye.

1292
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:26,407
Okay.

1293
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,679
Guess you better make that
16 Porterhouse steaks.

1294
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:32,279
Come on.
