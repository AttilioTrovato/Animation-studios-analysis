of the entire crew, wasn't it, doctor?

510

just enough for one person.

Ah. Naturally.

00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:34,857
Our wine and spare parts are vintage,
captain, I hope that's satisfactory.

513

We've had to modify a few of the parts,

to you and your companions,
Dr. Durant,

521
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,762

of your visit to the <i>Cygnus</i>.

522
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,515

And to you, sir, and your
magnificent accomplishments.

00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,073
Tonight, my friends,
