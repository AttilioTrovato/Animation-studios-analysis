1
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,658
what do you think,
theodore?

2
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:21,030
he looks like a real live one.
come on!

3
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,088
all right!

4
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,758
get him
with the rope!

5
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:50,760
huh?
rope him!

6
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,851
well, throw it!

7
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,612
maybe we could head him off
at the pass. mm-hmm.

8
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:16,119
maybe we can do a little better
this time.

9
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,889
two of diamonds.
jack of diamonds.

10
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:21,624
three of diamonds.
queen of diamonds.

11
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,894
ace of diamonds.

12
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:26,094
ten of hearts.

13
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,132
well, how proud are you
of that ace, leonard?

14
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,982
ace bets a dollar.
a dollar.

15
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:35,021
there was a time around here when
a jack high was worth a poke of gold.

16
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,973
i'm in.
me too.

17
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,975
i'm folding.
well, i'm in.

18
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,920
did the mines dry up?
quake of '65 pinched off the veins,

19
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,331
but the quake we had two years ago
finished us off for good.

20
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,786
hasn't been ten cents' worth of gold taken
out of quake city since.

21
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,586
ace, ten still high,
leonard.

22
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,407
bet a dollar. i was wondering about
that name, quake city.

23
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:57,160
when you build a town on top
of the calaveras fault,

24
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,879
you can figure to get shook up
once in a while.

25
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,382
ten. me too.
ain't that bad, homer.

26
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,301
we've still got two fine saloons,
our own theater...

27
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,712
and the only hook and ladder
this side of chicago.

28
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,819
you planning to settle down here,
mr. donavan?

29
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,856
no, no, no. i'm working my way
to new orleans.

30
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,811
soon as i get a big enough stake,
i'm gonna open up my own place.

31
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,811
first class too--
red carpets,

32
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,599
crystal chandeliers from europe,
two roulette tables.

33
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,768
good evening, gents.

34
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,901
homer.

35
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,821
if you need a haircut, wintle,
my barbershop's closed.

36
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,859
if you're lookin' to sue somebody,
my court's open every second tuesday.

37
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,362
if you want the sheriff,
i'm playin' poker.
deuces bet a dollar.

38
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,866
no, judge.
it's just that i'm leaving
for san francisco tonight.

39
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:39,619
san francisco's loss
is quake city's gain.

40
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,419
leonard?
the trouble is...

41
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,923
that i'm expecting
some valuables
on tomorrow's stage,

42
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,925
and i can't be here
to pick them up.

43
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,678
me neither.
oh. yes.

44
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:50,895
hmm.
mayor sharpe?

45
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,398
got a council meeting
tomorrow.

46
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,686
i'm in.
what kind
of valuables, john?

47
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,824
well, bless
my suspender buttons.

48
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,861
donavan! i haven't
seen you since, uh--

49
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,361
- santa fe?
- right.

50
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:10,498
when you sold me
the marshal's horse?

51
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,403
- right.
i was just funnin', donavan.
- the marshal wasn't amused.

52
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,824
well, now, old friend,
maybe i can make it up to you.

53
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,624
two pairs bets two dollars.

54
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:25,046
like i say, i'm expecting
valuables on the stage.
i'm in. like what?

55
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,583
oh, things a person wouldn't
leave lying around without
somebody responsible--

56
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,585
like yourself--
to keep an eye on it.

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,385
there's a game
going on, wintle.

58
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,188
there's your two,
and raise you five.

59
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:37,743
you couldn't have hit
an inside straight again.
i'll call ya.

60
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,147
if you'll claim them for me,
i'll make it worth your while,

61
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:44,517
besides repaying
what i charged you
for the marshal's horse.

62
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,352
the mayor
raised five.

63
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,155
it's just till
i come back, governor.
are you in or not?

64
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,192
uh--
here's five on account,
if you can use it.

65
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,278
i don't know how you
came by five dollars,

66
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,330
but i'll apply it
to your loan
at the bank.

67
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:00,616
it's a deal?
it's a deal.
i'm in.

68
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:02,884
thanks, donavan.
thanks.

69
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,296
- you won't forget?
- i won't forget.

70
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,638
thanks.
all right,
let's see 'em.

71
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:11,809
- hit it again!
- i don't
believe that.

72
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:16,465
welcome to quake city,
mr. donavan. looks like
luck's against you.

73
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,553
well, there's one good thing
about luck. it always changes,

74
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,557
and i've got a feeling
that mine is just
around the corner.

75
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,111
again?

76
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,415
whoa!

77
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,369
whoa!

78
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,817
well, they saddled up
in boston, still wet
behind the ears??

79
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,320
and they made their way
across the wild frontier??

80
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,823
as they sought
their fame and fortune??

81
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,673
their legend
up and sprang??

82
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,211
and they soon became
the apple dumpling gang??

83
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,548
and they called them
the apple dumpling gang??

84
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,850
it wasn't long
they'd been gone??

85
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,817
from the eastern shore??

86
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,820
people knew their name
from far and near??

87
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,608

88
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:43,362

the apple dumpling gang??

89
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,333
and they called them
the apple dumpling gang??

90
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,017
it wasn't jesse james
or old black bart??

91

a price upon their heads??

112
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:46,367
last night
you said you was.

113
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:49,120
took five dollars
in advance,
as i recall.

114
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,575
yes, but, uh,
but that was to pick up
some valuables,

115
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,843
but not a bunch
of runny-nosed kids.

116
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,746
they're in good shape,
mister, just as good
as when i got 'em.

117
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,713
now sign here.
uh, pardon me.

118
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:02,967

in authority?

119
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,890
how about the founder
and president of the line?
perfect.

120
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,436
pa? you wanna hear
this feller out?

121
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:16,482
colonel t.r. clydesdale,
at your service, sir.

122
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,934
well, uh,
colonel clydesdale, sir,

123
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:22,903
uh, there appears to be...

124
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:26,442
an unfortunate
misunderstanding
about the children.

125
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,409
you see, i didn't--
to cut through the fat,

126
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,947
this saddle blanket tinhorn
agreed to pick up these kids
for john wintle,

127
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,916
and now he's tryin'
to weasel out of it.

128
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,753
- magnolia!
- "magnolia"?

129
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,588
and where are...

130
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:43,140
the legal guardians
of these waifs?

131
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,345
their folks passed away
back east is what i get
from 'em.

132
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,264
they've been shipped
out here to john wintle.

133
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,549
he's their second uncle,
or something.

134
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,434
and where
is john wintle?

135
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,152
halfway to san francisco,
i'd say.

136
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,056
all i know is,
the stage made delivery...

137
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,059
to the consignee
or his agent, and that
seems to be you, mister.

138
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,061
what youdowith them
is your business.

139
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,397
that argument wouldn't
hold up in any court of law,
and you know it.

140
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,200
it would in my court,
and i'm the law
around here.

141
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,120
but, sheriff, look.

142
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,704
sheriff,

143
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,574
i didn't know
they were children.

144
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,493
now, i'm not
a family man.

145
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,460
mister,
i gotta go.

146
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,596
yeah, just as soon
as we get this
straightened out.

147
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:26,135
now, sheriff, i--
i have no--
i have no place to keep them.

148
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,352
wintle's got a shack
on the edge of town.

149
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,975
- mister, i gotta go bad!
- she can't wait too long,
mister.

150
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,563
- take my word for that.
- it might be prudent
to resolve...

151
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:40,375
the more imminent problem,
uh, forthwith.

152
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,152
all right. fine.
come on. let's go.

153
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,755
oh, where did you say
wintle's shack was?

154
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,622
well, you go
to the edge of town,
turn left,

155
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,577
and just beyond
that old pile
of shoring timbers--

156
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,246
well, i'll--
i'll show you.

157
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,365
hey!

158
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,368
oh, uh, i'll be right back.
just hold on.

159
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,789
what?
right here.

160
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,257
oh.

161
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,010
magnolia.

162
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,349
meanwhile, rest assured
that the butterfly stage
and freight company...

163
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,567
will make every endeavor
to satisfy...

164
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,472
uh, the problem
to the ultimate,
uh, satisfaction...

165
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,475
of all
concerned parties.

166
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,477
uh--

167
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:34,119
"unfortunately, mr. bradley's
lingering illness
left him destitute,

168
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,287
"and there are
no monies left
in the estate.

169
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:41,994
"however, mr. bradley felt
that revenues from his share
of the commodore mine...

170
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,456
would more than provide
for the care and well-being
of his children."

171
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,884
i guess when wintle got this,
he didn't want to be saddled
with the kids,

172
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,837
so he decided
on a change of scenery.

173
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,755
anything would be
an improvement.

174
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,490
yeah. well, now,
the way that i see it,

175
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,726
until we know
one way or the other,

176
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,861
uh, exactly what
wintle had in mind,

177
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,864
the children are wards
of this town, right?

178
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,904
wrong. there is no funds
nor facilities for orphans
in quake city.

179
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:11,149
well, you don't expect me
to be able to take care--

180
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,324
donavan, this is just
a half-portion
of a town,

181
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,328
but we do have certain
what you might call
rules to live by.

182
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,931
well, i--
you don't jump
another man's claim.

183
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,500
you don't steal his wife,
woman or whiskey.

184
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,502
you don't
strike a bargain...

185
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,006
and then entertain
second thoughts
about the matter.

186
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,084
any one of these offenses
can make you...

187
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,128
the exalted guest of honor
at a hemp party.

188
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,130
uh--
no, i'd say
you'd best...

189
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,385
keep these youngsters
or provide...

190
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,236
for their safekeeping.

191
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,190
well, it's time
i was getting back
to my barbershop.

192
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,694
oh, and, uh, donavan,

193
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,732
i wouldn't go
on no long rides
if i was you.

194
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,984
no. no.

195
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:18,090
- when are we gonna eat?
- uh, just--
just a little while now.

196
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,093
oh!

197
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,932
clovis don't like
to be touched.
don't he?

198
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,518
nope.

199
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:05,162
- now what?
- clovis, now put it back!

200
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,806
come on, you two.
clovis,
give it to me.

201
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,808
i mean it! no more
playing around the fire.
gimme it!

202
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,611
will you stop?
now listen to me.
i don't want any more--

203
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,734
- clovis don't like to be--
- i know. clovis don't
like to be touched.

204
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,203
gimme it, clovis.
will you stop?
give me that.

205
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:22,920
let me see what the fuss
is about.

206
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,290
"commodore mine,
december 3, 1871."

207
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,795
- commodore's our mine now.
- well, it's just
an old ore sample.

208
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,231
- is it valuable?
- if it was,
it wouldn't be here.

209
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,633
our dad said
there's gold
in the commodore mine.

210
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,219
everyone says
there's gold in their mine.

211
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,724
what's that?
it's salt pork--
i think.

212
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,312
- it looks like fat.
- well, whatever it is,
it's dinner.

213
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,980
- that's dinner?
- that's dinner.

214
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,852
couldn't you make us
apple dumplings instead?

215
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,771
no.
why not?

216
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,773
because even if i could
make apple dumplings,

217
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,275
i wouldn't make them
for you or anybody else.

218
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,245
bobby?
it's raining
on celia again.

219
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,247
then move celia
again!

220
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,749
there's no more
dry places to move her.
bobby, w--

221
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:20,260
oh, no,
not my salt pork.

222
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:23,599
what have i done
to deserve this?

223
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,268
who are you talking to?

224
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:29,102
it doesn't matter.

225
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,857
i don't think he's
listening to me anyway.

226
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:39,564
evenin'. had some extra
son-of-a-gun stew.

227
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,401
was either throw it out
or bring it up here.

228
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,668
huh. stopped raining.

229
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:06,356
you know,
it's really amazing.
what is?

230
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,725
the way those kids
settled right down
for you.

231
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,231
well, when you're dead
on your feet and you get your
belly full, you get sleepy.

232
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,934
- what's amazing about that?
- oh, you underestimate yourself.

233
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,901
i think i can say
without hesitation...

234
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,405
that was the best
son-of-a-gun stew
that i've ever had.

235
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,744
really?
yeah, and you saw the way the
kids polished off their plates.

236
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,579
you know,

237
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,581
i think it's a crime...

238
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,118
that someone
with your culinary talent--

239
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,121
well, i guess
you'd really have
to call it magic--

240
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,089
hasn't a family
to share it with.

241
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:43,345
you tryin' to dump
those kids on me, or you
workin' on somethin' else?

242
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,312
i am merely trying
to point out...

243
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,849
that you have a natural way
with children.

244
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,067
you're barkin' up
the wrong tree, mister.

245
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:54,306
my advice to you is,
get yourself a job
and look after your kids.

246
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:58,193
- they're not my kids!
- yes, they are,

247
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,532
till you find somebody else
to take 'em off your hands.

248
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:06,283
night.

249
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:45,774
it's dripping
on me again.

250
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,778
oh.

251
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,516
i, uh, i'm very attached
to the little fellas,

252
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,519
but i'm, uh,
i'm a bachelor, you see,

253
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,414
and i'm really
in no position
to care for them,

254
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,773
not like you and your
attractive wife could.

255
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,444
i'm sure there
must be room here
for three small children.

256
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:25,781
it would just be
until mr. wintle
gets back.

257
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:31,166
hey!

258
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:37,075
ma'am, i can--
oh, get out
of the way!

259
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,127
come on!
come on!
get outta there!

260
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,046
get out!

261
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,131
why?

262
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,753
don't get
your feet wet.

263
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,677
i'm really very attached
to the little fellas, you see,

264
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:57,562
but i'm in no position
to care for them.

265
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:02,282
howdy, ma'am.
good morning.

266
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,153
but they're all
healthy specimens,
sound of wind and limb.

267
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,989
they don't eat much.
they'd be a lot of help
around here.

268
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:10,426
- they could-- no!
- ow!

269
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,793
i can explain
about that.

270
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:15,614
uh, he's the only one that
does that. you see, he's just
a little sensitive, that's all.

271
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,616
uh, no, really!
the other ones--
come on.
get out!

272
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,368
ma'am, that little girl
could help you
in the kitchen.

273
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,621
she could wash your dishes and
scrub your personal clothes!

274
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,352
come on.

275
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,321
good day, sir.
i can see that you're
a man of substance.

276
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,323
i have
an interesting proposition
i thought that might--

277
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,591
- ah. the lady of the house.
kids. yech!

278
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,246
the children are
marvelous about parties.
they love parties themselves.

279
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,165
come on.
if you could just--
one small look at them--

280
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,072
who was that,
mr. donavan?

281
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,591
the president
of the garden club.

282
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,594
all right,
come on.

283
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,455
mr. donavan? look!

284
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:37,913
get out of there!
- celia!

285
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,631
bein' a family man's
quite a responsibility.

286
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,767
- i'm hungry.
- naturally.

287
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,179
hard times cafe
serves a nice lunch.

288
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:05,557
thanks.
come on, kids.
come on.

289
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,747
pair of tens
wants the money.

290
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,450
doggone. i guess
that sure beats
ace, queen high.

291
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,367
well, i'm on
my last card too.

292
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,206
all right, you kids
find something to do,
and stay out of trouble.

293
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:24,543
- where ya goin'?
- i have a few sheep
to fleece.

294
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,962
ace bets a dollar.
two, deuce.

295
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:30,749
jack. oh, a king.

296
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,638
what's a "millstone"?
i don't know.
why?

297
00:22:36,673 --> 00:22:38,605
mr. donavan said
he doesn't want...

298
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,942
three millstones
hanging around
his neck.

299
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:44,062
i gotta show you
where we're gonna
put it inside.

300
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,029
then we won't have
to move it again.

301
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,850
you don't want
to move something
as delicate as this twice.

302
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,695
what is it,
bobby?
i don't know.

303
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,185
ow!

304
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,938
go on!
get away from there!

305
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,458
this thing's come
halfway across the country,

306
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,909
and i don't want anything
happening to it now!

307
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,897
get! get! get!
all right, let's
move it in now, fellas.

308
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:37,732
real careful now.
move it in.

309
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,968
what did he say?

310
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,472
i think he's afraid
we'll get his
laundry dirty.

311
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,229
what's that
up there?

312
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,816
looks like a mine.

313
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:14,152
a mine?
is it ours?

314
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,171
could be.

315
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,156
let's go see.

316
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,692
pair of jacks.
no improvement.

317
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,243
three of hearts.
five of clubs.

318
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,780
ace of hearts
and king of spades.
kings bet.

319
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,782
kings bet ten dollars.
i'm in for ten.

320
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:29,749
i'm in.
i'm in.

321
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:32,036
there's your ten,
and i'll raise you twenty.
twenty?

322
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,289
i don't believe
you got 'em.
cost you 20 to find out.

323
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:36,291
that's kills me.
i'm in.

324
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,293
now there's a man
from missouri.

325
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:40,295
i fold.
all right,
let's see 'em.

326
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:42,297
well, three jacks.

327
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:44,299
three jacks?

328
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,535
uh, another round
for the gentlemen,
please.

329
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,236
i believe i've
also won the, uh,
the deal.

330
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:54,776
wow! how much money
you figure that dude's
got in front of him?

331
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:58,279
'bout 500.
500? wow!

332
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,782
you know,
that'd be, uh--

333
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,249
that's 200 apiece.

334
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,252
i told you he was
a real live one, didn't i?
right.

335
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,790
all right, now,
as soon as he leaves,
we jump him, right?

336
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,257
in broad daylight?

337
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,260
we get him
when the time is right.

338
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:17,298
let's get out of here
before he starts
gettin' suspicious.

339
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,266
two dollars.

340
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,304
okay. i'm in
for two dollars.

341
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,473
okay. and the pot
is right.

342
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,892
a pair of sixes.
four to the deuce.
a pair of ladies.

343
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,230
jack to the three.
ten to the four,
and a jack to the six.

344
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,269
look!
it's a little train.

345
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:17,192
it's not a train,
celia.
what is it?

346
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:20,160
it's a cart
to haul dirt.

347
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:24,149
this isn't our mine at all.
it's the moonridge
number two.

348
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:27,653
hey!
come on, now.
all aboard!

349
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:31,087
get out of there.
come on, clovis.

350
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,492
you and celia
get out of there.

351
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,880
put the brake on!

352
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,882
it's stuck!

353
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,850
whoa!

354
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,088
whoa!
duck!

355
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:55,346
look out,
bobby!
i can't steer it!

356
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,200
uh-oh!

357
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:03,655
stop the train, bobby!
- i can't. hang on, celia!

358
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,793
uh-oh!

359
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,746
oh, whoa!

360
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:15,333
we're coming
to a fence.
get down!

361
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,359
move it, move it,
move it!

362
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,174
get the sheriff!

363
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,583
it's so much fun
and it's no pity??

364
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,635
taking suckers
in quake city??

365
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,638
doo-dah, doo-dah????

366
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,144
that's him!
they're his kids!

367
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:20,481
don't bother putting
that away, mister.
now, just one minute!

368
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,483
now. one mirror, $300.

369
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:24,485
what are you talking about?
i was in the--

370
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:26,487
one melodeon.
i don't own a melodeon.

371
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,856
you do now.
how 'bout
my chickens?

372
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,324
why do we have
to go to bed so early?

373
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,862
because if you're asleep,
you just might stay
out of trouble.

374
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,250
what's that?

375
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,672
that is a cherished token
of a lady's affection.

376
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,057
- i'm sure you'll
understand, belle.
- you're gonna sell it?

377
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:51,429
i might raise a little
investment capital on it,
should the need arise.

378
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,813
if you'd go get the gold
in the commodore mine,

379
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,301
you could keep
the cherished token
of a lady's affection.

380
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,268
there is no gold
in that hole in the ground.

381
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,606
if there was,
someone would have
found it years ago.

382
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:04,440
and i don't have
to answer...

383
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:08,363
to three whelps
who aren't even dry
behind the ears yet.

384
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,863
- mr. donavan?
- what?

385
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,416
- i gotta go.
- you just went.

386
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,988
- i gotta go again.
- that's impossible.
go to sleep.

387
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:20,074
i'm gonna have
an accident.

388
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,833
all right,
come on.

389
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,672
i like you, mr. donavan.

390
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,026
psst! hey!

391
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,030
what makes you think
that gambler's gonna
come by this way?

392
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,997
well, he come this way
the last time,
didn't he?

393
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,035
well, that don't mean--
amos, will you stop
tryin' to think?

394
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:06,037
now come on.
get up on top
of that roof.

395
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,472
you know something?

396
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:13,011
why do i have to go
through this foofaraw of
dropping a bucket on him?

397
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,846
why don't i just throw down
on him and say,
"hand it over"?

398
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:17,230
and if he just
keeps on walkin',
then what?

399
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,268
well, then i'll call to him,
and then i'll start
throwin' lead.

400
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:22,270
you know somethin', amos?

401
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,655
the lord poured
your brains in with a teaspoon,
and somebody joggled his arm!

402
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,194
i keep tryin' to tell ya,
we ain't got no lead to throw
and no powder to throw it with!

403
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:33,398
oh, that's right.
i keep forgettin'.

404
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:37,667
come on.

405
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,454
this is gonna be easier
than robbin' a bird's nest.
right.

406
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:42,707
now you get up on that roof
and wait. i'll give you
a hoot-owl call when he comes.

407
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,994
hoo! hoo!
that's good.
i'll tell you what.

408
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,247
i'll answer
with a whippoorwill.

409
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:51,458
that's good.

410
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:53,634
good!
all right,
i got it.

411
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,471
here it is.
i got it.

412
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:00,975
the hash knife gang
rides again!

413
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:07,398
i should have heard
from jay gould regarding
my amalgamation proposal.

414
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,918
look into that
first thing in the mornin',
magnolia.

415
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,930
yes, pa.
we'll be needin'
new equipment, of course.

416
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,907
yes, pa.
don't you worry about
finances, little lady.

417
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,874
leave all that
to me.
yes, pa.

418
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,912
now i have to stop in here
and see some people, magnolia.
yes, pa.

419
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,379
good night, pa.
where you off to?

420
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,381
well, after i drop this
at the harness shop,

421
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,419
i'll head back to the barn
and fix the brake pedal
on the stage.

422
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,438
and then when i'm
through with that,

423
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,388
i've got diablo's teeth
to file.

424
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,891
he's not gettin' much
out of his food lately.

425
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,930
and then, when i'm through
with diablo, there's that
cracked singletree to fix.

426
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,199
aside from that,
i got a free evening.
uh-huh.

427
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,434
well, run along
and enjoy yourself,
my dear.

428
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,439
remember, these are
the best years
of your life.

429
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:06,791
hoo! hoo!

430
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:15,333
hoo! hoo!

431
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:19,720
ah!

432
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,145
- hoo! hoo!
- yeah. i'm comin'.

433
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,573
hoo! hoo!

434
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,250
hoo! hoo!

435
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,621
hoo-hoo!

436
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,267
hoo! hoo!

437
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:20,865
amos!

438
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,060
evenin'.
evening.

439
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,097
well, that's what
i call solid comfort.

440
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,099
yeah. it's very pretty.

441
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,602
where are the children?
fed and in bed.

442
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,110
you know, i'm not sure,
but i think two men
tried to waylay me.

443
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,077
what?
yeah. back there.

444
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,580
probably just
theodore and amos.

445
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,784
- who are theodore and amos?
- used to ride
with the stillwell gang.

446
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,636
the stillwell gang?
really?

447
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,423
till amos accidentally shot
stillwell in the leg.

448
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,527
they call themselves
the hash knife outfit now.

449
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:25,596
hmm.
they're pretty harmless
for the most part.

450
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,432
mm-hmm. hey.
buy you a drink?

451
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,735
i'm sorry.
i, uh--

452
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,939
i just wasn't thinking
of you as a wo--

453
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,024
i'm sorry.

454
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:55,925
mr. donavan!

455
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,594
we're going to the mine
to get some gold!

456
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,667
- you want to come with us?
- not so loud, and just
a little bit slower.

457
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:05,434
where are you going?
to dig some gold
out of our mine.

458
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,888
then we don't have to eat
biscuits and greens
all the time.

459
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:11,225
mr. purvis
in the assay office says
it's on bald hill.

460
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,728
will you come with us,
mr. donavan, huh?

461
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:15,611
- no.
- but why?

462
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,980
because my head hurts,

463
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,018
and because there is
no gold in that hole
in the ground.

464
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:24,522
our pa said
there was.
then you go get it.

465
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,490
and i'm going to go
get some sleep.

466
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,527
you know, leonard,
with the kind of luck
you have,

467
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,327
you ought to play poker
for a living...

468
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,832
and have banking as a hobby,
instead of the other way
around.

469
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,084
thank you, friend.
thank you very much.

470
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,338
hey, mr. donavan,
why does he got...

471
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,172
your cherished token
of a lady's affection?

472
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,712
because three deuces
beats aces over eights,
that's why.

473
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,216
don't get in trouble.

474
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,722
theodore! theodore!
theodore!

475
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,225
go on, clarice.
go hide, quick!

476
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,693
douse that fire!
ah!

477
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,529
what's the matter
with you?
what are you doing?

478
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:08,383
did you lose your--
come on!

479
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,202
there's a posse
after us! here!

480
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,487
come on!
a posse?

481
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,630
i don't see anybody.
they're down there,
all right.

482
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:25,150
i saw 'em.
they're all hidin'
in the bushes.

483
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,600
how many?
i don't know.
it was five, six.

484
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,137
maybe 20.
and they're all
loaded for bear too.

485
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:33,140
got those big,
long buffalo rifles.

486
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,142
you know somethin', amos?
hmm?

487
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,476
we gotta make
a decision.
what?

488
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:41,982
does the hash knife outfit
throw in its hand, or do we
go out in a blaze of glory?

489
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:46,404
right! uh, just
what do you mean,
"blaze of glory"?

490
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:49,323
fightin' till
the last man's killed.

491
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,290
what's it gonna be,
pard?

492
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:55,329
uh, you know that jail
in santa fe wasn't
all that bad.

493
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:58,099
remember?
i say we go out
clawin' and fightin'.

494
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,835
make 'em pay
for our hides.
what do you say?

495
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,838
uh, all right.
i'm with you.

496
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,807
you know somethin',
theodore?

497
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:10,845
this could be the end
of the trail for us.

498
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,847
looks that way, amos.

499
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,849
you know somethin'?

500
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,351
you and me been through
a lot together,

501
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:21,105
and although i climbed
your hump once in a while,

502
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,323
i-- i just couldn't have
asked for a better partner.

503
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,862
if we meet again
in that big roundup
in the sky sometime,

504
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:30,865
i'm gonna spread my blanket
'side of yours,

505
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:33,868
just the same as always.

506
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:40,124
mister?

507
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:50,382
we're lookin'
for the commodore mine.

508
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,544
uh, mm, it's, uh--
it's right up the hill there.

509
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,672
just follow the trail.
take you right to it.

510
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:57,091
thanks.

511
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,480
- bye!
- bye.

512
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,988
amos, that is the most
humiliating thing that's
ever happened to me.

513
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,456
i know.
three bitty kids
with shovels...

514
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,493
walk right into our hideout
and get the drop on us.

515
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:17,460
i know.
and you burnt
my hand, amos.

516
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,462
i'm sorry about that.
and you scorched a hole
in my best shirt!

517
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:23,501
well, i can fix that.
why did you tell me those
three bitty kids was a posse?

518
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,468
well, i thought i saw 'em
down there in the bushes.

519
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,005
oh, you couldn't see through
a barbed wired fence.
theodore?

520
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,874
that head of yours
wouldn't hold straw.
theodore?

521
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,091
you couldn't sell
hacksaws in a jail.

522
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,628
what about that big
roundup in the sky?
i don't want to talk about it!

523
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:37,596
i said i--
i said i--

524
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:40,134
said you were gonna
spread your blanket
next to mine.

525
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,346
w- why don't we
dig here?

526
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:14,251
because somebody
already did dig here.

527
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,818
you scared?
no. no more
than you are.

528
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:34,321
i'm not scared.
neither am i.

529
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:36,073
i am.

530
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,207
bobby?

531
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,750
come on.
a little mouse
can't hurt you.

532
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,706
it was just an owl.

533
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,627
this looks like
a pretty good place
to dig.

534
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,130
you start over there,
and i'll dig here.

535
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,057
find any gold yet?

536
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:45,809
nope. did you?
no.

537
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:51,148
maybe there ain't any gold,
like mr. donavan said.

538
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,767
pa said there was.

539
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:12,670
stop shaking it, celia!
i'm not shaking it!
it won't stand still!

540
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,872
it's an earthquake!
let's get out of here!

541
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,878
bobby?

542
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,573
i gotta go.

543
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,035
are we trapped?

544
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:38,789
there must be
another way out.

545
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:40,707
come on.

546
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,263
bobby, what's that?

547
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,696
well, we base
our evaluation...

548
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:07,734
on what the price
of the gold was
when we checked last,

549
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:09,779
but the price may have
gone up in the meantime,

550
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:11,754
in which case the nugget
could be worth more.

551
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,623
the san francisco mint
will give us a receipt
for the nugget,

552
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:18,412
and the cash deposit will remain
in the children's name
in the quake city bank.

553
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:20,714
i'll leave that end
of it to you. i just
want to make sure...

554
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:23,217
that the children's
interests are
well protected.

555
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,184
ah, donavan, don't worry
about a thing.

556
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,971
we'll see that that nugget
is well taken care of.

557
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,973
can we touch it?
i'm sorry, ma'am.

558
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,726
that's as close as
we can let you get to it.

559
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,143
it's a piece of cake.

560
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,300
you mean
it ain't gold?

561
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:02,387
course it's gold,
stupid.

562
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:06,426
i mean getting that nugget out
of that bank's gonna be easier
than fallin' off a log.

563
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:08,428
oh, boy!
act natural.

564
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,931
don't do nothin'
to attract attention.

565
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:16,186
hey, uh, theodore,

566
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,438
how we gonna--

567
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,906
theodore?

568
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:24,193
how, uh--
how we gonna get it
outta that bank?

569
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,079
all right, first
we gotta get ourselves
a long ladder,

570
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,616
and we're gonna go in
through the skylight,
through the roof.

571
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:32,084
then we gotta get
that nugget outta town,

572
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,122
and i figure
if it's worth $87,000,
it ought to--

573
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:37,642
oh, i'd say
it'd weigh close to--

574
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:40,127
let's see.
gold is $15 an ounce.

575
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:43,130
how many ounces
in a pound?

576
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,132
are you listening
to me, amos?

577
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:47,599
yeah, but--
yeah, but what?

578
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,137
your rear end's
on fire, theodore.
oh, thank you.

579
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:52,389
ah! ow!

580
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,694
why didn't you tell me
my rear end
was on fire?

581
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,231
well, you told me
not to do anything
to attract attention.

582
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,736
you got a match?
i've got--

583
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,239
excuse me.

584
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,245
ah! ah!

585
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,248
hello.
nice day.

586
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:27,457
mabel, stanley,
donavan.

587
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:29,424
hello.
hi, sheriff.

588
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,810
well, now,
this is what i call
havin' a party.

589
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:36,116
mr. donavan said
we can have all
the apple dumplings we want.

590
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:40,387
did he? did he?
well, that's very generous
of mr. donavan.

591
00:45:40,422 --> 00:45:43,772
and he bought me
a new dress, see?

592
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,694
oh, i think that's
the most beautiful dress
i ever saw.

593
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,226
awful nice kids.
yes, they are.

594
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,094
you still bound
for new orleans?

595
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:09,932
oh, yes. yes.
well, nothing's happened
to change that.

596
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:14,471
of course, uh, i have
a few things i have
to clear up here in town,

597
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,307
and i've gotta
make arrangements
for the kids.

598
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,474
seems a lot
of people...

599
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,728
are anxious to take
the youngsters
to their bosoms.

600
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:26,066
they're sayin' the kids
ought to be made
wards of the court...

601
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:29,569
and for me to give 'em
to some respectable family
around here,

602
00:46:29,604 --> 00:46:31,536
people of substance.

603
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,538
'course, that'd fit
right into your plans.

604
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:37,411
you'd be free
to go on your way.
unencumbered. unfettered.

605
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:39,280
yeah. yeah.

606
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:41,079
fine, fine.

607
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:44,249
who wants 'em?
oh, there's no shortage
of applicants.

608
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:47,329
- there's the little darlin'!
- here, let me have
the sweet little thing!

609
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:50,374
what do you know
about children? you don't
know nothin' about the child.

610
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:53,058
let go!

611
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:57,347
all right, ladies. ladies,
this is a private party!
but he said i could have her!

612
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,684
you're all gonna wind up
in the calaboose
if you don't get out of here.

613
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,603
that'll all be
decided later on
at the hearing.

614
00:47:03,638 --> 00:47:05,555
out! out!

615
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,561
see what i mean?

616
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,064
they ripped
my beautiful dress.

617
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,066
i know,
but we'll fix it.

618
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,318
hey. we'll fix it.

619
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,739
there'sgotto be
better people in this town.

620
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,207
there's always
miss clydesdale.

621
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,593
who's miss clydesdale?
dusty?
mm-hmm.

622
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:33,300
- but she's not married.
- that's easy to fix.

623
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,085
well, who can you get?

624
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,890
you're not suggesting--
i'm only suggesting it
for the kids.

625
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:44,811
i know, but dusty's--
dusty's a fine specimen
of womanhood!

626
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:47,264
i seen her get caught
in a cloudburst once,

627
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:50,482
and i wanna tell you!

628
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:53,320
yes, mr. donavan.
please marry dusty.

629
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:57,274
no two people
ever got married...

630
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,778
for a more honorable
or worthy cause,
donavan.

631
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,780
think that over.

632
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:11,288
hearing's not till
the day after tomorrow.

633
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:20,046
marry dusty?

634
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,969
if they give us
to mrs. stockley, she won't
hit us with a stick, will she?

635
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,138
why would she hit you
with a stick?

636
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,273
she hits mr. stockley
with a stick,

637
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,276
and she might get mad
if we track mud in the house
or something.

638
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,077
or forget
to comb our hair.

639
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,446
well, i'm sure
she wouldn't do that.

640
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:41,985
when mr. stockley
gets mad, he uses words
i never heard before.

641
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,488
he's not as mean
as mr. leach.

642
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,074
mr. leach'll put you in a sack
and throw you in the river
if you even talk too much.

643
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,293
nobody's gonna throw you
in the river.

644
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,629
if rowdy joe dover got us,
i bet we'd have to sleep
in his shed.

645
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:58,885
don't worry, clovis.
if celia gets pneumonia,
i can take care of her.

646
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,305
we picked these
for you,
mr. donavan.

647
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,092
so you won't forget us
when you get to new orleans.

648
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:15,534
you can press them in a book
and they'll keep forever.

649
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:19,322
then every time you see one,
you'll remember us
three "widdle" kids.

650
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:22,874
that you gave away.
come on, clovis.

651
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:26,613
we better do the dishes
and not bother mr. donavan
anymore.

652
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:43,763
all right!

653
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,137
i'll ask her.

654
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:02,113
"three 'widdle' kids"?

655
00:50:02,148 --> 00:50:04,034
three little swindlers,
you mean.

656
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:08,989
bobby?
what?

657
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:11,992
what's "swindlers"?
i don't know.

658
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:36,816
okay, come on.
come on!

659
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:40,320
soon as we get the ladder out
of here, we head straight
for the bank.

660
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,136
amos! amos!

661
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,138
yeah?
ahh!

662
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,786
this one's
too small.

663
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,823
get the one
on the other side.

664
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,208
mmmm--

665
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:35,578
i'll go open the door.

666
00:54:44,577 --> 00:54:46,862
it's too long.
we can't get it out this way.

667
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,198
push it together.

668
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:54,203
aah! you idiot!

669
00:54:55,704 --> 00:54:58,207
you get on that end,
and i'll get on the other...

670
00:54:58,242 --> 00:55:00,209
and then we'll
push it together.

671
00:55:00,244 --> 00:55:02,711
on the count of three.

672
00:55:20,613 --> 00:55:23,115
get in there
and get it out!

673
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:33,909
it went through
the other window. i'm gonna
pull it all the way through.

674
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:46,505
someone's comin'!

675
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:57,182
howdy.

676
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:12,081
evening.

677
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:22,875
don't worry. as soon as
we get across here,
it's gonna be all downhill.

678
00:56:27,379 --> 00:56:31,717
get back, you cabbage head.
you're gonna bust it.

679
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:35,220
don't worry.
aah! mmm!

680
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:39,189
it's a long way
down there, theodore.

681
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:42,111
well, don't look down.
it's startin' to shake!

682
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:49,151
hoo!

683
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:53,337
don't do that.

684
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:55,374
move it!
my spur's caught.

685
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,259
get up there!

686
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,796
i am. i d--
aah-ha!

687
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:04,299
get off!
get off!

688
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:08,554
if i didn't think
you'd freeze to death
come this winter,

689
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:12,007
i'd rob this bank myself
and leave you here.

690
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:15,060
comin' through.

691
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:17,728
watch it!

692
00:57:17,763 --> 00:57:20,165
uh--

693
00:57:33,529 --> 00:57:38,250
maybe you ought to check and
see if the front door's open.
will you shut up?

694
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:41,051
perfect. it's a great scheme.
only when it's over,

695
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,588
i'm the deserted wife left
with three kids to mother...

696
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:46,091
while i watch your south end
disappearing over a hill.

697
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:49,344
but you'll be compensated
for any inconvenience, any--

698
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:52,490
i don't want their money.
it's theirs. they found it.

699
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:55,601
agreed. the only reason
i suggested it is that i knew...

700
00:57:55,636 --> 00:57:59,021
that you would provide them
with a good home.

701
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:04,241
what do you get
out of this "arrangement"?

702
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:08,280
a chance to get to new orleans
before winter sets in.

703
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:14,403
- that all?
- well, i would appreciate it
if you'd square my debts.

704
00:58:14,438 --> 00:58:17,239
i will repay you
in due time.

705
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:20,075
- and that's all?
- yes!

706
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:26,590
oh, now wait a minute.
uh, do you mean...

707
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:31,136
might i exercise
my husbandly prerogatives?

708
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:35,140
that's exactly what i mean.
miss clydesdale, nothing
could be further from my mind.

709
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:40,646
this marriage
would ensure a good home
for those children.

710
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:44,183
nothing more.
i give my word
as a gentleman.

711
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:49,787
it's not the best guarantee
i've ever had.

712
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:54,291
well, maybe not,
but it's the best
i have to offer.

713
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:57,329
so what's it gonna be,
miss clydesdale?
you calling or folding?

714
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:01,333
all right,
i'll go along with it.

715
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,801
but it's not for you.
it's for the kids.

716
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:07,339
and the sooner
you light a shuck out
of this town, the better.

717
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,978
it's gonna be daylight
before we even
get in that bank.

718
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:18,992
boy, once we get our hands
on that gold, we're gonna be
livin' like kings.

719
00:59:19,027 --> 00:59:22,971
we'll be shooin' those
senoritas off like flies.
never mind about that now.

720
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:26,475
just make sure this mule
of yours don't get frisky.
don't you worry about clarice.

721
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,861
she'll get you up there
all right.

723
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,832
no, no. don't you
remember nothin'?

724
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:38,370
when i give that rope a tug,
then you haul me up.
that's a new one. right.

725
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:41,839
tug and haul. right.
okay. no hooty-owl.

726
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:44,376

735
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:46,236

744
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,199
somebody's coming!
we're not wandering around.
we're looking for him.

745
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:36,238
- maybe we should stay home
till he gets back.
- he should've been back by now.

746
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:38,190
unless he forgot.

747
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:41,443
hi.

748
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:45,462

01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:50,252
oh. hey, you're the man

01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:58,010
well, i think he went that way.

753
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,729

on your toes like that?

754
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:05,183
'cause i wanna
stand on my toes.
now get outta here.

755
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,440
well, you kids go ahead now.
i'm real busy.

756
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:18,947
- where's your friend?
- he'd better be
in another county.

757
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,787
how'd you get up there?
never mind how i got up here.
you kids should be in bed now.

758
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:28,123

759
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,879

01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,144
anyway, i got here early
this morning to draw up
the certification papers...

762
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:51,611
for the nugget
for the san francisco mint,

763
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:54,066
and when i opened up the place,

01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,497
morning.
morning.

766
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:15,954
you two couldn't take candy
away from a baby without
comin' out on the short end.

767
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:18,957
well, it's not gonna go
so easy on ya this time.

768
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,430
get outta that silly rope,
and stand up.

769
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:38,360
this court is now in session,
the honorable homer mccoy
presiding.

770
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:41,328
theodore ogelvie,
amos tucker,

771
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:43,657
you're charged with
attempted bank robbery.

772
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:45,951
how do you plead?
guilty or not guilty?

773
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:49,119
- not guilty?
- guilty!

774
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:52,255
- the wrong one.
- this court sentences you...

775
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:56,628
to be hung by the neck
until dead, and i'm fining you
an extra ten bucks for perjury.

776
01:03:56,663 --> 01:03:59,231
let 'em out, leonard.

777
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:01,800
nice goin'.
unh.

778
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:09,257
be down to the oak tree
near boot hill at 12:00 sharp
for your hanging.

779
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,226
thank you, your honor.
12:00 sharp on that.

780
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:14,062
you don't thank a man
for hanging you, you
leather-brained ignoramus.

781
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:16,646
and bring
your own rope.

782
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:18,600
right.
i'll get it.
where you goin'?

783
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,602
that's the only rope
we got.
get outta here.

784
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:23,313
well, the hardware's closed.
come on, you dummy.

785
01:04:23,348 --> 01:04:25,524
well, how you
gonna hang yourself
without a rope?

786
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:29,027
you know, those dummies
are liable to show up.

787
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:31,029
well, if they do,
they deserve to be hung.

788
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:34,032
i just want to get 'em
out of this town
once and for all.

789
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:38,537
sooner that gold's
out of this bank and in the
san francisco mint, the better.

790
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:42,005
a lot of people
are out to get that nugget.

791
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,178
stillwell, we've been sittin' on
this mountain for two days now.

792
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:51,800
starin' at a bank
through a spyglass...

793
01:04:51,835 --> 01:04:53,635
ain't gonna get us
no richer.

794
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:57,856
you worried
about that sheriff?

795
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:02,861
any time you got one of them
down-home sheriffs, you always
got a town full of vigilantes.

796
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:06,147
we could be
walkin' into
a real hornet's nest.

797
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:07,948
we got to get the gold
sometime.

798
01:05:07,983 --> 01:05:11,486
oh, we're gonna get it.
i never rode no 200 miles...

799
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,989
just to look
at the scenery.

800
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:18,341
dang.
your leg
cutting up again?

801
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:22,380
yeah, it always
acts up on me every time
the weather changes.

802
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:24,382
i'll tell you
one thing sure.

803
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:28,386
if i ever get
in shootin' distance
of that doggone amos tucker,

804
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:31,389
he's gonna have windows
where his ears was.

805
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:52,626
uh, homer?
can we, uh,
talk with you?

806
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,080
as barber, sheriff
or justice of the peace?

807
01:05:55,115 --> 01:05:57,082
justice of the peace.

808
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,384
that's two bits.
but i only got
half a shave!

809
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:06,258
a whole shave's four bits.
now git before i fine you
for loitering.

810
01:06:06,293 --> 01:06:08,260
git, git, git, git.
all right,
all right.

811
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:10,262
i'll see you
next tuesday.

812
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:15,267
dusty, you a willin' party
to this union?

813
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,688
just wanna make sure
they get a square deal
and a good home.

814
01:06:21,606 --> 01:06:26,311
i never teamed two more unlikely
prospects. you go together
like ice cream and whiskey,

815
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:29,564
but i guess
you'd be man and wife,
same as regular people,

816
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,533
and nobody
could say different.

817
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:36,036
now you kids just
make yourselves comfortable.

818
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:39,991
did you want it complete
with the trimmings-- love,
honor and cherish and all that?

819
01:06:40,026 --> 01:06:42,961
kind of like
to hear it anyway.
well, fine.

820
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:45,964
uh, well, let's
just get it over with.

821
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,896
you got a ring?
no.

822
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,232
more legal with a ring.

823
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,614
you hold this till i tell ya.

824
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:26,087
was you gonna keep
your hats on?

825
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,181
you take her, donavan?

826
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:40,301
yes!

827
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:43,855
do you take him, dusty?

828
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,272
i do.

829
01:07:46,307 --> 01:07:50,278
uh, the ring.
give it to mr. donavan.

830
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:03,742
powers invested in me,
the state of california,
county of tulare,

831
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:07,010
i pronounce you hitched.

832
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:09,881
it ain't necessary
for you to kiss
if you don't want to,

833
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:11,883
but you ought to
at least shake on it.

834
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:18,390
well, that's it.
i generally get two dollars
about this point.

835
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:24,396
pay you back.

836
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:30,402
ah.
since you two don't seem
to have no immediate plans,

837
01:08:30,437 --> 01:08:32,819
i'm buyin'.
oh, good, good!

838
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:36,858
oh, dusty, would you mind
just keeping an eye
on the kids for awhile?

839
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,112
might as well
get used to it.

840
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:46,383
come on. let's have
our own celebration.

841
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:49,421
how come mr. donavan's
goin' that way,
and we're goin' this way?

842
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:51,939
it's kind of hard to explain.

843
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:53,958
that all then,
miss cole?

844
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:55,960
all right.
$4.62.

845
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:58,428
i'll put it right here
on your bill.

846
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:01,466
you can each have
a licorice whip
and one jelly bean--

847
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:03,468
but just one.

848
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:06,936
mornin', dusty.
mr. purvey.

849
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:09,599
if you're here
for those grain bags,
they didn't come in yet.

850
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:12,227
i have to get boots and jackets
for the kids.
oh, well, here.

851
01:09:12,727 --> 01:09:16,064
we'll look 'em up
in the catalogue.
i see somebody bought the bed.

852
01:09:16,099 --> 01:09:18,032
yep.

853
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:22,536
sure is pretty.
yeah, sure is.

854
01:09:22,571 --> 01:09:25,039
who'd you sell it to?
donavan.

855
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:29,092
- who?
- mr. donavan.

856
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:32,046
he picked it out
this morning.

857
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:34,048
did he really?

858
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:37,302
did he really?

859
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:53,366
donavan!

860
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:57,655
yes, you, you snake oil
salesman. are you comin' out
here, or am i comin' in there?

861
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,859
- what's the matter?
is there some trouble?
- yes, there's trouble all right,

862
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:02,959
and you're in it.

863
01:10:02,994 --> 01:10:07,115
"all i want
is a chance to be on my way,
unencumbered and unfettered."

864
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:10,201
- that's right.
that's all i wanted.
- don't slick-talk me!

865
01:10:10,236 --> 01:10:12,886
dusty!

866
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,707
wait a minute, dusty.
wait a minute, dusty.
hold it.

867
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:18,126
wait a minute!
wait--

868
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:21,094
dusty--
wait, dusty.

869
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:23,131
wait, wait, dusty.
now wait a minute!

870
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:26,467
dusty, will you just
let me say one word?
one!

871
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:28,720
dusty--
that's it.

872
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:30,388
no!

873
01:10:31,806 --> 01:10:35,310
"nothing could be further
from my mind, miss clydesdale.

874
01:10:35,345 --> 01:10:38,146
you have my word
as a gentleman."
i meant--

875
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:40,148
gentleman?
yeah!

876
01:10:40,183 --> 01:10:42,066
aah!

877
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:50,458
no!

878
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,382
get off of him.
coward.

879
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:59,632
aha!
no!

880
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:01,502
no, dusty.
back! back!
give me that!

881
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:03,504
don't!
don't!

882
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:07,892
now wait a minute, dusty.
now wait.

883
01:11:07,927 --> 01:11:10,345
dusty--
no, no!
wait!

884
01:11:11,846 --> 01:11:13,813
now this is ridiculous.

885
01:11:13,848 --> 01:11:17,235
when you, uh, get rational,
we'll discuss this.

886
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:20,238
oh!
we'll discuss it
right now.

887
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,157
ohh!

888
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:29,128
sorry, ralph.

889
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:32,367
dusty, you're being hysterical.
we can't accomplish anything
this way!

890
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:34,669
what happened
with them two?
they got married.

891
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,089
dusty, be reasonable.
shut up, you liar.

892
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,425
i don't know what's happened,
but i can explain.

893
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:48,600
you're not gettin'
out of it that easy,
you pasteboard slinger.

894
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,602
pay you back, homer.

895
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,107
dusty! dusty! now look.
what's bothering you?

896
01:11:56,608 --> 01:12:00,076
that bed!
that great, big brass bed!

897
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:03,231
if you had no intention
of exercising
your husbandly prerogatives,

898
01:12:03,266 --> 01:12:05,233
why'd you buy that bed?

899
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:10,488
that's it?
the bed?

900
01:12:10,523 --> 01:12:13,456
yes!

901
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:15,458
the bed...

902
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:18,461
happens to be
for the kids, dusty.

903
01:12:18,496 --> 01:12:23,001
with the nights getting colder,
they need a warmer place
to sleep,

904
01:12:23,036 --> 01:12:25,771
so the brass bed
is for the boys,

905
01:12:25,806 --> 01:12:28,506
and the smaller bed
is for celia!

906
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,762
well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

907
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:37,515
we could have avoided
this little misunderstanding.

908
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:46,607
pardon me.
ahem. excuse me, please.

909
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:48,576
come along, celia.

910
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:51,579
this is no place
for a lady.

911
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:16,486
order in the court!

912
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:19,474
order, order!
quiet now!

913
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:33,037
everybody, sit down
and shut up.

914
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:35,540
edgar, you get back
in your seat.

915
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:45,133
i think we've heard
about all the testimony
this building can take.

916
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:50,054
now i'm gonna decide who gets
these sprouts of wintle's,

917
01:13:50,089 --> 01:13:53,049
and that decision
is gonna be final.

918
01:13:53,084 --> 01:13:56,824
this court appreciates
the generosity...

919
01:13:56,859 --> 01:14:00,530
and the kindness
of all you good people...

920
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:03,601
who have offered to provide
homes for these kids...

921
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:06,319
and to safeguard
their assets.

922
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:09,038
proves this town's got
a heart after all.

923
01:14:09,073 --> 01:14:12,994
but after due deliberation
and a consideration
of all the facts...

924
01:14:13,029 --> 01:14:15,446
and the merits
of the applicants,

925
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:18,300
this court awards bobby,

926
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:21,687
clovis
and celia bradley...

927
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:25,039
to mr. and mrs. russel donavan.

928
01:14:27,258 --> 01:14:30,678
that's the order of this court.
i don't want to hear
a lot of argument about it,

929
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:33,931
and i don't want
a half a dozen people
comin' up here--

930
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:42,106
homer. i heard you were
about to gavel off my kin.

931
01:14:47,728 --> 01:14:51,106
that won't be necessary now
since i'm here to claim them.

932
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:54,485
donavan,
thank you for taking
such good care of them.

933
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,669
my lawyer.

934
01:14:56,704 --> 01:14:59,373
he will explain
all the "whereas's"
and "wherefore's."

935
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:03,294
tell them.
tell them, uh, why
the kids are mine,

936
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:05,261
with no maybe's.

937
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:07,632
may it please the court,
i have an order--
what would please this court...

938
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:10,835
is to see both of you
rode out of this town
on a rail!

939
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,720
your honor,
the law--

940
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:16,474
i don't need
no checkered-pants lawyer
to tell me the law.

941
01:15:16,509 --> 01:15:18,259
give me that!

942
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:35,575
all right,
they're yours, wintle.

943
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:41,449
get yourself and that jackleg
outta here before i show you how
contemptuous this court can be.

944
01:15:41,484 --> 01:15:43,951
yes, sir, reverend.

945
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:48,956
that gold's the most valuable
shipment ever entrusted
to the butterfly line.

946
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:53,836
oh, my goodness gracious.
the most valuable shipment.

947
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:57,695
my word.
and exactly how much
does this nugget weigh?

948
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:01,484
three hundred and fifty-six
pounds, without the crating.

949
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:06,107
now, uh, that's not quite
as large as the one they found
in breckenridge.

950
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:09,575
still, that's
a whole lot of gold
all in one piece.

951
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,072
oh, i assume you have
a goodly portion of men
protectin' it.

952
01:16:13,107 --> 01:16:16,534
we're bringin' in
extra guards from
marysville tomorrow.

953
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:18,369
i see.

954
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,739
then you won't be
making your regular
noon passenger run.

955
01:16:21,774 --> 01:16:24,551
well, now--
oh, fear not,
dear brother.

956
01:16:24,586 --> 01:16:27,293
you're speaking to
a servant of the lord.

957
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:30,798
well, bein' a man of the cloth,
it can do no harm.

958
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:33,015
ahem.

959
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,836
they're takin' it out
as soon as the, uh,

960
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:38,339
bank closes
at 4:00 tomorrow,

961
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,842
but they won't be goin'
by the regular route.

962
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:44,143
they'll be goin'
over china grade.

963
01:16:44,178 --> 01:16:49,615
splendid.
splendid idea. why,
i shouldn't imagine...

964
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:53,654
that they would encounter
so much as a horned frog
on that old slag road.

965
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:57,992
my thinkin' precisely.
uh, reverend, could i
buy you a drink?

966
01:16:58,027 --> 01:17:00,159
oh, thank you, no, sir.
i never imbibe.

967
01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:05,166
however, i would be happy
to accept this as
a contribution for the poor.

968
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,669
bless you, brother.
bless you.

969
01:17:19,463 --> 01:17:23,968
well, charlie.
charlie, i seem
to have, uh,

970
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:25,935
left my purse
at the office.

971
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:29,473
i was, uh-- ah.
would you set 'em up
for charlie and me there?

972
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,482
hi, dusty.
howdy.

973
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:45,037
annulment papers.

974
01:17:45,072 --> 01:17:49,827
homer says you can drop 'em off
at the marysville courthouse,
but it'll take two, three days.

975
01:17:54,248 --> 01:17:56,250
we must have set
some kind of record.

976
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:59,135
yes.

977
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,173
well, you're
finally rid of 'em.
what now?

978
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,440
well, i guess
i'll work my way east.

979
01:18:04,475 --> 01:18:06,761
change of scenery,
change of luck, you know.

980
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:09,946
uh, dusty?

981
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:12,066
thanks for what you did.

982
01:18:14,435 --> 01:18:17,438
we tried somethin'.
it didn't work, that's all.

983
01:18:20,024 --> 01:18:22,818
well, good-bye.

984
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:25,613
bye.
donavan?

985
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:32,837
you were a good father
to those kids. they
couldn't have asked for better.

986
01:18:32,872 --> 01:18:35,456
we got along.

987
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,808
well--

988
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:41,594
- and, donavan?
- yeah?

989
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:44,932
i'm sorry
i hit you in the head
with the spittoon.

990
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:48,651
a perfectly logical
misunderstanding.

991
01:18:48,686 --> 01:18:53,941
and i'm sorry that i
offered you a drink
in the saloon too.

992
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:56,894
well, it's a perfectly logical
misunderstanding.

993
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:03,284
well, i wouldn't make
that mistake again.

994
01:19:05,236 --> 01:19:07,038
you wouldn't?

995
01:19:17,081 --> 01:19:18,833
good luck, dusty.

996
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:58,456
how you expect to get warm
sittin' in front of a fire
that's been out for two days?

997
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:02,224
aw, i don't know.
i always used to sit here
for breakfast.

998
01:20:02,259 --> 01:20:06,046
couldn't we build just one
little itty-bitty fire?
it don't seem like home no more.

999
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:08,816
no! amos, i tell you.
we got big trouble.

1000
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,517
we go in town to get food,
we get strung up.

1001
01:20:11,552 --> 01:20:16,307
if we stay here,
we starve to death, if we
don't freeze to death first.

1002
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:18,309
so what's it gonna be?

1003
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:22,813
well-- well,
what if we went down
and told sheriff mccoy...

1004
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:27,902
that we was real sorry
and we wasn't gonna
rob banks anymore?

1005
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:30,538
ever.
right. and we'd even
cross our heart.

1006
01:20:31,989 --> 01:20:34,708
well, that's worth
thinkin' about.

1007
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,879
we wouldn't want to take
any ropes with us,
would we?

1008
01:20:40,631 --> 01:20:42,500
hey, mister.

1009
01:20:47,505 --> 01:20:50,007
what do you kids
want now?

1010
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:52,009
you tell him, bobby.

1011
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:56,979
we want you to have
our gold nugget.

1012
01:20:57,014 --> 01:20:59,782
- what gold nugget?
- the one you tried to steal.

1013
01:20:59,817 --> 01:21:03,612
- oh, that gold nugget.
- all you gotta do is
take it out of the bank.

1014
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:07,408
you kids come all the way
up here just to tell us
to rob the bank again?

1015
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:10,376
we're already sentenced
to be hung for robbin' it
the first time.

1016
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:14,556
say, uh, maybe it's a fix
to smoke us out, theodore.
this isn't any trick.

1017
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:18,702
judge mccoy said mr. wintle
really doesn't want us.
he just wants the gold.

1018
01:21:18,737 --> 01:21:22,006
so if you take the gold,
then mr. wintle
will go away again.

1019
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:24,256
and mr. donavan
will be stuck with us again.

1020
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:27,595
mr. donavan buys us
all the apple dumplings
we can eat.

1021
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:33,350
it ain't like it's really
stealin'. it's our gold,
and we're givin' it to ya.

1022
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:35,186
all you have to do
is pick it up.

1023
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:37,605
we'll help you.

1024
01:21:38,105 --> 01:21:39,607
pardon me
just a minute, ma'am.

1025
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:43,611
what do you think,
theodore?

1026
01:21:44,111 --> 01:21:46,614
oh, i don't know about
the hash knife throwin' in
with a bunch of kids.

1027
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:48,616
how's that gonna look
in the history books?

1028
01:21:49,116 --> 01:21:52,236
we wouldn't have to call it
"hash knife." we could call
them the apple dumpling gang.

1029
01:21:52,271 --> 01:21:54,705
who's gonna know
the difference?
it's like the kid says.

1030
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,041
- it ain't actually stealin'.
- and you better hurry...

1031
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,543
'cause we're
leavin' at 4:00,
when the bank closes.

1032
01:21:59,578 --> 01:22:01,545
theodore?

1033
01:22:03,547 --> 01:22:06,382
all right.
all right! come on.

1034
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:10,888
now, here's the bank.
now we're gonna need some
dynamite to blow the safe.

1035
01:22:10,923 --> 01:22:13,408
we gotta get
some kind of a wagon
to haul off the gold.

1036
01:22:13,443 --> 01:22:15,858
you got that, gang?
now i think we'll go in
the side door.

1037
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:17,895
you remember that side door.
yeah. now when we
were hangin' in there--

1038
01:22:18,395 --> 01:22:20,898
let's see--
that would be
just off to the right.

1039
01:22:21,398 --> 01:22:24,366
you told me to get you
a wagon, didn't ya?
not that wagon.

1040
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:28,871
well, what's wrong with--
look. these are
the fastest horses in town.

1041
01:22:28,906 --> 01:22:31,909
we'll be halfway to mexico
before they find out.
it's too late to change now.

1042
01:22:31,944 --> 01:22:34,078
let's get the thing headed
in the other direction.
right.

1043
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:36,614
you kids keep a lookout
for the sheriff.

1044
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:52,546
i'm sorry.
we're closed.

1045
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:54,548
eh?
i say we're--

1046
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,552
i'm sorry, reverend.
we're closed for the day.

1047
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:00,554
you'll--

1048
01:23:04,391 --> 01:23:06,393
open that safe.

1049
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,495
clovis!

1050
01:23:28,082 --> 01:23:30,301
somebody else
is already robbing the bank.

1051
01:23:32,086 --> 01:23:34,338
come on!

1052
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:42,980
oh, no.
get on in there.

1053
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:45,230
hurry up!

1054
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:48,418
where'd they come from?
they was outside
lookin' in.

1055
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:51,572
get 'em over yonder
out of the way.
and you keep quiet.

1056
01:23:51,607 --> 01:23:54,992
you hear?
ox, keep an eye on 'em.

1057
01:23:55,492 --> 01:23:57,444
get out of the room.

1058
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:03,200
ain't that
the most beautiful sight
you ever saw?

1059
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:07,121
- boy, oh, boy.
- ay-yi-yi. it's heavy.

1060
01:24:07,156 --> 01:24:11,008
- where's the wagon?
- it's right outside.

1061
01:24:11,043 --> 01:24:13,926
easy, boys.
let me catch up with you.

1062
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:16,929
this blasted thing
weighs a ton, dang it.
sure does.

1063
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:20,384
my leg don't work too good
goin' round this turn.
now, that's got it.

1064
01:24:20,419 --> 01:24:22,151
now we got her.

1065
01:24:22,186 --> 01:24:25,105
hey, don't nobody move!
this is a holdup!

1066
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:30,277
we're gonna rob the bank,

1067
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:32,529
and we mean business.

1068
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,531
you're a day late
and a dollar short.

1069
01:24:35,032 --> 01:24:38,035
like he said right here--
did you say it?

1070
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,075
aah!

1071
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:52,131
who in blazes are you?
well?

1072
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:55,085
ahem. uh, mr. stillwell
asked you a question, theodore.

1073
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,721
uh, uh--

1074
01:24:58,806 --> 01:25:01,225
- theodore.
- hi, frank.

1075
01:25:03,977 --> 01:25:06,895
- amos.
- uh, still aren't mad...

1076
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:09,850
'cause i shot you
in the leg, are you, frank?

1077
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:12,770
i guess you are.
please, gentlemen,
no shooting.

1078
01:25:12,805 --> 01:25:14,703
that dynamite is old
and is sweating.

1079
01:25:14,738 --> 01:25:19,076
- if he drops it, there won't
be a bit of this bank left.
- that makes sense.

1080
01:25:19,111 --> 01:25:22,696
all right,
you two, get over here
and out of the way.

1081
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,413
all right.
move.

1082
01:25:24,448 --> 01:25:28,602
get these kids out of here
where we can watch 'em.
all right, you. come on.

1083
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:32,721
you're gonna walk right
out of here ahead of us,
straight to the wagon.

1084
01:25:32,756 --> 01:25:36,376
one peep outta you and
i'll blow a hole in you that
you can throw a mule through.

1085
01:25:36,877 --> 01:25:40,380
you understand?
all right, get to walkin',
and keep smilin'.

1086
01:25:40,415 --> 01:25:42,967
hurry up!
hooks, get ahold of this.

1087
01:25:43,002 --> 01:25:45,519
come on.
easy does it.

1088
01:25:46,937 --> 01:25:49,405
that's our gold!
we said they could have it!

1089
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,560
outta my way. all right,
now we're gonna walk--

1090
01:25:58,398 --> 01:26:00,784
watch out
for that dynamite!

1091
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:07,506
whoa, whoa.

1092
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:12,212
it's the law!
looks like we're gonna have to
blast our way outta here.

1093
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,710
- you idiot.
what's all the firing?

1094
01:26:18,745 --> 01:26:21,088
- they're tryin'
to get the nugget.

1095
01:26:37,437 --> 01:26:40,240
get this thing
off of me!

1096
01:26:40,275 --> 01:26:42,242
hold this.

1097
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:53,420
must be 50 of 'em
in there.
i'll go get old betsy.

1098
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:55,289
somebody
get him a drink.

1099
01:26:56,790 --> 01:27:00,594
take more than that
to get the sting out.

1100
01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:10,304
get down!

1101
01:27:11,805 --> 01:27:13,807
my knees!
get down.

1102
01:27:15,058 --> 01:27:17,326
don't do that
anymore.

1103
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:21,231
get down.
aah! i'm sittin'
on my spurs!

1104
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:36,914
dusty!
ha! ha!

1105
01:27:41,051 --> 01:27:42,903
are you tryin'
to get yourself killed?

1106
01:27:42,938 --> 01:27:44,755
i am trying to stop
a bank robbery.

1107
01:27:45,339 --> 01:27:48,809
well, do it from a safe place,
not the middle of the street!

1108
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:03,407
get it inside!
come on!

1109
01:28:18,255 --> 01:28:20,090
whoa!
aah!

1110
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:31,602
does anyone know where
alvin keeps his corkscrew?

1111
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:54,289
grab these kids,
and let's get out of here.
what about the gold?

1112
01:28:54,324 --> 01:28:59,129
forget about the gold.
we'll be lucky to escape
with our hides. hurry up.

1113
01:29:01,748 --> 01:29:04,933
frank, are you sure
you don't want your gold?

1114
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:08,755
it's all yours, partner.
don't spend it all
in one place.

1115
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,224
i'm gonna buy
some new toes.

1116
01:29:12,976 --> 01:29:15,978
you can't take
those children.

1117
01:29:16,013 --> 01:29:19,016
let's go this way.
frank, our horses
are around front.

1118
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:21,518
well, so is
half the town.
come on.

1119
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,989
i ain't never gonna rob
no bank-- ever, ever, ever.

1120
01:29:28,992 --> 01:29:31,745
that's it!
aah! aah!
i can't move!

1121

the scourge of the west
long enough...

our firearms up for good.

under the same roof with
these two lawless profligates?

their troubles all behind??

tied the knot??
