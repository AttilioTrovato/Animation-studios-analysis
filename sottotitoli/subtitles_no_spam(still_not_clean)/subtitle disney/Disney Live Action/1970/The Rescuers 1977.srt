[p.a. continues]

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,512
Attention, please,
the economic and social council...

7
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,790
will convene
in five minutes.

8
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,956
[p.a. system.:

[p.a. continues]

10
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,994
- Bonjour, Bernard.
- Good day, sir.

11
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,398
- Good day, Mr. ambassador.
- [ Russian ]

12
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,715
- How do you do, Ma'am ?
- [ German ]

13
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,389
- [ gavel pounding ]
- Order, order.
This emergency meeting...

14
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,751
of the international
rescue aid society is now in session.

15
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,668
Delegates, you have been summoned
from all corners of the globe...

16
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,918
... because we have reason to believe
that someone is in distress.

17
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,554
As you know,
our society...

18
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,592
has never failed
to answer a call for help.

19
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,836
- Hear, hear.
[cheering]

20
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,669
We will face the portrait of the
beloved founder of our society,

21
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,031
Euripides mouse.

22
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,550
Delegates,
hands over hearts!

23
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,629
Mouse scouts,
bring in the bottle.

24
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,832
[creaking]

25
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,999
[indistinct chatter]

26
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,999
Mr. Bernard,
if you please.

27
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,673
Uh, coming through,
pardon me.

28
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,916
Have a care there.

29
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,837
- [laughing]
- I'm, I'm--

30
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,474
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir.

31
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,716
- Whoops!
- Egad!

32
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,990
[laughing]

33
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,236
Delegates,
this is no time for levity.

34
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,874
Serious business,
you know, serious business.

35
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,153
[sighing]
Now what?

36
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,319
Sir, there... uh...
are 13 steps on this ladder.

37
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,193
Oh, superstitious nonsense.

38
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,309
[grunting]

39
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,029
[grunting]

40
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,594
What next?

41
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,712
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.

42
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,196
I'll have it out
in a jiffy, sir.

43
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,711
[applause]

44
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,634
Ahem. Ahem.

45
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,713
Hmm, most difficult
to decipher.

46
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,956
I can't make it out.

47
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,872
Terrible trouble.

48
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,356
Oh, dear,
it's all watered out.

49
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,708
Penny?
Morningside orphanage?

50
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,513
Dash it all, it's not
much to go on, is it?

51
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,552
Oh, that poor little girl.

52
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,559
Oh, Mr chairman, please,
please, may I have...

53
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,477
... this assignment?

54
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,309
You? Miss Bianca?
[chuckling]

55
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,876
Dear lady, it's absolutely
without precedent.

56
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,436
I mean, it's not like the old
days when it was a man's world.

57
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,951
However, I suppose
there has to be a first time.

58
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,311
Mr chairman, sir,

59
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,273
I don't think
Miss Bianca should go.

60
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,154
It could be dangerous.
I mean, anything...

61
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,077
... could happen to her.

62
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,751
You see, dear lady, before
our janitor interrupted,

63
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,189
ahem...
I was about to suggest...

64
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,959
... that you should have
a co-agent go with you.

65
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,390
Gentlemen,
who will volunteer?

66
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,557
Why, gentlemen,

67
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,753
this is indeed a most
difficult decision to make.

68
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,999
I choose...
Mr Bernard...

69
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,669
to be my co-agent.

70
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,918
M-me ? Oh, that's
really very, uh--

71
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,953
see, I'm a--
I'm only a-- a janitor.

72
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,709
Oh, come on. We'll be
a great team together.

73
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,671
Oh, come on.

74
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,756
Bravo! Bravo!

75
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,190
[cheering]

76
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,073
A janitor and a lady?
Ho, ho, good heavens,

77
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,555
bless my soul.
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

78
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,515
Morningside
orphanage?

79
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,995
Here, here it is.

80
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,671
Three blocks down and,
uh... four blocks over.

81
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,598
Why don't we take
the short-cut through the zoo?

82
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,156
Gee, Miss Bianca,
I, uh--

83
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,191
I don't know. I mean...
it's... you know--

84
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,676
- It could be risky.
- Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?

85
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,109
Never fail to do
what's right.

86
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,030
All right... duty calls.

87
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,189
[Indistinct sounds]

88
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,792
Mr Bernard, maybe
we better go back.

89
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,310
It's so dark in there.

90
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,874
Dark?

91
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,116
Who's afraid of the dark?

92
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,437
Look, you stay here.

93
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,551
I'll check it out.

94
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,037
[Indistinct sounds]

95
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,074
[Indistinct sounds]

96
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,918
[growling]

97
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,873
Aaah!

98
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,309
Wait for me!

99
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,434
[panting]
How--

100
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,236
How about trying
the three blocks down
and four blocks over?

101
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,874
What did you do
to make him so mad?

102
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,511
Nothing, he's just
a grumpy old lion.

103
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,076
But after all, waking him up
in the middle of the night--

104
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,236
wouldn't you
be grumpy too?

105
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,158
I didn't wake him up
in the middle of the night.

106
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,431
I was walking through,
banging into something.

107
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,197
I'll, uh--

108
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,356
I'll take a look around.
see what I can find.

109
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,319
Psst!
Psst!

110
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,638
Psst! Miss Bianca, over here,
I found something.

111
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,194
These are
Penny's belongings.

112
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,313
Good work.
now we're getting some where.

113
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,310
[Bianca]
Oh, look, the little girl's treasures.

114
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,750
[Bernard]
Boy, the things kids collect.

115
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,599
[Bianca]
Do you think she could be
still here in the orphanage?

116
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,715
[Bianca]
Maybe she's been adopted?

117
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,832
[Bernard]
No, because she would have
taken these things with her.

118
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,599
- Mice!
- Cat!

119
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,154
Now look here,
you two.

120
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,396
If folks find out
that mice moved in here,

121
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,910
I'll get kicked out,
lose my job.

122
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,191
Oh, don't worry,
Mr. cat.

123
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,834
- We won't be here long.
[yawning]

124
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,872
I'm a bit too old
to be chasing mice.

125
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,357
Sir, could you tell us what happened
to a girl named Penny ?

126
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,199
Well, I sure can.

127
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,436
You ain't gonna
find her around here.

128
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,028
The poor little thing
ran away.

129
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,709
When was the last time
you saw Penny?

130
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,116
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.

131
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,870
Let's see now.
the last time I saw her...

132
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,798
She was sitting over there
on her bed.

133
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,036
All alone.

134
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,675
She looked awful sad.
so I asked her,

135
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,590
- What's wrong, Penny honey ?
- Nothing.

136
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,188
Oh, come on now.
come on, no secrets.

137
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,392
You tell old Rufus, huh?

138
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,877
Well, it was adoption day
at the orphanage.

139
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,753
- What happened?
- A man and a lady came...

140
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,476
She was prettier than me.

141
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,558
Oh, she couldn't be.

142
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,752
You listen to me, darlin'.

143
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,556
- You're something extra special.
- No, I'm not.

144
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,478
Why, someday a mama
and a papa'll come
to the orphanage...

145
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,559
... lookin' for a pretty girl
just like you.

146
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,468
- Honest ?
- l'll bet my whiskers on it.

147
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,672
but... you got to believe it.

148
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,237
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
See that bluebird ?

149
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,397
Yes, I do.

150
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,911
Well, faith is a bluebird
you see from afar.

151
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,352
It's for real and assure
as the first evening star.

152
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,040
You can't touch it
or buy it or wrap it up tight,

153
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,594
But it's there
just the same,

154
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,711
Making things
turn out right.

155
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,515
Can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight,

156
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,631
But it's there
just the same,

157
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,433
Making things
turn out right.

158
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,758
But who ever 'dopts me
has to 'dopt teddy too.

159
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,273
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he ?

160
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,996
Oh, here.
I brought you something.

161
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,110
Land of goshen!
Catnip snaps.

162
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,438
No! They're
ginger-snaps!

163
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,996
Well, an old codger
like me...

164
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,351
could use
a little ginger.

165
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,597
We're not supposed
to do that.

166
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,030
You can trust me.

167
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,276
I won't
tattletale on you.

168
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,870
I love you, Rufus.

169
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,718
[purring]

170
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,435
Gee, we better hurry.
We'll be late for supper.

171
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,634
[Rufus]
She seemed happy enough,
but the next thing I heard,

172
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,591
Penny was gone.

173
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,871
Well, aren't the police
still looking for her?

174
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,310
No, no,
they gave up weeks ago.

175
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,910
Oh, this is terrible.
that poor little girl.

176
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,669
I just can't believe
that Penny would run away.

177
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,598
Mr. Rufus, please think.
there must be something.

178
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,076
Well, come to think of it...

179
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,589
...there was.

180
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,508
No, no, it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.

181
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,519
Get in what?
With who?

182
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,596
A weird lady tried
to give Penny a ride,

183
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,950
She wouldn 't have anything
to do with trashy people.

184
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
Trashy people?
Who?

185
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,754
She and her partner run a sleazy
pawnshop down the street.

186
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,270
Miss Bianca, we must
go down there and investigate.

187
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,439
Suit yourself, but you'd be
wastin' your time goin' down there.

188
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,269
She could be in trouble.
we gotta find and help her.

189
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,473
Yeah, but
two little mice?

190
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,670
What--
What can you do?

191
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,910

Bernard, a child's book.

193
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,989
- It's Penny's.
- then she's got to be here.

194
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,271
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

195
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,994

196
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,839

[ringing]

201
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,188
Who could be ringing
at this time of the night?

202
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,034
Madame Medusa's
pawnshop boutique.

203
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,878
- Hello, boss?
- Snoops!

204
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,798
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

205
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,038
You found it. Ha-ha-ha!
You've found the diamond!

206
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,630
[snoops indistinct]
- Give you time?

207
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,796
You bungler!

208
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,357
You have been down there
for three months.

209
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,074
[snoops indistinct]
- Bottles?

210
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,156
What bottles?

211
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,431
You caught Penny...

212
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,233
Sending messages
in bottles!

213
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,273
You blundering fool!
Can't you control...

214
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,152
A little girl?

215
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,918
Shut up!

216
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,589
I am taking the next flight
down to devil's bayou.

217
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,749
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.

218
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,075
Yeah, come on,

219
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,273
[sighing]
Bumbling boob!

220
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,472
He fouls up everything.

221
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,354
Leave him for a few weeks
and hah--

222
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,873
Oh, why won't this
stupid thing close?

Medusa could be at
the devil's bayou by now.

229

[panting]
I'm sorry,

230
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,997
But a lady does have
to pack a few things, you know?

231

[p.a. system]
Will Mr. Jenkins report
to the ticket counter, please?

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,194
Miss Bianca,
if you hadn't--

237
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,949

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,471
We are lucky, Mr Bernard.

241
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,353
Luck? Flight 13?

242
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,552
Maybe we'd better
take the train.

243

244
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,636

256
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,115
Then give him
the permission to land.

257
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,476
Captain, you have
our permission to land.

258

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,999
It's good for
what ails ya.

348
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,319
There, where
you folks from, anyway?

349
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,236
We're--
[clearing throat]

350
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,430
[whispering]
We're from new York.

351
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,232
[Orville]
Now stand back, folks.

352
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,590
I ain't gonna hang around
this creepy place long.

353
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,154
Clear the runway!

354
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,989
[coughing]

355
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,678
Great balls fireproof!

356
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,150
[panting]

357
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,712
Ooo-ooo!
Aah-aah!

358
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,990
Ooo!
[squawk]

359
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,749
[squawking]

360
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,953
Holy smoke! Why don't you
watch where you're going?

361
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,911
[coughing]

362
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,353
Bernard, it's that
terrible Medusa!

363
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,755
I'd like to give her a few whacks
with my rolling pin.

364
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,555
We swamp folks would like
to run her out of our bayou.

365
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,796
[indistinct noise]
- Hold it! hold it!

366
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,717
Somebody's comin'
this way!

367
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,716
Why'd you have to go
and spoil everything?

368
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,719
Nero, don't you dare
get my teddy bear wet.

369
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,630
Oh, it's that
poor little young'un.

370
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,876
She's tried
to run away again.

371
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,709
It's Penny!
Oh, how terrible.

372
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,197
Hurry! We've got to find out
where they're taking her!

373
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,634
You need a boat.
Evinrude's got
the fastest boat here!

374
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,990
Evinrude!
Wake up!

375
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,680
- Start your engine, boy!
[buzzing]

376
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,472
Send Evinrude back
as soon as you need help.

377
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,034
I'll round up
the neighbors!

378
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,992
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!

379
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,194
[coughing]
You stop that, Brutus!

380
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,992
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.

381
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,757
Slow down,
Evinrude.

382
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,878
[panting]
They got to be
around here somewhere.

383
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,709
[panting]

384
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,833
Oh, dear,
we've lost them.

385
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,032
Jehoshaphat!

386
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,994
Hang on!
Hard aport, Evinrude!

387
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,033
Help!
We're gonna--

388
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,309
Help!
Bernard !

389
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,874
Bianca!

390
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,592
Come on, Evinrude!
Give it all you got!

391
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,996
[Bianca]
Keep trying, Evinrude!

392
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,829
[panting, gasping]

393
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,636
Poor Evinrude,
your carburettor
is all pooped out.

394
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,956
Bring her right on in, boys.

395
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,753
[chuckling]
Come on.

396
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,237
So you tried to run away.
didn't work, did it ?

397
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,194
Put me down,
Brutus!

398
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,231
Creepy old dragon.

399
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,476
Nice work, good boys.

400
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,189
Steady, boys!
D-d-down, boys! Heel, heel!

401
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,474
There, there, teddy.
I won't let them do
that to you again.

402
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,636
Don't cry.

403
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,638
Now, teddy, teddy.
Poor teddy.

404
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,593
All she ever thinks about
is that simple bear.

405
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,712
You behave or I'll let
Nero and Brutus have
your old teddy bear.

406
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,549
You will not. besides,
I'm not scared of them...

407
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,955
Like you are,
Mr. Snoops!

408
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,551
Don't you sass me!
Boys, take this naughty
girl to her room.

409
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,628
I can go by myself.
Thank you!

410
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,950
[popping sounds]

411
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,316
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll signal if we need ya.

412
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,193
Look out!
Here she comes!

413
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,152
Where is she?
Where is she?

414
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,390
Where is she?
Oh, I sent her up to her room.

415
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,156
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?

416
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,078
Nitwit?
Don't blame me.

417
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,715
Those leather-headed lizards of yours,
they're supposed to patrol the island.

418
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,434
They let her get away.

419
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,074
Ha!

420
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,794
My precious pets!

421
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,435
We know who caught
that ungrateful brat,

422
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,391
Don't we, hmm?

423
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,876
[snoops]
lt was your idea to use
a little girl for this caper.

424
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,389
lf you'd
left it to me--

425
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,750
[Medusa]
Snoops! You're not thinking.

426
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,589
[snoops]
l know, she's the only one small
enough to squeeze down the hole.

427
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,111
[Medusa]
Yes, but why can't
she find my big diamond?

428
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,994
[snoops]
l don't know, but just look at
these beauties she brought up.

429
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,076
They'll sell for
a lot of cold cash.

430
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,318
[snoops]
Owww! l wish you
wouldn 't do that!

431
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,149
She's insane, utterly mad.

432
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,077
I want that diamond.

433
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,673
You didn't leave the girl
down in the cave long enough.

434
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,598
She won't take orders.

435
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,032
You are too soft.

436
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,913
The water was rising
and the tide was coming in.

437
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,794
All she did down there was fuss
about her teddy getting wet.

438
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,356
Snoops,
you don't have a way...

439
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,357
with children.

440
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,790
You must gain
their confidence,

441
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,956
make them like you.

442
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,913
Yeah?
How do you do that?

443
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,713
You force them
to like you, idiot !

444
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,516
At the next low tide
I'm going to put her down there,

445
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,030
myself,
and keep her there...

446
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,549
until she finds it.

447
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,148
It is as simple as that.

448
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,636
Oh, simple as that,
is it?

449
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,399
Well, you're the boss, boss.

450
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,035
Yes.

451
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,118
Now, come along,
petsy-poos.

452
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,993
We gotta get penny
out of here tonight.

453
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,596
- uh-oh, Bianca!
they smell your perfume.
- Oh, dear.

454
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,157
Aaah!

455
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,912
- Oh no!
- Bianca!

456
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,079
- Aaah !
- Let go, you big-bullies.

457
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,755
[panting]

458
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,876
[Medusa]
Brutus! Nero!

459
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,675
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean, now!

460
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,632
[screaming]
Snoops! Snoops!

461
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,673
A mouse!
Oh, kill it! Kill it!

462
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,837
[Medusa]
Run, Snoops, kill it!

463
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,434
[Medusa]
There's another one!

464
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,399
Oh, what is wrong
with this thing?

465
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,592
[clicking]

466
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,914
Snoops!
What's wrong?

467
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,519
- I don't--
[gunshot]

468
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,837
Evinrude, over here!

469
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,757
Are you all right, dear?

470
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,474
She tried to kill us,

471
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,398
that... that terrible woman!

472
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,035
Oh, if I was only
a ten-foot mouse, I'd show her!

473
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,072
It's-- it's no use, Bianca.

474
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,636
Maybe Rufus the cat
was right.

475
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,991
What can two little mice do?

476
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,953
But, Bernard,
the society's counting on us.

477
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,877
We can't quit now.

478
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,753
Oh, and that little girl,

479
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,111
we've just
got to rescue her!

480
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,237
Penny, dear?

481
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,672
Auntie Medusa
wants to talk to you.

482
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,915
High tide or not,

483
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,828
that little brat is going
to find me that diamond...

484
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,350
tomorrow... or else!

485
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,473
- [knocking]
- Come in. Come in.

486
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,592
Did you wanna see me,
ma'am?

487
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,793
Yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.

488
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,674
Now, l am going to let
by-gones be by-gones.

489
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,793
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?

490
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,879
Yes. you want me
to find that diamond.

491
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,355
That's right, dear.

492
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,109
But I tried as hard
as I could... honest !

493
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,310
Of course you have,

494
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,830
But we must try harder,
mustn't we?

495
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,033
Then please, will you take me
back to the orphanage...

496
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,675
- Like you promised?
- Penny, don't you like it here?

497
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,872
A big, beautiful boat
all to yourself!

498
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,549
But if I don't get back
to the orphanage...

499
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,796
I'll never get 'dopted.

500
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,911
Adopted?

501
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,270
What makes you think
anyone would want...

502
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,075
A homely little girl
like you?

503
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,795
Good night, teddy.

504
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,229
Sleep tight.

505
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,875
Oh, we almost forgot
to say our prayers.

506
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,917
Please bless...

507
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,635
Rufus and teddy...

508
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,671
and all the kids
at the orphanage:

509
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,873
Jennifer, Bobby,
Mary, Julie.

510
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,754
And please let some one
find my bottle.
There's a message in it.

511
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,555
Because running away
isn't working. Amen.

512
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,513
Don't worry, teddy.

513
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,076
We'll be...
[sniffing]

514
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,077
All right.

515
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,150
[sniffing]

516
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,669
Penny? Penny?

517
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,558
Yes?

518
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,394
Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.

519
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,150
Wait. Hi!
Where'd you come from?

520
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,397
We found the bottle
with your message and
we've come to rescue you.

521
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,310
Did you hear that, teddy?
Our bottle worked!

522
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,238
Didn't you bring
somebody big with you?

523
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:45,070
- Like the police?
- No, there's just the two of us.

524
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,670
But if the three of us
worked together, and
we have a little faith--

525
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,598
That's what Rufus said!

526
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,359
Faith makes things
turn out right.

527
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,268
I know it's late but we have
to escape tonight... right now.

528
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,676
But I just got caught
by Brutus and Nero.

529
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,030
Look what they did
to my pants!

530
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,232
Yeah, and they're still down there
guarding the gangplank.

531
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,430
Oh, those vicious monsters!

532
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,676
They ought to be
locked up in a cage.

533
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,109
I know!
I know!

534
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,037
C'mon, I'll show ya.

535
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,554
See there?
The elevator.

536
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,796
[Bianca]
lt's a perfect cage, Penny.

537
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,752
Great idea.

538
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,633
Now, what can we use
for bait?

539
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,557
They'll eat anything.

540
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,796
Yeah, I know.

541
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,990
I've got it...
My perfume!

542
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,953
Remember?
They'll follow the scent
right into the elevator!

543
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,719
And I'll slam the door.

544
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,308
And will that make
Medusa mad!

545
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,715
Brutus, Nero!

546
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,673
Did you let that
little brat escape again?

547
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,677
You're too soft !

548
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,916
Wap! Wap!

549
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,110
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Penny, that's not bad.

550
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,109
That's exactly like Medusa.

551
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,391
Track her down, boys!
Bring her back!

552
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,592
We'll be so far ahead,
They'll never catch us.

553
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,190
Wait a minute.
She might catch us...

554
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,791
I've always wanted
to drive it.

555
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,275
Vroom-vroom!
Vroom-vroom!

556
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,198
What if Medusa wakes up
while we're starting it ?
We're in trouble.

557
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,915
We've gotta stall 'em
somehow.

558
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,998
How about Mr Snoops'
fireworks?

559
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,749
We'll shoot 'em off
in her bedroom.
That'll keep her busy.

560
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,713
Oh, Bernard,
It's so exciting.

561
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,593
Perfume, crocs,
swamp-mobile!

562
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,950
It's just got to work!

563
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,071
It's our only chance.

564
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,156
But we're
gonna need help.

565
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,955
[Medusa]
Snoops, get down here!

566
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,231
What's up, Medusa?
What's going on?

567
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,637
[Medusa]
Oh, shut up!

568
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,514
- High tide or not--
- I bet those two
are up to something.

569
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,474
I don't wanna go down
in that awful black hole again.

570
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,513
Don't worry about that.
You must hurry and get dressed.

571
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,915
C'mon.
We haven't got much time.

572
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,430
Evinrude, up here.

573
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,550
We need help.
Go get Ellie-Mae!

574
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,477
And hurry!

575
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,755
[cheering]

576
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,997
Are you ready to help rescue
that little young'un?

577
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,918
- Sure enough !
- Hallelujah!

578
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,349
- Luke!
[snoring]

579
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,789
On your feet,
you lazy critter !

580
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,673
Ooo-shh!
Shucks, Ellie-Mae,

581
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,789
Dag-nabit!
Let's cut out the jawin'
and get a-goin'!

582
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,753
Hee-hee. when ol' gramps
gets head-up,

583
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,235
his nose gets
plumb out of joint.

584
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,237
Take it easy, gramps.

585
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,079
We gotta stay here 'til
Evinrude brings us word
from them mice.

586
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,589
If'n that bug
don't get here soon,

587
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,995
they'll put that poor little girl
down the black hole again.

588
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,915
All right,
you little brat.

589
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,270
You are gonna go down
in that hole...

590
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,472
And you're gonna dig
till you find me the diamond.

591
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,830
and no sassing me!

592
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,757
[Medusa]
Uh-uh-uh, Snoops!

593
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,749
That is no way to speak
to our little Miss Penny.

594
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,315
Oh, okay, boss.
Okay.

595
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,874
Now, my dear,

596
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,310
you're going to find
the big, shiny diamond...

597
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,558
for your auntie Medusa,
aren't you, hmm ?

598
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,671
[penny]
Teddy doesn 't like it down there.

599
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,519
He's afraid,
aren't you, teddy?

600
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,155
Ahh, tsk-tsk.
Poor teddy.

601
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,034
I'll just keep him up here
with me where he'll be safe.

602
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,631
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!

603
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,838
You get down there and
find the big diamond...

604
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,111
or you will never
see teddy again!

605
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,755
All right.
All right.

606
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,996
I'll go.

607
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,271
[snoops]
Boss, you really got
a way with kids.

608
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,638
Don't worry, teddy,
I won't be gone long.

609
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,796
l'll find her ol' diamond!

610
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,312
[water dripping]

611
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,516
Oh, what a dreadful,
frightening place!

612
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,076
Yeah, it used to be
a pirate's cave.

613
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,952
How do you know that,
Penny ?

614
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,231
- Him!
- Ah! Oh dear!

615
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,512
C'mon, girls.
Let's look for that diamond
so we can get out of here.

616
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,437
I looked there already.

617
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,677
Medusa doesn't want
those little ones.

618
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,360
[rumbling sounds]

619
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,552
Wha-- What's--
What's that?

620
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,717
[water sloshing]

621
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,717
[penny]
That's where
the water comes in.

622
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,798
Ooo! I'm afraid
to go over there.

623
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,310
Well, if I was a pirate,

624
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,590
that's just where
I'd hide the devil's eye.

625
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,157
I'll, uh, go over
and check it out.

626
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,752
[loud rumbling
and sloshing]

627
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,113
Come--
Come to think of it,

628
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,231
if I was a pirate,
I wouldn't--

629
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,351
I wouldn't hide
anything back there.

630
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,996
Bernard, look!
I can see something.

631
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,839
- C'mon, let's see what it is.
- No, Bianca.

632
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,349
You stay here.

633
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,553
I'll see if i can find
a safe way over.

634
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,710
[rumbling and sloshing]

635
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,556
Aaah!

636
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,591
- Bianca!
- Hang on!

637
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,995
Help!

638
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,917
I'm coming.

639
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,672
[Medusa]
What are you doing down there?

640
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,597
I'm looking!

641
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,154
Well, look faster!

642
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,349
Wow!

643
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,792
[tingling sounds]

644
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,037
Penny, hold
your lantern up again.

645
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,990
- Holy mackerel! That's it.
- The devil's eye!

646
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,113
Penny, we found it!
We found it!

647
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,755
Medusa, I found it!

648
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,314
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa.

649
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,590
Back!
Ah, good girl!

650
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,790
Good girl!
Let's get it up here.

651
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,672
[rumbling]

652
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,596
[Bernard]
Look, it won't go through.

653
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,517
We can't get it out.

654
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,154
[Medusa]
What's taking so long?

655
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,077
It's stuck tight.

656
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,829
Stuck tight!
You get that diamond...

657
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,589
or you'll never see
daylight again!

658
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,309
[Bernard]
No, back, Penny!

659
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,477
[Bianca]
Penny, you'll fall!

660
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,397
[screaming]

661
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,757
[coughing]

662
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,637
Forget the diamond.

663
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,671
Let's get out of here
before we drown !

664
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,870
The water's coming in!
Please pull me up.

665
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,468
Not until you
get the diamond!

666
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,989
Penny, the pirate's sword.

667
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,111
Use the sword!

668
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,990
[grunting]

669
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,235
[Bianca]
Penny! Penny, help!

670
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,437
I've got it!
I've got it!

671
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,597
Hurry!
Pull me up!

672
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,837
Faster!
Faster!

673
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,111
- I'm pulling as fast as I can.
- Ahh-ha-ha-ha!

674
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,879
At last!

675
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,195
The devil's eye!

676
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,551
At last!
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

677
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,752
It's worth millions!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

678
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,156
Mmm!
Just look at it.

679
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,794
Filled with power...

680
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,598
for its owner.

681
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,232
Let me look at it.

682
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,794
I got-- hey, that wasn't
a very good look.

683
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,388
[screaming]
- But know
there's enough there...

684
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,592
to cut it into
two equal shares.
- You idiot!

685
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,234
Cut up a perfect gem!

686
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,352
And it's mine.
It's all mine!

687
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,110
All yours! Half of it is mine,

688
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,028
- Put me down, Brutus.

689
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,994
- [snoops]: Double-crosser!
- [Medusa] Cheap pickpocket.

690
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,749

[gasping]

692
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,917
Land sakes,

693
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,917
Ol' ev sure is a mess.

694
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,998
- Where in tar-nation

- What's happening?

695
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,756
- Do they want us now?

696
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,757
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.

697
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,316
Buck up! We mustn't be
quitting now, must we?

698
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,237
[sighing]

699
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,828
Stand back!

700
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,349
Give poor Evinrude
some air.

701
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,391
He's plumb tuckered out.

702
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,715
Here, son.

703
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,751
This'll make

704
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,348
Gulp! Gulp!

705
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,672
- Ya-hoo!
- Yoo-hoo!

706
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,075
[cheering]

707
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,111
We're gonna have us
a rip-snortin' fight.

708
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,836
Yip...pee!

709
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,952
Charge!

710
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,469
Where'd everybody go?

711
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,588
I don't need any help
from anybody!

712
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,235
- Charge!
- Ya-hoo!

713

[snoops]
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!

715
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,991
Shut up, Snoops,
and don't move.

716
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,079
lf either of you
try to follow me,

717
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,077
you'll get blasted!

718
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,590
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.

719
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,757
Teddy goes with me,
my dear.

720
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,590
l've become
quite attached to him.

721
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,517
Heh-heh-heh-heh!

722
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,349
- Yeow!
[gunshot]

723
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,392
Ah! My diamond!
My diamond!

[screaming]

725
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,511
[whistling]

726
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,959
Now!

727
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,474
Now! Now!

728
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,956
[engine sputtering]

729
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,594
[Bernard]
Look out!

730
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,272
Oh, please start.

731
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,197
Advance the spark!

732
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,510
Not the horn!
The spark lever!

733
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,949
Digger, hold this.

734
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,036
It's the doohickey
on the steering wheel.

735
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:34,278
[Medusa]
You! You and your
infernal fireworks!

736
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,516
You--
[screaming]

737
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,278
You dunderhead!

738
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,313
- We're not getting any gas.
- Fill her up, Luke.

739
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,954
Hurry... all of it.

740
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,429
[screaming]

741
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,593
Look out!
The riverboat!

742
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,678
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

743
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,075
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray!

744
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,998
Bernard,
you're wonderful!

745
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,318
- We did it!
- We sure showed
that Medusa woman!

746
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,591
There goes...

747
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,439
...my diamond!
[sobbing]

748
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,319
... and because of a courageous
little girl named Penny,

749
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,908
the world's largest diamond,
the devil's eye,

750
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,474
is now in the
Smithsonian institute.

751
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,319
But what's even
more important, folks,

752
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,273
this little orphan's dream
has come true.

753
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,470
Today she's being adopted.

754
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,037
And here she is with
her new mother and father.

755
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,790
Bernard, I am so happy
for Penny.

756
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,354
Yes, uh, you might say
that Penny, uh...

757
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,277
... brought us together.

758
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,516
You are a darling.

759
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,437
Penny, you were
a brave little girl,

760
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,551
to do what you did
all by yourself.

761
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,875
I didn't do it
all by myself.

762
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,834
Two little mice from the
rescue aid society helped me.

763
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,952
Mice?
Rescue aid society?

764
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,834
Yes, they rescued me.
Could i say hello to them?

765
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,316
Hello, Bianca!
Hi, Bernard!

766
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,910
- You can talk to
these little mice?
- All the time.

767
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,032
Mice can talk like anybody.
didn't you know that?

768
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,550
[announcer]
Well, l didn 't.
But l do now, Penny.

769
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,433
[applause]

770
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,909
Evinrude,
what are you doing here?

771
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,589
[gasping]

772
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,599
It's another call for help.

773
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,349
Here. Uh, you're gonna
need some volunteers.

774
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,631
Bu-- but, Bianca--

775
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,354
Oh, Bernard, adventure,

776
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,029
Thrills, intrigue,
travel, exotic places.

777
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,276
Oh, come on, darling,
let's go.

778
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,996
Sure wish we had
taken the train!

779
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,916
Yah-ho-ho-ho-hee!

780
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,399
[gasping]
