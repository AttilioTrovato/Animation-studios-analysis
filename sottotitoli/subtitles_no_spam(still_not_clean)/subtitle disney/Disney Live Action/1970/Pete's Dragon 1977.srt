331
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:42,332
Well, as far as we know,
his ship was headed for a storm.

332
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:47,588
They were never heard from
again. That was a year ago.

333
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,716
He'll come back.

334
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,468
I tell myself
the same thing every day,

335
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:57,389
standing up there
watching for ships on the horizon.

336
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:01,101
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking
of other things, so they tell me.

337
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,188
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.

338
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,356
He has a way
of knowing things.

339
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,442
Who's Elliott?

340
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,528
- My dragon.
- Dragon?

341
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,865
[Gasps] So you're
the boy with the dragon.

342
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,367
- Yup.
- Where is he?

343
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,871
- Down in the cave.
- That's interesting.

344
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:24,750
I've never known anyone with
a dragon. What does he look like?

345
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,211
Just a plain,
ordinary dragon.

346
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:30,214
How plain?
How ordinary?

347
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:33,884
# He has the head of a camel #

348
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,136
# The neck
of a crocodile #

349
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,764
It sounds rather strange.

350
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,309
# He's both
a fish and a mammal #

351
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:48,106

he'll never change #

O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?

395
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:30,204
- No, Elliott's down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...

396
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:35,042
Elliott? It... It even has a name.

You're right. Right, there's

Nothing. No, why should I
get upset? I should be happy.

400
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:48,680
I... I should be happy! I'll go down
to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.

401
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:53,393
I'll say, "Boys, here it is." Then
hear the apologies. [Laughs]

402
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:57,105
Elliott'll be happy
to do it for you, sir.

403
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,483
Good boy. Good lad.

404

We'll go into the saloon.

He won't... won't start
to scratch or...

on fire, will he?

408
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,955
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?

409
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:17,000
- Unpredictable.
- Don't do anything with Elliott.

410
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,086
Wh-Why don't you
leave him where he is?

411
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:22,631
- It's too dangerous
to take him into town.
- It's dangerous.

412

I don't want either one of you

00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,727
and I want to take Pete
to buy new clothes.

417
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,813
Yes, well, clean Elliott
and eat the lamp.

418
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,274
I mean, we'll...
clea-clean the lamp.

Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?

In my scientific opinion,
the existence of a dragon...

of gigantic proportions.

become history and science.

the dragon is scary

995
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:22,437
I'll offer him five.
It'll make his head swim.

996
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:25,941
Five... dollars.

997
01:24:26,024 --> 01:24:29,278
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.

01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:33,365
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?

999
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:35,951
Well, nobody, I guess.

1000
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:39,580

goes to those who need him.

1002
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:45,586
Listen Doc, I don't know what you're up to,
but you better forget about this.

1003
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:49,089
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.

1004
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:52,092
Pete, my boy,
you're conversant with Elliott.

1005
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,762
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.

1006
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:58,891
Look, deliver Elliott to me
and the fiver is yours,

1007
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:04,313

that's guaranteed to bring on
puberty two years ahead of time,

1008
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:06,982

a dragon, hmm? [Chuckling]

1009
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:11,236
- Doc, maybe you should
talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

1010
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,447
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?

1011
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,741
Down the beach.

1012
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,747
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.

1013
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:32,883
- Right. I still don't see...
- That's because he's invisible today.

Well, they've had their chance
to make a few dollars.

1017
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:02,621

He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!

- There's not much fog.

1028
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:45,998
We were just using the horn
to chase off a few buzzards.

1029

how many times must I...

1030

Oh, started already, huh?

1031
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:55,174

- This is fun.

1036
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:09,188

it to you and Nora to finish up...

1037
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:13,233

a nice little nap.

1041
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,628
Pete, Lampie and I
have talked it over.

1042
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:37,424
- We feel the time has come
for you to stop running.
- Yes, it's true.

1043
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:42,346
<i>If it's all right with you,</i>
<i>we'd like you to live here with us.</i>

1044
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:48,268
Oh Nora, Lampie, do you mean this
could be my real home?

1045
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:52,064
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?

1046
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:55,776
- Well, I...
- Sure, and Elliott too.

1047
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,529
But Elliott has to live
in the cave.

1048
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:01,281
