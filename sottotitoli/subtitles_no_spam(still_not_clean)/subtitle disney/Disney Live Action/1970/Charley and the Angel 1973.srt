18
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,784

00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,921
        We still haven't decided
        what Leonora's going
        to do this fall.

20
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,624
        Go to college or what?
        What do you think, dear?

21
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,227
    I think if business
    doesn't pick up,

22
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,796
    I'm going to have
    to put on some kind
    of a sale or something.

23
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,432
        Charles, are you talking
        about the store again?

24
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,668
    Of course, I was
    talking about the store.

25
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,671

    five customers today.

26

27
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,374
    What about her?

28
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,777
           Well, I just
           got through sa--

29
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,713
           Charles, look.
           Look, look.
           A shooting star.

30
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,881
               Charles.

31
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,650
               Charles.

32
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,219
       I see it, Nettie.

33
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,821
            It-- It pointed
            right at you.

34
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,456
           Do you think
           that means something?

35
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,958

      Where's the star?

37
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,229
            Well, it's gone now.

38
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,397
        It went down over behind
        the Methodist church.

39
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,533
            It shone right on
            your father.

40
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,271

41

              Oh, well, uh--

00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,741
Leonora:
I know what I wish.

43
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,344
      I wish that
      someday I'll have
      a beautiful wedding

44
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,546
      with pink flowers.

45
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,948
              You didn't see
              the star, Leonora.

46
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,884
Pop saw it.
So what do you wish, Pop?

           [buzzing]

48
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,256

    would let me alone.

49
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,024
                    Go on, Mom,
                    make a wish.

50
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,829
           I wish...

51
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,764
    No, I'm not gonna tell.

52
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,866
                  Come on, Ma.
                  Just tell us.

53
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,372
   Please.

54
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,440
         I wish...
         we could all
         go to Chicago

55
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,842
   and see the World's Fair.

56
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,377
                What an idea!

57
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,711
   - Yeah, Dad, how about it?
   - Dad, please?

58
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,946
      - Come on.
      - Could we, please?

59
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,017
   How I'd love to see that.

60
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,918
                Oh, Charles,

61
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,754
               do you think we--

62
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,859
          No, I guess not.

63
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,529
  Daddy, why are you
  so dead set against
  taking Mom on a nice trip?

64
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,465
 Leonora, if there's one thing
 that's a bigger waste

65
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,567
 of time and money than a fair,
 I haven't heard of it.

66
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,970
   Besides, there's
   a depression on, you know.

67
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,973
Don't these wishes
ever come true, Pop?

68
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,676
           Rupert, there's only
           one way to get things
           in this world,

69
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,377
             and that's
             to work for them.

70
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,645
   I think we ought to go in

71
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,714
    before these mosquitoes
    eat us alive.

72
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,964
            What do you think
            you're doing, nutty?

73
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,834
    I'm wishing for
    Mom's wish to come true.

74
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,571
      Didn't you hear
      what Pops said about
      that wishing junk?

75
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,874
  Well, I don't care.
  Maybe he doesn't think
  about such things.

76
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,710
  All he knows is work.

77
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,549

Oh, good morning,
Miss Partridge.

83
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,879
            Good morning.
            Now, Pierre,
            you be a gentleman.

84
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,116
            I don't ever recall
            you having a sale
            before, Mr. Appleby.

85
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,784
    Well, that's true,
    Miss Partridge.

86
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,953
But we've never had times
like these before, either.

87
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,455
                   Oh, so true.
                   So very true.

88
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,593
            Now, let me see
            if I understand
            this sale correctly.

89
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:38,130
         I could buy this little
         green tea pot for, uh--

90
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,998
For the regular price:
$2.00.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,701
              And then I would
              get the orange one
              for just a penny?

92
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,736
That's right.
$2.00 for the green one

93
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,037
and just one cent
for the orange one.

94
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,906
           Oh, that's very good.

95
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,475
                 That is a very
                 ingenious sale.

96
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,445
                   That's $2.00,
                   and one cent.

97
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,646
                    Oh, dear.

98
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,882
   Something wrong,
   Miss Partridge?

99
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,484
               Uh, the green one
               is chipped.

100
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,620
                Do you see that,
                Mr. Appleby?

101
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,854
Oh, it is a little
chipped, isn't it?

102
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,022
Maybe I can
find another one.

103
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,991
            Oh, no, no.
            Please don't bother.

104
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,527
            I'll just
            take the orange one.

105
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,896
          And here's your penny.
          Good day, Mr. Appleby.

00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,266
                  You don't even
                  look like one.

285
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,335
      Oh, Charley.
      You're such a pain.

286
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,271
All right,
look over there.

287
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,212
                    Satisfied?

288
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,389
    Now then, let's get down
    to cases, Charley.

289
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,691
      We know your number
      is up, so--

290
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,659
                Look, I can't
                go with you now.

291
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,694
                I'm not ready.

292
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,162
    You birds never are.

293
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,130
          Well, I've got to have
          more time.

294
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,566
      More time?
      Are you kidding?

295
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,235
You never learned how to use
the time you've already had.

296
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,105
        What do you mean?
        I've always made a good
        living for my family.

297
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,206
You call that living?

298
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,407
        Well, I couldn't afford

299
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,176
            to do all those
            exciting things.

300
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,645
        How expensive is it
        to go out and play
        ball with the kids?

301
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,147
        Would a 50 cent
        bottle of cologne
        for your wife break you?

302
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,016
               That's all
               well and good--

303
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,986
As far as I know,
there's no charge at all
for a good sunset.

304
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,588
All you have to do
is take time to look at it.

305
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,492
        Uh, wait a minute.
        Where are you going?

306
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,728
This thing is so fouled up,
I gotta go back

307
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,063
and find out when and how
they're gonna take you.

308
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,399
         They've already
         tried three times.
         Isn't that enough?

309
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,634
   Look, kid, when
   your number's up, it's up.

310
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:47,338
     I've got to have more time.
     There's so many things
     I have to do.

311
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,640
   Well, you've got
   one thing in your favor.

312
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,142
      You're still here.

313
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,711
              Wait. What do I do
              in the meantime?

314
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,014
                  If I were you,

315
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,749
                I'd drive
                more carefully.

316
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,512
Hello, dear.

317
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,747
                    [gasps]
                    Charles.

318
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,649
                    What are you
                    doing home?

319
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,151
I thought I'd
surprise you, honey.

320
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,186
            Oh, you scared me
            half out of my wits.

321
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,454
       The lodge hall burn down?

322
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,389
Not that I know of.

323
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,591
     Here.

324
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,393
               Oh, where did you
               find those?

325
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,662
I didn't find them,
I bought them.
For you.

326
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,532
                    For me?

327
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,167
        Why, what have you done?

328
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,069
  I haven't done
  anything, Nettie.

329
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,638
Is it against the law
for a man to buy his wife
a few flowers?

330
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,342
                  No, no.
                  Of course not.

331
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,346
                They're lovely.

332
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,581
                  Thank you.

333
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,352
             All right, Charles.
             What happened?

334
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,654
                Why aren't you
                at the lodge?

335
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,689
I decided not to go.

336
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,125
I'd rather spend the time
here with my family.

337
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,661
Nettie, have you seen
the sunset out there?

338
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,596
    - The sunset?
    - It's really something.

339
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,798
Come on out on the porch
and look at it with me.

340
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,234
           Charles--

341
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,873
Would you look
at that sky, Nettie?

342
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,776
What colors, huh?

343
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,312
Makes you feel like, well,
like there's something

344
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,147
important going on
up there, doesn't it?

345
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,151
                Yes.

346
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,154
A man should take the time
to appreciate things like this.

347
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,456
Before it's too late.

348
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,858
            What do you mean,
            too late?

349
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,227
          Oh, nothing.

350
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:53,264
      But we just never know
      what might be around
      the corner for us

351
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,566
      in this great scheme
      of life.

352
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,436
            Charles...

353
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,238
       let me smell your breath.

354
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,708
Come on, Nettie.
You know me better than that.

355
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,877
Well, let's go in.
I'm hungry.

356
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,515
We better get a man to fix
that screen door tomorrow.

357
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,316
              You've been saying
              that for months.

358
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,585
    But this time I mean it.
    No more putting it off.

359
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,555
         In fact, I'm going
         to have the whole place
         fixed up for you.

360
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,190
I'll go and get washed up.

361
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,793
     Just a minute, Rupert.

362
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,730
       I don't think
       we've said grace yet.

363
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,735
          Grace? You, Daddy?

364
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,537
        Well, of course.

365
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,341
     Dear God, thank you
     for this food and all.

366
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,410
       Take care of us
       in the days ahead.

367
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,245
        And speaking of
        the days ahead,

368
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,613
       if you could
       see your way clear

369
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,184
    to stretching them
    out a little, I'd sure--

370
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,920
    We'd sure appreciate it.

371
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,354
             Amen.

372
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,656
                 Amen.

373
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:55,560
     Well, now, what
     did you boys do today?

374
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,962
            We didn't
            do anything. Honest.

375
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,464
    Well, I wasn't accusing you.
    I was just interested,
    that's all.

376
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,633
It was really Jigs' fault
that the paste--

377
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,902
      Everything was just fine.
      Today, just fine.

378
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,571
        Eat your
        vegetables, Rupert.

379
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,774
    How would you all like
    to go to the movies tonight?

380
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,977
      The whole family?
      How does that sound?

381
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,845
               Tonight?

382
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,515
    I don't know what's playing,
    but I know it's bank night,

383
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,483
       so maybe we can
       pick up a little money.

384
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,620
            Oh, well, maybe
            tomorrow night, huh?

385
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:27,558
    Well, I might not be able
    to make it tomorrow night.

386
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,861
             Oh, well, I sort of
             have a date with
             Derwood tonight.

387
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,631
        - Oh.
        - And Ray, also.

388
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,533
         You have a date
         with two boys?

389
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,301
   You'll never get a husband
   that way, Leonora.

390
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,536
            Who said I was
            looking for one?

391
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,637
        [car horn honks]

392
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,905
              Oh, that must
              be Derwood.

393
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,840
          Sorry, Daddy.
          Maybe some other time.

394
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,841
    Well, you haven't
    finished your dinner.

395
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,343
I'll be late.

            [honks]

397
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:54,685
I know Derwood, but who's
the other fellow she mentioned?

398
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,920
                 Oh, Ray.
                 Ferris.

399
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,255
        Who's Ray Ferris?

400
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,857

401

  [honks]

402
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,463
        That'll give you an idea
        of who he is.

403
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,968
       - You ready to go?
       - Uh...

404
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,372
             Great.

405
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,024
         See you later, Derwood.

406

     [engine doesn't start]

407
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,466
    Well, that doesn't mean
    the rest of us

408
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,734
     can't go, right boys?

409
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,370
                   Um...

410
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,905
               to the movies,
               did you say, Pop?

411
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,540
           Weren't you
           listening, Willie?

412
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,310
      Boy: Willie, Rupert,
      come on, let's go!

413
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,345
              Go?
              Go where?

414
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,980
           Oh, no place, really.

415
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,815
            We sort of promised
            Frankie Gosset

416
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,317
                 that we'd go
                 along with him.

417
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,619
       You're going
       no place with Frankie?

418
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,920
          Frankie:
          Hurry up, guys!

419
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,689
        Dad's waiting to take
        us to the movies!

420
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,791
Okay, Frankie.
We'll be right there.

421
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:11,062
   You're--
   You're going to the movies
   with Frankie's dad?

422
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,930
Yeah, he takes us
lots of places.

423
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,099
He's a keen guy.

424
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,735
             Excuse us.
             See you later, Pop.

425
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,836
                Yeah.

426
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,574
       Well, Nettie, old girl,
       I guess it looks like

427
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,609
       it's down to
       just the two of us, huh?

428
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,613
            Dear, maybe
            you could still get

429
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,482
            to part of
            your lodge meeting.

430
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,417
      You mean you have
      some place to go, too?

431
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,453
                Only to Clara's.

432
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,455
         Well, can't you
         go to your sister's
         some other night?

433
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:41,092
            Uh, not really.
            On Thursday nights,
            I'm always a fourth.

434
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,094
           A fourth what?

435
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,562
        A fourth.
        At bridge.

436
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,797
 - Oh.
 - Just leave everything, dear.

437
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,499
        I'll do the dishes
        as soon as I get home.

438
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,700
        I'm running a little
        behind schedule.

439
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,768
                Bye-bye.

440
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,910
            [whines]

441
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,479
                    Hello, Jigs.

442
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,849
        Well, we have a few
        leftovers for you.

443
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,388
           By the way,
           are you busy tonight?

444
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,492
The first thing
I want you to do, Pete,

445
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,060
is fix that
back screen door.

446
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,396
I want the whole place
put in top shape.

447
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,965
You think you can
handle that?

448
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,534
               More than likely.

449
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,469
And I may want
the house painted.

450
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:28,806
Can you paint a house?

451
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:29,874
                     What color?

452
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,809
        What difference
        does that make?

453
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,944
          Could make a lot.

454
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,781
       Say I painted it orange,
       and you wanted it purple.

455
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,949
    I want it the way it is.

456
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,518
           Then why paint it?

457
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,586
       I mean, I want it
       the color it is.

458
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,656
          Well, it's your house.

459
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,192
This is wild.
After all these years,

460
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,661
he's actually
fixing the place up.

461
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:54,465
What's come over Daddy, Mom?

462
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,167
               I wish I knew.

463
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:00,671
    Oh, Pete, it seems to me
    I've heard some rumors.

464
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,173
       Tell me,
       are you a drinker?

465
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:05,009
            Thanks, but not now.
            It's too early.

466
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,911
   I don't want to catch you
   drinking on the job.

467
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,579
             Oh, you won't.

468
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,848
        If I feel like drinking,
        I stop working.

469
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,889
             All this to catch
             a poor little fish.

470
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,459
                Zowie.

471
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,563
        Whoops.
        Sorry, Charley.

472
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,798
    So, it's you,
    the pipe filcher.

473
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,467
    Tell me,
    what did you find out?

474
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,768
    What are they
    going to do with me?

475
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,136
                   I don't know.

476
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,604
             Boy, they're sure
             making better reels

477
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,605
            than back in my day.

478
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,973
        You don't know?

479
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,741
    What kind of an outfit
    are they running up there?

480
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,109
            Right now,
            a confused one, kid.

481
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,678
    Why? What's the jam-up?

482
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,812
            They don't
            tell me anything,

483
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,547
       but near as I can figure,

484
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,049
         someone up there thinks
         you're worth salvaging.

485
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,050
             Yeah?

486
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,651
          Why, I don't know.

487
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,986
        But at least that's why
        you're still alive.

488
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,788
Then I do have
a chance for more time?

489
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,190
     I wouldn't bank on it, kid.
     Not with your record.

490
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,593
Look, if you're
really my angel, help me.

491
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,661
I mean, tell me what I can
do to improve my chances.

492
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,697
        That's for you to learn,
        but whatever you do,

493
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,532
                I'd sure do it
                in a hurry.

494
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,067
              Would I have time
              to take Nettie

495
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,902
            and the kids
            to the World's Fair?

496
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,137
Oh, come on.
You know you don't
really intend to do that.

497
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,272
                   How do you
                   know I don't?

498
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,874
        I suppose
        the minute I'm gone,

499
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,041
       you're gonna march
       right over to the bank

500
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,010
        and draw out money
        for the trip.

501
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,980
            Well, I can't
            very well leave
            the store right now.

502
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,282
Oh, of course not.
I'll be seeing you.

503
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,783
                Now, wait
                a minute, angel.

504
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,553
    Look, I feel kind of silly
    calling you "angel".

505
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,888
               What's your name?

506
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,556
 Oh, I wouldn't remember that.

507
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,024
          You don't remember
          your own name?

508
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,894
    No, you see,
    those earthly things
    sort of fade away.

509
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,630
    Oh, sometimes you get
    flashes of the old life.

                 are you anyway?

513
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:41,038
    Well, maybe this
    will give you some idea.

00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,009
I'm sorry about that.

561
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,411
          You knew this was
          going to happen.

562
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,846
      Charley, I am going
      to try and get

563
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,049
    the bank open again
    just as soon as I can.

564
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,350
           Well, how soon?

565
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,718
Well, I don't know.

566
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,253
It'll be a few weeks
or months.

567
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,822
        A month?
        I can't wait a month.

568
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,725
You'll have to,
just like everybody else.

569
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,193
           But, Ernie,
           you don't understand.

570
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,897
           I-- I may not be
           around here too long.

571
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,199
From the sound
of that crowd out there,

572
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,735
I may not be around
too long, either.

573
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,171
                Ernie--

574
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,827
Watch out
for the string, Pop.

575
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,829
      What are you trying to do,
      set a booby trap for me?

576
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,098
   No, we're making
   a telephone with Frankie.

577
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,467
    - Oh.
    - His pop showed us how.

578
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,001
            Oh, he did, huh?

579
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,003
Yeah, he teaches us
lots of things.

580
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,839
                    Oh.

581
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,141
        I wish you fellas
        would keep your bicycles
        out of the driveway.

582
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,149
    Yoo-hoo, Charles!
    Don't walk under the ladder.

583
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,817
        You might have bad luck.

584
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,520
          I might?
          That's a hot one.

585
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,457
                 Boy.

586
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,825
        Nettie:
        Oh, did you notice?

587
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,393
        Pete started painting
        the house today.

588
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,195
Looks more like
he's painting the windows.

589
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,930
I guess I'm going
to have to let him go.

590
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,465
              Oh, no, no.
              You can't do that.

591
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,968
Nettie, didn't you hear about
the bank closing today?

592
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,337
        Well, that's exactly why
        you can't let him go.

593
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,938
What kind of logic is that?

594
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,142
          Well, I had to loan
          poor Pete $100.

595
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,376
        You what?

596
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,044
              Well, he needed it
              because he said

597
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,479
            his cash was all
            tied up at the bank.

598
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,114
    His cash?
    I'll bet he's never

599
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,816
    had a bank account
    in his life.

600
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,484
              Well, anyhow,
              the only way

601
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,253
          he can pay it back
          is to work it off.

602
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,089
Nettie, when you
have to start handling
your own finances--

603
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,791
          No, I don't intend to.

604
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,259
       Well, you may have to.

605
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,127
          Sooner than you think.

606
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,363
Testing.
Good evening.

607
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,465
            I'll do the talking.
            You just hold it.

608
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,802
            Testing.
            Good evening, Mister
            and Missus America,

609
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,203
               and all
               the ships at sea.

610
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,872
            Let's go to press.
            Frankie, could
            you hear me?

611
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,141
        Frankie:
        No! Talk louder!

612
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,810
                        What?

613
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,178
  When I'm ready for the song,

614
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,113
   I'll signal you like this.

615
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,448
                 You're supposed
                 to hold it.

616
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,884
  And don't forget the money.

617
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,353
                Okay, Frankie,
                we won't forget.

618
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:27,090
              Hey, listen,
              when Pop comes in,
              you gotta ask him.

619
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,392
Why don't you ask him?

620
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,927
         Because you're littler.

621
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,028
              All right, Willie,

622
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,329
                what did you
                want to ask me?

623
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,432
        Oh, uh, we need
        two bucks, Papa.

624
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,534
              Two bucks?

625
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,369
           When I was your age,
           I had to work
           a week for that.

626
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,871
        What do you
        want it for?

627
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:44,074
            Uh...
            It's for a surprise.

628
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:47,344
     Oh. I'm glad you brought up
     the subject of money,

629
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,947
        because it's something
        I've been wanting
        to talk to you about.

630
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,516
                  Come over here
                  and sit down,
                  will you?

631
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:56,186
    Pop, we gotta practice
    a song that we're gonna
    sing on a telephone.

632
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,355
Well, that
will wait, Willie.
Just sit down.

633
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,358
You know, boys, I'm--

634
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,493
Well, I'm not always
going to be around for you

635
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,062
to run to whenever
you need money.

636
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:07,598
So I think you should
start earning your own,

637
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,166
learning the value
of a dollar.

638
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,467
        [doorbell rings]

639
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,502
Now, don't go away.
I'm not through.

640
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,604
            [rings]

641
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,543
                 Mr. Appleby?

642
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,345
       - Yes?
       - I'm Ray Ferris.

643
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,546
Oh, you're--

644
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,014
                  Is Leonora in?

645
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,616
No, I'm afraid not.
She's, uh--

646
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,317
Well, she's gone out
with Derwood.

647
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,654
      Oh. Where'd they go,
      that miniature golf place?

648
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,623
Well, it's pretty hard
to keep track

649
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,324
of where young people
go these days.

650
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,326
                Yeah.
                Well, thanks.

651
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,896
Ray?
I think you should know,

652
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,999
Leonora's going steady
with a substantial young man,

653
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,068
and I think we should
leave it that way.

654
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,305
        I can't say as Leonora
        gave me that impression.

655
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,140
    - Well, she wouldn't.
    - In fact, she told me--

656
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,241
    Do you have a job?

657
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,543
            Well, no, sir.
            Not at the moment.

658
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,645
     Well, there, you see?

659
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,446
        Things are kind of tough
        right now,

660
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,582
         but I'm willing to work
         at anything I can get.

661
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,417
Uh-huh. Well, good luck
at it, Ray.

662
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,585
It's been
nice knowing you.

663
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,655
                    Mr. Appleby?

664
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,490
                 I don't
                 give up easily.

665
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,938
Now, let's see.

666
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,606
We were talking about
getting jobs, weren't we?

667
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,041
                   Yes, sir.
                   Here, Pop.

668
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,075
What's this?

669
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,311
                   It's for you.

670
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:30,614
      "To our Dad,
      Happy Father's Day."

671
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,684
    Well, that's right.
    Sunday is Father's Day,
    isn't it?

672
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,119
           We just thought we'd
           give it to you today.

673
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,587
  You made this yourself, huh?

674
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,090
                Yeah, we made it
                at school.

675
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:43,260
       Thanks, boys.
       Thanks very much.

676
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,562
         Hey, kids.
         You guys get ready.

677
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,264
       I'll give you
       the signal when to start.

678
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,032
               Okay, Frankie.

679
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,168
       Pop, we promise
       that we'll look for jobs,

680
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,602
         but right now, we gotta
         practice this song.

681
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,537
                Come on, Rupert.

682
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,976
          He's ready.

683
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:04,348
 ¶ Happy Father's Day to you ¶

684
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,017
 ¶ Happy Father's Day to you ¶

685
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,988
     ¶ Happy Father's Day,
     Mr. Gosset ¶

686
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,691
 ¶ Happy Father's Day to you ¶

687
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,394
Oh, about that money, Pop.

688
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,596
              Oh, yeah.

689
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,598
           I guess I can
           see my way clear to--

690
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,667
We're chipping in
with Frankie for his dad.

691
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,569
Because he's been
so nice to us.

692
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,138
            Uh-huh.
            Well...

693
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,207
        - Thanks, Pop.
        - Yeah, thanks.

694
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,287
             Happy Father's Day,
             Mr. Gosset.

695
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:59,269
        [rooster crows]

696
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,241
               Leonora, I really
               ought to go home.

697
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,543
   You can't go until
   I put something
   on your poor eye.

698
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,412
                  It'll be okay.

699
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,248
That big bully Derwood.
I never knew he had
a temper like that.

700
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,549
           Let's not talk
           about him, all right?

701
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,151
I never want
to see him again.

702
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,252
               Ray:
               Shh.

703
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,254
               Just don't talk.

704
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,488
       [Charley mumbles]

705
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,791
    [gasps]
    It's Daddy!
    You better go.

706
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,059
               Wait, wait, wait.

707
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,126
                   Ray?

708
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,230
What are you doing here?

709
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,166
            I just brought
            Leonora home.

710
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,436
What time is it?
It's 5 o'clock
in the morning.

711
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,438
          - 5 o'clock?
          - 5 o'clock.

712
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,306
   How did you
   get the shiner?

713
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,576
        Oh, Derwood and I just
        had a little scuffle.

714
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,677
    That took all night?

715
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,145
              Oh, no, no, no.

716
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,280
              Leonora and I just
              stopped off

717
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:44,581
            at this little place
            on the way home.

718
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,716
       What little place?

719
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,552
                Sadie's Place.

720
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,254
  Sadie's? That's a roadhouse.
  A bootleg joint.

721
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,657
            Well, it's the only
            place in town
            where you can dance.

722
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,125
      Ray, if that's
      the kind of a place

723
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,626
      you're going
      to take my daughter,

724
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,495
    I don't want you going out
    with her anymore.

725
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,631
         Mr. Appleby, we weren't
         doing anything wrong.

726
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,600
              We just enjoy
              being together.

727
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,103
        Well, don't you remember
        when you were young,

728
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,871
            how important
            it was to, well,

729
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,339
            to have someone
            care for you,

730
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,274
            and to be with them?

731
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,344
  You think that's only
  important to the young, huh?

732
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,646
                Well...

733
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,748
            Maybe when people
            get older, they just

734
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,584
            don't think about
            such things.

735
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,389
        I guess I better go now.

736
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:33,497
           Mr. Appleby,
           I love your daughter.

737
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,240
Nettie:
Charles, aren't you
ever coming to bed?

738
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,442
            I'll be up
            in a minute, Nettie.

739
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,835
          Good morning, Charlie.

740
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,172
     Roy.
     Now where did you go?

741
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,842
[whistling]

742
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,777
              What are you doing
              in there, Roy?

743
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,345
Taking a bath.

744
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,681
First tub I ever saw
with a faucet way up there.

745
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,650
                That's a shower.
                You just stand
                in front of it,

746
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,218
           let it squirt on you.

747
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,187
        Well, what did they
        decide up about me, Roy?

748
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,722
They're still arguing.
A couple of 'em
are on the fence,

749
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,891
but most of them think
you're getting nowhere fast.

750
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,562
        Well, they can
        say that again.

751
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,765
     The more I try,
     the worse I mess things up.

752
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,934
        My wife suspects
        everything I do,

753
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,770
          my daughter's
          ruining her chances
          for a good marriage,

754
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,306
        and the boys
        have thrown me over
        for a substitute father.

755
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,874
    Yeah, it's tough.

756
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,210
    I wish to heck
    you could get more time.

757
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,312
I'd like to see you
win this thing, kid.

758
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,948
            You would?
            I didn't know
            you were on my side.

759
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,651
I wasn't at first,
with your record and all,

760
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,788
but I don't know,
I guess I always was
for the underdog,

761
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,258
and right now I'd say
you're the underest dog I know.

762
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,626
              Yeah.
              Then you'll really
              get in there

763
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,860
               and pitch for me,
               huh, Roy?

764
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,563
                 I need help
                 from somewhere.

765
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,632
[knocking]
Charles?

766
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,300
                Yes, Nettie?

767
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,302
   Is someone
   in there with you?

768
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,571
       What kind of a ridiculous
       question is that, Nettie?

769
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,975
It sounded like you were
talking to somebody.

770
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:26,610
                     It did?

771
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:29,279
          I guess I must've been
          talking to myself.

772
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,513
    Oh?

773
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,616
When did you
start doing that?

774
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,919
          Uh, Nettie,
          would you mind
          if I finished shaving?

775
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,520
              I've got to get
              to work, you know.

776
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,756
Oh, yes. Yes, dear.
Of course.

777
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,413
            Charles.

778
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:04,447
                       What?

779
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,383
        Charles, Charles.

780
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:09,519
        Will you ever learn
        to pick up your things?

781
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:13,290
It seems to me
I've just been picking up
after you all my life.

782
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,701
              You kids
              want to work, huh?

783
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,569
               Well, first thing
               I want you to do

784
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,904
               is clear all this
               junk out of here.

785
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,540
               Just stack it off
               to the sides.

786
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,609
             I want room
             so I can move cars
             in and out of here.

787
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,544
                   You got that?

788
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,013
               Move all this?

789
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,016
      You said you wanted a job.
      Take it or leave it.

790
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,084
         Pays ten cents an hour.

791
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,919
                  We'll take it.

792
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,089
                 Okay.
                 I'll keep track
                 of your time.

793
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,695
            Let's have an honest
            day's work now, huh?

794
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,465
How are we supposed to learn
the value of a dollar

795
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:58,468
if we only make ten cents?

796
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,704
                  Work overtime,
                  I guess.

797
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,972
              Come on, we better
              get this started.

798
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,723
                  Rupe, grab
                  the other end.

799
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,060
                One, two, three.

800
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,066
                Boy, I'm pooped.

801
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,770
            Let's rest up
            a few minutes, okay?

802
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:34,604
         Somewhere in the shade.

803
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,678
                  Come on, Rupe.
                  The car.

804
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,656
          [both sigh]

805
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:56,793
    How much money do you
    think we earned by now?

806
00:39:56,795 --> 00:40:00,897
                    Ah, at least
                    20 cents.

807
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,399
    [groans]

808
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,536
             I wonder if this
             clunker still runs.

809
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,908
Hey, look what I found.

810
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,910
                    Huh.

811
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,446
Hey, I wonder if Felix
will let me have this.

812
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:17,781
              Don't ask him now.

813
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,616
            He'll see that
            we're not working.

814
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:22,452
             Okay, okay,
             keep your shirt on,
             will you, Sadie?

815
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,555
      Look, I told you.
      Bugs should be there
      any minute with the stuff.

816
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,791
      [car engine starts]

817
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,728
              Say, look,
              I gotta go, Sadie.

818
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,062
                 Yeah, business.

819
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,198
       Hey!
       Hey, cut that out,
       you kids!

820
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,069
             Stop playing around
             with the car!

821
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,573
               I'm planning on
               selling this one.

822
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,875
               I'm sorry.
               I didn't think
               it would start.

823
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:46,876
                           Yeah.

824
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,545
Can I please
have this, sir?

825
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:51,014
       Yeah, who cares?
       Just leave the car alone.

826
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,916
           And what are you
           doing in here anyway?

827
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,584
  You're supposed to be working.
  Now get out and get to work.

828
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,831
                 Hey, hey, hey!
                 Hey, Bugs, what
                 are you doing?

829
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,066
I'm getting rid of
this load of booze,
that's what I'm doing.

830
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,768
            Not here, you idiot.

831
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,903
The cops have been tailing me.
They got the truck spotted.

832
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,238
     Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
     But first,

833
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,207
       deliver this load
       to Sadie's Place.

834
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:19,609
    They've been calling
    for it every two minutes.

835
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,743
        You deliver it.

836
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,582
        Oh, sure. Smart.

837
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,518
        If I get caught,
        you lose your front
        in this town.

838
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,786
           [chuckles]

839
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,622
    If I get caught,
    the big boss will kill me.

840
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,725
           Okay, okay.
           Don't let's panic.

841
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,827
   Just call Sadie
   on the phone and tell her.

842
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,562
         Shut up, shut up.
         I'm thinking.

843
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,099
      I got it.

844
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,534
           What?

845
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:45,969
                They're gonna
                deliver it.

846
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,003
      Who?

847
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,576
              Them? Come on,
              they're just kids.

848
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,714
    Hey, boys.
    Come here!

849
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,052
             Hey, look, Felix,
             I don't understand.
             I mean--

850
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,954
  Nobody would suspect
  a couple of kids

851
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,189
  of running a load
  of hooch, right?

852
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,290
                 No, but still--

853
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,125
Do me a favor.
Relax.

854
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:10,994
Let me handle this.

855
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,163
We were working.
Honest!

856
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,665
          Yeah, yeah.

857
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,700
         Tell me, how good
         can you drive a car?

858
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,969
               Pretty good.
               My pal's father

859
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,304
           let me drive with him
           a few times.

860
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,873
Would you like to make
a little extra money?

861
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,742
                  Doing what?

862
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:29,045
Delivering a couple cases
of cooking oil for Bugs.

863
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,815
This is Bugs.
Poor fellow's truck
broke down here.

864
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,217
              Yeah, but we don't
              have a car.

865
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,085
I'll tell you what.

866
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,788
You can use that car
that you were playing
around in back there.

867
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,156
         Yeah? Where do you want
         the stuff delivered?

868
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,958
Sadie's Place.
You know where that is?

869
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,992
            - Sure.
            - Good.

870
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,260
You bring the car up here,

871
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,261
and we'll load it for you.

872
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,629
                        Okay.

873
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,698
                 Shorty. Listen.

874
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,233
               This dame Sadie's
               gonna give you

875
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,935
               an envelope with
               some money in it.

876
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,236
For the cooking oil.

877
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,238
             Yeah. Now, when you
             get this envelope,

878
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,907
               you bring it
               right back to me.
               You got that?

879
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,909
          - Yes, sir.
          - Okay.

883

                That darn clutch
                is so far away.

884
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,728
                      All right.

             You've got a better
             angle on it.

894
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,619
          Not now,
          I'm settling for this.

             Stick your arm out.

         Well, I never!

902

                        Hello.

                  Are you Sadie?

905

Run along, kid.
We're busy.

906
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,901
            Wait, don't you want
            your cooking oil?

   You?

             We're delivering it
             for Mr. Bugs.

909

                  we gonna do?

A half an hour ago?

919
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,237
I knew we never should've
trusted those kids
with all that loot.

920
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,841
I knew it.
If I go back to Chicago
and tell the big boss

           Where's the envelope?

926

        Oh, yeah.

927
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,328
       Gee, I hope
       I didn't lose it.

Like, maybe cops?

933
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,942
Why would cops follow us?

934

   Well, uh,
   you're underage.

    that extra money, Mr. Felix?

                 No, no,
                 we got no more.

943
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:08,998
Possibly.
Very possibly, boys.

        is Felix having
        you do anyway?

            Whatever it is,
            it's dirty work.

00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,818

            and wash,

956

            That's yours, honey.
            You earned it.

        to have it.

        That's what
        we're earning it for.

              For heaven's sake.

963
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:55,178
                   Can you
                   imagine that?

964
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,981
           Isn't that something?

965
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,851
        Too bad we're not going.

966
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,353
I was hoping I could
take you and the boys.

967
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,256
     I still might make it
     if I can get a good
     price for the store,

968
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:10,293
     and if something else
     works out.

969
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,961
            What did you say?

970
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,196
      I've put the store
      up for sale, Nettie.

971
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,564
             You what?

972
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:17,099
    I'm selling the store.
    Ed Jones is handling it.

973
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:20,870
            How would we live?
            What would we do?

974
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:23,539
    Now, Nettie, believe me.
    This is something that
    has to be done.

975
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,274
I'm doing this
for your own good.

976
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:29,011
            Cutting off our
            means of livelihood
            is for my own good?

977
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,381
        Charles, you'd better
        go see the doctor, dear.

978
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,618
Nettie, I do not need
to see the doctor.

979
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,354
        Well, getting notions,
        these peculiar notions--

980
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,488
     I'm sorry I told you.

981
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,990
                  How would you
                  plan for our--

982
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,491
            Wait, come back.
            Where are you going?

983
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:43,559
I'm going to bed.

984
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,162
                    Oh.

985
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,064
                My goodness.

986
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,115
      Well, Roy, why don't
      you help me?

987
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,453
         How about it, Roy?
         Can you hear me?

988
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,361
               Are you up there?

989
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,996
               Can you hear me?

990
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:21,297
Who are you
looking for out there?

991
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,666
                Huh? Oh, I was
                looking for you?

992
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:26,402
          Roy, I want to know
          right now what's going
          to happen to me.

993
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,471
I wouldn't push my luck
if I were you, kid.

994
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,306
          But I just can't stand
          this not knowing.

995
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,275
Now, now,
take it easy, Charley.

996
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,176
I want to wind this up
as much as you do,

997
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,379
because I should be moving on
to other assignments.

998
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:37,980
              I thought you were
              going to help me.

999
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:40,249
I am. I put in a pretty good
pitch for you today.

1000
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,317
                Well, did it
                do any good?

1001
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:42,685
I don't know.

1002
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,553
    Oh, fine.

1003
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,223
        But I can tell you this.
        I think they're close
        to a decision.

1004
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,491
             They are?

1005
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,326
        Boy, they're sure
        making these springier

1006
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,694
        than when I was a kid.

1007
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:53,629
Roy, will you stop that?

1008
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,564
All right, so they're
close to a decision.
How close?

1009
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,933
            I don't know.

1010
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,301
        Well, what do you
        think it'll be?

1011
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:00,303
             I don't know.

1012
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,971
   That's all I get from you
   is "I don't know."

1013
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:04,173
                   This thing
                   is driving me
                   batty, Roy.

1014
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,108
          Roy, again.

1015
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,577
            How can I make any
            plans if I'm sitting
            on a trap door

1016
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,079
              that's gonna
              spring any minute?

1017
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:11,614
        Now, I want you to go
        up there and tell them--

1018
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,616
    Charles.

1019
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,321
                   Relax, kid,
                   she can't see
                   or hear me.

1020
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,061
    Charles, dear,

1021
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,163
would you like for me
to get you some hot milk?

1022
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,297
                    Hot milk?

1023
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,333
    It might make you
    sleep better.

1024
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,134
             Oh, no.
             No, thanks, Nettie.

1025
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,703
                 I'm fine.

1026
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:35,471
  I just thought if--

1027
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,106
                  Nettie, what
                  are you doing?

1028
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,708
    - I'm getting undressed.
    - Well, don't do that.

1029
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,177
Charles,
I've had a hard day.

1030
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,578
Charles, I'm going to bed.

1031
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,013
           Don't get undressed
           in here in front of--

1032
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,181
            You never know
            who's looking.

1033
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,482
                  What are you
                  talking about?

1034
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,683
Why don't you get
undressed in the closet?

1035
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,486
               In the closet?
               I never, Charles.

1036
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,088
                   Charles.

1037
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,990
                  Charles,
                  that's enough.

1038
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,726
            That does it.
            Tomorrow, you're
            going to the doctor.

1039
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:59,061
    Nettie, there's nothing
    wrong with me.

1040
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,296
           - Oh, no?
           - No.

1041
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:03,632
              Then tell me,
              who is Roy?

1042
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,269
            Roy?

1043
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,072
   Now, look, I don't
   expect you to believe this,

1044
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:13,209
        but Roy is an--
        An angel.

1045
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,611
               An angel?

1046
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,513
That's right.

1047
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,415
              Oh, Charles.
              Really.

1048
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,017
    It's true, Nettie.
    I swear it.

1049
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,151
    His name is Roy Zerney.

1050
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,387
                An angel?

1051
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,522
            Named Roy Zerney.

1052
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,124
That's right.

1053
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,592
Now, you can't see him,

1054
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,193
but he's right over there
on the bed, watching.

1055
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,662
Oh, he's done it again.
Roy?

1056
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,599
            Roy, where did
            you go now?

1057
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,801
               Roy, do something
               to prove to her

1058
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:41,404
               that you're here,
               will you? Roy?

1059
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,172
          Are you under the bed?

1060
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,640
                 Roy?

1061
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,275
                Oh.

1062
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:49,712
         Roy? Roy, will you give
         a sign or something?

1063
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,313
               He was right here
               in this room.

1064
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,582
             I swear it, Nettie.
             Roy?

1065
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,684
            Don't do this to me!

1066
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,222
  I don't know why I went
  through all this rigmarole.

1067
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,390
 There's nothing wrong with me.

1068
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,426
            Well, you seem to
            check out all right.

1069
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,094
      The only reason
      I came in to see you

1070
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,229
      is so you could
      convince Nettie I'm okay.

1071
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,432
           Then why do you
           want to upset her

1072
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:12,768
          with all this
          nonsense about angels?

1073
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,304
        Oh, she told you
        about that, huh?

1074
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,606
       Doc, I'm going
       to level with you.

1075
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,375
     There really is an angel.

1076
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,676
               Named Roy Zerney.

1077
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,344
         It's all true.
         I swear it.

1078
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:26,148
    Come on, now, Charley.
    What are you trying to pull?

1079
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,583
       I'm not trying
       to pull anything.

1080
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,654
        You see, doc,
        my number's up,
        and this angel--

1081
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,389
  Well, you wouldn't understand.

1082
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,458
             Sure, I would.

1083
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,094
         Tell me
         all about him, Charley.

1084
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,196
       Nah, forget it.
       You're all alike.

1085
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,531
     If I could just
     prove to somebody
     I'm telling the truth.

1086
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,167
           Where do you
           see this angel?

1087
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:46,569
           Anywhere.

1088
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,370
   He popped up in my shower
   the other morning.

1089
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,339
     He could be right here
     in this office.

1090
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,175
     Roy, where are you
     when I need you?

1091
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,377
       Charley, sit down.
       I'm not through with you.

1092
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,113
    No, you've got nothing
    that can help me, doc.

1093
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:58,781
                Please, Charley.

1094
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:03,285
        Look, there's
        a very good psychiatrist
        right down the hall.

1095
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,688
Fine.
Give him my regards.

1096
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,740
            Zerney.

1097
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,409
        Ed? Doc Sprague.

1098
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:31,780
    Listen, I understand Charley
    asked you to sell his store.

1099
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,783
        Don't do it, Ed.

1100
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:38,454
        Well, stall him.
        He's a--

1101
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,756
      He's a very sick man.

1102
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,791
            Six cases
            go to Sadie's Place,

1103
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,794
             and the rest goes
             to the Red Rooster.
             You got that?

1104
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:48,297
            - Sure.
            - Good.

1105
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,232
            How come they use
            so much cooking oil?

1106
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:55,538
          Well, uh, it's the new
          high grade thin oil.

1107
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,939
               Yeah, they
               use it up faster.

1108
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:58,874
                 You guys better
                 get going.

1109
00:52:58,876 --> 00:52:59,909
        Oh, yeah. Sure.

1110
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:11,620
And don't forget
to bring back the envelopes!

1111
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,792
I don't like this, Felix.

1112
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,227
And I'll tell you
somebody else

1113
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:20,496
who don't like it.
The big boss.

1114
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,499
           You tell the big boss
           I'm running this end
           of the operation, eh?

1115
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,801
But not for long,

1116
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,504
unless you find some way
to cool the local cops.

1117
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:32,575
You know, he's talking
about sending Frankie Zuto
in here to take over.

1118
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:35,678
      Frankie Zuto?
      I don't want that gangster
      coming in here.

1119
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,547
Maybe you don't have
a whole lot to say about it.

1120
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,686
           [humming]

1121
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,321
          Oh.

1122
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,290
    [chuckles]

1123
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,264
Rupe:
Willie, watch out!
Turn, turn!

1124
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,499
           [screams]

1125
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,607
Hello, Nettie.

1126
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:05,874
            Where have you been?

1127
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,676
I've been talking
to Ed Jones.

1128
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,812
Now all of a sudden,
for some idiotic reason,

1129
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,013
he thinks he can't
sell the store.

1130
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:14,617
                 Dear, I talked
                 to Dr. Sprague,

1131
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,253
          and he thinks
          you really ought to
          see that psychiatrist.

1132
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,288
Now, Nettie, let's not
get into that again.

1133
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,490
               Oh, that Leonora.

1134
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:22,925
        I told her to take this,

1135
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,660
           especially if she's
           going to be out late.

1136
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:25,728
    Where did she go?

1137
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,529
            Well, I believe Ray

1138
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,266
            said something
            about dancing.

1139
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,268
       Dancing? With Ray?

1140
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,436
       That can
       mean only one thing.

1141
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,272
       He's taken her
       to Sadie's Place.

1142
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:39,308
    I told that lounge lizard
    not to take her there again.

1143
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,776
                  Charles, where
                  are you going?

1144
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,911
   I'm going to bring
   my daughter home.

1145
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,959
                 Follow me.

1146
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:02,698
    Mr. Appleby? Hi.

1147
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,067
          Oh, hello, Suzie.
          Have you seen Leonora?

1148
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,969
     Well, not tonight. No.

1149
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,071
                         Thanks.

1150
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:14,743
                What'll you
                have to drink?

1151
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,545
Oh, nothing, thank you.

1152
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:19,548
            Well, you have to
            pay for it anyway.
            We have a minimum.

1153
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:23,619
            What would you like?
            The lemonade
            or the iced tea?

1154
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,954
   Oh, lemonade will be fine.

1155
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:30,759
    Look, the only reason
    I'm here is to try
    to find a certain girl.

1156
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:35,364
              Got you, sport.
              [laughs]

1157
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,715
                  Hi.

1158
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,717
            I understand
            you're looking for
            a little company.

1159
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,754
        No.
        I think you have
        the wrong idea.

1160
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,656
                I don't care.
                I'm no bargain.

1161
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,625
    I just happen to be here
    looking for my daughter.

1162
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,060
            Oh, does she
            work here, too?

1163
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,495
   No, she doesn't work here.

1164
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,897
     You see, she has this
     boyfriend--

1165
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,733
            Oh, she's lucky.

1166
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:22,611
   [coughs]
   What do they put in there?

1167
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:25,514
              Yeah, it is pretty
              cheap booze.

1168
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,416
              You know, they got
              a couple of kids

1169
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,684
              that are
              delivering it now?

1170
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,452
            I just don't know
            what kind of parents

1171
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,154
         that would allow kids
         to do things like that.

1172
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,156
        [whistle blows]

1173
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,024
       Run! It's a raid!

1174
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:38,527
          Let's get out of here!

1175
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:42,898
           [shouting]

1176
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,409
Hey, that's Pop.

1177
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,511
Willie, look.
Pop's on the front page.

1178
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,813
                Oh, my gosh.
                It is Pop.

1179
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,648
                Let me see this.

1180
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,617
                 What's he doing
                 with the cops?

1181
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,621
           Sadie's place,
           raided for selling...
           bootleg whiskey?

1182
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:08,424
No wonder they could
afford all that
cooking oil.

1183
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:11,727
              "After staking out
              the roadhouse for
              two nights,

1184
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:14,563
           the officers
           crashed the doors
           and rounded up the"--

1185
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:15,831
All right,
that's enough of that.

1186
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,199
    Pop is in the hoosegow.

1187
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,701
          Rupert, where do you
          pick up such language?

1188
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:20,903
Didn't you read
where it says--

1189
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,539
          All right, now listen.

1190
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,607
            Your father is--

1191
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,745
          Well, he's not exactly
          himself right now.

1192
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:33,015
       When he comes down,
       the less said the better.

1193
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,083
                     Understand?

1194
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:37,686
                Who's that girl?

1195
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,855
    Uh, sit down, boys.
    I'll get your breakfast.

1196
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,896
   And don't say anything
   to make him feel worse than--

1197
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:48,897
[door closes]

1198
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,098
            Shh-shh.

1199
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,902
Good morning.

1200
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,471
      - Good morning, Pop.
      - Good morning, Pop.

1201
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,239
            Sure was a nice
            picture of you, Pop.

1202
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,942
Picture?
What picture?

1203
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,980
                Girl's kind of
                pretty, too.
                Who is she, Pop?

1204
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:09,685
         Willie, you boys
         run up and tell Leonora
         that breakfast is on.

1205
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:10,853
                   Doesn't take
                   two of us to
                   do that, Mom.

1206
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:13,989
            I said go.
            Now go on. Go. Go.

1207
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,093
What's it like
in the clink, Pop?

1208
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:19,728
            Rupert!

1209
00:58:21,232 --> 00:58:24,566
Clara has already
called about it.

1210
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:26,602
               Naturally.

1211
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:29,505
Too bad you have to
spread it all over
the front page.

1212
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,140
        Nettie, I don't
        print the newspapers.

1213
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:36,144
               By the way,
               who is that girl?

1214
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,713
I don't know who she is.

1215
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:38,981
            Is that the angel

1216
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:42,184
        you've been hobnobbing
        around with?

1217
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,153
      Nettie, I explained
      the whole thing
      to you last night.

1218
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,788
Now, if you want to make
something different out of it.

1219
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,991
             Mom, Pop.
             She's not upstairs.

1220
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,959
          I found this
          on her bed.

1221
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,128
              Where in the world
              could she be?

1222
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,698
               Oh, no.

1223
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,934
              She's eloped.
              My baby.

1224
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,603
           Eloped?
           Well, I'll be darned.

1225
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,972
          - With Ray.
          - Ray!

1226
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,141
                Well, don't
                just sit there.
                Go after them.

1227
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,910
      Well, Nettie, I don't know
      where they've gone.

1228
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,645
              Besides, what good
              would that do?

1229
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,114
      Well, we have to find them
      before something happens.

1230
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:14,783
   What do you mean,
   before something happens?

1231
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,785
What she means is--

1232
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,820
              Never mind what
              she means, Rupert.

1233
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:19,988
              What are you two
              doing in the house

1234
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,089
               on a day
               like this anyway?

1235
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,291
            Why don't you go out
            and play?

1236
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:23,592
We haven't
finished our breakfast.

1237
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:24,726
       [telephone rings]

1238
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,727
                    I'll get it.

1239
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,796
            Oh, if that's Clara,

1240
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,198
             don't tell her
             about poor Leonora.

1241
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,334
               Don't worry, Mom.
               Ray's a keen guy.

1242
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:33,802
           Nobody asked
           your opinion, Willie.

1243
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,672
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept
the charges.

1244
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:37,739
It's Leonora.

1245
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,740
               Oh, it's Leonora.

1246
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,275
Hello. Hello, Leonora.

1247
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,677
Are you all right, honey?

1248
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,111
      Let me talk to her.
      Let me talk.

1249
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:46,248
Mad? Of course we're
not mad, sweetheart.

1250
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,849
Where are you?

1251
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,117
East Plankton?

1252
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,953
    East Plankton?
    They've had an accident!

1253
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,621
No, no, they haven't.

1254
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,056
    They wouldn't be
    in East Plankton on purpose.

1255
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,091
Do you have
a place to stay, honey?

1256
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,192
Do you need any money?

1257
00:59:57,194 --> 01:00:00,929
            Well, we have
            a very lovely room,

1258
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:05,634
       and Ray is getting a job,
       so we don't really
       need any money.

1259
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:08,337
        Except for maybe
        the first month's rent.

1260
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,205
        But only until
        he gets his first check.

1261
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,841
How much is it?
I'll send it right away.

1262
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:15,077
Fine. Now hang on.

1263
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,379
I think maybe
your mother wants
to talk to you, Leonora.

1264
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,715
Now, Nettie,
don't carry on and cry.

1265
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,383
Act as though
you're happy for them.

1266
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:24,119
             I know what to do.
             For heaven's sakes.

1267
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,723
Hello, Leonora.
This is your mother.

1268
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:30,892
And I'm so happy for you.

1269
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:32,861
[sobbing]

1270
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,335
            Boy, do these
            take me back.

1271
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,704
            I wonder
            if I could still--

1272
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,240
       I've been waiting
       half the morning
       for you, Charley.

1273
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,709
      Where have you been?

1274
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,777
            I've been out trying
            to raise some money.

1275
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:58,313
                   Roy, what's
                   the decision?

1276
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,248
  - Well--
  - Hey, you're taller today.

1277
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,221
             Roller skates?
             Boy, you're fooling
             around while I--

1278
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,824
                 Roy, what about
                 the decision?

1279
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,092
      Have they reached one yet?

1280
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:11,993
    Well, Charley,
    the situation is--

1281
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:13,195
       [telephone rings]

1282
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:14,262
     Your phone's ringing.

1283
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,064
            Roy, let me have it.

1284
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,766
  Your phone's ringing, Charley.

1285
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,434
                I hear it.

1286
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,970
               All right, don't
               you go away, now.

1287
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,243
Appleby Hardware.

1288
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,179
Yeah, what is it, Harry?
I'm in kind of a rush right now.

1289
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,115
         Well, Charley,
         we got some

1290
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:36,017
   Chicago bootleggers
   running loose around town.

1291
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,320
     They even took a shot
     at one of my men.

1292
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:41,256
   And we're checking out
   every lead we got
   to see if we can trap 'em.

1293
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,125
Yeah, but why
are you calling me
about that, Harry?

1294
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,494
     Well, uh,
     to tell you the truth,

1295
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,329
     we got a tip that
     a couple of local kids

1296
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:50,932
     have been making deliveries
     for these same bootleggers.

1297
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:54,336
           And, Charley,
           the descriptions
           fit your boys.

1298
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,404
My boys?
Harry, that's the most

1299
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,440
preposterous thing
I've ever heard.

1300
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,408
Don't leave, Roy.

1301
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,911
How could they make a delivery?
They don't even have a car.

1302
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:05,013
        I'm sorry
        I bothered you, Charley.

1303
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:07,015
Okay, Harry.

1304
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:12,420
       Okay, Roy, let me
       have the bad news,

1305
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:13,955
     if that's why
     you've been stalling.

1306
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,057
Roy:
Well, Charley,
it's like this--

1307
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,526
               Mr. Appleby.

1308
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,427
    - You've got a customer.
    - I know.

1309
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,962
If it's about
the one cent sale,

1310
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,097
Miss Partridge,
it's off.

1311
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,865
        Never mind that.

1312
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,401
      I'm here to inform you
      that I intend to sue you.

1313
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,170
    Sue me? What for?

1314
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:30,438
        Don't play innocent
        with me, Mr. Appleby.

1315
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,241
Excuse me, Roy.
And don't go away.

1316
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,279
Miss Partridge, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1317
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:39,447
           I'm talking about
           a broken lamp.

1318
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,350
          It was a very
          valuable antique lamp,

1319
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:43,952
       and your boys broke it.

1320
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,520
   My boys broke it?

1321
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,389
Miss Partridge,
just when did they do this?

1322
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,057
            When they tried
            to run over me,

1323
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,859
            in that old wreck
            of a car they drive.

1324
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,327
      - [dog barking]
      - A car they drive?

1325
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,895
           - [arf]
           - Pierre.

1326
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,163
    Miss Partridge,
    are you positive

1327
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,264
    it was my boys?

1328
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,433
            Well, I'd know
            them anywhere.

1329
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,970
            What is that noise?
            Pierre, be quiet!

1330
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,939
No wonder Felix
paid them all that money.

1331
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:09,511
            Pierre!

1332
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,214
What kind of a car
were they--

1333
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,949
     I've got to find them.

1334
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,088
            Okay.
            Okay, keep your
            shirt on, Sadie.

1335
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:25,894
                 Hey! Hey, Bugs!
                 Bugs, you crazy
                 or something?

1336
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,195
                    Get that car
                    out of here!

1337
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,430
       Felix, we got trouble.
       We got trouble.

1338
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,098
         Frankie shot
         a local flatfoot.

1339
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,001
        I know, I know,
        it's all over the radio.

1340
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:36,538
            Frankie, ain't you
            smarter than to take
            a shot at a cop?

1341
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,241
Button that big mouth
of yours and get your car.

1342
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:40,475
You're driving us
out of town.

1343
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,377
            You're not mixing me
            up in this.

1344
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,079
     Oh, no?

1345
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:46,047
Hey, Frankie,
we got a break.

1346
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,450
Remember them two kids
I told you about?
They're here.

1347
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,555
Now, they could
drive us out of town.
Nobody suspects them.

1348
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,024
          Hey, leave them alone.

1349
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,193
              They're good kids,
              and I don't want
              them shot up.

1350
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:00,161
                    You s--

1351
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:05,533
Hey, kids.
Come here.

1352
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,904
Hey, kids.
How you doing?

1353
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,072
       Did you hear about
       the raid at Sadie's Place
       last night?

1354
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,407
Yeah, I heard. Too bad.

1355
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,142
Let's get going.
By the way, this is Frankie.

1356
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:16,077
    He's gonna go with us,
    all right?

1357
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,580
We don't want to make
any more deliveries
to Sadie's Place.

1358
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,448
    You don't have to. We're
gonna take a little ride.

1359
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,017
          - Let's go
          - Where to?

1360
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,551
      You're just gonna
      drive us somewhere.

1361
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:26,321
     Don't worry about it.
     Come on, let's go.

1362
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,061
Okay, here we are.

1363
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:35,964
Let's go.

1364
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,234
                 What's he doing
                 down there?

1365
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,636
Just shut up
and drive us out of town.

1366
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:45,273
You see any cops,
you let me know.
Now get going.

1367
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,408
                       Yes, sir.

1368
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,044
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

1369

what happened to you?

1371
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:10,532
            Your boys.
            They took your boys.

1372
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,167
                   Who took 'em?

1373
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:14,703
       Frankie Zuto.
       Chicago gangster.

1374
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:17,038
Trying to get out of town.

1375
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,707
They'll never make it
in that old car.

1376
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:31,086
Don't take that car.
You'll have every cop
in town on your tail.

1377
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:54,509
       Uh-oh.

1378
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:57,445
       Frankie:
       All right, hold it, kids.
       Slow down.

1379
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:00,648
         Pull in behind that car
         before they spot us.

1380
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:05,520
                  Hey, what's
                  with you, kid.

1381
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,328
  What are we gonna do, Frankie?
  Just sit here all day or what?

1382
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,063
              No, we ain't gonna
              just sit here.

1383
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,798
      We're gonna pull out
      and go back the other way.

1384
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,134
           But we're gonna do it
           nice and easy

1385
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:21,269
           so that we don't
           attract no attention.

1386
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,271
                       Now move.

   Hey, our roof's come off!

1390
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:37,152

                being followed.

                  Must be Felix.

    Cut through that alley.

1401
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,697
           Bugs, take the wheel.
           This kid'll kill us.

1402
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,632
       Yeah.

1403
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,901
                   Don't let go
                   of the wheel,

Yeah, but don't
bug me now, huh?

                 know any place.

1481

1482
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,954
    Where is your home?

1483
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,923
                Over that way.
                But my pop would
                never let you.

01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:57,758
   Don't worry
   about it, kid.

      my best customer, Charley.

01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,233

My boys--

1489
01:15:05,235 --> 01:15:06,534
             I mean,
             it's one thing

1490
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,835
            to get picked up
            in a raid,

1491
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,704
        but what were you doing
        driving a bootleg car?

1492
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:12,039
Never mind that.
The real bootleggers
have kidnapped my boys.

1493
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,941
  - How you do you know that?
  - Because I followed them.

1494
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,643
    - I almost caught 'em.
    - How'd you get the car?

1495
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,044
      Would you just
      get some men on this

1496
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,813
     so those hoodlums
     don't get out of town?

1497
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:20,081
                Don't worry.

1498
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,582
            Nobody's gonna get
            out of town tonight.

1499
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:23,584
     Anything happens
     to Willie or Rupert--

1500
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:24,886
        I know, I know,
        we'll find them.
        I promise you.

1501
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:26,187
             Come on,
             I'll take you home.

1502
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,122
                Just drop me off
                at the store.

1503
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,525
One more thing.
Don't get any more
foolish notions

1504
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:31,926
about chasing gangsters.

1505
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,828
Leave that for us, okay?

1506
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:34,929
             Okay.

1507
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,545
                  This it?

1508
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:52,013
Willie:
Yeah, this is it.

1509
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:53,147
       Well, come on, let's go--

1510
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:54,615
          [loud bang]

1511
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:59,820
                        Come on.

1512
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:16,938
         That ladder leads up to
         my sister's old room.

1513
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,207
         She doesn't use it now,
         so you could use it
         as a hideout.

1514
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,144
Who's that?

1515
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:24,645
               My mother.

1516
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,683
  Hey, shorty.
  Go in and keep her occupied

1517
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,284
    so she don't get nosey.

1518
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,353
 Remember, we got your brother
 upstairs with us,

1519
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:35,189
      so don't go getting
      any big ideas about
      tipping anybody off.

1520
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,291
You got that?

1521
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,660
                       Yes, sir.

1522
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:02,216
        Well, thank goodness.
        Somebody's finally here.

1523
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:03,951
        I've warmed the liver up
        so many times,

1524
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,653
it's like shoe leather.

1525
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:06,654
Where's Willie?

1526
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,956
                Oh, he'll be in.

1527
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,192
Hear about
the big excitement?

1528
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:14,695
A shooting,
police chasing bootleggers,
I don't know what all.

1529
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:17,832
         Yeah, I believe I heard
         something about that.

1530
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:20,668
I wish your father were here.
I worry about him now.

1531
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:24,639
Go upstairs
and wash, Rupert.

1532
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,273
                I'd rather
                do it down here.

1533
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,812
        Sit down, kid.
        You ain't going nowhere.

1534
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,182
           Come on.

1535
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,954
What in the world
is Willie doing out there?

1536
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:41,222
I better call him.

1537
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:42,690
Where have you been?

1538
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,425
     Nettie, don't
     get excited, but--

1539
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:45,960
    Rupert, you're safe!

1540
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,395
    How did you get away
    from the bootleggers?

1541
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,296
  - Bootleggers?
  - How'd you know about that?

1542
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:51,365
      - I was chasing you.
      - That was you, Pop?

1543
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,234
     - Yeah.
     - What in the world--

1544
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:55,002
    Where's Willie?
    Have they still got him?

1545
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,873
         No, he's--
         He's upstairs, I think.

1546
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,808
      Upstairs? You said--

1547
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,309
              He must've gone in
              the front way.

1548
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,712
   Well, come on, Rupert.
   We better call the police

1549
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:06,847
    and give them all the
    information you've got.

1550
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,382
         I don't think
         we oughta do that, Pop.

1551
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:09,984
We have to, Rupert.

1552
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:11,752
        I wish somebody would
        tell me what's going on.

1553
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,854
Come on downstairs, Willie.
And hurry it up.

1554
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,056
        You, come here.

1555
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:23,130
    All right, go on down.
    But don't try anything, pal.

1556
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,166
           You send
           your brother up here.

1557
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:28,135
            If he's not here
            in five seconds,
            we're coming down.

1558
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,709
              Will you please
              tell me what
              this is all about?

1559
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:37,044
Not now, Nettie. Oh, Willie.
I'm calling the police.

1560
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,747
I want you and Rupert
to tell them everything--

1561
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:41,348
Rupert,
where are you going?

1562
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,184
        - Uh--
        - The bathroom.

1563
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,152
      - Yeah, bathroom.
      - Well, hurry it up.

1564
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:46,320
I want you to tell them

1565
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,888
everything you know
about these birds.

1566
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,790
Do you know
where they are now?

1567
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:51,192
        I think they're
        hiding out some place.

1568
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:52,827
Where were you when
you got away from them?

1569
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:53,894
        [doorbell rings]

1570
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,262
Do you remember that?

1571
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:56,731
                           Mama!

1572
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,299
      My baby!

1573
01:18:58,301 --> 01:18:59,800
  Leonora!

1574
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:01,302
                      Daddy, hi.

1575
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:02,937
                Oh, hello, Ray.
                We're so pleased
                to see you.

1576
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,004
   Hi, Ray.

1577
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:05,239
Well, then,
this is a surprise.

1578
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,474
Is everything all right?

1579
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:07,742
              Isn't it wonderful
              to have them

1580
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,110
                come for a visit
                so soon?

1581
01:19:09,112 --> 01:19:11,278
          Well, it's not exactly
          a visit, Mama.

1582
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,446
            Oh?

1583
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,982
All right,
what's happened?

1584
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,751
         Well, Daddy, you're not
         gonna believe this.

1585
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:18,018
              I think I'd better
              tell it.

1586
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,086
             Yes, Ray will tell.

1587
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,855
                  Well, what
                  happened was--

1588
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:23,457
        He got cheated.
        He got cheated right out
        of that good job.

1589
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:26,794
         That big crook
         hired his own stupid
         brother-in-law instead.

1590
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,230
              And there we were.

1591
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:31,232
    Ray, take
    the bags up, dear.

1592
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,233
No!

1593
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:33,768
    What do
    you mean, "no"?

1594
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,236
              He's right.
              The room's a mess.

1595
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,871
               Let me run up
               and tidy it.

1596
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,372
No, Ma. I'll do it.
Just let me do it, okay?

1597
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,241
    - What's wrong with you?
    - Let me go, Willie.

1598
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:42,176
           We have to make that
           phone call, you know?

1599
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:44,178
        Believe it or not,
        we're trying to run down
        a couple of crooks.

1600
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,080
                Hey, yeah.
                We had a dickens
                of a time

1601
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,515
              coming through
              a police blockade.
              What's going on?

1602
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:49,483
    Well, you see, these two
    crooks from Chicago--

1603
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,186
                [Nettie screams]

1604
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:53,954
       Charles!
       Charles, call the police!

1605
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,256
Call the police!

1606
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:56,857
      All right,
      put the phone down.

1607
01:19:58,528 --> 01:19:59,994
    Close the door.

1608
01:20:03,032 --> 01:20:04,198
All right, now get in here.

1609
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:08,269
               Come on, come on.

1610
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,403
    Charles.

1611
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:16,944
         Well, looks like a nice
         little family reunion.

1612
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:18,245
               I'd sure hate
               to spoil that.

1613
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,947
How'd you get up
in Leonora's room?

1614
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:21,415
            Shut up, lady.

1615
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,284
        One thing I can't stand,
        it's a yakking broad.

1616
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:25,019
Why, you're terrible.

1617
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,420
            That's right, lady.

1618
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:27,988
            Coming in to
            a nice home--

1619
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,156
Nettie, take it easy.

1620
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:38,399
            - Bugs?
            - Yeah?

1621
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:39,600
               Take the ol' lady
               in the kitchen,

1622
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:41,235
                have her sack up
                some food.

1623
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:42,870
        Sure, sure.

1624
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:45,573
                     Come here.

1625
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:46,874
   Don't you touch me.

1626
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,943
Wait a minute.
Go ahead, Nettie.

1627
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,177
Get 'em some food.

1628
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:54,448
   I'm not an old lady.

1629
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,918
              Hey, sweater.

1630
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,154
        You look like a hotshot
        with a hard-running car,
        right?

1631
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,156
               What's it to you?

1632
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:04,892
    Oh, we got a smart one, huh?

1633
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:07,328
         Let's see if you're
         smart enough to hand me
         your car keys.

1634
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,434
            You may be smart,
            but your hearing's
            not too good.

1635
01:21:13,436 --> 01:21:15,169
              I said toss me
              the car keys.

1636
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:16,237
                     Do it, Ray.

1637
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,404
Give 'em to him, Ray.

1638
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,581
            Catch on quick, pal.
            Where's it parked,
            out front?

1639
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:30,050
        Yeah.

1640
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,660
   Here.

1641
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,495
        You hang on to it, lady.

1642
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:46,467
                      Bugs?

1643
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:49,169
       Put your hat and coat on.
       We're leaving.

1644
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:53,540
            And bring that
            other kid down here.

1645
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:56,510
            I'd like to keep
            the family together.

1646
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:00,514
             Here, take it.

1647
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,516
           No, you hang on to it

1648
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,051
            'cause you're
            coming with us.

1649
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:05,920
What do you mean,
she's coming with you?

1650
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,388
You're not taking
my wife anywhere.

1651
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:10,057
    I ain't got time to debate
    it out with you, Dad.

1652
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:12,159
Well, you'll take her
over my dead body.

1653
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:16,196
         Okay, just remember.
         You laid down
         the conditions, not me.

1654
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:18,532
          [screaming]

1655
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:20,534
                Aah!
                Charles!

1656
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:24,238
Wait a minute, Nettie.
Wait a minute.

1657
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,272
  I'm not shot.

1658
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,943
         Howdy, folks. Anybody--

1659
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:33,213
             Attaboy, Pop!

1660
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:35,316
     Bugs, get him off me!

1661
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:37,651
      Okay, hold it, Pop!
      Hold it!

1662
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:40,521
         Hold him, Ray!

1663
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,357
                Get off me, kid!

1664
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:44,425
Nettie:
Now, don't get hurt!

1665
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,093
         Willie:
         Come on, Ray!

1666
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:47,161
Frankie!

1667
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,196
           [yelling]

1668
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,703
            Well, aren't you
            gonna help them?

1669
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:57,271
They're doing just fine.

1670
01:22:57,273 --> 01:22:58,539
                 Oh!

1671
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,007
Come on, Leonora!

1672
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:01,976
           [yelling]

1673
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,978
         Charles:
         Attaboy, Ray.

1674
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,045
             Now, wait a minute!
             Wait a minute!

1675
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,481
          [screaming]

1676
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,550
   Ray! Ray!

1677
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:11,385
         Willie:
         Get 'em, Pop!

1678
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:15,022
           [shouting]

1679
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:29,570
            Charles:
            The gun!

1680
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:31,505
         - Get the gun!
         - The gun.

1681
01:23:33,743 --> 01:23:37,344
All right, mister.
Hold it right there.

1682
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,447
              Ung!

1683
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,051
Hey, Rupe, you missed
all the fun.

1684
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,520
    All right, boys,
    take charge of these hoods

1685
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,654
    and get 'em out of here.

1686
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:49,656
            Oh. Oh.

1687
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:51,759
                Come on, Nettie.
                There you go.

1688
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:53,260
           Thank you.

1689
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:55,529
       Oh, Charley.
       Charley, you are a tiger.

1690
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,097
              You won't give up,
              will you?

1691
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,098
You know, Pop did it.

1692
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,466
Pop whupped Frankie?

1693
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:00,801
         Gun and all.
         You should've seen him.

1694
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:02,736
             Did it to save Mom.

1695
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:06,440
      I tell ya, Rupe,
      we've got some pop.

1696
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:08,042
            Well, I, uh--

1697
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,643
            I had a little
            help, you know.

1698
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,413
            Okay, now hold that.

1699
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:14,348
       I think you moved.

1700
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,517
   Good. Now, what do you
   plan on doing with the money?

1701
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:18,752
         - Money?
         - What money?

1702
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,321
    You don't know?
    For capturing Frankie Zuto.

1703
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:22,689
    Right, Chief?

1704
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:24,691
            Right, Chicago has
            a standing reward

1705
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,527
        of 5,000 bucks on him.

1706
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:28,429
            $5,000?

1707
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:29,797
           [shouting]

1708
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:37,604
                    Miss Nettie?
                    Miss Nettie?

1709
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:39,406
       - Uh, Miss Nettie?
       - Yes, Pete.

1710
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,276
   Speaking of money, the reason
   I dropped by tonight--

1711
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:43,777
              Pete, we haven't
              got the money yet.

1712
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,712
        Besides, you haven't
        paid back the last loan.

1713
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:47,548
                 Oh, Charles.

1714
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,616
           What do you think
           I'm trying to do?

1715
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:54,088
                   Here you are.
                   There's $100.

1716
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,622
                  And there's
                  your interest.

1717
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,124
               Thank you, Pete.

1718
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:06,433
Charlie, the town
has a little something
for you, too.

1719
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,601
                          Arnie?

1720
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,336
            This is the best
            I could do

1721
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,605
                on such short
                notice, Charlie,
                but you'll find

1722
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,474
your hotel reservations
right in there.

1723
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:16,276
         And when you get there,
         just ask the clerk

1724
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,845
            for your tickets
            to the World's Fair.

1725
01:25:17,847 --> 01:25:21,281
               The World's Fair!
               Oh, Charles!
               Oh, Charles!

1726
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,251
And if you need any cash,
the bank examiner's

1727
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:25,652
gonna let me open up
tomorrow morning.
How about that?

1728
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,321
             Fine.

1729
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:28,722
           All right, now, look.
           Let's get out of here

1730
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,390
            and let these people
            get some rest.

1731
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:32,559
    They've had a hard day.
    Good night, Charlie, Nettie.

1732
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:33,560
       Nettie:
       Good night, Chief.

1733
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:34,695
                        Goodbye!

1734
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,330
    Bye.
    I knew it, Pop.

1735
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,831
             I knew we'd go.

1736
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:39,800
           Yes, you were
           the believer, Rupert.

1737
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,535
  We wished on a star,
  didn't we?

1738
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:44,271
Pop made it happen,
not the wishing.

1739
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:45,873
                   I wonder.

1740
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,342
Well, Leonora's wish
for that big wedding
never came true.

1741
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:49,710
      Who said it didn't?

1742
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:51,845
    I wished for
    a beautiful wedding,
    not a big one.

1743
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:55,382
  And mine was
  the most beautiful wedding.

1744
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:57,584
   Well, I cried all the way
   through it, didn't I, Ray?

1745
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:58,785
             Yeah, she sure did.

1746
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,454
You know, we had better
get some sleep

1747
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:01,755
'cause we gotta get up early
and go house hunting.

1748
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:03,223
         That's right.
         Good night.

1749
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:04,858
      Good night, Leonora.
      Good night, Ray.

1750
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,860
            Hey, we gotta
            go up and pack.

1751
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:10,464
     Oh, yeah.
     Hey, listen, we gotta
     pack those baseball gloves.

1752
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:13,534
     You know, in case
     a foul ball comes our way
     when we go to see the Cubs.

1753
01:26:13,536 --> 01:26:14,568
                  Yeah!

1754
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,470
        You boys get
        right to bed now.

1755
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:18,739
           It's late.
           You can pack
           in the morning.

1756
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:24,511
                Oh, Charles.
                This is all
                so wonderful.

1757
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,514
                I can hardly
                believe it.

1758
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,582
                        Charles?

1759
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:29,616
            Hmm?

1760
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:34,688
              What's the matter?

1761
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:39,226
   I, uh, I just remembered
   something, Nettie.

1762
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,761
   I don't know how
   I could've forgotten it,

1763
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:44,431
  but with all
  this excitement, I did.

1764
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,567
            You forgot what?

1765
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:50,304
Come over here
and sit down, Nettie.

1766
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:58,946
Honey, I, uh,
I have to go down
to the store.

1767
01:26:58,948 --> 01:27:00,347
                  Well, tonight?

1768
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:01,882
           - Yes, I--
           - Oh.

1769
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,851
I have an appointment
with a fellow.

1770
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:07,688
             You're not still
             thinking of selling
             the store, are you?

1771
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,457
Oh, no, no. I'm saving that
for Ray and Leonora.

1772
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,692
                       Good.

1773
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:15,596
Nettie,
promise me something:

1774
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:18,699
that no matter what,

1775
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:21,535
you and the boys will
go to the fair, hmm?

1776
01:27:21,537 --> 01:27:24,338
            But, Charles,
            we're all going.

1777
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,639
           Would you like
           for me to pick you up

1778
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:27,241
            one of those
            seersucker suits
            for the trip?

1779
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:29,576
        No, no.

1780
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:33,013
    Nettie, I just want you
    to know one thing.

1781
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:37,251
    I think you're
    a fine woman.

1782
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,886
       Oh, what brought that on?

1783
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:43,257
    If I had my life
    to live over again,

1784
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:44,858
    I'd do a lot
    of things differently.

1785
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,862
    But one thing I know,

1786
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:50,964
    I'd want
    to live it with you.

1787
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:54,735
                Don't stop.

1788
01:27:57,573 --> 01:28:00,807
I think I'll go up
and see the kids
for a minute before I go.

1789
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:05,045
   Think about
   that seersucker, Charles.

1790
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:07,314
    You'd look nice in it.

1791
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:21,628
[Leonora and Ray laugh]

1792
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:29,536
             Boys?

1793
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,543
                  [sighs]

1794
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:11,978
Well, Nettie,
I guess I'd better go.

1795
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,682
           I wish you didn't
           have to go right now.

1796
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,718
So do I, Nettie.

1797
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,620
    So do I.

1798
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:31,932
           You haven't kissed me
           like that since...

1799
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:36,636
    since that night after
    the Air Force league picnic.

1800
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:39,973
I know. I should have
done it more often.

1801
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,844
I love you, Nettie.

1802
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:19,679
            [whines]

1803
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:31,525
              Oh, there you are.

1804
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,593
           Boy, you sure picked
           a fine time for this.

1805
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,662
Yeah.
Pull over to the curb.

1806
01:30:42,204 --> 01:30:44,538
Charley, why do you
have to be so difficult?

1807
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,573
      I don't know what
      you're talking about, Roy.

1808
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:49,009
        So let's get this
        over with, huh?

1809
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:50,544
        Where's it gonna happen?

1810
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:51,778
It's already happened.

1811
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,180
              It has?

1812
01:30:53,182 --> 01:30:55,182
  Who do you think
  that gunshot was meant for?

1813
01:30:55,184 --> 01:30:56,183
          That was it.

1814
01:30:56,185 --> 01:30:57,984
               It was?

1815
01:30:57,986 --> 01:30:59,853
        Roy, I don't understand.

1816
01:30:59,855 --> 01:31:02,055
        He shot right at me,
        but there was no bullet.

1817
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:05,025
Oh, yes there was.

1818
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:06,059
               You mean, you--

1819
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,128
            How did you do that?

1820
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,096
       Well, I had to
       move pretty fast.

1821
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:11,731
               But why?

1822
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:14,034
      Because I'm
      a soft-hearted boob.

1823
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:15,535
   As long as I can remember,

1824
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:17,103
        that's always
        been my trouble.

1825
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,939
            What do I do now?

1826
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:20,640
       If I were you,
       first thing I'd do

1827
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,075
       is pick me up
       a seersucker suit.

1828
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:24,144
             Roy, wait a minute.

1829
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:25,846
            How will I know
            when my number's up?

1830
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:27,814
      You won't.
      You'll have to go on

1831
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,249
      like everyone else,
      not knowing.

1832
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,918
    Except maybe you've
    learned how to live now.

1833
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,655
       So long, Charley.

1834
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:41,595
         [cows mooing]

1835
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:47,000
Oh, Charles.

1836
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:50,270
You do look handsome
in your seersucker suit.

1837
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:52,672
           Yeah, Pop,
           you sure look snazzy.

1838
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:55,509
   I guess it doesn't
   look too bad, does it?

1839
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:58,111
Oh! Charles, my hat!

1840
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,625
It's coming back.

1841
01:32:11,627 --> 01:32:13,860
     Boy, that must
     be some wind.

1842
01:32:19,101 --> 01:32:20,567
         Oh!

1843
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:23,904
     For heaven's sake.

1844
01:32:23,906 --> 01:32:25,705
How could it
do that, Pop?

1845
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:27,874
      Uh, well,
      as you said, Willie,

1846
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,843
     it must be some wind.

1847
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,624
                 Who are you
                 waving at, Pop?

1848
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:48,995
      Oh, I was just waving
      goodbye to summer, Rupert.

1849
01:32:48,997 --> 01:32:51,698
            I'll bet this is one
            we'll never forget.
