00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,298
Mother And Clara
Did That.

184
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,134
Oh, Well Done, Clara.

185
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,002
Thank You, Sir.

186
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,070
Mother's Putting
The Best China Away.

187
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,040
She Wouldn't Let Me Help.
She Said I Might Drop It.

188
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,207
Did She?

189
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,143
Hello, Dear.

190
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,143
Hello.

191
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,211
You're Back.

192
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,211
Yes.

193
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,480
Clara, You Can
Serve Dinner Now.

194
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,950
The Master's Home.

195
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,217
All Right, Mum.

196
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,086
That Girl...

197
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,423
I Wish She'd Call Me "Madam."

198
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,959
"Mum" Is<I> So</I> Vulgar.

199
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,060
Well, I've Been Brought Here
By Lord Harrogate

200
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,530
To Make His Colliery Pay,
And I'm Going To Do It.

201
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,598
And If I Don't,
He'll Close Down The Pit,

202
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,199
And Then I Shall Lose
My Job...

203
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:57,602
As Well As
The Miners' Livelihood.

204
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,038
What Exactly
Is The Problem, Dear?

205
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,541
Alice, Do Drink
Your Soup Quietly.

206
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,043
The Real Problem Is That
We Can't Get The Coal Out

207
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,346
In Sufficient Quantities.

208
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,949
And Therefore,
It's Too Expensive.

209
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,350
At That Price,
We Can't Sell It.

210
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,952
That's Why They Had To Stop
The Night Shift.

211
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:18,090
What Will You
Have To Do, Father?

212
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,358
Well, For A Start,

213
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,958
I Shall Try And Get Rid
Of Those Pit Ponies.

214
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:23,596
[Steam Whistle Blows]

215
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:43,948
[Barking]

216
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,050
Come On, Tom,
I'll Race You To The Top!

217
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,219
That's Not Fair --
You Started Off First!

218
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,621
Don't Worry--

219
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,423
I'll Wait For You
When I Get There.

220
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,026
Oh, No, You Won't!
I'll Beat You Yet!

221
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,629
See If I Don't.

222
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,466
Bye, Daddy.

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,370
Goodbye, My Dear.
Have A Nice Day.

224
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,040
Alice!

225
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,942
Alice,
Where Are You Going?

226
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,177
Just Going To
Fly My Kite, Mother!

227
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,147
Don't Go Too Far.

228
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,215
I Don't Like Her
Going Up In The Moors Alone.

229
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,053
Well, It's A Bit Lonely
For Her Here.

230
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:22,987
I Don't Want Her Playing

231
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,723
With Any Of Those
Rough Miners' Children.

232
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,491
I Shall Be Glad
When The Governess Arrives

233
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,494
To Keep Her
Out Of Mischief.

234
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,730
Well, Goodbye, Dear.

235
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,565
Hmm.

236
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,467
I Do Hope His Lordship
Is Agreeable.

237
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,136
Yes, So Do I.

238
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,421
Uh, Mr. Sandman
To See Lord Harrogate.

239
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,123
His Lordship
Is Expecting You, Sir.

240
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,499
Now, Then, Sandman,
What Do You Propose To Do

241
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,167
About This Colliery
Of Mine?

242
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,503
Well, Lord, One
Of The Problems Is That--

243
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,737
Uh, No, Thank You--

244
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,106
Is That Emsdale
Is A Small Colliery,

245
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,509
And The Seam Is A Long Way
From The Surface.

246
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,478
Yes, Yes.
I Know All About That.

247
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,213
But The Point Is That
It Doesn't Make A Profit.

248
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:25,250
Now, Kirkdale's Colliery
Makes A Profit,

249
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,253
But My Colliery
Does Not Make A Profit.

250
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,255
In Fact, My Colliery
Keeps Losing Money.

251
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:34,091
Now You, As My New
Manager, Tell Me,

252
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,494
What Do You Propose
To Do About That?

253
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,762
I'd Like To Explore
The Possibility

254
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:40,064
Of Using Machinery
In The Pit, Milord.

255
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,632
Machinery?
[Laughing]

256
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,703
Are You Suggesting
We Might Use Machinery

257
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,638
Instead Of Miners,
Perhaps?

258
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,008
Um, Well, No, Milord.

259
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,475
But It Might Be Possible

260
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,778
To Bring The Coal
From The Face To The Shaft

261
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,081
By Means Of Machinery
Instead Of Ponies.

262
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,517
Hmm?

263
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,384
Well, Yes, Yes,
At Least I'm --

264
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,321
I'm Prepared
To Explore That Idea.

265
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,124
Hmm? Look Into That For Me,
Will You, Sandman?

266
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,492
And Find Out
All About The Costs,

267
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:12,330
And Show Me Things,
Like Plans And So On.

268
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,532
You Know,
That Sort Of Thing.

269
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,799
I Will, Milord.

270
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,169
My Goodness,
Just Look At Those Rabbits

271
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:20,071
All Over The Lawn
Simply Ruining It.

272
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,506
[Barking]

273
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,142
Alice: Go Away!

274
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:28,113
Go Away, You Horrible Dog!
Go Home!

275
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,780
It's A Girl Up A Tree.

276
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,216
Aye.

277
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,085
Come On.

278
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,421
Go Away,
You Horrible Dog!

279
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:39,790
What Are You Doing
Up There?

280
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:40,792
Go Away!

281
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,126
Can You Get Down?

282
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,327
Yes!

283
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,130
Of Course I Can.

284
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,132
[Gasps]
No!

285
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,536
Come On.

286
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,238
I Want My Kite.

287
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,673
You Don't Want Much,
Do You?

288
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,776
You Best Get
Yourself Down First.

289
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:00,644
Come On--
That's The Way.

290
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,148
Go On--
Down A Bit More.

291
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,224
[Gasps]
Be Careful!

292
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,460
Why Did You Put
Your Kite In A Tree?

293
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:18,262
I Didn't Do It
On Purpose.

294
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,798
I Can't Run Fast Enough

295
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,134
To Get It Up In The Air
Properly.

296
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,501
Dave Could.

297
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,339
Pull, Dave, Pull.
It's Nearly There.

298
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,807
Run Faster, Dave.

299
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,476
Dave: There It Goes --
I Can Feel The Wind Take It.

300
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:34,546
Come On, Kite.
Come On!

301
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:37,548
Oh, Dave, It's Flying!
You've Done It!

302
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,118
Oh, Well Done.

303
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,387
Oh, Let Me Have A Go,
Please.

304
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,624
Here You Are.

305
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,624
Thank You.

306
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,795
Why Aren't You
In School?

307
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,797
Why Do You Think?
Summer Holidays.

308
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:53,932
You're Lucky--

309
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,933
I've Got A Horrible
Governess Coming,

310
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,803
And She'll Want To Stay
Indoors All Day Doing Lessons.

311
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,204
What's A Governess?

312
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,474
She's A Sort Of Teacher,
Ain't She?

313
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,676
Why Don't You
Go To School Like Us?

314
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,546
Because It's A Colliery School,
And She's A Lady.

315
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,879
I'm Not A Lady!

316
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,682
Oh, Yes, You Are.

317
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,951
I'm Not A Lady!
I'm Not!

318
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,685
I Only Said
You Were A Lady.

319
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,955
How Dare You Call Me That?
Take That Back!

320
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,390
Nothing Wrong With That.

321
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,357
Yes, There Is--
The Way You Said It.

322
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,259
Watch What You're Doing.
You'll Tear Your Dress.

323
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,228
I Don't Care!
I'm Not A Lady!

324
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,797
Take That Back!

325
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,797
Stop It!

326
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:26,932
That's Enough!

327
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,265
What?

328
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:31,836
Ladies Don't Fight.

329
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,283
Alice: I Wonder What
It's Like Down The Pit.

330
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,787
Haven't You Ever
Been Down?

331
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,955
We Go Down All The Time.

332
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,356
You Can't.
You're Too Young.

333
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,892
Boys Aren't Allowed
To Work Down The Mines

334
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,292
Until They're 14.

335
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,493
We Don't<I> Work,</I> Exactly.

336
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:57,895
We Help Bert
With The Ponies.

337
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,832
The Ponies?!

338
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,768
You Help With The Pit Ponies?!

339
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,337
Yes. We Go To The Stables
Near Every Day.

340
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,273
We Help Look After Them.

341
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,342
You'll Miss Them
When They're Gone, Won't You?

342
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,711
Gone?

343
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,953
The Ponies!
Mum, The Ponies!

344
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,656
Now,
Where Have You Been?

345
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,825
The Ponies!

346
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,825
What About The Ponies?

347
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,659
They're Gonna
Get Rid Of Them.

348
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,795
They're Putting
Machinery In Instead.

349
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,631
What'll Become
Of The Ponies?!

350
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,398
What Will They Do
With Them?!

351
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,701
What<I> Can</I> They Do
With Them?

352
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,535
Nobody's Going To Pay
For Their Keep

353
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,838
If They Can't Work.

354
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,741
Come On, Sit Down
And Have Your Tea.

355
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:50,815
What<I> Will</I> Happen To Them?

356
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,651
How Should I Know?

357
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,818
Be Thankful It's Only The Ponies
They're Getting Rid Of

00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,177
Send The Men Home,
Then, Shall I?

535
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,448
Oh, Yes, Very Well.

536
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,421
Alice, You Run Along.
I've Got A Lot To Do.

537
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,056
Please, Father.

538
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,691
All Right.
What Is It You Want?

539
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:36,493
It's About The Pit Ponies.
What Will Happen To Them?

540
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,062
Alice,
I Haven't Got--

541
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,497
Please, Father,
I Want To Know.

542
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,965
Well, I Can Hardly
Turn Them Loose On The Moors.

543
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,302
They're Not Used To
Fending For Themselves.

544
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,970
Isn't There
A Field Somewhere,

545
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:46,770
So They Can Live Happily

546
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,973
And Run About
And Enjoy Themselves?

547
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:49,974
Who'll Pay
For Their Feed?

548
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,343
The Colliery Owner.
They Work In The Colliery.

549
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,144
You Can Hardly Expect
Lord Harrogate

550
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,180
To Pay For Animals To Do
Nothing, Anymore Than Men.

551
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:57,981
Well, Then What<I>
Will</I> Become Of Them?

552
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,085
They Won't...

553
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:03,954
Be Sent To
The Slaughterhouse,

554
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,457
Will They?

[Voice Trembling]
Father...

556
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:12,096
Run Along Home.

557
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:13,596
Why Aren't You
With Your Governess?

558
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,099
I've Got Enough On My Mind

559
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:17,468
Without Being Bothered
About A Lot Of Ponies!

[Crying]

561
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:31,248
What Is It, Alice?

562
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,150
What's The Matter?

563
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,754
The Ponies...

564
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:41,358
He's Going To Kill
The Ponies.

[Sobbing]

566
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:58,075
There's Only
One Thing To Do.

567
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,744
We'll Have To Steal Them.

568
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,646
Steal Them?

569
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,616
You Mean Get Them Out Of
The Mine And Keep Them Safe?

570
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,119
Oh, Yes!

571
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,153
How Will We Do It?

572
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,392
I Don't Know.

573
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:20,730
Bert Can Help Us.

574
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:22,732
No. You're Not
To Mention It To Bert.

575
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,035
But You Said --

576
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,568
I Was Wrong.

577
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,571
He Might Tell Luke.

578
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:29,373
Luke Likes The Ponies.

579
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:32,275
He'd Be Afraid
Of Losing His Place.

580
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:37,114
Couldn't We Come In
Along At Night

581
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,048
And Wind Them Up?

582
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,650
No. Someone Would Hear Us.

583
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:41,652
Besides, There's
Always People About

584
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:43,653
Doing Maintenance
In There.

585
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:46,490
Then How
Can We Get To Them?

586
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:49,359
There Must Be
Another Way In.

587
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:52,797
There'd Be
Some Old Workings.

588
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:55,765
Might Be A Way
Of Getting In Through Them.

589
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,235
How Do We Know
Where They Are?

590
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,372
They Always Keep Plans
Of All The Workings.

591
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:05,241
Where?

592
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:07,378
In Your Father's Office.

What's Going On, Carter?

Carter: You Better Come Over,
Mr. Sandman,

The Whole Pit Standing Idle.

What's Going On?

00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,488
Your Man Tells Me I Can't
Take This Stuff Down Pit.

598
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:19,657
I Warned You
Time And Time Again,

599
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,392
No Naked Flames Down There.

You Given Me Four Weeks
To Finish This Job.

If I Can't Do...

603

...Any Delay
As Of Yesterday.

604

Firmly Promised.

[Indistinct Arguing]

606
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,553
It Should Be
Somewhere Here.

607
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,722
Yes, But Where?

608
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,493
Let's Look Up Here.

609
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,268
Look!

610
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,304
Look, I've Found It!

611
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,949
Come On!

612
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:15,833

That Could've Been You.

615
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:46,430
That Should Be
The Old Engine House There.

616

00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:09,352
Aye, It's A Winding Engine.

619
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:11,954
You Know, For Winding
The Gauge Up And Down.

620
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:15,425
Then If We Can Get It Working,
We Can Bring The Ponies Up.

A Winding Engine Work?

Alice, Dear, That's Hardly
A Suitable Subject

623

For A Young Lady.

To Be A Young Lady

And To Learn French,
And Sewing, And Watercolors--

But I Also Want Her
To Take An Interest

So, Alice, If You'd Like
To Come To My Study,

629

I'll Show You How
A Winding Engine Works.

About Machinery?

You Can't Put<I> This</I>

And Putting It In.

Is Some Grease.

You Know What It Does.

648
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,579
It Rides The Gauge Up And Down
And Pumps The Water Out.

649
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,981
Where Does
The Water Come From?

650

The Water Comes From.

If You Didn't Pump
The Pit Out Every Day,

00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,125

When You Get It Going?

Up Out Of The Pit,

00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:10,293
And How Do You Think
You'll Do That?

Through The Old Workings.

Up Out Of The Pit?

If Only We Could Get
The Engine To Work.

00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:32,682
Shouldn't Be Too Hard.

It's Not So Long
Since It Was Running.

681
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:39,022
First,
Clear The Shaft Head.

01:10:08,703 --> 01:10:10,672
There's Bound To Be
A Bit Of Dislocation At First

1072
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:11,806
When We're Changing Over--

1073
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,875
From Men To Machines!

Now, I'm Not
Going To Punish You,

So I Hope It Will Be
Enough Punishment

For You To Know
That I'm Very Angry,

1107
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,817
And I'm Disappointed
In You.

Will The Union
Give You Their Backing?

01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:44,925
They Might.

1117
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,395

They Might Not.

No Food, And No Work.

01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,065
Aye!

1242
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:08,469

1245
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:18,412
If Colliery Closs
We're Done For,

1246
01:20:18,445 --> 01:20:20,081
So Think On.

1247
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:24,985
I Say We Give It A Chance.

1248
01:20:25,019 --> 01:20:28,890
It's Agreed, Then--
We Go Back.

1249
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:31,259
We Should Have A Vote!

1250
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,061
Let's Vote!

To Hold Out For Terms!

We'll Have A Show Of Hands!

To The Colliery.

Aren't You Going To
Kiss Him Good-Bye?

1262

I Shall Never
Kiss Him Again

Come On!

What's Going On There?

1268
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,075
Come On, Bert,
Get Them Ponies Up, Don't Ya?

1269
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,177

By Next Week, We Should
Be Able To Drive South

From The Forward Heading.

1274
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:42,623
Aye.

1275
01:22:42,655 --> 01:22:47,194
It's A Pity We Couldn't Have
Found The Ponies A Home, Sir.

1276
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:48,596
Well, It Would Have
Made It Easier

1277
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:51,032
For The Men To Go Back
With A Good Heart.

1278
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:53,500

As A Sign Of Weakness.

There's Been
An Explosion, Milord,

And A Fall
In The Drift Heading.

1287

What Caused It...

And, Uh, Eight Men Cut Off
In The Forward Heading.

Who Are They?

Mrs. Armstrong, Sir.

1292
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:14,114
I'm Sorry, Mrs. Armstrong.

Is One Of Them.

How's The Leg, Amos?

1299

Oh, Hey, Hey,
Don't Touch It, Lad.

1300
01:25:05,765 --> 01:25:08,135
All Right, Lad,
All Right.

1301
01:25:08,168 --> 01:25:10,805
If There's A Buildup
Of Afterdamp Beyond The Fall,

1302
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:12,806
It Could Be Days
Before They Get Through.

1303
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,911
Aye. Cheer Us Up,
Why Don't You?

1304
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:20,848
I'm Gonna Try
The Other Heading--

1305
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:23,451
See If
I Can Hear Anyone.

1307
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,654
Mind How You Go, Alf.

1308
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:27,854
One Spark From Your Boots

1309
01:25:27,887 --> 01:25:29,789
Might Be Enough
To Set It All Off.

They're There, Milord.

1311

I See.

1312
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:36,931
And There's No Way
Of Getting Through To Them?

1313
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:38,932
Well, It's Not A Very Big Fall,
As Far As We Can Judge,

1314
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:41,903
But, Um, It's Knocked Out
The Main Ventilation Shaft.

1315
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:44,671
And, Uh, The Afterdamp
Is Very Bad.

1316
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:47,507

The Suffocating Gas?

1317
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:48,943
That's Right, Milord.

1318
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:50,810
And When There's Firedamp
And Afterdamp Together--

1319
01:25:50,844 --> 01:25:53,681
I Know, I Know--It Ignites.

1320
01:25:50,844 --> 01:25:53,681
It Can Do.

1321
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:56,951
And There's No Other
Possible Way Of Reaching Them?

1322
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:59,187
No, Milord, And
It May Be As Much As,

01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,454
Oh, 48 Hours Before
We Can Get The Ventilation --

1324

To Them Somehow.

The Shaft Bottom!

Like We Did With The Ponies!

1330
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:16,469
They Got The Old Winding
Engine Working Again And All.

To Try It.

Your Way Through, Sir.

Knows The Way.

From Beyond The Fall?

Two Or Three Days

We're Dead, Anyway.

1395

Won't Be Long
Before They're Right.

You're A Real Tonic.

1397
01:30:55,282 --> 01:30:56,583
Just A Minute--Stop.

1398
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:57,952
I'm Just Going To Test
For Firedamp.

1399
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:07,927
Yes, There's A Show Here.

1400

Great Heavens.
It's Very Heavy.

1401
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:14,101
Is It That Bad, Sir?

1402
01:31:14,134 --> 01:31:16,971
Why, It's
Up To The Limit.

1403
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:19,006
We Don't Have Much Time.

1404

Straight Away.

She'd Be Most Welcome.

1406
01:31:34,621 --> 01:31:36,923
Uh, Mrs. Sandman,
Lord Harrogate Was Wondering

1407
01:31:36,957 --> 01:31:38,993
Whether You'd Like
To Go And Sit In The Car.

1408
01:31:39,025 --> 01:31:40,894
Oh...

1409
01:31:44,698 --> 01:31:45,966
Would You Thank
His Lordship,

1410
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:48,234
But Say
