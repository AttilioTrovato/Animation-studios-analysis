            [girl] nice landing,
            Uncle Bene.         

3
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,880
                 Right on the   
                 50-yard line.

00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,782
[boy] should've gone            
for a touchdown.                

5
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,486
 Next time, I'll put it         
 right between the goalposts.   

6
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,462
[girl] can't wait to see        
the museums and go to           
all the concerts.               

7
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,365
 [Bene] that's why we arranged  
 this little vacation.          

8
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,802
 We've been so busy establishing
 our community on Witch Mountain

    an opportunity              

10
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,274
 To see what life               
 in the big city is all about.  

11
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,378
I'd rather go to the beach      
and learn how to surf.          

12
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,381
    [chuckling] there'll be     
    another time for that.      

13
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,651
 Just remember what I told you, 
 and have a lot of fun.

15
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,900
     Tony, come back here.      

16
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,809
Now, never energize unless      
it's absolutely necessary.      

17
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,679
Tia?                            

18
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,956
If earth kids can live here     
without energizing, you can too.

    I'm supposed to pick up?

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,585
 - [Bene] just the children.    
 - All right.                   

23
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,987
    Meter's running, hop in.    

24
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,456
         I got it.

        [cabbie grunts]

     I've been                  
     waiting here forever.

00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,670
You know, people wait for taxis,
not taxis wait for people.      

28
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,639
                 We're exactly  
                 on time.       

29
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,276
Yeah, well, kind of a           
strange time and place          
to be making a pick up.         

30
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,946
I mean, if you're here for the  
next game, it's in three months.

31
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,182
            We have seats       
            on the 50-yard line.

            Deliver the children
            to this address.    

34
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,120
             You'll be paid     
             after you arrive.  

35
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,388
This is a big fare here.        

36
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,192
If these kids pay me, I hope    
they know I get a big tip.      

37
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,297
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.            

38
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,499
 - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.     
 - Goodbye.                     

39
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,769

        These civilians         
        don't know how to drive.

46
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,345
         They ought to be       
         kept off the streets.  

47
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,881
 The streets belong             
 to us professional drivers.    

48
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,316
     Taxis, buses, trucks.      

49
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,985
 That's all that should         
 be allowed on the streets.     

50
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,188
 You see, I happen to know      
 a great deal about driving.    

51
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,391
I have a perfect safety record.

53
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,195
            Come on, get out    
            of the way, you bum.

     [woman] thank you.         
     Thank you, sickle.         

57
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,562
Well, this is                   
a perfect test site.            

58
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,963
Little traffic...

00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,366
...And low                      
real estate value.              

60
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,334
                 It's adequate, 
                 I suppose.     

61
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,405
Ok, let's get this over with.   
This thing on all right?        

62
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,379
                     It's ready.

63
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,382
     What do you want him       
     to do this time?           

64
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,753
     I want you to              
     climb that fire escape...  

65
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,155
    ...To the absolute top.     

66
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,091
         Wait a minute.         

67
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,827
             Uh-uh.             

68
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,663
    This is as high as I go.    

69
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,665
     You want me to             
     break somebody's leg?      

70
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,600
 Just tell me how many pieces.  

71
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,635
 But up there, I don't go.      

72
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,939
- Why not?                      
- Because I'm afraid of heights.

73
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,241
I will get dizzy.               
I will fall.                    

74
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,311
     That is true, Victor.      
     He has acrophobia...       

75
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,613
     ...Among other things.     

76
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,748
 Find a different test for him. 

77
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,153
    Acrophobia is not           
    a problem with my device.   

78
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,589
        Start climbing.         

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,791
I will do anything else you say,

80
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,193
But I am not going              
up that building, understand?   

81
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,797
         - I...                 
         - Sickle...            

82
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,834
 ...I command you               
 to climb up that fire escape.  

83
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,870
                You will go     
                to the very top,

84
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,039
         You will turn around,  
         and you will look down.

85
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,009
     And you will not           
     be frightened of heights.  

86
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,346
                     Off you go.

87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,601
                 It's working.  

88
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,538
                 It's working!  

89
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,309
It seems to be.                 

90
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,046
Victor. Victor,                 
you are risking his life.       

91
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,982
He's my nephew.                 
My only living relative.        

92
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,718
He's the only one               
I can leave my...               

93
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,854
...Uh, my bankruptcy to.        

94
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,024
     That's what experimentation
     is all about, Letha.       

95
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,459
[Letha] we cannot               
afford to lose him.             

96
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,730
     I am the only one          
     we cannot afford to lose.  

97
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,733
 Can't you see that I've got    
 complete control over his mind?

98
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:33,505
             He has no fear,    
             no memory, no will.

99
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,076
        He can only             
        carry out my commands.  

100
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,724
 - [car rattling]               
 - what... What's happening?    

101
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,060
We're out of gas.               

102
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,030
What are you, crazy? Look at    
the dial, it points to... Empty.

103
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,865
             Empty?             

104
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,644
     - [exhales]                
     - [horns honking]          

105
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,047
         It was all that waiting
         I had to do for youse. 

106
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,222
 I'll run down the street to the
 gas station and get some gas.  

107
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,993
Boy, oh, boy.                   

108
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,499
         You guys are costing me
         a lot of dough.        

109
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,202
         I sure hope you        
         make the tip worth it. 

110
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,109
Something's going to happen     
to someone near here.           

111
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,644
             We've got to help. 

112
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,047
No, I think you'd better stay   
here and wait for the driver.   

113
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,249
I'll go.                        

114
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,585
I think it came from            
back that way.                  

115
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,487
                     Be careful.

116
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,556
             And remember what  
             Uncle Bene said.   

117
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,943
That is enough.                 
Bring him down!                 

118
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,713
     [victor] sickle,           
     turn to your right.        

119
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,482
        Balance yourself        

120
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,887
                 And walk along 
                 the ledge.     

121
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,823
             [Letha] Victor, no.
             Stop.              

122
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,060
I'll bring him down myself.     
Give that to me.                

123

     [wires crackling]          

124
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,896
                    Look what   
                    you've done.

         Sickle, stop.          

127
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,606
    Sickle, I'm                 
    commanding you to stop.     

128
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,610
 Sickle, this is Dr. Victor     
 Gannon commanding you to stop! 

129
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,518
     - He's out of control.     
     - [Letha] sickle!          

130
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,153
Go back!                        

131
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,489
 [Letha screeching] sickle!     

132
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,127
             No!                

133
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,516
                 Letha... Look. 

134
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,253
        - I can't look.         
        - You must.             

135
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,294
         [footsteps approaching]

136
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,602
        [Letha] it's miraculous.

137
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,137
There are                       
no miracles, Letha.             

138
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,372
Only scientific explanations    
for everything.                 

139
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,109
Well, then, just explain to me  
what we're seeing.              

140
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,646
        It... Must be...        

141
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,848
        ...That... Boy.         

142
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,519
    There's a...                
    There's a force that...     

143
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,255
 ...Centers around that boy.    

144
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,425
     A force capable            
     of countermanding          

145
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,763
 The basic physical law of...   
 Gravity.                       

146
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,833
 Victor, I don't know           
 what you're talking about.     

147
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,270
    Molecular mobilization.     

148
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,008
 - I need that boy, Letha.      
 - [horns honking]

 - Now, just a minute.          

150
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,391
             Brilliant, my boy. 
             Brilliant.         

151
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,328
Congratulations, young man,     
for a fantastic...              

152
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,231
Well, whatever it was           
you just did,                   

153
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,534
It was absolutely heroic.       

154
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,803
        It was nothing,         
        I just... [gasps]

         Over here.             

168
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,924
[older boy #2] it ain't no use  
hiding behind those trash cans. 

169
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,827
[older boy #1] the earthquakes'

in the world did that come from?

173
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,480
        It was a set up.        

174
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,484
    - Let's give it to 'em.

Hey, you really saved us        
from getting wiped out.

00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,509
             Yeah, thanks a lot.

 We're the earthquake gang.     

189
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,424
            Does that scare you?

190
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,264
             - No.              
             - Aww.             

191
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,866
Let's change                    
our name again.                 

192
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,834
We gotta have                   
a name that scares.             

193
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,970
            - Yeah.             
            - Hey.

 How'd you do what you done?    

195
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,774
     Well, I really             
     didn't do anything.        

196
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,010
     Yeah. You a magician       
     or something?              

197
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,979
             No.                

198
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,283
 You want to join our gang?     

199
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,088
    I'm sorry.                  
    I'm looking for someone.    

200
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,789
        - Thanks anyway.        
        - Aw, sure.             

201
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,625
     I guess you're like        
     the rest of them.          

202
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,627
     You've heard               
     we're a nothing gang.      

203
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,496
    Yeah, well we ain't         
    always gonna be nothing.    

204
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,365
     Someday we're gonna        
     be the toughest.           

205
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,966
 Take over the whole territory. 

206
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,503
    Someday they're gonna run   
    when they see us            
    coming down the block.      

207
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,938
         All right.             

208
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,040
    It's just that              
    I've got to find my brother.

209
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,942
 What gang does he belong to?   

210
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,879
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]                

211
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,449
 I never heard of a Guy         
 that never belonged to a gang. 

212
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,220
 I'm sure something's happened. 
 I've got to find him.          

213
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,889
    If anybody could find him,  
    we could.                   

214
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,658
     I mean, we know            
     this town inside out.      

215
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,660
         Oh, would you?         

216
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,428
        Hey, yeah, sure.        

217
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,299
Listen, you done us a big favor,
now we'll do it for you.

     Thank you.                 
     Thank you very much.

    Hey, come on, let's go.     

220
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,916
            That Tony sure      
            made himself scarce.

221
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,552
 - We better walk you home.     
 - Where do you live?           

222
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,889
I... I was supposed to          
stay at a hotel.                

223
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,757
But I don't know                
which one.                      

224
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,259
        You could stay          
        in our hideout.         

225
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,427
         - [boys] yeah!         
         - Thank you.           

226
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,761
     We'll look                 
     for Tony tomorrow.         

227
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,698
     If we aren't busy          
     beating up goons.          

228
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,034
     - Yeah.                    
     - Hey, it's yo-yo.         

229
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,671
        - Get down.             
        - Come on, hide.        

230
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,880
        - Did he see us?        
        - I don't know.         

231
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,350
 - But he's coming this way.    
 - [Tia] who is he?             

232
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,519
 - [muscles] our worst enemy.   
 - He's worse than the goons.   

233
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:00,024
 [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto,     
 the truant officer.            

234
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,793
         He's trying to make us 
         go back to school.     

235
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,631
     [dazzler] let's go.        

236
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,302
         [all] yeah!            

237
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,514
             That's our hideout.

238
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,539
     [stairs creaking]          

239
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,915
[Tia] when do                   
the ghosts get here?            

240
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,185
        [Rocky] don't say things
        like that.              

241
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,460
        This place could        
        really scare ya.        

242
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,562
            [gasps]             

243
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,164
Come on.                        

244
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,217
 This is where we're gonna live 
 when we run away from home.    

245
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,052
        Yeah, you can't be tough

246
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,822
     If you take orders from    
     your mom or older sister.  

247
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,090
        That's why              
        we quit school.         

248
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,393
     You can't be tough         
     and educated, too.         

249
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,927
[crusher] yeah.                 

250
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,332
        - Tony!                 
        - [boys] where?         

251
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,502
 I had a contact with him.      

252
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,005
You...                          
You calling on the spirits?     

253
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,840
             Shh.               

254
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,244
        - She's weird.          
        - She's creepy.         

255
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,148
    I... I ain't too sure       
    I wanna meet this Tony.     

256
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,949
             Shh!               

257
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,053
     Tony, where are you?       

258
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,557
     He's coming in again.      

259
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,996
    I can only see a light.     
    That's all.                 

260
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,133
    Now it's... Going black.    

261
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,669
 Now it's... Completely gone.   

262
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,071
     [machines beeping]         

263
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,673
                He's doing that?

264
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,643
He's projecting a magnetic field
through his reflexes            

265
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,945
As he struggles                 
to regain consciousness.        

266
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,547
His output is so great,         

267
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,783
That my machines aren't         
even capable of measuring it.   

268
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,253
             But he's dangerous.

269
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,122
Once I have control             
of his brain, Letha,            

270
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,591
He will only                    
be dangerous to others.         

271
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,830
I hope you realize that         
kidnapping's a criminal offense.

272
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:30,167
My experiments are more         
important than the law, Letha.  

273
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,771
With these receptors            
placed on certain people,       

274
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,073
Combined with                   
this boy's powers,              

275
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,743
I could become one of the most  
influential men in the world.   

276
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,647
         Oh, you are absolutely 
         brilliant, professor.  

277
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,317
             Now we can go ahead
             with my plans, too.

278
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,988
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.     

279
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,592
 A comment, perhaps, on you and 
 the life you've been leading.  

280
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,966
             Now, you look here,

281
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,569
    Doctor, professor,          
    physicist. Whatever you are.

282
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,740
     I built this laboratory    
     for you at great expense.  

283
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,510
     I used every penny I had.  

284
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:17,314
 Now, we've made a lot of plans 
 and I won't let you upset them.

285
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,950
        I want some money. Fast.

286
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,554
Letha, we are                   
worlds apart.                   

287
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,390
My mind is filled               
with large concepts.            

288
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,893
Mankind, the universe.          

289
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:33,230
You only worry about            
the horse that's                
running in the third race.      

290
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,633
            Sure, I gamble...   

291
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,868
     ...But with my own money.  

292
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,304
                You're the worst
                kind of gambler.

293
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,339
            You use             
            other people's money

294
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,675
     And want to keep all       
     the winnings for yourself. 

295
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,879
         Well, you can be sure  
         of one thing, Victor.  

296
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,583
     I'll be around to pick up  
     the chips with you.        

297
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,155
    - [wires pop and sizzle]    
    - [Tony moans]              

298
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,091
         [panting]              

299
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,361
         [grunting]             

300
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,705
    We'll be back in the morning
    with maps and breakfast.    

301
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,974
I'll bring an egg               
from my refrigerator.           

302
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,810
             And I'll bring some
             day-old bread.     

303
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,947
- I'll bring some milk for you. 
- Thank you.                    

304
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,383
 - You're good friends.         
 - That's the trouble with us.  

305
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:30,187
 We don't want to be good.      
 We want to be bad.             

306
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,555
             Yeah.              

307
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,858
 Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.   
 My mom's gonna yell at me.     

308
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,695
[crusher] see you tomorrow,     
Tia.                            

309
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,464
 [muscles] we'll find Tony      
 tomorrow for sure.             

310
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,871
 [Rocky] let's stay close       
 together on the way out, guys. 

311
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,045
            [sighs]             

312
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,569
                         Good.  

313
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,181
             This is            
             professor Gannon...

314
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:35,019
             ...Commanding you  
             to awaken.         

315
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,090
[indistinct shouting]           

316
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,525
                         Tony!  

317
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,001
 He's in some kind of a room.   

318
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,770
                Like a hospital.

319
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,973
     With machines              
     and instruments and things.

320
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,307
Oh, that's easy.                

321
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,410
All we have to do               
is check all the hospitals.     

322
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,112
     While we going around      
     looking for a fight.       

323
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,747
            Come on.            

324
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,192
 [victor] you will now function 
 exclusively under control.     

325
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,795
            You will no longer  
            think independently.

326
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,064
     All thinking and reasoning 
     will be done               

327
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,166
             By the voice       
             that commands you. 

328
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,201
             Do you understand? 

329
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,738
     - Yes.                     
     - What is your name?       

330
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,908
     - Tony.                    
     - Where are you from?      

331
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,576
Witch mountain.                 

332
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,179
        Sounds like             
        some hick town to me.   

333
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,884
         How did you suspend    
         Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 

334
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,352
     By energizing matter.      

335
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,723
Do you mean to say that         
you can control molecular flow? 

336
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,057
         Yes, sir.              

337
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,929
- How did you learn to do this? 
- I was born with the ability.  

338
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,433
 I wish to see a demonstration  
 of molecular flow.             

339
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,036
                You are strapped
                to the table.   

340
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,773
             Unbuckle yourself  
             and sit up.        

341
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,160
         Power has come         
         into our hands         

342
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,296
     Which is centuries         
     before its time.           

343
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,036
We must use it wisely.          

344
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,305
                Well, what can  
                you have him do?

345
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,609
     Other than go around making
     people's belts unbuckle.   

346
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,745
The possibilities are unlimited.

347
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,716
     Oh, come on. It's just     
     some gimmick, that's all.  

348
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,155
Tony...                         

349
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:58,128
         Mr. Sickle,            
         whose life you saved,  

350
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,031
             Doesn't seem       
             to believe in you. 

351
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,135
         Mr. Sickle             
         needs convincing, Tony.

352
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,871
[knob squeaks]                  

353
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,274
         [gas hissing]          

354
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,609
         Hey, come on.          

355
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,646
Hey, get back!                  

356
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,882
     Get back! Get back!        

357
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,517
Don't.                          

358
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,356
[grunting]                      
get back!                       

359
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,724
[goat bleats]                   

360
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,799
I can see how that'd be a big   
hit at a scientific convention. 

361
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,236
But the bottom line is,         
how do we make money with it?   

362
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,305
[goat bleats]                   

363
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,008
     I will demonstrate         
     an industrial application. 

364
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,478
Come with me, Tony.             

365
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,615
         [gas continues to hiss]

366
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:02,626
             Now, Tony,         
             those wine casks...

367
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,829
         Stack them... Neatly.  

368
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,021
            Two glasses         
            of burgundy, please.

369
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,324
                 To molecular   
                 mobilization.  

370
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,161
 To molecular capitalization.   

371
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,598
        - [goat bleats]         
        - [gas hisses]          

372
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,104
[muscles] hey,                  
got any more clues?             

373
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,205
             No.                

374
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,475
        Nothing at all.         
        It's so strange.        

375
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,212
 We've been to every hospital   
 and he's in none of them.      

376
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,281
             It's like          
             his mind's a blank.

377
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,650
He probably                     
conked out somewhere.           

378
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,486
 - Don't listen to him.         
 - We'll find Tony for sure.    

379
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,422
     Yeah, we'll turn           
     the town upside down.      

380
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,890
Yeah.                           

381
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:52,202
 - [sickle] what're you doing?  
 - [Letha] thinking.            

382
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,373
Thinking about us in            
a different place, such as...   

383
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,108
Las Vegas...                    

384
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,377
...With Tony.                   

385
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,481
             Seven or eleven    
             every time, right? 

386
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,284
A day at the races.             

387
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,486
             All the long shots  
             come in.           

388
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,190
[laughs] you do have            
an imagination, after all.      

389
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,994
The possibilities               
with Tony are unlimited.        

390
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:22,165
For example, he stacked the wine
casks by just looking at them.  

391
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:27,104
If he can stack them,           
he can unstack them.            

392
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,178
         The gold is on display 
         at the museum.         

393
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,549
    Protected by an impenetrable
    security system.            

394
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,119
             Just sitting there 
             waiting for us...  

395
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,488
             ...To penetrate it.

396
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,391
Wait a minute. Us?              

397
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,694
You mean Gannon said it's ok    
to use the control on Tony?     

398
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:55,298
 Professor Gannon is            
 extremely busy being a genius. 

399
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,567
 I own half the invention,      

400
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,704
 Half of Tony, that means       
 I own half of the profits.     

401
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:05,876
     So far, the return on      
     my investment has been     
     half of zero.              

402
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,446
What about security. We'd       
need an army to pull it off.    

403
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,848
     We'll have an army with us!

404
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,851
             Tony.              

405
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,822
         [chuckles]             

406
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,366
              <i>Tony?</i>             

407
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,102
              <i>Tony?</i>             

408
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:36,206
      <i>Tony, why can't I</i>         
    <i> </i> <i>get through to you?</i>       

409
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,076
              <i>Tony?</i>             

410
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,551
I'll pick up the new            
transistors, make a few stops.  

411
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,885
Be back later on.               

412
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,954
            [Letha] don't worry.

413
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,328
                 Everything's   
                 under control. 

414
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,882
            Tony.               
            This is Letha wedge,

415
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,885
             Commanding you     
             to open your eyes. 

416
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,222
                 Now, stand up. 

417
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,998
     We're going to the museum  
     for education and profit.  

418
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,540
        [brakes squeak]         

419
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,352
        Tony and I will do      
        a little... Sightseeing.

420
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,063
     [indistinct chatter]       

421
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,675
                     [Tia] wait.

422
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,914
     Gold! I see gold.          

423
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,916
        - Hey it's mine.        
        - Where is it?          

424
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,151
     - Hey, give it to me!      
     - No!                      

425
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,626
         A stagecoach.          

426
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,298
     She must be tuned in       
     on a western.              

427
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,632
                         Yeah.  

428
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,943
         I see dummies.         

429
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,544
     [both] that's you.         

430
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,646
        No. Old things.         

431
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,615
                     Clothing.  

432
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,618
             Hey, he's at       
             the salvation army.

433
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,555
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches
at the salvation army.          

434
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,457
            They don't got gold,
            neither.            

435
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,893
                Wait a minute,  
                wait a minute!  

436
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,495
         We had one of them     
         nothing school trips.  

437
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,397
                 To the museum. 

438
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,032
                 Yeah, they got 
                 a pile of gold.

439
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:19,736
And a stagecoach.               
They had to kick me out.        

440
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,304
     We've got to go there.     

441
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,273
                 Come on,       
                 it's over here.

442
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,981
        [kids grunting]

        [tires screech]         

445
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,419
Now, Tony.                      

446
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,989
We're going to create           
a little diversion.             

447
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,225
The stagecoach.                 

448
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:18,862
I want you to roll it           
all around the museum.          

449
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,004
[woman gasps]

                 [man] watch it.

452
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,647
[man] watch out for that thing, 
it's coming this way.           

453
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,357
Hey, where are                  
the horses?                     

454
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,126
                I... Don't know.

455
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,930
Now cause total chaos.          

456
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
                [man] watch out.

457
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,205
            [yelps]             

458
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,186
Short circuit                   
the control system.             

459
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,121
    [control system buzzes]

        [guard screams]         

462
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,349
            Oh, no.             

463
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,086
             Letha!             

464
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,055
             Letha!

[chortling]

         - [gasps]              
         - look out.            

468
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,433
        [man] get out of my way.

469
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,646
         [moaning]

         [guards yell]          

471
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,894
[man] can't you put             
that thing out?                 

472
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,030
Come on, take a shot.           
Move it.                        

473
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,717
Now, Tony,                      

474
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,921
Make a hole                     
in the plastic shield.          

475
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,191
And it doesn't have to be neat. 

476
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:23,740
Tony, unstack the gold bars     
and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 

477
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,183
 [man] move it buddy, move it.  
 We gotta get out of here!      

478
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,322
Las Vegas,                      
here we come.                   

479
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,306
             Oh!                

480
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,479
     - Look.                    
     - [bars thudding]          

481
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,857
                     Come on,   
                     follow me. 

482
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,160
Tony, make them                 
go faster.                      

483
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,297
     [woman] watch out!         

484
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,578
    Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!     

485

        Look out, lady.         

488
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,637
Yeah, why don't you watch where 
you're going, you big dummy.

     [man] look out, Eddie!     

491
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,990
[Letha] Tony, what's happening? 

492
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,092
[Tony] molecular flow reversing.

493
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,429
     - Are you doing this?      
     - No.                      

494
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,197
Then who is?                    

495
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,267
             It would have to be
             one of my people.  

496
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,770
 - There are more like you?     
 - Yes.                         

497
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,640
 - Oh! Let's get out of here.   
 - [Tia] Tony!                  

498
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,208
             Tony!              

499
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,010
Who's that?                     

500
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,549
                 It's my sister.

501
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,951
                 My sister, Tia.

502
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,854
This is no time

         [victor] you fool!     
         How could you do this? 

507
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,629

        - I don't know.         

510
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,546
 I keep it running perfect.     

511
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,317
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is.        

512
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,891
     Tony, I command you to     
     make this car run perfectly

513
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:05,261
 And continuously without       
 interference from your sister.

        [engine starts]         

515
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,773
     I can't stop the car.      
     Tony's energizing it.      

516
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,776
         It's like your brother 
         doesn't even know you. 

517
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:27,817
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! 
- No. Don't run.                

518
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:31,454
     You crazy? You don't want  
     to go to that school.      

519
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,423
     Please, trust me.          
     Now, come on, hurry.       

520
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,760
 [Rocky] hey, wait for me.      

521
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,029
 [dazzler] come on, you guys.   
 Get in there.                  

522
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,765
     - Let's go!                
     - Come on, get in.         

523
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,302
        - [door shuts]          
        - I'm dreaming.         

524
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,038
 You're surrendering            
 to the board of education?     

525
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,340
Sir, you see that car           
going down the street?          

526
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,943
     - Yeah.                    
     - My brother's in it.      

527
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:57,246
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 

528
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,117
    Another truant? Oh, boy,    
    we're gonna have a load.    

529
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,198
     - Hey, what happened?      
     - Good driving, yo-yo.     

530
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,200
Yeah, that was neat.            

531
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,904
             [laughs] this bus  
             can really move.   

532
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,942
             Tony, look         
             through the window.

533
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,677
                The rear window.

534
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,547
                That minibus    
                is following us.

535
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,583
         I command you to place 
         obstacles in its path. 

536

         [tires squeal]         

537
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:28,271
     City property.             
     I've damaged city property.

these glasses were shatterproof.

540
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,260
 Was that a bus or a bridge?    

541
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,334
         They're still with us. 

542
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,569
        Tony, you must stop her.

543
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,816
Man, that man was               
really buzzing.                 

544
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,451
     Am I still alive?          

545
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,355
        [tires screech]         

546
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,261
         They're gaining on us. 

547
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,797
     She counteracts            
     everything that Tony does. 

548
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,167
                Tony, you've    
                got to stop her.

549
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,886
                        We flew!

550
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,888
        [boys cheering]         

551
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,794
             They must've flown.

552
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,365
Don't you                       
dare try it.                    

553
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,302
     Sickle... Sickle, stop...  
     Stop over that hill.       

554
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,876
 Tony, cause the reflection     
 of the sun on the rear window  

555
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,112
             To magnify and     
             shine so brightly  

556
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,814
            That our pursuers'll
            be blinded by it.

     [crusher] I can't see.     

561
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,527
- [Tia] yeah.                   
- [muscles] come on, let me out.

562
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,931
    - Everybody ok?             
    - [all kids] yeah, sure.    

563
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,369
        Oh, look what's happened
        to city property.       

564
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,372
No... But I'm still             
gonna take you to school.       

565
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,542
     - Just soon as I...        
     - Come on.                 

566
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,844
     [siren approaching]

You jeopardized my life's work.

00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,933
My accountants'

569
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,569
         You've proved yourself 
         incompetent yet again. 

570
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,904
        I don't even know if    
        I can trust you anymore.

571
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,407
You don't trust me?             

572
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,741
I trusted you enough            

573
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,011
To make my credit rating        
look like Swiss cheese.         

574
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,048
Don't tell me                   
you don't trust me.             

575
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,850
We have to                      
trust each other.               

576
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,385
     Right.                     
     I trust everybody.         

577
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,389
             Yes...             
             Well, fortunately, 

578
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,326
         I thought of something 
         very spectacular       

579
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:15,164
 Which will satisfy both of us  
 in terms of prestige and money.

580
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:19,034
Well, you have the prestige,    
I'll take the money.            

581
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:23,139
But, before we celebrate        
your return to sanity,          

582
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,342
We'd better do something        
about Tony's sister.            

583
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,678
     How did she know           
     we were at the museum?     

584
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,284
                I...            
                I'm not certain.

586
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,862
How did your sister know        
that we were at the museum?

588
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,835
            She'll show up again
            and ruin everything.

589
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:58,240
In that case, she will          
have to be, as you would say...

01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,673
         Get me down.           

855
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,950
 Thank you, thank you.          
 Now, where are you going?      

856
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,785
                     In there.  

857
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,556
Oh, no. You can't go            
beyond this point without ids.  

858
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:26,180
 - [footsteps approaching]      
 - [Tia] Tony!                  

859
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,719
         - Tia!                 
         - I knew it.           

860
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:35,856
 She'll spoil everything.       
 I can just taste that money.   

861
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,359
     We cannot let her          
     take it away from us.      

862
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,728
                         Tony!  

863
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:46,834
 Tony, from this moment         
 you will no longer hear Tia.   

864
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:50,304
    She cannot break through    
    my power of control.        

865
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:53,240
 - Acknowledge.                 
 - <i>[Tia] Tony, what's wrong?</i>

     - Yes, sir.                
     - Get those kids.          

871
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,292
        She'll use some of those
        molecules on us.        

872
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,795
I'll take care of her before    
she gets a Chance, you get them.

873
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,865
 [Tia] I can't get through.

01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,001
     I don't know what          
     they've done to his mind.  

875
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,737
 We've got to find the emergency
 cooling system ourselves.      

876
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,739
 How do you spell cooling?      

877
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,240
                        Come on.

878
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,251
     - [Tia] uh-oh.             
     - [muscles] whoa.

    the emergency switches.     

882
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,534
    You two go that way,        
    and you two go that way.    

883
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:46,087
                 Tony, we must  
                 eliminate Tia. 

884
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,322
[footsteps approach]            

885
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:54,628
 You will cause that portable   
 utility panel to run her down. 

886
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:28,462
     - Hey, Tia, come here.     
     - [machines whirring]

888
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,235
     That ain't it, right?      

889
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,040
     - [Tia] you found it!      
     - I knew it was it!        

890
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,275
     But, it's spelt wrong.     

891

         The rest of the money's
         just arrived.          

895
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,292
         All right.             

896
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,896
    I'd better call Gannon.     

897
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,500
The cooling system's on.        

898
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,307
         Switch it off.

            Gotcha!             

904
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:50,104
    Tony, you must stop her.    

905
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:14,194
             Tony, why are you  
             doing these things?

906
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:17,064
    Why are you using           
    your powers against me?     

907
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,433
                What's happened?

     Lure her to the            
     center of the room and...

01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:49,263
             ...Make that crane 
             drop on her.

01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,288
 I'm starting to remember.      

914
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,757
                What was the    
                matter with you?

915
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:19,460
I don't know, exactly... But... 

916

     Don't go any closer.       

918
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,702
     Why? What is it, Tony?     

919
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:41,615
         Tony, stop it!         
         Stop it, Tony, stop it!

920
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,451
Exert a force                   
greater than hers.              

921
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,187
 Why are you doing this, Tony?  
 Stop.

     Tony, we can still do it.  

933
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,779
         We can still make use  
         of molecular control.

01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,237
You will go back to school,     
won't you?                      

976
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,244
         Well, if we was        
         to go back to school,  

977
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:46,446
         Could we get as smart  
         as Tia and Tony?       

978
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:49,316
     - Maybe even smarter.      
     - Yeah, sure.              

979
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,720
Let's give it a shot.           

980
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,056
             Great.             

981
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:57,357
 I hope the school can take it. 

982
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:01,261
     - Goodbye, yo-yo.          
     - Goodbye.                 

983
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,299
- [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. 
- You promised.                 

984
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,577
     Tia, open the gate.        

985
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:19,980
 No, everybody join hands.      

986
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,853
            - Whoa.             
            - Wow.              

987
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:29,156
         [boys] cool!           

988
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,759
[muscles] all right!            

989
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:42,669
Wow! Flying saucer!             

990
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:49,543
Will we ever                    
see you again?                  

991
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,146
                 Well, it's...  

992
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,248
                    It's kind of
                    hard to say.

993
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:56,850
Thanks for everything.          

994
01:30:56,951 --> 01:31:00,187
     And especially for         
     letting me be in your gang.

995
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,155
Take care of Alfred             
for me, ok?                     

996
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:12,766
         [all laugh]            

997
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:14,734
There you are.                  

998
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,973
    - Where's your luggage?     
    - Uh, we lost it.           

999
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:22,742
                 There were     
                 a few problems.

1000
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:25,879
    - But you did have fun?     
    - Oh, terrible.             

1001
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,715
I just knew we                  
should have gone surfing.       

1002
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,826
     [mechanical whirring]      

1003
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:45,866
         [all] wow.             

1004
01:31:56,711 --> 01:32:00,013
Hey. Let's do it the way        
Tia and Tony taught us.         

1005
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,114
         [all] yeah.            

1006
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,817
    - Ready?                    
    - [all] one, two, three!    

1007
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,852
         [all grunt]            

1008
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,104
         - Hey, yo-yo!          
         - Yo-yo!               

1009
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,673
         [panting] guess what!  

1010
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:29,643
     Tia and Tony just drove off
     in a flying saucer.        

1011
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:32,479
        - Flying saucer?        
        - Whoosh!               

1012
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,748
Whoosh?                         

1013
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:38,351
How about whooshing             
yourself into the bus?          

1014
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,153
                 But, it's true.

1015
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:43,390
    Lookit, I saw those two kids
    do miraculous things.       

1016
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:47,761
I believe anything and          
everything, except that. Get in.

1017
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:51,431
     I hope this school teaches 
     about flying saucers.      

1018
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:53,300
Yeah.                           

1019
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,170
                Flying saucers. 
                [laughs]        

1020
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,452
[engine starts]                 

1021
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,032
