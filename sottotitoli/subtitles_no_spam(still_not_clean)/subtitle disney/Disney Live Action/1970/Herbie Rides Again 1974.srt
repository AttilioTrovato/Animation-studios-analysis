1
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,308
Umph.

2
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,041
What a location.

3
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,440
Ah, Si. The mighty Coliseum.
The glory of Rome.

4
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,718
Doesn't it stir your imagination?

5
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:47,718
You bet it does, baby.
Do you people realise

6
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:50,237
what a shopping centre
we could put up there?

7
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,556
Plenty of parking too.

8
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:06,792
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:09,472
the world's highest
office building.

10
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:14,031
Hawk Plaza... 130 stories
of man-made glory.

11
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:17,150
In just a few hours,
Hawk Enterprises

12
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:19,829
will break ground on
this incredible project.

13
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,349
How did it happen,
you ask? I give you

14
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,628
now the man that made
it all possible.

15
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,386
Thank you, friends. Thank you.

16
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,144
My heart is too full to speak.

17
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,143
Ah, you see.

18
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,622
You've brought a tear to
this flinty, old eye.

19
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:51,262
So, all I can say is thank you.

20
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:56,500
Thank you for allowing me to share
a moment of your precious time.

21
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,699
Get those deadheads out of here.

22
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,859
What, are they gonna stand around
all day and drink my booze?

23
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,018
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, down to my office...

24
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,417
where a scroll awaits you.

25
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:09,937
Hello.

26
00:04:09,977 --> 00:04:11,936
Mr. Barnsdorf, sir.

27
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,376
Hello, Barnsdorf.

28
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,655
When are you going to be ready
for us to start digging?

29
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,575
What are you talking about?

30
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,655
That building site's
as clean as a...

31
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,013
What's that?

32
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,914
I thought we got
rid of that crummy

33
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,412
little firehouse months ago.

34
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,725
There's just one
hold-up. We couldn't get

35
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,612
old lady Steinmetz
to sign the papers.

36
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,331
Just one, beat-up old
lady makes monkeys

37
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,770
out of the most overpaid
lawyers in the country.

38
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,712
Come on, boys. I expect a little

39
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,969
action, and I better
get it or else.

40
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,288
For some reason, she
doesn't seem to trust us.

41
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:48,727
Of course she doesn't. Have
you looked at yourselves?

42
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:51,487
Your own mothers
wouldn't trust ya.

43
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:56,205
What we need is somebody
so nauseatingly innocent,

44
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,124
and so stomach-turningly helpful

45
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,285
and so incredibly dumb
anybody would trust him.

46
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,124
What is it?

47
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:03,684
Mr. Willoughby
Whitfield to see you.

48
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,244
He says he's your nephew.

49
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,482
Whoever he is, throw him out.

50
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,962
Don't bother me again.

51
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:12,041
Say, wait a minute.

52
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:15,641
Is that that dumb-looking kid
of my sister's from back east?

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,760
He was going to law
school or something?

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,959
He just finished law school. He
says he's a full-fledged lawyer.

55
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,318
He's a full-fledged
lawyer. Send him in.

56
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,678
Mr. Hawk will see you now.

57
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:29,796
Oh.

58
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:32,316
Thank you.

59
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:37,115
Come in, boy. Come in.

60
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,473
Isn't he beautiful?

61
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,392
Uncle Alonzo, I hereby present you

62
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:56,190
with the first law college
Humanitarian-of-the-Year Award.

63
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,390
Here.

64
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,670
Oh, well, well.
Humanitarian of the Year?

65
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:00,709
That's right, Uncle.

66
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,374
Award committees give
out humanitarian

67
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,628
awards to a lot of strange ducks,

68
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,748
but why me?

69
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,028
I was the award committee.

70
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,106
You put in the fix.

71
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,226
You figured to take care
of your Uncle Alonzo.

72
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,546
You're a smart boy.

73
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,146
If there's one thing I admire,

74
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:18,105
it's somebody who knows how
to use juice properly.

75
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,225
Juice?

76
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,824
Yes, juice. How to use
muscle, influence,

77
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,103
how to bend things his own way.

78
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,343
Oh, no. My goodness, no.

79
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,662
It wasn't done dishonestly.
I thought it over,

80
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:33,421
and I couldn't think of anyone
any more deserving than you.

81
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,060
How come?

82
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,620
From the day I was born, my
mother never tired of telling me

83
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,939
what a great man her brother was,

84
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,539
getting rid of dirty old buildings
and building shiny new ones,

85
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,577
sending us California fruit at
Christmas. You were her idol.

86
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,456
You clowns get out of here.

87
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:54,736
I'm trying to have a nice talk
with my favourite nephew.

88
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,775
When I look into your eyes

89
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:01,254
and see the shining light
of idealism aglow there,

90
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,453
it makes me young again
and ready for battle.

91
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,533
Battle?

92
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,813
Yes, battle.

93
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,731
It has never been easy
for us idealists.

94
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:13,049
Now, I'm going to
give you a chance

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,010
to put that idealism into play

96
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,930
on your very first job.

97
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,610
Oh.

98
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,048
Picture if you will, a
tough, little old lady,

99
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,767
living in a rundown,
rat-infested firehouse,

100
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:30,206
standing right in the way of
our latest civic benefaction.

101
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,845
There may be city builders who
might find it in their heart

102
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,765
to be vindictive to this old lady.

103
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,964
They might say that

104
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,246
she feeds on the
misery of the poor

105
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,203
in that forsaken neighbourhood,

106
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:48,362
that she rolls drunks, that she
teaches small children to steal

107
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:52,161
and make them bring most
of the take to her.

108
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:56,760
Would I, Alonzo Hawk,
Humanitarian of the Year,

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,879
stoop to such tactics?

110
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,719
On the contrary.

111
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,039
I would do everything in my power

112
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:06,557
to help that tough,
no-good, little old lady.

113
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:09,437
I would give her a large sum
for that worthless property,

114
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,636
and I would provide a
special price to her alone

115
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,995
a lifetime lease in
Eternity Towers,

116
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,517
that beautiful new haven for

117
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:19,474
helpless old people
such as herself.

118
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,194
It has a gymnasium, a sauna,

119
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:25,913
an old Rudolph Valentino
Sessue Hayakawa movie.

120
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:28,392
It has a beauty
parlour, hobby centre,

121
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:32,151
and instead of cooking her
heart out over a hot stove,

122
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,190
there would be automatic
machines in every hall

123
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,629
to lavish her with everything
from pizza to hot chilli.

124
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,215
Now wouldn't it make
just your whole

125
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:44,148
being happy to be
part of all that?

126
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:45,428
When can I start, Uncle?

127
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,908
Here's the address. Get moving.

128
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,301
- Here.
- Thanks, pal.

129
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,980
Ah, isn't it breathtaking?

130
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,020
It's a mess, all right.

131
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,099
That guy, Hawk, oughta be hung.

132
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,339
What?

133
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,538
I'm coming.

134
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:34,535
Mrs. Steinmetz? Good morning. My
name is Willoughby Whitfield.

135
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,335
I'd like to discuss
business with you.

136
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:37,415
Come in, won't you?

137
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,455
I can't.

138
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,454
You see this car has
rolled onto my foot.

139
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,253
Oh, dear.

140
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,893
I guess somebody forgot to
set the brake or something.

141
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:47,372
Herbie, aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

142
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,732
Get off Mr. Whitfield's foot.

143
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,651
Herbie's always
trying to protect me.

144
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,731
Herbie?

145
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,810
I'm quite capable of
taking care of myself.

146
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,090
I was about to make
a nice cup of tea.

147
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,289
Come in. You must
have one with me.

148
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,329
Oh, thank you.

149
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,208
Of course, I have
to humour Herbie.

150
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,687
He used to be a famous racing car,

151
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,407
but his driver went to Europe
to drive foreign cars,

152
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,166
so he's a little sensitive.
You can understand that.

153
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,885
Yes. Now, to get down to
business, Mrs. Steinmetz.

154
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,525
People have been worrying about
you living in this old firetrap.

155
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,204
I've been asked to
come over and...

156
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:22,843
Firehouse, not firetrap.

157
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,402
Firehouse, yes. Be that as it may,

158
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:26,802
the least we can do...

159
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,801
Stop that. That's downright rude.

160
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:35,960
Do you know what he was playing?

161
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,799
Do Not Trust Him, Gentle
Maiden. Nothing personal.

162
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,879
No.

163
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,519
He's a friend of
Herbie's, of course.

164
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:43,718
Friend of Herbie's?

165
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:45,678
So is old 22.

166
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:50,076
You may as well meet all the
family while you're here.

167
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:53,076
Number 22 used to be on
the old Clay Street line.

168
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,715
Herbie found him in a vacant lot.

169
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,794
Someone had used him
as a chicken house.

170
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,714
He's much happier here, of course.

171
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,712
I can understand that you may have

172
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,792
some emotional attachment
to this old building...

173
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,551
Indeed, I have.

174
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,710
I was married here
to my late husband,

175
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,358
Captain Steinmetz, of the San
Francisco Fire Department.

176
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,359
Oh?

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,109
One of the heroes
of the great fire.

178
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,375
We understand your
position. That's

179
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,188
why Mr. Hawk has authorised...

180
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,947
Don't tell me you're
from Alonzo Hawk?

181
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,028
Yes.

182
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,187
Oh, you have such a nice face.

183
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,268
Thank you.

184
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,706
Not at all like those
ruffians he usually sends.

185
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:34,665
If you would just look at
the size of this check.

186
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,305
I don't know anything about money.

187
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:40,823
My nephew, Tennessee Steinmetz,
usually takes care of me.

188
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:42,263
He used to live here.

189
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:45,703
He had to rush off to Tibet
because his guru got sick.

190
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:48,822
If you would just look at
this... What's a guru?

191
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:53,020
His teacher. My nephew is a
student of Oriental Philosophy.

192
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,380
That's how he learned that
things have an inner life.

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,739
Like wind, rain, traffic lights,
can openers, flowers...

194
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,658
And little cars.

195
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,657
That's how Herbie and Tennessee
became such great friends.

196
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:07,507
Mrs. Steinmetz, this
sum of money could

197
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,496
take care of you for
the rest of your life.

198
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:13,175
I didn't have to study Oriental
Philosophy the way Tennessee did.

199
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,815
I could talk to Herbie right off.

200
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:15,855
Oh?

201
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,215
I guess it's in the blood.

202
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,133
See ya tomorrow.

203
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:26,812
I don't like to press,
but believe me,

204
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,732
Mr. Hawk has your
interest at heart.

205
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:30,891
I have an agreement here.
If you would just glance...

206
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,411
Oh, Nicole.

207
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,010
I want you to meet a
gentleman from Mr. Hawk's.

208
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,290
- How do you do?
- Agh.

209
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,288
Poor Mr. Whitfield.
Such a nice young man.

210
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,687
They're bothering us again?

211
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,127
You've hurt your hand.

212
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:51,566
On the contrary, it
feels marvellous.

213
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,765
Are you all right, Mr. Whitfield?

214
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,205
What was that?

215
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:59,364
Nicole Harris, a very brave young
lady. She works for the airline.

216
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,465
Last week she knocked
out a hijacker

217
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,323
with a bottle of California wine.

218
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:06,322
Now, get out. If you or any more
of Hawk's stooges come around,

219
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,922
you'll get worse than that.

220
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:12,041
Please. Mr. Whitfield and I were
having a nice conversation.

221
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,320
I'll bet. But...

222
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,159
Isn't it time for your nap?
Mr. Whitfield is just going.

223
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,238
Well, very well.
Goodbye, Mr. Whitfield.

224
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,917
I hope I'll see you
again when I come down.

225
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:25,037
Mrs. Steinmetz...

226
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:26,397
- Out. Out.
- What?

227
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,524
Please, have a heart.
This is my first

228
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,156
assignment. I can't
afford to fail.

229
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:34,115
I said, out.

230
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,515
All right, all right.

231
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,992
Miss, you look like
a sensible person.

232
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,991
You must know living all alone
in this crummy neighbourhood

233
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:51,630
is no place for an elderly woman.

234
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,670
What do you mean
"alone"? She's got me...

235
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,269
And she's got Herbie.

236
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,630
That's another thing.

237
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,518
That goofy story about this car,

238
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,828
that's a sure sign
she's coming apart.

239
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,547
So you think it's goofy?

240
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:04,748
Of course, don't you?

241
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,506
How would you like to
go for a little ride?

242
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:11,986
I thought you didn't like me?

243
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:16,184
I'd like to take you for a ride in
Herbie. I'd like that very much.

244
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,664
That's very nice of you.

245
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:20,023
I'll be ready in a minute.

246
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,779
All right, Herbie.
Let's get going.

247
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:40,618
Miss Harris, you're obviously
an intelligent young woman.

248
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,818
Why do you pretend to talk to
this car? People might wonder.

249
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,017
Don't listen to him,
Herbie. Just move it.

250
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,897
I can understand Mrs. Steinmetz
thinking of this car as a person.

251
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,685
Old age has many
fantasies. It only

252
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,535
proves that she needs
Mr. Hawk's help.

253
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,975
Remember, Alonzo Hawk sent him.

254
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:56,855
You and I know better, don't we?

255
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,454
You stubborn bucket of bolts.

256
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:01,333
You always have to do
everything your way.

257
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,773
Let's stop kidding ourselves. This
is just an ordinary little car,

258
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,892
like a million other ordinary,
rather unattractive... Whoa.

259
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,611
I don't think you
should have said that.

260
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,291
Herbie's very sensitive
about his appearance.

261
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,770
All right, you've had your
laugh. You ought to stop now.

262
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,489
You won't get Herbie to stop
until you say you're sorry.

263
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,595
The thing that upsets
me most about this

264
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,768
thing is you trying to
maintain the fiction

265
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,847
about this... Whoa.

266
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,286
Please, tell Herbie you're sorry.

267
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,406
All right.

268
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,045
Herbie, I'm sorry.

269
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,005
What do you think now?

270
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,364
I think you're a skilful driver,

271
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:41,163
but I don't know if I'd like
to have you drive me again.

272
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,323
You think it's a trick?

273
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,243
Yes. I would say the
whole thing is a trick.

274
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,162
Would you like to drive?

275
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,362
Yes.

276
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:49,561
Good.

277
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,557
There, you see,

278
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:11,956
this car is just your ordinary,
rather stupid-looking... Whoa.

279
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:14,595
What do I do now?

280
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,115
It's too late now.
You're on your own.

281
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:18,873
I just hope Herbie hasn't
lost his sense of humour.

282
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:38,908
"Chicken tournament
jousting today."

283
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,228
What? What's it up to now?

284
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,948
I don't know. It's hard to
figure Herbie out sometimes.

285
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,587
The gallant and
chivalrous contenders

286
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,666
are now taking their places
on the field of honour.

287
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:53,745
At the north end of the list,

288
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:56,184
the undefeated champion
of the tournament,

289
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,344
earless, brutal, unforgiving,

290
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,384
the Red Knight.

291
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:06,902
Yeah.

292
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,420
At the south end, his
stout-hearted adversary,

293
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:13,540
the ever-popular Sir Lancelot.

294
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,118
I don't know what
Herbie's up to, but

295
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,498
I hope it's not
what I think it is.

296
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,018
Let the joust begin.

297
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,018
Give the signal, Your Majesty.

298
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,489
What are they doing?
Seems dangerous to me.

299
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,209
Hey, what are they doing?

300
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,208
I think this is where I get out.

301
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,848
Good idea. I'll join you.

302
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:08,407
The victor, thus far, has
demolished all who oppose him.

303
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:12,325
The surviving champion,
your favourite and mine,

304
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,245
the Red Knight.

305
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,283
At the other end,

306
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,483
we have a mysterious
new contender,

307
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,082
but the name doesn't matter.

308
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:28,961
No one lasts for long
against the Red Knight.

309
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
Let the joust begin.

310
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,679
No, Herbie. Wait.

311
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:42,557
I take everything back.

312
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,837
I apologise. I believe, Herbie.

313
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:46,717
I believe.

314
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:11,471
My brave champion,
you have won me.

315
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,590
Take me to your kingdom.

316
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,389
You win the bread, man. $3.

317
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:27,026
I'm beginning to think
that I owe you an apology.

318
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,986
Oh, no, I can't stand
men who apologise.

319
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,545
Oh, well, may I take you to lunch?

320
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,425
All right.

321
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:47,069
I used to live in a
little apartment

322
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,181
building opposite the firehouse.

323
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:51,980
I loved it. Then Alonzo Hawk came
along to tear the place down.

324
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,180
And kicked me out.

325
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,740
I'm sure he didn't
mean it personally.

326
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,500
Now you know why I
go crazy every time

327
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,139
I hear the name Hawk.
How's your jaw?

328
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,498
It's all right. It's... Ooh.

329
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:04,777
I'm sorry. How was I supposed to
know it was your first assignment?

330
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:07,056
You couldn't possibly know
what a no-good he is.

331
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,772
Miss, there's something
I should tell you...

332
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,671
Anyway, Mrs. Steinmetz
took me in until

333
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:12,471
I could find another
place to live.

334
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,774
When I found out what Hawk was up
to, I stayed on to protect her.

335
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,383
I wasn't gonna let
rats from Alonzo

336
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,734
Hawk talk her out of her home.

337
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,493
I don't think you're
being quite fair.

338
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,212
Fair? To Alonzo Hawk?

339
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:24,293
Yes.

340
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,771
Don't tell me he's conned you the
way he's conned everybody else.

341
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,972
I think I should tell you that...

342
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,811
Did you know...

343
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,551
He put a parking garage
on the lot where

344
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:33,170
the DiMaggios learned
to play baseball?

345
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,250
Please, I...

346
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,129
His factories are polluting
all the fish in the Bay.

347
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,210
Look, you...

348
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,089
His skyscraper casts
a cold, grey shadow

349
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:41,208
on the children's
playground all day long.

350
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:42,248
Let me tell you...

351
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,807
He kicked 30 old-time
Chinese families

352
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,686
off Grand Avenue to make
room for his skyscraper.

353
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:47,926
Please, Miss Harris.

354
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,126
I can't believe Uncle Alonzo
would do things like that.

355
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,405
Wait a minute. Uncle.

356
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:54,725
He's your uncle?

357
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:55,805
Yes...

358
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,284
You rotten spy.

359
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,882
Here's your warm milk, Grandma.

360
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:10,080
Be sure and drink it. You
know how good it is for you.

361
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes, dear. I still
can't understand

362
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,879
why you hit him with
a boiled lobster.

363
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,878
Grandma, I wish I could stop
doing things like that.

364
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,958
I really sort of like him.

365
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,997
I'm glad to hear that.

366
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,276
After all, brilliant, eligible
lawyers don't grow on trees.

367
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:31,195
What are you leading up to?

368
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:33,715
Nothing, dear.

369
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:37,303
I just thought that
perhaps you could talk

370
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:39,833
things over with that
nice Mr. Whitfield.

371
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:41,713
Nice try, Grandma.

372
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:44,872
But if I want a young man,
I'll have to get him my way.

373
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,952
I suppose so, dear.

374
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:50,030
Stop hatching plots
and go to sleep.

375
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,510
Yes, dear.

376
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,629
Good night, Grandma.

377
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,869
Good night, dear.

378
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,387
Good night, Herbie.
Pleasant dreams.

379
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:13,584
He used to be a famous racing car.

380
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:16,144
He used to be a famous racing car.

381
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:20,343
He used to be a famous racing car.

382
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:25,191
Uncle Alonzo,

383
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:28,231
I dropped by to talk
to you man-to-man,

384
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:31,030
so I could look you
squarely in the eye.

385
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,669
No, I'm wearing make-up
because of a black eye.

386
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:38,908
A girl hit me in the face
with a boiled lobster

387
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:41,628
the moment I mentioned your name.

388
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:45,187
This same wonderful, intelligent,

389
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,426
clear-sighted girl

390
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:51,465
was able to convince me what
kind of a person you really are.

391
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:53,843
I do not hold with your scheme of

392
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:55,903
cheating Mrs. Steinmetz
out of her home

393
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:59,183
so that you may build
your concrete anthill

394
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:02,702
on the spot where she has
known so much happiness.

395
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,221
I think you are despicable,

396
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,060
greedy, grasping

397
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,899
and wholly without
principle or pity.

398
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,539
I also believe you are
not a nice person.

399
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:19,617
If you write my mother, who
is also your sister, Frieda,

400
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,777
please do not tell her that I
wear make-up as a general rule.

401
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,256
I'm going back to Missouri now,

402
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:30,735
so you may no longer
use me as a cat's paw.

403
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:34,814
I bid you farewell, more
in sorrow than in anger.

404
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:37,613
Please do not send us any
more fruit for Christmas.

405
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:49,491
Goodbye, Grandma.

406
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:56,088
Hi, everybody.

407
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,765
Hi, Herb.

408
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:13,004
No hard feelings, okay?

409
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:18,443
I'm so glad you and Herbie
decided to make up.

410
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,563
Oh.

411
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,843
I'm just going for
my morning walk.

412
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:24,162
Come with me. We could
have a nice chat.

413
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:28,040
I just came to say goodbye. I'm
going home to Hawk City, Missouri.

414
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:33,159
Oh, what a pity. Nicole was
hoping to see you again.

415
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,234
She's a wonderful
girl, even though

416
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,118
you don't seem to agree with her.

417
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:39,118
I do agree with her now.

418
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,397
As a matter of fact, I'm
going straight to my uncle

419
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,237
to tell him exactly
what I think of him.

420
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:44,597
That's splendid.

421
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:46,396
He might be an
important man but it's

422
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,036
time somebody told
him the real truth.

423
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:51,515
Nicole will be thrilled. Please
wait 'til she comes back.

424
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:55,394
To be honest, I'm more afraid
of her than I am of my uncle.

425
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:58,833
Nonsense. Nicole is just a
high-spirited young lady.

426
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:02,152
Oh, that's for sure.
Goodbye, Mrs. Steinmetz.

427
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,432
Don't weaken about the firehouse.

428
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:05,111
Don't you worry.

429
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,351
Call my nephew
wherever he's staying

430
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:08,751
and tell him to get
right over here.

431
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,870
Yes, sir. And Mr. Barnsdorf
is on the phone for you.

432
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:14,269
Yeah, what do you want?

433
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,948
You ready for us to dig yet?
My boys are getting itchy.

434
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,908
I'll tell you when
to start digging.

435
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:23,426
Thought I'd remind you I got some
high-priced digging equipment

436
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:25,307
and crew sitting around
playing gin rummy,

437
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:27,506
waiting for you to
make up your mind.

438
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,465
It's costing you 80 grand a day.

439
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,545
Stop bugging me, Barnsdorf.

440
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,903
I'll give you the order to
start digging any moment now.

441
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:39,062
What do you want?

442
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:42,142
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawk. I called the
motel but your nephew checked out.

443
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,502
What do you mean he's checked out?

444
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,341
When? Where? Who told
him he could check out?

445
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,539
How dare he disappear when
he knows I'm worried sick.

446
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,419
I'll tear his chicken-livered
gizzard to pieces.

447
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,818
I'll stomp him silly. I'll
take this letter knife

448
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:00,378
and I'll stab that kid in
his ungrateful breastbone.

449
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:05,536
You know me, Millicent.
Normally I'm a kindly fellow.

450
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:08,656
But when I get
crossed, I go bananas.

451
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,374
Yes? Oh.

452
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,174
It's your nephew.

453
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:15,334
Willoughby?

454
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,133
Where are you?

455
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:18,733
Oh, hi, Uncle.

456
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,772
I thought I'd save time
and phone you the news.

457
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,252
That's marvellous, great.
You're a smart boy.

458
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,251
That Hawk blood will
tell in the end.

459
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,929
All ashore that's going ashore.

460
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:42,607
What's all that
noise? And what news?

461
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,526
The news I was leaving town.

462
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,526
Leaving town?

463
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:51,125
I'm on the ship-to-shore phone...

464
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:57,643
From the deck of the Swedish
freighter, the Gustav Gustaffson,

465
00:28:57,723 --> 00:28:58,963
bound for Helsinki.

466
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,323
Helsinki.

467
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:03,042
I'm glad you're taking
it like this, Uncle.

468
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,921
You know, you really should
leave Mrs. Steinmetz alone.

469
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,759
Haaa.

470
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:25,116
Don't worry. You'll feel
better in the morning.

471
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:28,795
Stop talking like an idiot.
I feel better right now.

472
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:32,275
Alonzo Hawk may be betrayed,
but he is never defeated.

473
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,074
Outta my Way.

474
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,953
Since none of you pitiful excuses
for men have enough muscle

475
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,633
to move a feeble old
lady off her property,

476
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:42,432
I'll go and do it myself,
like I have to do

477
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,072
everything around here
that's important.

478
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,151
- Now, Mr. Hawk.
- Oh, shut up.

479
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,790
We'll start on number
one, harassment.

480
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,989
And I wrote the
book on harassment.

481
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,349
We'll shut off her phone,
turn off her water.

482
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:56,068
We'll sic the health and
building inspectors on her.

483
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,148
Steal her dog.

484
00:29:58,468 --> 00:29:59,588
She doesn't have a dog.

485
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:04,146
What do you mean? A little old
lady living in a place like that?

486
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:06,346
Who looks out for her?
How does she get around?

487
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,785
She has a little car she
goes everywhere in.

488
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,025
You fellows go and pick it up.

489
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:12,264
Yes, Mr. Hawk.

490
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:15,064
A bunch of lamebrains.
Hold it, hold it.

491
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,337
You fellows'll
probably even foul up

492
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:19,023
on a simple assignment like this.

493
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:23,382
The first team is on the job.
I'll go pick the car up myself.

494
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:28,540
Overeducated pinheads.

495
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,266
All right, gentlemen, start taking

496
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,339
notes. Learn how the
grown-ups do it.

497
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,498
You gentlemen are
probably unaware of it,

498
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:41,377
but I began my fabulous career
as a repossessor of motorcars.

499
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:43,457
At the tender age of 19,

500
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:47,976
I was the best-known repossessor
of cars west of the Mississippi.

501
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,294
Hot-wire Hawk, they called
me. Observe, gentlemen.

502
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:54,054
Screwdriver, pliers

503
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:56,334
and a piece of wire.

504
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,373
Check your watches,

505
00:30:58,453 --> 00:30:59,936
and you will see
that I will return

506
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:01,172
with the object of my mission

507
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:02,691
in 15 minutes or less.

508
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:04,611
All right, let's go.

509
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:33,124
Madam is not at home, sir.

510
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,204
Thank you, Maxwell.

511
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:36,043
I won't be needing you any more.

512
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:37,123
Very well, sir.

513
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:07,590
Once you learn
something when you're

514
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,475
young, you just never forget it.

515
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,210
Except a six-year-old kid could

516
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:14,233
steal this one-cylinder
hair dryer.

517
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,830
Quiet.

518
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:35,309
All right, buddy, let's get this
thing outta here before I...

519
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:39,467
Oh, hello, Mr. Hawk. What are
you doing in this little car?

520
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:41,707
Just shut up and push.

521
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:45,706
Certainly, Mr. Hawk. One tiny
thing, is the car out of gear?

522
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:50,105
Of course it's out of gear,
you nitwit. Just push.

523
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,184
All right, Mr. Hawk.

524
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,503
Okay, push.

525
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,499
Hey, wait a minute. What are
you gonna do about that cab?

526
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:16,178
Are we trying to get tough?

527
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,618
Don't you dare to threaten me.

528
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,977
All right, Mr. Hawk.

529
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,217
Well?

530
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,656
Three minutes to go.

531
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,095
Oh, hello, Commissioner.

532
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:32,974
Got a little problem.

533
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:34,974
We gotta tow him outta here.

534
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:39,692
Mr. Hawk, just sit
quietly this time.

535
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:42,011
Don't touch the pedals or
the gears, understood?

536
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:44,771
Don't order me around.
I will do as I please.

537
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:47,930
The traffic commissioner
shall hear about this.

538
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:49,650
I am the commissioner.

539
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,889
Then what are you doing
in that monkey suit?

540
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:56,448
The traffic commissioner would
dress in dignified clothes.

541
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,647
This happens to be
my dress uniform.

542
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:03,926
I was on my way to the ceremonies
for "I am a Policeman" day.

543
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:06,805
Okay, let's go.

544
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,476
Commissioner, call your office.

545
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:44,915
There's been an accident.

546
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,875
See the man. See the man.

547
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:49,435
One minute to go.
He'll never make it.

548
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:51,514
Oh, if Mr. Hawk says he'll
do something, he'll...

549
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:53,034
Here he is.

550
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:58,992
Get that car, dead or alive.

551
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,712
Right away, sir.

552
00:35:01,872 --> 00:35:03,111
Mr. Hawk?

553
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:07,070
If you'll sign a few
of these citations.

554
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:09,510
Compliments of the commissioner.

555
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:14,268
Well, he's got more
stuff than I thought.

556
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:18,348
Yeah, I'm sorry he's going too.

557
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,027
All right, I'll see
you later. Bye-bye.

558
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:24,186
Flight 38 for Las Vegas...

559
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:27,305
I tell you, Mother, you've never
seen Uncle Alonzo in such a rage.

560
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,145
He's probably having this
airport watched right now.

561
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:34,423
But he won't find me. I'm wearing
a disguise. A disguise...

562
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:37,223
A beard and a moustache.

563
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,422
Yes, I know, Mother. I promised I
wouldn't grow a beard when I left.

564
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,421
Don't you understand?
It isn't real.

565
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:47,380
No, I will not go back and
apologise to Uncle Alonzo.

566
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,899
He is a greedy,
unscrupulous, no-good,

567
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,418
thieving,

568
00:35:55,938 --> 00:36:00,857
coyote. Yes, thank you, miss. Oh.

569
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,536
No, Mother, my asthma
is not coming back.

570
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:07,335
No, nothing's the matter with me.
Everything is just fine now.

571
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:11,574
This is the turning
point of my life.

572
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,454
Uncle Alonzo used
to push me around

573
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:15,254
and you were always
telling me what to do.

574
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:19,452
Then I met this perfectly
wonderful girl.

575
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:23,571
I was even afraid of her 'til now.

576
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:25,371
I've just decided something.

577
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,289
I am not going to be
a rabbit any more.

578
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,209
Goodbye, Mother.

579
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,088
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

580
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,486
Come along, Herbie. Off to market.

581
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,045
Thank you, Herbie.

582
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:54,083
Let me see now. Half
a dozen tomatoes.

583
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:57,443
The broccoli looked
very nice yesterday.

584
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,562
What else was there?

585
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:15,558
We've sighted the car, Mr. Hawk.

586
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,874
We're moving in for the kill now.

587
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,554
They're moving in
for the kill now.

588
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:35,953
Ooh.

589
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:43,551
What happened? You said you
were moving in for the kill.

590
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:46,390
Negative. A little
premature, I'm afraid, sir.

591
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,509
She's obviously a
very desperate woman.

592
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,709
But don't worry. She
won't make it this time.

593
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,865
Another of your shortcuts, Herbie?

594
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:15,423
Where is she now?

595
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:17,622
She's still going up and up.

596
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,382
It's incredible. She's
driving like a madman.

597
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:34,258
Oh, Herbie, behave yourself.

598
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:36,738
You knocked my glasses off.

599
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:40,817
Where on Earth is she?

600
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,775
Don't answer it. It'll be Hawk.

601
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,854
Look.

602
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:55,813
No, Mr. Hawk, the phone
didn't ring before.

603
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:57,013
Were you trying to reach us?

604
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,812
Did you grab the car?

605
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,012
Any moment now.

606
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,131
There it goes, into the
Sheraton-Palace Hotel.

607
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,610
The Sheraton-Palace Hotel?

608
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:10,049
May I draw your attention
to the superb baby shrimp?

609
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,968
All right, Herbie,

610
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:17,967
but you'll never convince me this
is a shortcut to Vern's Market.

611
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:20,246
Gentlemen, do you
have a reservation?

612
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,486
There it is.

613
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:23,965
After her. Somebody stop her.

614
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:26,445
Don't let her get away.
Come on, let's go.

615
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,609
There's only one
thing gives me the

616
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,483
creeps, that's that
weird little car...

617
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,242
What's the matter with you?

618
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:40,441
There it is.

619
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,241
Pull yourself together.
You're getting hysterical.

620
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:45,281
Take two aspirins and lie down.

621
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,600
One of us has to keep our nerve.

622
00:39:57,037 --> 00:39:58,277
Come on, come on. Move it.

623
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:02,476
Now we've got him.

624
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,435
Stop wool gathering, Herbie.

625
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:08,354
We really must get to the market.

626
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:11,994
Oh, oh. Wait a minute.

627
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,553
Look out. He's coming back.

628
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:16,833
Ooh.

629
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,992
Look out. Look out.

630
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:37,867
Grandma, I was worried about
you. Is everything all right?

631
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,986
Wonderful. Herbie took me for
a nice drive on the bridge.

632
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,466
Let me help you.

633
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,825
It's Mr. Whitfield. So
nice to see you again.

634
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:47,185
This morning you were on
your way to Missouri.

635
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:48,625
Nicole spoke to me.

636
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:52,064
Grandma, Mr. Whitfield's agreed
to help us fight his uncle.

637
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:55,343
Wonderful. Stay for dinner.

638
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:56,782
I've already invited him.

639
00:40:56,982 --> 00:40:59,221
Why don't you take those
out to the kitchen?

640
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:00,461
Yeah. Thank you.

641
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:05,540
What a fine young man.

642
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,260
You look so right together.

643
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,459
Oh.

644
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,539
Now, if there's
anything I can do...

645
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,978
There is one thing, Grandma.

646
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:17,178
Just let nature take its course.

647
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:20,776
Oh, yes, dear. Oh, I
wouldn't want to interfere,

648
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,056
not for anything.

649
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:23,096
Oh.

650
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:25,775
By the way, we're going to
want more broccoli for dinner.

651
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:27,815
Will you and Willoughby
pick me up some, please?

652
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:28,894
Sure.

653
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:31,814
Incidentally, you ought to
drive down to the beach.

654
00:41:31,893 --> 00:41:32,893
Grandma.

655
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:34,053
It's the most beautiful day.

656
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,333
We'll just go get some broccoli.

657
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,732
Yes, dear, of course.

658
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:43,930
I'm not gonna say
another word, Herbie.

659
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,249
There's nothing I can do.

660
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:53,488
Of course, I can't help it if you
happen to have a mind of your own.

661
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,288
Can I?

662
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:04,285
I guess I should have told Mrs.
Steinmetz I don't like broccoli.

663
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,562
Herbie, where are you going?

664
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:24,720
The young lady and gentleman
have turned towards the north.

665
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,988
It would appear that they're not

666
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:37,077
immediately returning
to the firehouse.

667
00:42:37,397 --> 00:42:40,596
See that they don't. Do
anything you have to,

668
00:42:40,636 --> 00:42:43,875
but don't let them return to
that firehouse until after dark.

669
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:44,956
Do you read me?

670
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,475
Perfectly, sir.

671
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,154
Oh, Grandma put him up to this.

672
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,233
Where's he taking us?

673
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,273
I don't know, but I
could make a guess.

674
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:11,069
Pardon me, sir. Is this the
only road from the beach?

675
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:12,948
Yep.

676
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,908
Would you care, sir, to earn $50?

677
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:17,187
Don't mind.

678
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,306
We wish you to obstruct the road
from the beach for two hours.

679
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,665
My employer is preparing
a surprise party...

680
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,465
Don't explain. Just
give me the money.

681
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:30,024
It's very romantic
here, don't you think?

682
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:33,383
Do you know that's the
first time I've ever heard

683
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:36,102
anyone use the word "romantic"
in a real conversation?

684
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:39,941
I hope I wasn't being too
forward, but it is romantic.

685
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,780
I think that's what
Grandma had in mind.

686
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,219
She always thought the Pacific
Ocean was very romantic.

687
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,659
Captain Steinmetz proposed to her

688
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,259
on the beach near the
Cliff House 50 years ago.

689
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:58,696
I'm sorry I punched you
the first time I met you.

690
00:43:58,777 --> 00:43:59,777
That's okay.

691
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,815
It wasn't very ladylike to hit
you with a boiled lobster.

692
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:03,896
It's okay.

693
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:05,855
You can hit me back if you want.

694
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,174
That isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

695
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:18,731
Oh.

696
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,930
Herbie. Oh.

697
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:29,968
Oh, it's time we
were getting back.

698
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:34,367
Herbie, come on.

699
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,527
Leave that sea gull alone.

700
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:40,926
Herbie.

701
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:43,165
I wish that car would
learn to mind.

702
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,724
Herbie, please.

703
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,404
Herbie.

704
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:51,283
Heel, Herbie.

705
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:56,403
See? Just needs a firm hand.

706
00:44:56,482 --> 00:45:00,522
You know, Willoughby, sometimes
you really surprise me.

707
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,598
Hey, what's happening?

708
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:24,715
Sorry, sir. My rear axle's frozen.

709
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:25,955
But, how're we...

710
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:27,235
Sorry.

711
00:45:36,992 --> 00:45:38,111
No, Herbie.

712
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:39,471
Ooh.

713
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,110
Whoa.

714
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:48,230
Oh.

715
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,547
Oh.

716
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,866
Oh, well, here we are.

717
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:12,303
Ah.

718
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:13,383
Nicole?

719
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:16,102
Very quietly and quickly, pull
your hand back inside the car.

720
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,179
Why?

721
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:18,181
We've got company.

722
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:24,380
That's ridiculous. Why would
a shark follow a Volkswagen?

723
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,860
Because he thinks the
same thing I do.

724
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:27,300
We're going to sink.

725
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:37,017
Excuse me.

726
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:38,896
Can you tell me the
way to San Francisco?

727
00:46:38,937 --> 00:46:43,095
Yeah, man. Straight up the beach
road, first left, second right.

728
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:45,014
Thank you.

729
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,654
Whoa...

730
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,250
Old number 22, it's gone.

731
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:07,689
What?

732
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:15,207
They came with a big truck.

733
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,366
Everything's gone.

734
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,006
Who did it?

735
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:23,565
It said on the truck,

736
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,284
"Alonzo Hawk Van & Storage."

737
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:29,004
Haven't you ever
jimmied a lock before?

738
00:47:29,043 --> 00:47:30,283
Of course not.

739
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:31,763
It isn't a hobby of mine.

740
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:33,562
Hurry. We can't just stand here.

741
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,761
Good for Herbie.

742
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,480
Halt.

743
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,000
You have been detected by
electronic surveillance.

744
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,399
You are about to be surrounded

745
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:49,998
by agents of the Alonzo
Hawk Security Service.

746
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,639
Touch nothing in this warehouse

747
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:54,037
or you will be prosecuted to
the full extent of the law.

748
00:47:54,117 --> 00:47:56,517
Don't you dare talk to
me like that, Mr. Hawk.

749
00:47:56,597 --> 00:47:58,597
I want my things back and
I'm going to have them.

750
00:47:58,676 --> 00:47:59,756
I think that's a recording.

751
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:00,996
I don't care what it is.

752
00:48:01,036 --> 00:48:03,555
Halt. You have been...

753
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:05,394
Let's find your things
before somebody gets here.

754
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,434
By agents of the Alonzo
Hawk Security Service.

755
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,193
Touch nothing in this warehouse

756
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:13,393
or you will be prosecuted to
the full extent of the law.

757
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:33,227
Your things aren't here.
Maybe we better...

758
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:45,944
All right, hold it.

759
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:49,783
Okay, get your hands up.

760
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,622
Don't you get fresh
with me, young man.

761
00:48:57,022 --> 00:48:59,061
Watch it, Smitty. She's
the ring leader.

762
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,981
Come on, grandma. Move it.

763
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,101
Keep your hands up.

764
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,820
I most certainly will not.

765
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,619
If you say please, I
might consider it.

766
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:09,619
All right, please.

767
00:49:12,218 --> 00:49:16,217
There now, you see, that
wasn't so difficult after all.

768
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:19,416
If you'd mind your manners,
life would be easier

769
00:49:19,576 --> 00:49:21,215
for all of us.

770
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:24,575
Now, would you be good
enough to tell me exactly

771
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:26,734
what you are doing
with my furniture?

772
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,893
How do we know, lady?

773
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:35,212
All I can tell you is that nothing
goes out without Mr. Hawk's okay.

774
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,010
Look out, Smitty. Run.

775
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:53,007
There goes some more.
Out of the way.

776
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:00,486
Hey, we're out off. How're
we gonna get out of here?

777
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,663
You know, Smitty,
I don't think Mr.

778
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:04,644
Hawk's gonna be happy about this.

779
00:50:30,638 --> 00:50:34,317
Whew.

780
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:37,596
Oh, evening, mother.

781
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:42,795
Ain't you a might old
to be a stewardess?

782
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:50,393
There've been a lot of changes
since I come to visit this town.

783
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:57,191
Barnsdorf, will you stop worrying
about your digging equipment?

784
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,111
You're paying me 80 grand a day.

785
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:01,671
Will you stop bothering me?

786
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,750
I have broken the old
lady's spirit. Yeah.

787
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,669
I've taken every
stick of furniture.

788
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:08,443
She's sitting in an
empty firehouse,

789
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:09,708
ready to listen to reason.

790
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:12,947
Barnsdorf, I guarantee you

791
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:15,627
you can start digging first
thing Monday morning.

792
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:21,185
Yeah.

793
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:24,105
What?

794
00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:27,304
That's right, sir. Yes, they
got away with everything.

795
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:30,743
Call out every unit of the
mobile security force.

796
00:51:30,823 --> 00:51:32,142
We'll nail 'em to the wall.

797
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,627
Stop at the top so
we can figure out

798
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:40,981
how to get down the other side.

799
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
Right.

800
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,579
Like I was saying, little lady,

801
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:50,539
I was doing fine
'til I got into that

802
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,898
sheep-dip you call
liquor in this town.

803
00:51:56,017 --> 00:51:58,976
My name is Judson.

804
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,855
Got a little cow ranch a couple
hundred miles north of here.

805
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:07,014
Been alone with those cows for
over 40 years, so I thought

806
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:09,853
I'd get into town and stir
up a little excitement.

807
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,773
Might be my last opportunity.

808
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:20,993
I better get a piece
of rope and tie

809
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:22,490
us all up together, nice and snug.

810
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,807
Oh, no. It looks
like Uncle Alonzo.

811
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,606
No, Herbie. Don't do it.

812
00:52:41,565 --> 00:52:42,925
Oooh.

813
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:48,763
After him.

814
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:01,641
Faster. Faster.

815
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,920
Oh, Herbie, now you
have got us in a mess.

816
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:13,397
Now, Herbie, stop this minute.

817
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:17,596
Hey, watch out. What
are you trying to do.

818
00:53:17,756 --> 00:53:20,315
You busted my machine. Look,
here comes another one.

819
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,954
That's not nice. Look what you've
done to my "pretzellette".

820
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:38,591
Mrs. Steinmetz.

821
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:41,710
Mrs. Steinmetz, put on the brake.

822
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:45,269
You're a fine looking woman.
Did you say you was married?

823
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,669
No, the Captain's been
gone these many years.

824
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:50,708
There he is, Captain Steinmetz,

825
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:52,936
hook and ladder,
number 27, city of

826
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:54,907
San Francisco, a fine gentleman.

827
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:57,027
Nice picture.

828
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,825
You carry it around
with you everywhere?

829
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:03,745
Mrs. Steinmetz, use
the hand brake.

830
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:11,383
- Oh. You okay?
- Yeah.

831
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,945
I declare, little lady,
you're a sight to

832
00:54:13,946 --> 00:54:16,101
make this country
boy's heart flutter.

833
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:19,581
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm much too old.

834
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,323
Oh-oho. The way I
figure it, you're

835
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,900
just about coming into your prime.

836
00:54:30,178 --> 00:54:32,897
Can't that thing play something
with a little more pep?

837
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:10,728
How nice to see people
dressing up for parties again.

838
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:15,127
Was that anyone we know?

839
00:55:16,127 --> 00:55:19,086
Looks like these
cars go a lot faster

840
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,725
than when I was a young fella.

841
00:55:20,806 --> 00:55:22,525
Well, you can't stop progress.

842
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:24,844
Look at that.

843
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:28,044
Herbie, you gotta help us.

844
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:53,477
Steady, Herbie.

845
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:55,997
Come on. Come on. Move closer.

846
00:55:58,596 --> 00:56:00,715
Hurry up. We're running
out of street.

847
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,395
Closer. A little more.

848
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:09,833
Go On, Jump.

849
00:56:11,353 --> 00:56:13,312
Whoa.

850
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:17,710
Oh.

851
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:36,627
Well, here's where I get off.

852
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:40,065
Thanks for the ride, little
lady. Appreciate it.

853
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:45,864
Sure like to cross trails
with ya again sometime.

854
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:49,103
Are you all right, Grandma?

855
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:50,423
Of course.

856
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:53,342
I just met the most
interesting man.

857
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:56,381
Good morning, Grandma. Sleep
well after being up so late?

858
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:58,941
Not a wink, my dear.
I suddenly realised

859
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,460
what an enormous amount of trouble
Alonzo Hawk is giving me.

860
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,128
I'm going straight
down to his office

861
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:04,499
to give him a piece of my mind.

862
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:06,658
Oh, no, you don't.

863
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:09,658
Oh, I have to go.
Bye-bye, Grandma.

864
00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:13,017
Please, don't do anything foolish.

865
00:57:19,975 --> 00:57:22,734
Willoughby, I know Grandma and
I think she's up to something.

866
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:24,854
Don't worry, I'll keep
her out of mischief.

867
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:27,894
You better or else
I'll get tough again.

868
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:28,933
Bye.

869
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:30,013
Bye.

870
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,851
Where are you going,
Mrs. Steinmetz?

871
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:38,171
To see Mr. Hawk.

872
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:41,570
Oh, no, you can't do that.
You heard what Nicole said.

873
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,619
Nicole is a very sweet
girl. But at her age

874
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,409
she shouldn't start
ordering me around.

875
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,608
Do you mind if I go with you?

876
00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:48,528
That won't be necessary.

877
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:52,207
No, but I think Nicole
would prefer it.

878
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:56,926
Hey, come back. Mrs.
Steinmetz. Come back.

879
00:58:00,005 --> 00:58:01,845
This certainly is a nasty
whiplash, Mr. Hawk.

880
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,564
I'm afraid you're
trying to do too much.

881
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:06,483
I know, Millicent.

882
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:08,883
But except for you,
who can I depend on?

883
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:11,442
I have to do every...
Who are those clowns?

884
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:15,322
Your new lawyers. You fired
the others yesterday.

885
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:19,400
Oh, now look, fellas, I'm gonna
tear down the Steinmetz firehouse.

886
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,440
Just a moment. You have
the necessary permit?

887
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,918
Of course I don't have a permit.
I don't even own the land yet.

888
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:29,798
Sorry, Mr. Hawk, such an
action would jeopardise

889
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:31,518
the legal status of
your new building.

890
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:32,757
We can't permit you...

891
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:34,117
Will you get outta here?

892
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,835
I didn't hire you to
tell me what I can't do.

893
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,355
I hired ya to tell
me how I can do it.

894
00:58:40,436 --> 00:58:42,155
Go.

895
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:46,594
You see, everybody lets me
down. You know me, Millicent.

896
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:48,993
I'm enthusiastic, boyishly eager.

897
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:51,872
All I get is cheap lawyer talk.

898
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:54,591
Poor Mr. Hawk. It isn't fair.

899
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,391
Nevertheless, I shall not falter.

900
00:58:56,511 --> 00:59:00,031
I am like a sensitive,
finely-tuned violin.

901
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,949
All I need to restore me is a
few moments of peace and quiet.

902
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:10,227
Hey. Hey.

903
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,227
Hey. Hey.

904
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:17,185
Hey, you out there.

905
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:22,065
Hey.

906
00:59:22,944 --> 00:59:26,383
Hey, turn it off.

907
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:30,382
You idiot. What do you
think you're doing?

908
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,982
Washing the windows, every
Wednesday, Mr. Hawk's orders.

909
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:36,021
I am Mr. Hawk. Get out of here.

910
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:39,740
Okay, cancel the windows.

911
00:59:42,339 --> 00:59:45,219
And you better shut the window.
Runs up the air conditioning bill.

912
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:47,258
You're fired, get your money...

913
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:49,338
Mr. Hawk's orders.

914
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:52,817
They may harass me,

915
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:55,697
but don't let them ever
think they have me beaten.

916
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:58,816
That is when Alonzo Hawk
is at his most dangerous.

917
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,295
Yes, sir.

918
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:03,054
Millicent.

919
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,653
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to try and get

920
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:10,532
Fred Loostgarten on
the phone for me.

921
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:14,012
He used to work with our wrecking
company before I fired him.

922
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:15,487
I understand he has a little

923
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,331
one-horse operation
of his own now.

924
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,176
Yes, I think that's how Captain

925
01:00:25,177 --> 01:00:27,448
Steinmetz would
handle the situation.

926
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:38,085
Excuse me, could you tell me
where Mr. Hawk's office is?

927
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,978
Yes, ma'am, the old
buzzard hangs out

928
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:41,885
28 stories up, six
windows to the left.

929
01:00:41,924 --> 01:00:42,924
You can't miss it.

930
01:00:42,964 --> 01:00:45,923
I'm sorry. I don't hear
so good from this side.

931
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:47,923
28th floor. You can't miss it.

932
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:49,443
Thank you so much.

933
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:01,559
No. Mrs. Steinmetz. Stop.

934
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:10,637
Mrs. Steinmetz. Come back. Stop.

935
01:01:11,557 --> 01:01:15,036
Mrs. Steinmetz. Help.

936
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:18,835
Grandma. Mrs. Steinmetz.

937
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:21,515
Help.

938
01:01:21,915 --> 01:01:25,594
Help.

939
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:27,753
Missus... Grandma.

940
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:31,592
Help. Mrs. Steinmetz.

941
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:35,351
Grandma. Help. Mrs.
Steinmetz. Help.

942
01:01:36,031 --> 01:01:37,190
Grandma.

943
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:39,071
Is that you, Mr. Whitfield?

944
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,230
Where are you?

945
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,310
Down here.

946
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,029
Help me.

947
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,789
Oh, there you are.

948
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:46,148
Just a minute. I'm coming.

949
01:01:46,228 --> 01:01:47,988
No, no, stay where you are.

950
01:01:48,028 --> 01:01:49,107
Just take us down.

951
01:01:49,147 --> 01:01:52,107
Of course, Mr. Whitfield.

952
01:01:52,147 --> 01:01:54,866
But first you must promise
to let me see Mr. Hawk.

953
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:57,625
Anything. I'll do
anything you say.

954
01:01:57,706 --> 01:01:59,545
Very well, Mr. Whitfield.

955
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:02,385
Hey, Loostgarten, old
buddy, how are ya?

956
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,776
I know things haven't
been going too

957
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:06,983
well for ya, but that's
the way life is.

958
01:02:07,183 --> 01:02:08,543
Yeah, right, Mr. Hawk.

959
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:09,903
I got to thinking...

960
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:13,902
I've got to find a job for my
old friend, and here it is.

961
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,301
You know that crummy old firehouse

962
01:02:16,381 --> 01:02:18,340
on the site where I'm
building Hawk's Plaza?

963
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,620
Yeah?

964
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,619
I want you to get your
wrecking ball and smash it.

965
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:26,858
I want nothing left but
itsy-bitsy splinters.

966
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:31,817
Don't worry, Willoughby. I shall
be perfectly polite... But firm.

967
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:36,056
What do you mean, "send
you over a permit"?

968
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:37,576
I don't get one 'til
tomorrow morning.

969
01:02:37,736 --> 01:02:39,215
Yeah, but, Mr. Hawk, I...

970
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:40,295
Loostgarten.

971
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:42,614
The job has gotta be done tonight.

972
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:44,574
Take it or leave it.

973
01:02:46,254 --> 01:02:49,572
Millicent, my dear, will you put a
check in the mail to Loostgarten?

974
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:53,932
That's Loostgarten Wrecking
Company, a thousand on account.

975
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:57,771
Tonight he's gonna smash that
crummy firehouse to matchwood.

976
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,969
That'll teach that old
battle axe a lesson.

977
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:10,927
No, no, Grandma, he
won't like that.

978
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:13,886
I don't care what he doesn't like.

979
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,486
Knock down my home, will he?

980
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:19,485
Oh, no. Uncle Alonzo, I don't
believe you've met Mrs. Steinmetz.

981
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:20,805
How do you do?

982
01:03:23,004 --> 01:03:25,123
Don't worry, Uncle.
Everything's under control.

983
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,763
Yeah, just dandy.

984
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:31,282
Now you've done it, Mr. Hawk.
You've made Herbie very angry.

985
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:46,558
No. No. Get out. Get out. Get out.

986
01:03:49,957 --> 01:03:52,676
No. No. No. Go away.

987
01:03:54,516 --> 01:03:56,116
No. Herbie. Stop.

988
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:58,715
Ooh. Wrong way.

989
01:04:00,555 --> 01:04:02,274
Stay away from me.

990
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,194
Somebody come in here
and stop this thing.

991
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:07,633
Don't you think we ought to see
what all those noises are?

992
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:10,272
When Mr. Hawk says he doesn't
want to be disturbed, that's it.

993
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:17,910
Herbie.

994
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:19,670
Uncle?

995
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,189
Now's a good time to explain.

996
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:24,989
You.

997
01:04:26,588 --> 01:04:28,068
Help.

998
01:04:29,107 --> 01:04:30,107
Herbie, stop it.

999
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:37,825
Will you be going out
for a while, Mr. Hawk?

1000
01:04:39,105 --> 01:04:40,105
Herbie.

1001
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:41,584
Gotta get away from that thing.

1002
01:04:43,184 --> 01:04:45,223
- Good morning, Miss Millicent.
- Good morning.

1003
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:46,264
Mrs. Steinmetz?

1004
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,342
I told you Mr. Hawk was busy.

1005
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:11,737
Aw, shut up. And get
off my building.

1006
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,936
There must be some way
to make this car behave.

1007
01:05:18,455 --> 01:05:22,814
I don't like to threaten Herbie.
He has been trying to help us.

1008
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:25,653
But there's one thing
Herbie is afraid of.

1009
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:36,730
Whoa.

1010
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:43,649
Now stop, Herbie.
Don't make me do it.

1011
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:44,728
Please, do it, Grandma.

1012
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:50,607
Very well, Herbie.

1013
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:53,646
It so happens that I know
this nice used car lot.

1014
01:05:55,446 --> 01:05:59,285
I'd certainly hate to call Mr.
Honest Al, the used car man.

1015
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:03,443
Of course, you know I
never would do it.

1016
01:06:03,484 --> 01:06:05,091
And between you and
me, I don't think

1017
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:06,443
Herbie believes I would either.

1018
01:06:06,483 --> 01:06:07,883
But it always works.

1019
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:16,561
What a lovely morning.

1020
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,280
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

1021
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,879
Did we get the name
of the gentleman

1022
01:06:20,919 --> 01:06:23,719
who thinks he's going to
knock down my firehouse?

1023
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,597
It was Loostgarten,

1024
01:06:27,678 --> 01:06:30,317
of the Loostgarten
Wrecking Company.

1025
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:33,676
I'm going to write that down.
We're going to need it.

1026
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:38,035
Well, thanks anyway for
trying Millie. Bye.

1027
01:06:38,115 --> 01:06:40,035
Millie's one of the stews who
works for Hawk's airline.

1028
01:06:40,074 --> 01:06:41,434
She can't find his address either.

1029
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:42,514
May I say something?

1030
01:06:42,554 --> 01:06:44,713
No, I'm still mad at you for
not taking care of Grandma.

1031
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,273
If we can't find out where he
lives, my idea won't work.

1032
01:06:47,433 --> 01:06:49,192
We'll just have to think
of something else.

1033
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:50,471
I am going to say something.

1034
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:54,311
I've sent Uncle Alonzo
a card every Christmas

1035
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:57,830
since I was seven years old,
and here's his address.

1036
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,829
Willoughby, oh. You're wonderful.

1037
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:04,068
Right.

1038
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:05,948
Loostgarten speaking.

1039
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,027
This is Alonzo Hawk.

1040
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:10,147
Right, Mr. Hawk.

1041
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,306
Loostgarten, there's been
a slight change of plan.

1042
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:14,786
I don't want you to knock
down that firehouse tonight.

1043
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:17,865
Instead I want you to knock
down 343 Oleander Heights.

1044
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:20,704
You got that? 343
Oleander Heights.

1045
01:07:20,784 --> 01:07:21,784
Right.

1046
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:23,904
Write it down.

1047
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,942
I don't want to see
you blackballed

1048
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:28,742
in the wrecking ball business,

1049
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:31,901
If you get what I mean.

1050
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:32,982
You were wonderful.

1051
01:07:33,021 --> 01:07:34,181
Oh.

1052
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,418
Yes... I know it's 3:00 in the
morning, but I can't sleep.

1053
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,178
Well, you're my doctor, aren't ya?

1054
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:48,412
Sometimes the
old-fashioned remedies

1055
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:50,257
seem to work best, Mr. Hawk.

1056
01:07:50,297 --> 01:07:51,737
Have you ever tried
counting sheep?

1057
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:53,616
Sheep.

1058
01:07:53,656 --> 01:07:56,376
Picture in your mind's eye

1059
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:59,614
a grassy green meadow,

1060
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:02,774
a whitewashed, three-rail fence,

1061
01:08:02,814 --> 01:08:05,853
a flock of sweet little sheep.

1062
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:10,492
They begin to jump over
the fence. One sheep...

1063
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:14,051
Six sheep, seven sheep,

1064
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:18,050
eight sheep, nine sheep,

1065
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,768
ten...

1066
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:52,986
Yeah, what is it?

1067
01:09:53,146 --> 01:09:55,546
Sorry to disturb ya at this
time of night, Mr. Hawk.

1068
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,505
But a guy in my job can't
afford to make mistakes.

1069
01:09:58,584 --> 01:10:00,384
What are you talking about?

1070
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,344
That address you gave
me on the phone.

1071
01:10:02,423 --> 01:10:04,143
What about it?

1072
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:07,023
343 Oleander Heights.

1073
01:10:07,063 --> 01:10:08,982
Are you sure that's
the right address?

1074
01:10:09,062 --> 01:10:11,022
Of course I'm sure, you idiot.

1075
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:14,141
I know it as well as I
know my own address.

1076
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,779
Wait a minute. It
is my own address.

1077
01:10:37,215 --> 01:10:41,654
Loostgarten. No. Not
this. This is my house.

1078
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,134
You dumb jerk.

1079
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:47,692
Loostgarten. This time
you're really through. Help.

1080
01:10:50,332 --> 01:10:52,811
You...

1081
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:05,848
We beat him.

1082
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,327
I knew he'd cave in. He just
couldn't stand the heat.

1083
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:15,525
Hello? Oh, good morning, Mr. Hawk.

1084
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:19,204
Well, now that it's all over, I
just had to phone you and tell you

1085
01:11:19,284 --> 01:11:21,298
how much I admire the
plucky fight you

1086
01:11:21,299 --> 01:11:23,363
put up for that sweet
little firehouse.

1087
01:11:23,763 --> 01:11:26,082
Oh, thank you, Mr. Hawk.

1088
01:11:26,243 --> 01:11:28,882
Well, what brought about
my change of heart

1089
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:31,721
was an accident to
my own little house.

1090
01:11:31,802 --> 01:11:33,757
It only brought home
to me how terrible

1091
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:35,761
it is to lose something
you really love.

1092
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,200
What happened, Mr. Hawk?

1093
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,799
Well, a very confused
man came along

1094
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,439
and knocked down the
whole side of it,

1095
01:11:42,518 --> 01:11:44,478
smashed it to rubble.

1096
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:48,397
Someone knocked down
Mr. Hawk's house.

1097
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:51,356
Aw, what a rotten shame.

1098
01:11:51,397 --> 01:11:52,397
But it...

1099
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:53,876
It did serve a purpose.

1100
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:56,675
It made me realise I can't
knock down any more

1101
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:59,434
of San Francisco's
beautiful old buildings.

1102
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:01,257
So I don't want you
to worry that sweet,

1103
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:02,794
little, grey head
of yours about it.

1104
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:04,313
Is that clear?

1105
01:12:04,393 --> 01:12:06,952
Yes, Mr. Hawk. Thank
you, Mr. Hawk.

1106
01:12:07,352 --> 01:12:10,231
All right, Mrs. Steinmetz, and
I'll drop by one of these days

1107
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:12,511
and have a cup of tea with you.

1108
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:13,910
Bye.

1109
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,270
I always said you'd do the
finer thing, Mr. Hawk.

1110
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:21,149
What are you talking
about, fathead?

1111
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:22,428
Giving up Hawk Plaza.

1112
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,388
Are you fooled by
this phony story?

1113
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:26,867
But, Mr. Hawk, you
can't go back on this.

1114
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:30,786
Oh yes, I can. I can
say I was misquoted.

1115
01:12:30,867 --> 01:12:32,746
I can say they printed
the story purposefully

1116
01:12:32,786 --> 01:12:34,785
to discredit me in the
eyes of the public.

1117
01:12:34,866 --> 01:12:38,665
Well, it's an old gag. It's
out of my bag of tricks.

1118
01:12:39,024 --> 01:12:41,104
You mean we're still going
after the old lady?

1119
01:12:41,343 --> 01:12:44,263
Right for the jugular vein, baby,

1120
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:46,503
right for the old jugular.

1121
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:49,701
I wish Grandma would
hurry up and get here.

1122
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:52,461
Can't start a celebration
party without her.

1123
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,111
It gives us a chance
to have a quiet

1124
01:12:54,112 --> 01:12:55,460
talk. We never had one before.

1125
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,300
Something always
happened. Oh, thank you.

1126
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:04,898
Nicole, there's something
I've been wanting to say.

1127
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:06,857
What's that, Willoughby?

1128
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:11,496
Did I ever tell you that my
great-grandfather Whitfield

1129
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:15,655
was one of the first men to go
over Niagara Falls in a barrel?

1130
01:13:19,414 --> 01:13:21,454
Oh, well, was he all
right afterwards?

1131
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:23,333
I don't know. They
never found him.

1132
01:13:23,613 --> 01:13:25,253
I think I'll call Grandma.

1133
01:13:27,972 --> 01:13:30,411
The giant lobster is
very good tonight, sir.

1134
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:32,131
Of course, no lobster.

1135
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:35,629
I did mean to call,
dear. But I was

1136
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,250
just sitting here
thinking to myself

1137
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,361
what a fine time those
two young people

1138
01:13:39,362 --> 01:13:41,329
must be having without
me in the way.

1139
01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:44,448
Now listen, Grandma, I
love you very much,

1140
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:46,487
but I've had enough
of your matchmaking.

1141
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,487
Now you get over here
like you promised.

1142
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:50,771
If I do marry Willoughby,
I'd like the

1143
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:52,806
satisfaction of
nailing him myself.

1144
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:55,328
Do go ahead without
me, dear. I think

1145
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:57,604
I'll just have a quiet
evening at home.

1146
01:13:57,685 --> 01:14:00,284
Goodbye, dear.

1147
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:06,122
Now, do go on with your wonderful
story about the cows, Mr. Judson.

1148
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:10,041
I swear I never seen a
handsome woman like yourself

1149
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:11,921
who had so much an
interest in cows.

1150
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,800
That's quite natural, Mr. Judson.

1151
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,639
After all, a cow is
not only useful,

1152
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:22,318
but an extremely
decorative animal.

1153
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:23,718
Ain't it just.

1154
01:14:25,997 --> 01:14:29,317
As I was saying, I got this

1155
01:14:29,396 --> 01:14:31,916
nice little 200-acre
spread up in Oregon.

1156
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:40,633
What in tarnation
you doing that for?

1157
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:43,913
I'm not quite sure. I think
I saw this once in a movie.

1158
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:24,023
Oh, no.

1159
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,460
Just let me get my hands on the
brute responsible for this.

1160
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,020
Now. Horse whipping's
too good for him.

1161
01:15:46,057 --> 01:15:47,577
What on Earth?

1162
01:15:58,014 --> 01:15:59,214
It's Mr. Hawk.

1163
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:01,533
Herbie. Don't you dare.

1164
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:09,452
Oh. Every man for himself.

1165
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,690
Herbie must have gone for help.

1166
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:19,608
Hope he makes it through to
the fort. We must be cut off.

1167
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:23,808
Okay, Steinmetz. We
know you're in there.

1168
01:16:23,888 --> 01:16:25,687
We've got you surrounded.

1169
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:32,925
We'll give you 10 minutes to get
your stuff together and get out

1170
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:36,525
before I grind this
dump to powder.

1171
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,564
Now you hold on there, Mister.

1172
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:40,537
This little lady's
under my personal

1173
01:16:40,538 --> 01:16:42,123
protection and she stays here.

1174
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:44,882
Ten minutes, Steinmetz.

1175
01:16:45,203 --> 01:16:47,495
To get back to my
great-grandfather

1176
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:48,642
at Niagara Falls,

1177
01:16:48,721 --> 01:16:52,281
I don't think I put it quite
right. What I wanted to say was,

1178
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,759
though we Whitfield men
look like rabbits,

1179
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,519
we have always liked challenge,

1180
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:02,972
the scent of danger
in our nostrils,

1181
01:17:02,973 --> 01:17:04,798
the high road to adventure.

1182
01:17:04,877 --> 01:17:06,637
Yes, Willoughby?

1183
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:09,556
That's why I want to
go on seeing you.

1184
01:17:09,637 --> 01:17:11,556
Not to deprecate your physical
attributes, certainly,

1185
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:14,795
but because there is this
feeling of danger about you,

1186
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:16,234
of something about to happen.

1187
01:17:19,714 --> 01:17:21,033
You're right, Willoughby.

1188
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:40,469
Looks like we've just
picked up a friend.

1189
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:07,422
Three minutes to go, Steinmetz.

1190
01:18:07,462 --> 01:18:09,461
This is your last chance.

1191
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:11,541
Make your play, Hawk.

1192
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,221
We're standing pat.

1193
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:18,339
I think Captain Steinmetz would
have liked you, Mr. Judson.

1194
01:18:18,419 --> 01:18:19,819
You're his kind of man.

1195
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:20,899
Thank you, ma'am.

1196
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:27,536
Hey.

1197
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,325
Attention. One minute to zero.

1198
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:20,444
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1199
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:25,643
Here come the hostiles.
We're ready for 'em.

1200
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,398
I think Captain Steinmetz would
have liked you to wear this.

1201
01:19:40,678 --> 01:19:43,797
Why, I'd be proud to, little lady.

1202
01:19:45,517 --> 01:19:46,677
Mighty proud.

1203
01:19:48,957 --> 01:19:50,596
Power shovel number one, ready?

1204
01:19:50,676 --> 01:19:51,715
Ready, Mr. Hawk.

1205
01:19:52,236 --> 01:19:54,755
Full speed ahead. Go.

1206
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,273
Fire.

1207
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:07,712
Hey. Hey.

1208
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,511
Stop. Help.

1209
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:12,870
Cease fire.

1210
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,989
Good shooting, Mr. Judson.

1211
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:20,189
Thank you. That one won't
bother us for a while.

1212
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:23,228
Hurry. Move in with the crawler.

1213
01:20:23,308 --> 01:20:24,748
All right, Mr. Hawk.

1214
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:28,186
Fire.

1215
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,665
Please, stop it. No.

1216
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:35,184
Ceasefire.

1217
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,944
There goes another one. We got
the devils on the run. Fire.

1218
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:43,183
Oh, no.

1219
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:51,181
Are you all right?

1220
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:55,580
Don't worry about me, ma'am.
What we gotta worry about,

1221
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:57,179
we're plumb outta ammunition.

1222
01:20:57,459 --> 01:20:59,939
This time we all go in together.

1223
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:02,818
We got nothing to
regret, little lady.

1224
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:05,417
We done our best.

1225
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:09,216
Ready.

1226
01:21:17,254 --> 01:21:21,013
Drive. Drive. Let's get
going. Get outta here.

1227
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:05,602
Hi, Grandma. Hi, there.

1228
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:11,361
Why, that rascal. She's
got a man with her.

1229
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:13,560
No wonder she wouldn't
come to our party.

1230
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,678
Faster. Faster. Faster.

1231
01:22:22,758 --> 01:22:24,957
Wait a minute. Back.

1232
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,355
Why don't ya look
where you're going?

1233
01:22:31,436 --> 01:22:34,354
How dare you raise your voice
to me, you myopic oaf.

1234
01:22:36,914 --> 01:22:39,074
Hey. What do you think
you're... Whoa.

1235
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:53,630
All right, Herbie.
That's enough now.

1236
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,189
You think you're gonna
make him stop? Fat chance.

1237
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:59,868
Herbie, if you don't stop, you
won't be invited to the wedding.

1238
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:12,585
Ah, it's you again, Mr. Hawk.

1239
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:17,264
Save me. Save me. They're
after me. They're after me.

1240
01:23:17,824 --> 01:23:18,864
Who's after you?

1241
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:21,103
Those little cars...
Hundreds of 'em.

1242
01:23:21,183 --> 01:23:22,742
Can't you see them, you idiot?

1243
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:26,532
Mr. Hawk, I wonder, would you mind

1244
01:23:26,533 --> 01:23:28,221
coming down to my
place of business?

1245
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:29,860
I would be happy to.
I would... Ooh. Ooh.

1246
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:32,301
Ooh. Ooh.

1247
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,900
And what happened then?

1248
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,299
Willoughby told Herbie that

1249
01:23:36,339 --> 01:23:39,058
if he didn't stop, he wouldn't
be invited to the wedding.

1250
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:42,818
Wait a minute. What wedding?
