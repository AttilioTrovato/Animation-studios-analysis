1
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:50,644
Mr. Jonathan lyte.

2
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,387
- Good day to you, Mr. Lyte.
- Good day, lapham.

3
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:06,260
I have a commission for you,
lapham.
Yes, sir.
Your servant, sir.

4
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:09,463
The teapot to this set
was ruined by a careless maid.

5
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,532
I value the piece
and wish to replace it,

6
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,534
but I must have it
by Monday next.

7
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,671
Monday, sir ?
It's a mighty short time
for such a fine piece.

8
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,608
It looks like one
of revere's best. Why
not take it to him, sir ?

9
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,313
Revere ? Look at the Mark.
You made that set yourself
more than 30 years ago.

10
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,384
So I did.
So I did.

11
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,387
Oh, but Monday, sir.
I don't know.

12
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,224
It's a long time
since I've done
anything like this.

13
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,693
Very well then, I shall have
to take it to revere.
We can do it, Mr. Lyte.

14
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,296
My master's too modest.

15
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,466
You do not seem overburdened
in that direction.
Who are you ?

16
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,336
- Johnny tremain, sir.
- My apprentice.

17
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:53,574
Well, since you
allow him to speak for you,
on Monday morning then, early.

18
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,743
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:55,776 --> 00:03:00,514
A fine commission, and you'd
have let it go out the door.

20
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,417
Beautiful, isn't it ?
And I made it.

21
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,519
I think I can do most
of it, sir.

22
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:10,258
A fine piece like this ?
And you not half through
your term.

23
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,394
Takes a tall man
to cast a great shadow, boy.

24
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,396
Put it away.

25
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,098
But I'm sure I can do it.

26
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,402
Heed holy writ,
proverbs 16:

27
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,972
"Pride goeth before
destruction, and a haughty
spirit before a fall."

28
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:34,382
I think I can
do anything, cilla.

29
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,417
Just about anything,
if I get the chance.

30
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,288
Well, grandpa's right
when the meek inherit the earth,

31
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:44,124
I doubt you'll get so much
as one square foot of sod,
Johnny tremain.

32
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,491
Oh, it's no use.
It looked all right
when it was cast, but now--

33
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,461
you think I don't know
what's wrong ?

34
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,163
God's will is playing.

35
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,767
Mr. Lyte will have
to find another Smith.

36
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,102
I'll go to Mr. Revere
in the morning.

37
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,271
He's helped me before,
and he'll know what's wrong.

38
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:35,075
You've let commissions
go by before when grandpa
didn't feel up to them.

39
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,645
Why are you so anxious
about this one, Johnny ?

40
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:43,150
Mr. Lyte's our landlord.
Isn't that reason enough ?
What's this ?

41
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:47,555
Oh, just a Mark
to sign my silver with
when I'm my own master.

42
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,826
Using Mr. Lyte's family crest ?

43
00:04:55,162 --> 00:05:00,768
"J" for Johnny,
"t" for tremain.
What's the "l" for ?

44
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,274
It's a secret
I've never told anyone.

45
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,710
...and all's well !

46
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,646
You can tell me.

47
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,149
Promise on your hope of heaven,
you would never
tell anyone else ?

48
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,218
On my hope of heaven.

49
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:23,824
Well, my mother told me
my real name is
Jonathan lyte tremain.

50
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,560
"Jonathan lyte tremain" ?

51
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,897
You, a relative
of Mr. Lyte ?

52
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,900
What are you
to him ?
I don't know.

53
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,636
Mother wouldn't tell me.

54
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:41,675
Why ? Was she afraid
or ashamed ?
Proud, I think.

55
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,145
She was the proudest woman
in the world.

56
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,881
But apprenticing you
to grandpa,

57
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,751
and the lytes almost as rich
as John hancock himself.

58
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,422
She wanted me to learn my trade,
make my own way.

59
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:58,592
Are you crazy ?
A chance at a big house,

60
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:03,196
servants, coaches and your own
ship sailing the seven seas ?

61
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,566
I'd rather be my own master
and stand on my own feet.

62
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,569
Johnny, this isn't another one
of your tricks,

63
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,872
is it ?
Maybe you'll believe this.

64
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,687
This was my mother's
christening cup.

65
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,724
If I ever have
to go to Mr. Lyte,
I'm to show him this.

66
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:35,629
But she made me promise
I wouldn't go to him unless
god himself had forsaken me.

67
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,766
And I never will.

68
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,649
Fresh COD, mackerel.
Come in this morning, at the head of the ferry way.

69
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,591
I'm looking for Mr. Revere.
His shop's
down the street.

70
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:07,427
Yes, I know. His wife
told me I'd find him here.
He's busy.

71
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,531
I'll wait.
If you want to.

72
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:18,672
"Countrymen ! Ships laden
with English tea are now
bound for this port.

73
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,676
Shun the detested beverage
and let none be landed
on these shores" ?

74
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,346
What's this ?
The most important
piece of news in Boston.

75
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,683
Tea ?
But I like tea.
Almost everyone does.

76
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:34,855
The English ministry has already
collected a tax on this tea
and added it to the price.

77
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,425
Now if we let that stuff in,
every time we buy a pound of it,

78
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,594
we'll be paying a tax
we haven't voted.

79
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:44,765
That's why
to warn everyone of the truth.

80
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,968
- Who is "we" ?
- The sons of Liberty.

81
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,771
- But who are you ?
- Everyone in Boston
who believes...

82
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,273
Their liberties
are worth fighting for.

83
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:58,546
You can keep your politics.
I'll stick to my trade
and mind my own business.

84
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,449
- Rab, you finished yet ?
- Yes, uncle nat.

85
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,552
If they suit
Mr. Adams.
I'll look at them.

86
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,720
Johnny,
what are you doing here ?
I want to see you.

87
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,822
Oh, in a moment.
Yes, sir.

88
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,859
Excellent, rab.
Thank you, Mr. Adams.

89
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,861
Get them out
to your Liberty boys.

90
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,829
The sooner they're spread
through the town, the better.

91
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,865
I'll nail one
to the governor's door
myself.

92
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,835
Sometimes I wonder why
we trouble ourselves.

93
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:25,472
Liberty is for the young.
They have the spirit for it.
That's certain.

94
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,676
This lad seems to have
business with you, Paul.
We'll go on.

95
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,611
Good day, gentlemen.

96
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,047
Dr. Warren, Mr. Adams.

97
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,884
Seems everybody in Boston
is interested in tea.

98
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,921
Not tea, Johnny.
The principle behind it.
What is it this time ?

99
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,592
We've been commissioned
to replace the teapot
on a silver set.

100
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,727
I copied this handle
from the creamer
and enlarged it,

101
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,930
but it always
comes out wrong.

102
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,333
This is the work for a master,
not an apprentice.

103
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:58,038
Mr. Lapham feels
he's too old for such work.
We need the trade badly, sir.

104
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:03,010
The fault here
is not craftsmanship.
I've seldom seen better.

105
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,681
No, it's in your design.
Enlargement isn't enough.

106
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,584
Proportion has to be
taken into account too.

107
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,120
Now...

108
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:19,126
We make our curves deeper,
like this.

109
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,961
You see ?

110
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,637
Enough of work, lad.

111
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,538
Don't you hear
the bell ringing
for vespers ?

112
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,541
But I've almost
finished this pattern.
In another hour--

113
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,977
there are things
more important than
a rich man's silver.

114
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,980
The boy is only trying to do
what you can't do yourself.

115
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:45,819
God granted him a great gift,
but he must learn gratitude
and humbleness.

116
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,588
But grandpa, only an hour ?

117
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,992
It's time that god and his word
came first in this house.

118
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:57,497
We will begin
our sabbath tonight
as becomes humble people.

119
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,767
Begin with the 19th verse.

120
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,006
"And I will break the pride
of your power.

121
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,677
"And I will make
your heaven as iron
and your earth as brass.

122
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,012
"And your strength
shall be spent in vain...

123
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,481
"For your land shall not
yield or increase.

124
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,918
Neither shall the trees
of the land yield their fruits."

125
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,718
Pray god the Deacon's meeting
lasts extra long, so he won't
miss us from our pews.

126
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,620
We could get put in jail
for breaking the sabbath.
If we get caught.

127
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,556
Fetch a pail of water
so we can douse the fire
if anyone comes.

128
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,625
Then keep watch
down the street.

129
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,695
Hurry up, Johnny !
Yes, Mrs. Lapham.

130
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:29,456
- The constable's coming !
- Put it away, quickly !
We'll douse the fire.

131
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,732
Johnny !

132
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,937
Oh, Johnny !

133
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,287
Hey, it's you again.
Where you been ?
Around.

134
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,723
What happened
to your hand ?
I burned it.

135
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:08,128
What's the gun for ?
The tea I told you about,
it's in that ship.

136
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,131
And we're here to stop 'em
from landing it.
Oh, the tea again.

137
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,633
Good morning, sir.
A fine, large day, isn't it ?

138
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,570
That it is, lad.

139
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,240
Hmm, if you're
gonna carry one
of these things,

140
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,276
learn to carry it
right.

141
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,578
Yes, sir.

142
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,884
Who was that ?
Admiral montagu
of his majesty's Navy.

143
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,153
He's taken quarters
for himself over there,

144
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,322
but he can't land
the two companies of marines...

145
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,324
He's got in his flagship.
What do you mean
he can't land them ?

146
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,993
You wouldn't be hanging
around this tea ship
very long if he did.

147
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,295
That's just it.
Governor hutchinson
won't let him.

148
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,999
Half of Boston would turn out
in a minute if those marines
were landed against us.

149
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:49,269
Why don't you get your master
to give you some time off,
so you can take a turn with us.

150
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:53,941
My master's a silversmith,
not a troublemaker.

151
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,688
You could have rode
to Charleston for that
charcoal time you been gone.

152
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,124
There were others
ahead of me, and I had
to wait my turn.

153
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:15,628
Since when has Johnny tremain
taken to waitin' when there's
work to be done in this shop ?

154
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,166
- What's got into you, Johnny ?
- Let the boy be.

155
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,170
Everything in good time.
Oh, time. He's been
mopin' about for weeks.

156
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,707
- But, ma, his hand.
- Time we looked at that too.

157
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,043
Now, unwrap it, Johnny.

158
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,648
Did you hear me, boy ?

159
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,710
Move your fingers.

160
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,948
I can't.

161
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,255
It's no wonder.
They've all growed together.

162
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,224
I know.

163
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,331
Well, so, so that's it.

164
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,102
There'll be no more
following the trade for you.

165
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:32,205
Why, we're not bound
to his contract after this,

166
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:37,744
are we ?
Johnny's contract is with me.
Come here, boy.

167
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,453
I've said nothing about
the broken sabbath, Johnny.

168
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,089
God has sent you
enough punishment for that.

169
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:53,293
If you can't serve me,
you'll have to find other work.

170
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,696
But I want you to know that,
as long as I live,

171
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,731
there will be a place
in this house for you.

172
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,004
Not if I can't earn it.

173
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,485
Johnny ! Johnny.

174
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,989
Johnny, I don't want you
to go off like this.

175
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:26,826
- Good-bye, cilla.
- But at least stay
until you can find something.

176
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:32,199
You're a stubborn fool,
Johnny tremain !

177
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,804
"Sixteen hundredweight
of west indies molasses...

178
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,806
"To the order of
hitchbourne and company...

179
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,942
At Boston in the bay
of Massachusetts."
Good, boy. Very good.

180
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,145
Lads who can read
are hard to come by these days.

181
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,380
Now let me see a sample
of your pen.

182
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,384
Well, well, come on, boy.

183
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,994
I'm sorry, boy.
We could have used you.

184
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,264
You've sinew
on your bones, lad.

185
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,533
Enough to weather a voyage
in fine style.

186
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,203
We sail
on the Tuesday tide.
You'll give me a berth ?

187
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,040
Here's my hand on it.

188
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:24,817
I'm sorry, but who's going
to hire a boy with one hand...

189
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,320
When there are dozens
to be had with two ?

190
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,384
Wait here.

191
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,593
You can bill me for these
at the end of the month.
Yes, sir. Good day, sir.

192
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,928
By your leave, sir.
What is it ?

193
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,432
I wanted to talk to you, sir.
Oh, aren't you
old man lapham's apprentice ?

194
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,401
The young rascal
who ruined the silver
he was making for me ?

195
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:19,172
Yes, sir, I was.
But my name is
Jonathan lyte tremain.

196
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:23,543
So, Jonathan lyte tremain.

197
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,045
Well, get on with it.
There's more to it,
isn't there ?

198
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,081
Or shall I tell you
how it goes ?

199
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:33,286
Your dying mother told you
to come to me in adversity,
that you are my relative.

200
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,456
Isn't that it ?
Why, yes, but I didn't
realize you'd know.

201
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,058
What rich man
doesn't know that trick ?

202
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,295
It's one
of the oldest in the world
and one of the scariest.

203
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:46,266
But I have this to prove
what I say is true.

204
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,304
- Where'd you get that ?
- My mother gave it to me.

205
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:56,075
Gave it to you, eh ?
A long time ago, I suppose.

206
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,411
Yes, when she told me
about my name.

207
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,481
Quite so.

208
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,056
Bring that to my house
after supper tonight.

209
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,493
We'll discuss our relationship
in proper surroundings.

210
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,595
Drive on.

211
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,864
Thank you, sir.

212
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,950
What do you want, boy ?
I have an appointment
with Mr. Lyte.

213
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:41,521
Oh, master tremain !
Can I take your bag, sir ?

214
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,893
Right this way.

215
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,499
Master Jonathan lyte tremain.

216
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,702
Ah, come in, my boy. Come in.
My friend, Mr. Hooper.

217
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,138
Your servant.
That cup, boy.

218
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,541
You know, I think you've solved
the family mystery...

219
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:05,645
Of long standing,
master tremain.

220
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,316
I think we can agree that these
four cups are identical...

221
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,119
And of one set,
bearing the lyte family crest.

222
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,524
Mmm, it is obvious that
this fourth cup now stands
where it belongs.

223
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,627
There remains
only the question...

224
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,662
Of how it came
into master tremain's hands.

225
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:26,366
But I've already
told you that, sir.
My mother gave it to me.

226
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,635
Ah, yes, your mother.

227
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:33,240
Constable,
didn't I report
on August 10 last,

228
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:38,177
that a window was broken
in this room, and one of these
cups, carelessly left out,

229
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,513
was stolen
along with some other
trifles of silver ?

230
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:46,085
That you did, sir.
Well, we found our burglar,
constable. Take him away.

231
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,223
Come, boy.

232
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,437
Mr. Revere, rab,
how'd you know I was here ?

233
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:09,041
He's with us, Johnny.
Lets us know every time
he gets a new tenant.

234
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:13,112
Looks as though
Mr. Lyte intends
to make an example of you.

235
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,716
But don't worry, lad.
This is Mr. Josiah Quincy.

236
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,118
He's taking your case.

237
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,389
But I can't afford a lawyer,
let alone the best one
in Boston.

238
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,725
-Any innocent man can afford me.
-But I'm a nobody.

239
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,295
We're all nobodies
when we're standing alone.

240
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,463
It's what I tried
to tell you, Johnny.

241
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,699
It's when
we fight together
that counts.

242
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,635
And we happen to believe
that we must fight
just as fiercely...

243
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,305
Against small tyrannies
as against big ones.

244
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,408
So, Mr. Quincy is your lawyer.

245
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,280
And now then, Mr. Lyte,

246
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,417
having heard your testimony
and that of the defendant,

247
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,753
a few questions,
if you please.
Certainly, sir.

248
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:57,056
You state that
these cups were presents
from your father...

249
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,159
To each of his children
to commemorate their
christening.

250
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,396
Yes. As the sole survivor
of those children,

251
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,498
these cups have all come
into my hands in due course.
Quite so.

252
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,401
And each of your three
brothers has passed onto his
reward through the years,

253
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,671
leaving his goods
and chattels, including
these cups, to you.

254
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:16,409
But, sir, yours
is a very well-known family,
both here and in england,

255
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,445
and I'm under the impression
that your father...

256
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:22,148
Had five children,
rather than the four
you mentioned.

257
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,283
True. There was a sister,

258
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,686
lost under tragic circumstances
many years ago,

259
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,189
before any of us
came to America.

260
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,760
Is it not possible that this
boy's story could be true ?
Could he not be related to you ?

261
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,530
You say my name and family
are well-known !

262
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,500
Look at this beggar
from the streets,
and look at me, sir,

263
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,702
and let that be your answer.

264
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,804
Your eloquence is respected
by all, Mr. Quincy,

265
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,541
but I fear, sir,
that not even you
can alter fact.

266
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,711
That heirloom,
of little value in itself,
was plainly stolen...

267
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,648
For no other purpose than
to establish just such
a preposterous claim...

268
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,785
As that young ruffian
has proposed.

269
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:03,623
Your honor, the apprentices
and scavengers of Boston
get out of hand these days.

270
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,158
They roam the streets
in lawless bands,

271
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,328
roaring out treasonous songs
in the public squares...

272
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:13,833
And prating of Liberty
like drunken parliamentarians.

273
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,803
Loyal and lawful citizens
are at their mercy.

274
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,140
I suggest, sir, that these
sentiments have prejudiced you
against this unfortunate lad.

275
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,744
Most certainly not !
My reputation for fairness...

276
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,547
Is known throughout
this colony, sir.

277
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,385
I bear no ill will
towards my fellow man,
whatever his age or station.

278
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,654
But I have been robbed,
and the gallows...

279
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,589
Of this city have been
too long empty.

280
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:41,561
In the interest of justice,
I demand the death penalty !

281
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:45,297
That, fortunately,
is for the court to determine.

282
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,402
I thank you, sir.

283
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,375
Does that conclude your case,
Mr. Quincy ?

284
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,447
No. No, your honor.
May I remind you, sir, that
we have a full docket today.

285
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,381
I had hoped
to summon a witness...

286
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,585
On behalf of my client.
Out of the way.
Out of the way, sir.

287
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,588
There she is now.

288
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:13,292
- I call Priscilla lapham.
- Go on.

289
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:22,435
Do you swear by the living
god that the evidence you
shall tell this court...

290
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,237
Shall be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

291
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,674
so help you
god ?
I do.

292
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:34,947
Miss lapham, have you ever
seen this cup before ?
Yes, sir.

293
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,983
Will you tell
the court where ?

294
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,418
In grandfather's shop.

295
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,754
And you know to whom
this cup belongs ?

296
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:47,494
Him. He showed it to me
the night he told me his true
name was Jonathan lyte tremain.

297
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,930
- When was that ?
- The fifth of July.

298
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,667
- Are you sure of the date ?
- I'll never forget it.

299
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,470
It was just two days
before he burned his hand.

300
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,872
And I submit, your honor,
more than a month...

301
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,476
Before Mr. Lyte says
his missing cup was stolen.

302
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,514
Thank you,
miss lapham.

303
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:10,382
Oh, just a moment, girl.

304
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,689
Do you know who I am ?

305
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,691
Yes, sir.
Good.

306
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:23,295
Now, isn't it a fact
that the accident
to which you refer...

307
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,866
Occurred while this young
felon was deliberately
breaking the law ?

308
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,435
He was breaking the sabbath,
if that's what you mean.

309
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,971
Precisely.
We all were,
except grandpa.

310
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,607
Because this unprincipled
boy urged you to it ?

311
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,943
No, sir. Because you'd
brought us an order...

312
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,779
That could have paid all
the back rent grandpa owes you.

313
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,716
Your honor, it is not I who
am prejudiced in this case.

314
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,653
This girl
is obviously in love
with the prisoner...

315
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:51,558
And is determined
to protect him.
I'm not
in love with Johnny tremain.

316
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,727
He's the most stiff-backed,
thickheaded, stubborn boy
in Boston.

317
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,896
And a lying thief !
That isn't so !

318
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't argue with me !
Johnny may be everything
I said, your honor,

319
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,804
but he never told a lie
or did a dishonest thing
in his life.

320
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,340
I am not interested in
your opinions, young woman !
What I want to know is--

321
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,977
one moment, Mr. Lyte.

322
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,748
A tenant who dares
to testify against
her landlord has courage, sir,

323
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:19,752
and, in the opinion
of this court, no possible
motive but the truth.

324
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:24,423
This court finds no evidence
to support the charges
against this defendant.

325
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,559
Good day, Mr. Lyte.
Next case.

326
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,367
Thank you, cilla.
It was my duty,
Johnny tremain,

327
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,870
and don't get an idea
it was anything else.

328
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:46,445
Things look a little brighter ?
Thanks to you and Mr. Revere
and your other friends.

329
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,515
You've all helped me
so much, I'd like
to help you somehow.

330
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,618
That doesn't sound
like Johnny tremain.

331
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:55,955
- What do you mean ?
- What's happened
to the master Smith...

332
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:59,458
Who was gonna stand
on his own two feet and let
others stand on their own ?

333
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,561
The one who thought
freemen's rights
and people working together...

334
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,598
Was just a lot of things
that got argued about
by politicians ?

335
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,567
Guess I have learned a bit
about that, haven't I ?

336
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,870
But just the same, I wish
there was something I could do.

337
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,472
Matter of fact,
there is.

338
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:17,476
Come on. You can help me
with a chore across the street.

339
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,979
Who's goblin ?
Pump some water
in the trough.

340
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,014
I'll bring him out
to meet you.

341
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:36,395
- Like him, don't you ?
- Who wouldn't ?
He belong to you ?

342
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,398
To uncle nat.
Goblin.
That's a funny name.

343
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:44,103
He's a funny horse.
His imagination gets
the best of him now and then.

344
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,974
A rag, a paper, a bush.
He thinks they're all terrible
goblins. They eat horses.

345
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,476
I bet I can
make friends
with him.

346
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,846
You know, Johnny,
there is something
you could do...

347
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,649
If you could
only ride.
Why can't I ?

348
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,851
It only takes one hand
to hold the reins.

349
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,154
On goblin, even two hands
aren't enough.

350
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,023
I can do it,
can't I, boy ?

351
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,026
All right.
I'll get a saddle.

352
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,729
We'll see.

353
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,453
- Haven't you had enough ?
- Just a little bit longer.

354
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,056
I think he's beginning
to trust me.

355
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,726
All right, once more.
But that's all.

356
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,201
We've got to show him
this time, goblin.

357
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,738
Do this for me, and I won't
ever let anything happen to you.

358
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,941
No goblin's gonna get you
when you're with me.

359
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,753
Will he do ?
Yes, uncle nat.

360
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,655
We finally got
the horse boy we need.
Good.

361
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,191
I've run tomorrow's paper.
You better start folding it.
Yes, uncle nat.

362
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,226
Can I help ?
If you want to.

363
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,495
They still upstairs ?

364
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,231
They've adjourned.

365
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,502
Five hundred
and thirty-two
subscribers.

366
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,906
Biggest newspaper
in the whole Providence.

367
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,942
Rab, what's it all about ?

368
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:34,180
The latch on the door
and the people upstairs ?

369
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,149
I was waiting
for you to ask.

370
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,120
You know
what this is ?

371
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:45,291
It looks like
the Liberty tree.
It is.

372
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,293
It's our badge.

373
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:51,964
You see, the observer
is really the voice
of the sons of Liberty.

374
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:55,601
The committee meets
secretly here upstairs,
like tonight.

375
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:59,906
And sometimes part
of your job will be
to carry messages for them.

376
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,775
Who's the committee ?
The men who organized us.

377
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,944
The greatest patriots
in Boston.

378
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,313
Now, there isn't
any list.

379
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,917
Don't dare write it down
for fear it will fall
in the wrong hands.

380
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,319
So you'll have
to memorize the names.

381
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,823
You trust me ?
Any reason
why we shouldn't ?

382
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,258
Here they come.

383
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,296
Good night.
Good night,
Mr. Lorne.

384
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,799
Good night, doctor.
I'll let you gentlemen out.
Sam Adams, Dr. Warren,

385
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,102
Paul revere, Mr. Quincy;
You know them.

386
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:34,173
That's the reverend
Samuel Cooper and
his brother, William.

387
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,810
Martin brimmer,
Mr. Mollineaux,

388
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,913
Moses Gill,
Newman greenough,

389
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:45,784
Tom boyleston,
Oliver Wendell,

390
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:49,055
Joseph eayers,
Josiah flagg--

391
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,626
oh, Mr. Quincy, sir.
Yes, Johnny,
what is it ?

392
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,329
Mr. Lorne's compliments.
And you owe the Boston
observer six shillings.

393
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,565
Thank you.

394
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,971
Now, remember,
no work for a few days
until the swelling goes down.

395
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,873
Hello, Johnny.
Mr. Lorne's
compliments, sir.

396
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,208
And you owe the observer
six shillings.
Oh ?

397
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,311
Tell Mr. Lorne I'll attend
to it straight away.
Yes, sir.

398
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,882
Mr. Lorne's compliments.
And I owe the observer
six shillings.

399
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:19,285
Thank you, Johnny.
Mr. Adams just told me.
Yes, sir.

400
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,121
"You owe the observer
six shillings."

401
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,224
That means the committee
is meeting at 6:00, doesn't it ?
Maybe.

402
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,960
What do you suppose
the meeting's all about ?

403
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:31,730
Well, it could be to draft
a letter of apology
to the governor...

404
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,900
For interfering
in his affairs.

405
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,903
On the other hand,
there's a tea ship
at Griffin's wharf.

406
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,005
It will have been in harbor
20 days tomorrow.

407
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,242
And the law says,
after 20 days, any cargo
that hasn't been unloaded...

408
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,844
Must be seized
by the governor
and sold at auction.

409
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:48,180
They might want
to talk about that.

410
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,818
They've been talking
over an hour.

411
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,088
Probably dry enough
for some punch by now.
Very well.

412
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:01,827
May I take this
up for you, sir ?
Oh, I can manage.

413
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,931
Oh, I see. You've never
been up there, have you ?
No, sir.

414
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,799
Very well, Johnny.
Thank you, sir.

415
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,278
Gentlemen !

416
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,447
Gentlemen,
then we're all agreed.
The last detail...

417
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,716
As far as I'm concerned, doctor.
The one move they'll not
expect us to make.

418
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,119
Help yourselves,
gentlemen.

419
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,288
Take my word.
There's not a drop
of tea in it.

420
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,359
Oh, rab !

421
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,427
Have you warned your lads
we may need them ?

422
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,795
Yes, sir.
They're ready.
Good.

423
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,432
We're going from here
to a mass meeting at old south.
Thank you.

424
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:44,336
A last plea to ship the tea
back to england has been sent
to the governor.

425
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,739
His answer will come back
to me at the meeting.

426
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:52,144
If he refuses us again,
I'll give you the signal.
You'll know what to do then.

427
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,213
Yes, sir. But we'll be
outside the church.

428
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,984
If there's much of a crowd,
we won't be able to hear you.

429
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:01,387
There'll be a crowd,
all right. Johnny,

430
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,990
do you have
a whistle ?
I can get one, sir.

431
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:08,927
Good boy. You get over to old
south and get inside where you
can see me and hear me.

432
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,830
When the governor's
message comes,
if you hear me say,

433
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:17,103
"this meeting can do nothing
more to save the country,"

434
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,405
you get outside
and blow on that whistle
for all you're worth.

435
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,974
Understand ?
Yes, sir.

436
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:27,813
Gentlemen, a toast.

437
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:31,517
A toast to the hope that
is foremost in all our hearts:

438
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,354
A reasonable answer
from governor hutchinson.

439
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:45,097
We stand
upon moral grounds,

440
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:49,468
no less firm
than the rock-ribbed shores
of our own continent.

441
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:54,373
The rights of free englishmen,
wherever they may be.

442
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:59,211
And from this
unassailable vantage,
we must face the Gale.

443
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:04,216
I see the clouds which rise
thick and fast upon our horizon,

444
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,185
the thunder roll
and the lightning play.

445
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:10,056
And to that god
which rides the whirlwind...
Make way. Government business.

446
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:14,160
Make way. Government business.
And directs the storm,
I commit my country.

447
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,362
We sure don't look
like no real Indians.

448
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:19,898
Not supposed to especially,
just so we don't look
like ourselves.

449
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,234
You can't recognize anybody,
you can't blame anybody.

450
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:30,442
Quiet ! Mr. Adams would speak.

451
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,217
Fellow citizens...

452
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,388
Governor hutchinson's
answer has arrived.

453
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,061
This meeting
can do nothing more...

454
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,397
To save the country.

455
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,839
Come on, lads !

456
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:42,148
7:00 on a fine night,
and all's well.

457
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,585
7:00 on a fine night,

458
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,221
and all's well.

459
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,391
All is well tonight,
indeed.

460
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,627
But those seditious meddlers
who call themselves
the "sons of Liberty"...

461
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,930
Have given us a bad time
these past 20 days, admiral.

462
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:02,000
You know, I swear,
if I hadn't stiffened
the governor's resolution,

463
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,236
I believe he'd have shipped
that tea back to england.

464
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,505
What a misfortune
that would have been.

465
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,309
Allow me to offer you
a glass of port in
celebration of your victory.

466
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:14,580
Thank you. Yes,
the landing of that tea tomorrow
is a bit of a victory for me.

467
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,016
I daresay, Mr. Lyte.
Naturally, you'll buy it
in at the auction.

468
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,519
Naturally.
And at a vast profit.

469
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,088
Oh, I am a man
of business, sir.

470
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,991
But, believe me,
my real satisfaction is
in the utter defeat...

471
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,661
Of these radical demagogues
who have so long
corrupted Boston.

472
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:35,066
I'm convinced, admiral,
we shall hear no more prattle
of Liberty or the rights of man.

473
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,982
Remember your orders.

474
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:55,387
No damage to the ship,
no violence to the crew,

475
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:58,056
no harm to any cargo
but the tea.

476
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:03,662
It would seem, Mr. Lyte,
our celebration is
a trifle premature.

477
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:07,533
- To your task, gentlemen.
- Come on, lads.

478
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,042
Well, sir, aren't you
going to do something ?
What, for instance ?

479
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:20,346
Those ships out there are loaded
with his majesty's marines !
Bring them ashore !

480
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,681
I take my orders
from the governor.

481
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,419
Good evening, captain.
I must ask you
for your keys.

482
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,457
If you please, sir.

483
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,366
Excited, Johnny ?

484
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,702
This is a night I wish
I had two good hands.
You can.

485
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,704
I've told you before.

486
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,774
Anytime you'll come
to my surgery.

487
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:53,779
A few moments with a knife,
a few moments of pain,

488
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,615
your fingers
will be free.

489
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,318
We need good men, Johnny,
the best we can get.

490
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,150
Don't you realize, sir,
that tea is worth more than
two shillings a pound ?

491
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,586
And those chests weigh
near four hundredweight apiece !

492
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,756
A loss of more than
£40 sterling a chest !

493
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,426
As much as £18,000 value
for the whole cargo !

494
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,362
No doubt, Mr. Lyte.

495
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:21,367
But isn't it odd those
Indians seem to prefer
principle to profit.

496
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,535
"Shun the detested beverage
and let none...

497
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,405
Be landed
on these shores."

498
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,546
There goes
the last one.

499
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,692
That's it, lads.

500
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,568
There you are, sir.
All shipshape
in Bristol fashion.

501
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:59,505
And thank you, captain,
for the use of these.

502
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:10,682
*

503
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,251
*

504
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:33,271
Good night, admiral !

505
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,909
* plant the seed
in our homeland, boys *

506
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,446
* let it grow
where all can see *

507
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,681
* feed it
with our devotion, boys *

508
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,383
* call it the Liberty tree

509
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,555
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

510
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,790
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

511
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,560
* the sons of Liberty

512
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,695
* save it from the storm, boys

513
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,964
* water down its roots
with tea *

514
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,433
* and the sun
will always shine *

515
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,469
* on the old Liberty tree

516
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,973
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

517
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,642
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

518
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,545
* the sons of Liberty

519
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,647
* march along
with the fifer, boys *

520
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,949
* we were born
forever free *

521
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,787
* let's go pay the Piper, boys
beneath the Liberty tree *

522
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,725
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

523
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,327
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

524
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,963
* the sons of Liberty

525
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,965
* pay the price
they're asking, boys *

526
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,434
* always pay
the tyrant's fee *

527
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,770
* never give up
the struggle, boys *

528
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,640
* fight for the Liberty tree

529
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:46,411
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

530
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,313
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

531
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,782
* the sons of Liberty

532
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,684
* stand for the rights
of man, boy *

533
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:55,521
* stand against all tyranny

534
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,756
* hang the lamps
of freedom, boys *

535
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,325
* high on the Liberty tree

536
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,696
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

537
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,698
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

538
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,501
* the sons of Liberty

539
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,637
* it will grow
as we grow, boys *

540
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,272
* it will be
as strong as we *

541
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,007
* we must cling
to our faith, boys *

542
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,309
* faith in the Liberty tree

543
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:22,981
* it's a tall, old tree
and a strong, old tree *

544
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,551
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

545
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,486
* the sons of Liberty

546
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,567
Hup, hup,
hup, two, three, four.

547
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,670
Hup, hup,
hup, two, three--

548
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:54,079
My name is Warren.
I have an appointment
with the governor.

549
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,282
Oh, yes, Dr. Warren.
General Gage is
expecting you, sir.

550
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,425
Dr. Warren, sir.
Oh, come in, doctor.

551
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,329
I trust my sending for you
was not an imposition.
Why, not at all, general.

552
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,932
Any service
at my command.

553
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,936
I have always held you
in great respect, sir.

554
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,371
And you will
believe my sincerity
when I tell you...

555
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:23,441
That the time has come
when we must have
an understanding.

556
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,578
-"We," general ?
-It has long been known to me...

557
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,847
That you are the most
influential voice...

558
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,350
In that body which you call
"the committee."

559
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:38,123
And now, doctor,
the fate of Boston lies
on this table between us.

560
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,359
I received today
this newspaper
from Portsmouth.

561
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,130
It contains an account
of lord chatham's speech
to the house of lords.

562
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:48,099
I wonder if
you have seen it ?
No, doctor.

563
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,135
You are an admirer
of lord chatham ?

564
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,537
What englishman is not ?

565
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,540
Lord chatham's speech
proposes an address
to the king...

566
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,475
With the demand that you
and your soldiers...

567
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,046
Be immediately withdrawn
from Boston.
I see.

568
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,150
May I take it, sir, that such
a decision would not be
entirely unwelcome to you ?

569
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,920
I have lived in these provinces
for too many years, sir,

570
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:12,824
to enjoy the responsibilities
which have now been
thrust upon me.

571
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:17,996
Chatham speaks here
of the ministry and the effects
of its colonial policy. He--

572
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,498
may I ?

573
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,835
"Resistance to your acts
was as necessary
as it was just,

574
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,738
"and your imperious
doctrines will be found
incompetent...

575
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,675
"To convince or enslave your
fellow subjects in America...

576
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:35,480
"Who feel that
tyranny is intolerable
to British subjects.

577
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:41,186
"All attempts to establish
despotism over such a mighty
continental nation...

578
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,622
"Must be vain,
must be fatal.

579
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:48,526
"We shall be forced,
ultimately, to retreat.

580
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,462
"Let us retreat
while we can,

581
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,866
not when we must."

582
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:02,173
Lord chatham is one
of the greatest statesmen
england has ever known.

583
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:04,976
But lord chatham
is not in office.

584
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,081
I am a soldier, sir,
and must take my orders
from the ministry in power.

585
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,150
Those orders are explicit.

586
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:15,486
I must not open this port
to any trade whatsoever...

587
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,189
Until the tea has been paid for
to the last shilling.

588
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:24,162
And I must stamp out vigorously
the least sign of resistance
to the ministry's policy.

589
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:28,734
In this connection, there are
certain things to which I can
no longer close my eyes:

590
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:32,704
The illegal bodies
of militia, for instance,
drilling on every village green.

591
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:34,906
They must be disbanded.

592
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,045
And I am also aware that
considerable stores of munitions
are being assembled.

593
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:43,749
They must be surrendered
at once.

594
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,117
That is why I sent for you.

595
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:54,025
I am sorry, general, but that
I do not have the power to do.
Why not ?

596
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,529
Because freemen will never
consent to give up the means
of defending their liberties.

597
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,733
Good day, doctor.

598
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,769
Good day, sir.

599
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:10,608
You realize, doctor,
this means that I must
enforce my orders.

600
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,944
I do, sir.

601
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:16,982
We have our duty.
We cannot deny you yours.

602
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,077
Ah, come in, my boy.
Come in.

603
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,153
Delightful weather
we're having.

604
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,655
Yes, sir.
This way.

605
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,525
Oh, see to it
we're not disturbed.

606
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,164
Well, sit down, my boy.
Sit down.

607
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:12,804
Johnny, I've decided
to go back to england.

608
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:14,772
Boston is no place
for a merchant now,

609
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,842
with the government
in the hands of the military,

610
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,244
the port closed,
trade at a standstill...

611
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,848
And more soldiers than civilians
in the streets.

612
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,650
It's a sorry situation,
isn't it ?

613
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:29,087
Yes, sir.
Why doesn't general Gage
take his redcoats home ?

614
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,322
But you don't understand.

615
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:35,293
Boston must first
accept responsibility
for the tea she destroyed.

616
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:38,763
Why ?
We didn't ask for the tea.
The ministry forced it on us.

617
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,599
That has nothing to do with it !

618
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:46,004
Do you know that
a group of loyal merchants,
myself amongst them,

619
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,875
offered to pay,
out of their own pockets,
the £18,000 in damages...

620
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:52,643
The ministry demands
for the tea ?
Yes, sir.

621
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:55,713
And do you know that
the political leaders
of Boston...

622
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,950
Have repeatedly refused
this generous and peaceable
solution...

623
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,352
To the plight
of the town and its people.
Yes, sir.

624
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,891
Well, can you sit there and tell
me that such leaders are working
in the public interest ?

625
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:09,895
- Yes, because we can't
give up our principles.
- "Principles" ? Ha !

626
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:15,266
What do beardless boys like you
or traitors like Sam Adams and
his kind know of principles ?

627
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,070
They're only trying to stir
the whole colony to defiance
of crown and ministry alike !

628
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:21,306
- No, they're not !
- Then what are they doing ?

629
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,742
They're defending our liberties,
and every freeborn englishman
has the right to do that.

630
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,844
Why are you parroting,
young popinjay ?

631
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,380
I didn't send for you
to hear the twopenny
political lecture !

632
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,217
Why did you send for me ?

633
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,056
To make you an offer I now
realize I would have regretted
for the rest of my life.

634
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:41,826
I've been at pains
to investigate your claim
of relationship to me.

635
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,897
I was willing to Grant
that you might, indeed,
be my dead sister's son.

636
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:48,333
I'd intended, in fact, to
take you to england with me...

637
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,902
And try and make
a gentleman of you.

638
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,904
You would have wasted
your time, sir.

639
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,240
I would never leave Boston.

640
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:57,275
I warn you, lad.

641
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,945
When the hangman comes
for your rebel friends,

642
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,080
there'll be no one
to whom you can turn.

643
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,382
Then I'll hang with them.

644
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:20,831
This cup means more to you
than it ever will to me.

645
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,808
Dr. Warren and Mr. Adams
and Mr. Revere...

646
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,144
Are upstairs
making plans right now.

647
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:35,346
I've sent for all of you
because they need help.

648
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,748
What can we do,
rab ?

649
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,318
They think general Gage
is going to make a move soon,

650
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,988
and they have to know
what he plans to do
before he does it.

651
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,756
That's where
you come in.

652
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,458
To watch
the general's headquarters
and the redcoats,

653
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:50,161
and to report everything
they do and say.

654
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:54,232
- What about you ?
- Some of us are old enough
to carry guns.

655
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,068
Captain Parker,
out in Lexington, is my cousin.

656
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:00,105
He wants us to come out
and join his minutemen
when the redcoats move.

657
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:02,473
Wait a minute. You're not
gonna leave me out of that.

658
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:05,343
There's plenty for you
to do here, Johnny.

659
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:08,346
You watch the redcoats
billeted on this street,

660
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,116
like the afric queen
across the way.

661
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,819
Dorcas,
you and the hitchbourne boys
watch the camps on the common.

662
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,824
Don't take it so hard, Johnny.
I'm glad you're not going
to Lexington.

663
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:22,960
I like it better
with you here.
I can carry
a gun as well as he can.

664
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,796
I've been thinking.

665
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,466
A lot of redcoats
are billeted
at the green dragon.

666
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,468
I can get a job
in the kitchen there...

667
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,503
And pick up
all sorts of things
while I'm serving them.

668
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,872
I don't want you hanging around
a lot of redcoats.

669
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,842
But that's what
we're supposed to do.
All of us.

670
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:41,212
I want you where
I can keep an eye on you
while you're watching them.

671
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:44,182
Colonel Smith
and his staff are quartered
at the afric queen.

672
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:48,519
That's a better place for you.
All right, Johnny.
The afric queen then.

673
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:51,522
You doddering old fool !

674
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,559
Three weeks is enough time
to make new campaign flasks
for the whole regiment.

675
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,894
All I wanted was
my old one repaired.

676
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,064
I'm sorry.
In a day or two--
oh, "in a day or two" !

677
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,232
I sail on the morning tide,
and I want my flask.

678
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:03,234
I beg your pardon, sir,
but has the port been
reopened...

679
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:06,371
So ships may sail from Boston
again ?
What business
is it of yours ?

680
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:09,574
I thought Mr. Lapham might
send your flask on after you
on another ship.

681
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,077
I go by military transport.
There'll be no other ships.

682
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,047
Maybe he can send it on
by me. I deliver newspapers
to most of the nearby towns.

683
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:19,084
I'd be glad--
you don't deliver newspapers
to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

684
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,486
It worked !

685
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,554
It worked !

686
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,070
Dr. Warren still here ?
Yes, what's up ?

687
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:40,938
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.

688
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,075
What's the matter, Johnny ?
The redcoats after you ?

689
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,078
No, sir, but I think
they're after something.
What do you mean, boy ?

690
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:51,015
Well, an officer just told
cilla and me he's sailing
to Portsmouth tomorrow.

691
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,351
It's hardly the move
we expected from Gage.

692
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,286
But a shrewd one, Sam.
Look here.

693
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,555
Portsmouth committee
reports a lot of crown
munitions...

694
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:01,392
Stored at fort William and Mary
there, and the Garrison
badly undermanned.

695
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,461
The committee thinks
the fort could be taken.

696
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:05,463
Apparently general Gage
thinks so too.

697
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:07,965
We could use
those arms and powder.

698
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,969
I'll be in Portsmouth
before the transport
clears Boston harbor.

699
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,043
Good evening,
Mr. Revere.

700
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,113
Not much traffic
these nights, eh, boys ?

701
00:51:22,147 --> 00:51:24,149
Nor daytime either,
Mr. Revere.

702
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:26,251
It's a dead town.
That's a fact.
How about some cider...

703
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:29,487
To go with your rations ?
We've not forgot the last jug
you brought us, sir.

704
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,323
I've a cousin over
in Milton. Perhaps he can
spare one I can bring back.

705
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:35,160
A good ride to you.

706
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:42,233
There goes one provincial
who sits his horse
like a gentleman.

707
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:45,336
Aye, and always
as fast as he can go.

708
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,538
I reckon he's
the ridingest man
in Boston.

709
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,642
"After securing the keys
to the armory,

710
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:57,615
"the provincials
carried off 97 kegs of powder
and 110 stands of small arms.

711
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:00,351
Their whereabouts
are now unknown.
I have the honor to be--"

712
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:04,655
etc. "Henry green,
lieutenant commanding officer,
fort William and Mary."

713
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,624
The impudence of these
gawking yankee-doodles !

714
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,659
Their impudence does not
disturb me so much...

715
00:52:08,693 --> 00:52:10,628
As the situation,
colonel Smith.

716
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,331
With arms and powder,
they can offer
a forcible resistance.

717
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:17,268
And they're certain to do so
if the ministry insists
on pressing them too far.

718
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:20,371
They've been storing munitions
in villages all around Boston.

719
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:24,609
In my opinion, sir,
we must confiscate these
contraband stores at once.

720
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:28,546
I quite agree,
but no blood has been shed
by my command thus far,

721
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:32,483
and I am determined
none shall be shed.
None will be, sir.

722
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,519
If I may have
a small, picked force--

723
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,389
say, a detachment of grenadier
and light infantry companies
from each regiment--

724
00:52:38,423 --> 00:52:41,626
- I will undertake the matter.
- But if you meet
with resistance, sir ?

725
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,728
There'll be no resistance.

726
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,297
We're not dealing
with a professional army,
major pitcairn.

727
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:49,300
These are but farmers
and mechanics who spend
a few hours each week...

728
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,236
Playing at soldiers
on the green.

729
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:54,405
If we can move at night
with the utmost secrecy,

730
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:57,475
we'll be back in Boston
with their precious munitions
in our possession...

731
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,678
Before they can summon
a dozen of their men
from their beds.

732
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:06,150
Very well, colonel.
You may have your picked force.

733
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,019
And pray god we are right.

734
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,491
Put more back
into it, boy.

735
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,560
You'll never
get a shine to him
without your bared arm.

736
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:18,996
The colonel likes
his horseflesh, you know.
Not this old nag, he don't.

737
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,500
He hasn't had a saddle
on him all spring.
Well, he may any day.

738
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,436
And the beast's
got to be fit.
The colonel
always rides his parade horse.

739
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,405
A slipper for dancing,
a boot for mud.

740
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,674
So bear down
like I told you.
Thank you, lass.

741
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,377
Service has improved in this
rattrap since you came along.

742
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,179
Kind of you
to say it, sir.

743
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,515
Orders, sir,
with the general's
compliments.

744
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,149
Very well.

745
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,557
Confound it, lad ! You'll
never be a fit horse boy until
you learn the proper stroke !

746
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,059
Here, let me show you.

747
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:53,764
- Wait a minute, lass.
- Yes, sir ?

748
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:57,468
- Be a good girl and fetch this
to my quarters, will you ?
- With pleasure, sir.

749
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:01,739
Your back, lad !
Put your back into it !
Here, I'll show you.

750
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,242
Hello, Johnny.

751
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,413
Where is everybody ?
Most of them
have already left ?

752
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,648
I had to work late,
but it was worth it.

753
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,318
Some hot cider,
cilla ?
Thank you.

754
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,456
Look, a copy
of Gage's latest order.

755
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:24,128
- Is that all ?
- "All" ? Listen.

756
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,797
"All grenadier and light
infantry companies--"

757
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,800
"are detached for five days'
training in special evolution."

758
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:33,103
Most of the rest of us
have already brought in
the same thing.

759
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:35,306
- Oh, I see.
- Johnny !

760
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,443
Yes, sir.
We've decided to call a meeting
of the committee tonight.

761
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,678
The usual time ?
No, make it 9:00.

762
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:44,682
And, Johnny,
tell the members this may be
the last meeting for awhile.

763
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:48,152
We want them
all here.
Even Mr. Otis ?

764
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:52,323
Especially Mr. Otis,
if he's well enough to come.
Is that wise, doctor ?

765
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:55,292
His spells have been becoming
more violent lately.

766
00:54:55,326 --> 00:55:00,197
Before that injury to his head,
James Otis was the most
brilliant mind among us, Sam.

767
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,735
He started the committee.
It's fitting he be here when
we end it. All right, Johnny.

768
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:12,209
Dr. Warren. This order,
it means the redcoats are
going to move, doesn't it ?

769
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,545
We think so.
Within the next five days.

770
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,747
Then isn't it time for us
to join captain Parker ?

771
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,316
What do you think, Sam ?

772
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,285
Every day that passes
will make it harder...

773
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,390
For men and boys
of military age
to get out of Boston.

774
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:29,394
Go ahead, rab...
And good luck.

775
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,729
Thank you, sir.

776
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,164
Come on, lads.

777
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,233
It's me, rab.

778
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,470
Oh, Dr. Warren.

779
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:42,807
Where's rab ?
He's gone on to Lexington.

780
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,412
- But without me ?
- You could hardly go, Johnny.
Surely you can see that.

781
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,514
I'd like to know
why not.

782
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:52,850
Well, let's say
I need you more here.
Is Mr. Otis coming ?

783
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:56,854
Yes, sir.
Good. You take over for me
and admit him when he gets here.

784
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,789
Yes, sir.

785
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:10,435
For ten long years, we've tried
to placate crown and
parliament,

786
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,671
and they've tried
to placate us.

787
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:17,174
The cry is peace.
Peace !

788
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,277
But there is no peace.
Oh, Mr. Otis,
good evening.

789
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,849
I tell you, gentlemen, there is
no longer any choice before us.
Good evening, boy.

790
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:29,386
The alternative
to everlasting slavery...
The others are waiting for you.

791
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,489
All except
Sammy Adams, eh ?
Is war.

792
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:36,461
But out of that shall come
such a country as was never
seen
on this earth before.

793
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:41,231
A free country.
For this we will fight.

794
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,839
Good evening, gentlemen.

795
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:56,313
Mr. Otis, this place
properly belongs to you.

796
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,849
Thank you,
doctor.

797
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,688
There you are, sir.

798
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,827
Now, Sammy, let's see.

799
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,663
You had got as far as
"for this we will fight."

800
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:17,234
I've not always agreed with you,
but you are right in that.

801
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,671
In all conscience,
Mr. Otis, this committee
cannot declare for war.

802
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:23,007
Determination to defend
our rights, yes.

803
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,344
Necessary preparations
to do so. But war ?

804
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,880
Only if war
is made against us.

805
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,351
A splendid resolve, doctor,
but it doesn't alter fact.

806
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,522
The fatal shot will come,
whoever is to pull
the trigger.

807
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:40,758
When it does,
then fight we must
and fight we will.

808
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,860
But for what ?

809
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,429
This is the thing
we must know,

810
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,365
that the whole world
must know.

811
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,536
For what do we fight ?
Tell me that.

812
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,871
To rid ourselves
of these infernal redcoats !

813
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,376
That's no reason
for blood on our land, Paul.

814
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:03,648
We've earned these redcoats.
We've shouted our treason...

815
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:08,619
In the press and the public
squares for ten long years
without hindrance.

816
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:13,891
And did ever an occupied city
receive better treatment
than we in Boston have had ?

817
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:18,829
Where are the firing squads,
the jails filled with political
prisoners ?

818
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:22,800
The gallows erected
for Paul revere ?

819
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,837
Samuel Cooper ?

820
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:29,506
Sammy Adams ?

821
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,742
And Joseph Warren ?

822
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:39,550
I hate the presence
of these troops of the ministry
as much as any of you,

823
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:42,720
but we are not going off
into a civil war...

824
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,722
Just to get them
out of Boston.

825
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:48,525
Tell me why then.
Why do we fight ?

826
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,728
To end tyrannous taxation.

827
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:54,899
Something more important
than our precious pocketbooks.

828
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,668
- But what is it ?
- The rights of englishmen.

829
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:01,872
Ah !
Now we have a glimmer.

830
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:05,610
It is prophetic that
it should shine brightest
in the eyes of youth.

831
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,946
Rights, yes.
But why stop with englishmen ?

832
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:12,583
Is the earth so small
there can be room
for only one people ?

833
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:16,520
Or can we here fight for men
and women all over the world ?

834
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,726
That
there should be no more tyranny,

835
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:24,795
that a few men cannot seize
power over thousands,

836
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:27,464
that wherever the sun shines,

837
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,801
a man shall choose
who shall rule over him.

838
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,704
The rights of englishmen,
you say, lad.

839
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,473
The battles we shall win
over the worst in england...

840
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,610
Will benefit the best in england
until the end of time.

841
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,979
Even as we shoot down
British soldiers,

842
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:45,650
we will be winning rights
their children shall enjoy.

843
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:49,754
And the peoples of the world--
the peasants of France
and the serfs of Russia--

844
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:52,890
shall see freedom rising
like a new sun in the west.

845
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,894
Those natural rights
god has given every man,

846
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:02,432
no matter how humble...
Or crazy.

847
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:12,843
They say my injury bashed
the wits from my head.

848
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:15,012
That's what you think,
isn't it, Sammy ?

849
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,114
Certainly not, sir.

850
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,149
Perhaps it's true.

851
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,686
Some of us
will give our wits.

852
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:23,788
Some will give
our property.

853
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:26,757
Let those of substance
among you think of that.

854
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:30,627
Gold and jewels
and fine, great houses.

855
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:34,598
Hurts, doesn't it ?
You, friend Paul--

856
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:40,170
god made you
to fashion silver,
not to make war.

857
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:43,040
There's a time
for casting silver
and a time for casting Cannon.

858
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,009
If that isn't in the writ,
it should be.

859
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:48,145
And you, Dr. Warren--

860
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:52,016
what use are the fine mind
and the skilled hands
of the surgeon...

861
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:54,551
When they have been
mangled in battle ?

862
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,054
Then others must do
what I no longer can.

863
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:00,725
And you who are so young--

864
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:02,893
some of you must die.

865
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:05,562
To die young
is more than dying.

866
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,098
It's to lose
so large a part of life.

867
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,670
My old friend, my old enemy,
how can I call you ?

868
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:17,507
Even you will give
the best you have:

869
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,844
A genius
for politics.

870
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:23,680
And we need you, Sammy,
for we must fight this war...

871
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:28,585
In meetinghouse and congress
and the halls of parliament
as well as on the field.

872
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:32,022
But what it's all about,
you'll really never know.

873
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:37,762
And yet it is
so much simpler
than any of you think.

874
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:42,666
We give all we have,
we fight, we die...

875
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,769
For a simple thing:

876
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:47,571
Only that a man can stand.

877
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:54,544
You write as good a hand
as ever, don't you, lad ?

878
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:57,114
Yes, doctor.
Thanks to you.

879
01:01:57,147 --> 01:02:00,885
Address this to Mr. Adams
and Mr. Hancock at Lexington.

880
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,622
Good morning, Paul.
What's afoot ?
Good morning, doctor.

881
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:09,026
Oh, they're as busy
as red ants all over town.

882
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,296
No sign of a march yet.
The transports
in the harbor...

883
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:16,200
Are sending all their boats
way down here along the common.

884
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,803
Maybe they intend to row
the troops across to Cambridge.

885
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,971
Those boats
may be a trick.

886
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:24,875
General Gage won't need them
if he marches his troops
out across the neck.

887
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,978
What route do you intend taking
with our message
when the time comes ?

888
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:32,983
By way of Charleston. I have
a boat hidden at mill cove.
Good.

889
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:36,987
Billy dawes has volunteered
to try to get past
the guard post at the neck.

890
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:41,158
- One of you should get through.
- What if they don't ?

891
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:45,162
We've one messenger
they can't stop, Johnny:
The spire of Christ's church.

892
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:46,897
It can be seen
from the Charleston shore.

893
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:51,335
Friends there will be watching
for the lanterns in the belfry
tower when the redcoats march.

894
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,904
One if by land,
two if by sea.

895
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:56,706
One if by land,
two if by sea.

896
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,916
Johnny, this may be
important.

897
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,352
The colonel was making
a to-do with Caleb
over a saddle...

898
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,654
When that orderly
came looking for him.

899
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:14,791
I heard the orderly say,
"the general's
compliments, sir."

900
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,194
Let's see if Caleb's
heard anything else.

901
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,796
Hello, Caleb.

902
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,033
That fat-bellied,
redcoat colonel.
What happened ?

903
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,869
When he told me he wanted
his saddle shined,

904
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:27,704
how'd I know he only
used that one for show
around town...

905
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,374
And he wanted this one
for some country riding
tonight ?

906
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,642
"Country riding" ?

907
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:35,345
We'll help you, Caleb,
but you've got to remember
everything the colonel said.

908
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:40,784
Be a lot more help if you get
old Sandy out and look him over.
I gotta have him ready too.

909
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,654
He's too old for much of a ride.
That's what
I told the colonel.

910
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:48,125
He said he'd be better off
tonight on a horse he can trust.

911
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,862
Sandy will last the 17 miles
they have to go, all right.

912
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,830
Hand me that rag,
cilla.

913
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,668
I thought you were gonna help !

914
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:04,909
*

915
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:08,678
it's tonight, all right.
They're beating to arms
in every square.

916
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:10,847
It should be Concord.

917
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:13,918
We have much
of our powder there.

918
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,887
But 17 mile--

919
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:19,089
wait a minute.
Johnny.

920
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:22,659
Yes, sir ?
You've ridden most of the roads
for the observer.

921
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,896
Suppose they did use
their boats and began
their march at Cambridge ?

922
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,932
How far would it be
to Concord then ?

923
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,067
That'd make it 17 miles.

924
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,270
That's it.
Priscilla, do you think you can
get to Mr. Revere's house ?

925
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,839
Yes, doctor.
Tell him they're marching
on Concord.

926
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,675
He'll have to leave
at once.
Yes, sir.

927
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,445
Warn him they've moved
the somers up
off barton's point.

928
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,914
He'll have to cross
under her guns.
Yes, sir.

929
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:48,118
Johnny, I want you
to go to Mr. Robert Newman,
the sexton at Christ's church.

930
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:50,287
You'll likely find him
somewhere about the church.

931
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,323
Tell him too.
He'll understand.
Yes, sir.

932
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,231
You, boy.
What are you about ?

933
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:03,968
I'm on my way home, sir.
Time to get home
after we've gone.

934
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:05,970
Over here
with the others.

935
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:08,005
After him !

936
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,938
Are you
Mr. Newman ?
Yes, lad.

937
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:45,042
- Dr. Warren sent me.
- Down this Lane, men !

938
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:52,182
How many lanterns ?
Two.

939
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,184
Two.

940
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,492
I saw you
two-thirds across.

941
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:06,463
I knew
it could be no other boat.
Not this night, Paul.

942
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:10,034
Thank heavens the watch aboard
the somers didn't have
your eyes, Mr. Larkin.

943
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:11,968
I see you brought
the horse.

944
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:17,341
How do the redcoats go, Paul ?
And where ?
There's your answer.

945
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:20,510
To Concord by sea.

946
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:23,247
Thank Mrs. Larkin
for the use of the horse.

947
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,097
Turn out !
Turn out your militia !

948
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,770
Turn out !
Turn out your militia !

949
01:06:56,913 --> 01:07:00,250
Turn out !
Turn out your militia !

950
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:03,953
What's all the noise
down there ?
The redcoats are coming !

951
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:25,575
- Johnny ?
- Oh, it's you.

952
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,444
Johnny,
where are you going ?
Lexington.

953
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,946
But there may be
fighting there.
I know.

954
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,449
Oh, be reasonable for once,
Johnny tremain.

955
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:34,851
You don't even have a gun.
I'll get one.

956
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,455
And if you did, you wouldn't
know how to shoot it.
I'll learn then.

957
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:40,624
You'll get yourself killed.

958
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,826
Not if I can help it.

959
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,868
Bye, cilla.

960
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:03,247
Halt ! Halt !
Pull up there !

961
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,464
How can you eat
at a time like this ?

962
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:23,500
It was a long night,
and I'm hungry.
Where's Mr. Revere ?

963
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:27,637
He went to the Clark house
to warn Mr. Adams
and Mr. Hancock to clear out.

964
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:31,675
But where are the redcoats ?
That's what I want to know.

965
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:34,511
Ought to be along
any minute.
Major pitcairn anyway.

966
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:36,513
He's commanding ?
The advance party.

967
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:41,518
He was when I passed them.
Colonel Smith was back
with the main body.

968
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,553
What do you suppose
the advance party's for ?

969
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:48,024
Probably to clear us
out of here, so the rest
can get through to Concord.

970
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:52,662
*
all right, lads,
take your places.

971
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,931
Fall in.

972
01:08:54,964 --> 01:09:00,437
*

973
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,307
what are you doing here ?
Same thing you are.

974
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,642
You haven't got a musket.
That's why
I'm standing behind you.

975
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:08,278
So the redcoats won't notice.
Turn around.

976
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:13,250
*

977
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,124
Let everyone of you
remember your orders.

978
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,560
You are not to fire
unless fired upon.

979
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:27,231
We stand upon our rights,
not upon the force of arms.

980
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:30,967
Do not molest them
unless they begin it first.

981
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,038
*

982
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:39,108
column... halt !

983
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:47,083
No man will fire
except on my order !
Is that clear ?

984
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,220
No man will fire
without order !

985
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:53,390
Take care to display column
to the left !

986
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:57,261
- March !
- *

987
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:02,198
*

988
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:09,606
To the left !

989
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,641
Wheel !

990
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,112
We'll stand by our orders.

991
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:20,717
But if they mean
to have a war,
then let it begin here.

992
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,119
*

993
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,089
halt !
Front !

994
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:29,993
Are they gonna fire on us ?
I don't think so.
Just trying to scare us.

995
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:34,298
To the left !
Wheel !

996
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:37,734
*
halt !

997
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,337
*
lay down your arms !

998
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:50,647
Disperse, you rebels !
Why don't you disperse ?

999
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:04,694
Come on !

1000
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:12,469
Hold your fire !
Get back to your ranks !

1001
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:16,673
- Get back to your ranks !
- Get back to your ranks !

1002
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:19,275
Hold your fire. Get back.
Hold your fire. Get back.

1003
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:22,479
Return to your ranks.
Return to your ranks.
Get in here.

1004
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,281
Who fired that shot, sir ?
The first one.

1005
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:29,819
One of them, one of us,
someone in one of those houses
over there.

1006
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:32,722
I don't know.
What difference
does it make now ?

1007
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:41,331
*

1008
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:51,140
*

1009
01:11:57,481 --> 01:12:03,186
*

1010
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,780
There they are.

1011
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,255
Where are we bound ?
North bridge.
They're tearing it down.

1012
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:43,226
Does it mean fighting ?
We can't let them cut us off
from Concord, can we ?

1013
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:04,848
- Fall in !
- *

1014
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:08,785
*

1015
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:15,425
you'd better get out of this.
I'm gonna get one of those
redcoat muskets.

1016
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,561
Fire a warning shot.

1017
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,933
Shoulder, firelock !

1018
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,840
Make ready !

1019
01:13:37,481 --> 01:13:40,584
Present !

1020
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:49,192
Fire !

1021
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:52,662
Fire ho !

1022
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,439
Return to your ranks !

1023
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:07,911
- Hold your ranks, men !
- Hold your ranks !

1024
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:21,658
We've got 'em on the run !

1025
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:24,427
Let's keep 'em running
all the way back to Boston !

1026
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,431
*

1027
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,900
*

1028
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,352
*

1029
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:12,776
*

1030
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:20,884
*

1031
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,589
*

1032
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:46,576
*

1033
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:56,319
After them !

1034
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:13,903
First platoon, right !
Fire at will !

1035
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:43,366
*

1036
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,679
After them !

1037
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:15,732
*

1038
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:41,590
*

1039
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:09,853
History holds
no parallel to it, sir.

1040
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:11,755
An untrained,
undisciplined rabble,

1041
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:14,223
turning an orderly retreat
into a rout in spite
of anything we could do.

1042
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:17,493
They fired on us
from every tree and dunghill
the whole way back.

1043
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,997
But never once did we
have an enemy with whom
we could close.

1044
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,266
You see those campfires,
gentlemen ?

1045
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:28,905
Yesterday we ruled over Boston.
Tonight we are besieged in it.

1046
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:32,208
And still they come
from every village and farm.

1047
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:37,213
Tonight, 10,000.
Tomorrow, perhaps twice 10,000.

1048
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:40,116
We've experienced
more than a defeat,

1049
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,286
more than a mere
misfortune of war.

1050
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,992
We have been vanquished
by an idea, a belief
in human rights.

1051
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,115
Johnny !

1052
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:19,622
Oh, Johnny.
Cill...
How'd you get here ?

1053
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,724
Are you badly hurt ?

1054
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,594
Me ? Hurt ?
I'm tired, that's all.

1055
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:27,797
Been chasin'
redcoats all day.

1056
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:31,100
And I thought
you were--
that's all right, cill.

1057
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:33,803
Hey, you two,
give me a hand.

1058
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,779
Johnny,
I'm so glad it's over.

1059
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:47,683
Over ? Nothing is over.

1060
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:52,688
It's only a beginning,
a kindling of the flame.

1061
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,925
Feed it, lads...

1062
01:19:55,959 --> 01:19:58,828
As you fed it
with your blood today.

1063
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:03,299
It is the spark of Liberty
that you've touched afire,

1064
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,302
and its light must grow
until every dark corner
has vanished...

1065
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:08,938
And it illuminates
the world.

1066
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:11,174
* it's a tall, old tree

1067
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:13,977
* and a strong, old tree

1068
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:18,047
* and we are the sons
yes, we are the sons *

1069
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:23,920
* the sons of Liberty
