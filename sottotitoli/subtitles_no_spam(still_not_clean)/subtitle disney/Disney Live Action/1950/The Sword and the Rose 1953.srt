1
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,811
How go the honors, Henry?

2
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,613
Rack upon ruin.

3
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,448
The way these tricky
Frenchmen overmatch us,

4
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,350
they must have sold
their souls to the devil,

5
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,619
and that one's
the very devil himself!

6
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,288
Oh ho, brother, so
you've changed your tune.

7
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,257
Yesterday, you'd sell
your sister to the French.

8
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,042
Only to get you
a royal husband.

9
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,826
And don't brother and sister
me at a time like this!

10
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,635
Look you, ye beef-eating,
muscle-bound, flat-footed bunglers.

11
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,204
How dare you
call yourselves Englishmen!

12
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,641
<i>Is there no one here who can throw
me that arrogant Frenchman? Well?</i>

13
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,613
I would try,
your grace.

14
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,484
Who is that fellow? A newcomer, my lord,

15
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,220
late returned
from our foreign wars.

16
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,757
What do you know of him? His name
is Brandon. He's a gentleman, sire,

17
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,326
though without title. Title
be hanged! Can he wrestle?

18
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,861
<i>That I know not.
Hmm.</i>

19
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:52,337
Why not call upon my lord of Buckingham?
He could humble the Frenchman.

20
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,839
<i>That is, if he'd
hazard his finery.</i>

21
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,309
With pleasure,
my lady.

22
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,947
We thank you,
Master Brandon.

23
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,383
<i>But first the Duke of
Buckingham will try a fall.</i>

24
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,269
'Tis catch as catch can, milord,
so watch out for his feet.

25
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,604
He broke Courtney's
neck with 'em.

26
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,941
<i>Allez, Jacques!
Allez!</i>

27
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,434
<i>Watch his feet!</i>

28
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,842
<i>Hooray!</i>

29
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,546
Bravo, Buckingham!
Bully boy, Ned!

30
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,354
'Tis well you chose
the Duke. Well, indeed.

31
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,391
<i>I doubt if the newcomer could
have won for you. So do I.</i>

32
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:23,962
And yet, I wonder how he
would fare against Buckingham.

33
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,701
My lord Duke. Would
you care to challenge...

34
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,303
<i>Master Brandon
to a fall?</i>

35
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,909
<i>If it please
your grace.</i>

36
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,048
Henry, you must
stop it.

37
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,950
But it's heathen cruel. It
was you who first proposed it.

38
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,952
You wanted to see a
Christian thrown to the lion.

39
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,467
<i>Come on, milord!</i>

40
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,827
Well done, fellow! You're a
credit to England. Get up, Ned.

41
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,963
When you've recovered from your
beating, I'll trounce you at cards.

42
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,536
Your Christian bore
himself right manfully.

43
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,905
He'd make a handsome captain
of the guard. No doubt he would,

44
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,674
but were I to make him such,
you'd drive him from the court.

45
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,743
Why so?

46
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,811
'Cause I like him, and if I liked
him not, you'd fall in love with him.

47
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,813
If you think me
so perverse,

48
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,549
why don't you try hating
old King Louis of France?

49
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,984
Very well, then,
I'll decise him.

50
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,387
Then I'll hate him too.

51
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,690
You scheming little wench! But
you'll marry him nonetheless,

52
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,526
and I already have
guardsmen aplenty.

53
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,995
Will I ever learn not to
match wits with our king?

54
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,105
Brandon,
can this be you?

55
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,775
By Jove, you do make a
handsome captain of the guard.

56
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,043
I, I feel more like
a pouter pigeon.

57
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,880
Nay. You're a brave adornment
to the house of Tudor.

58
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,150
An honor I did not seek. My mind
was set on fortune in the new world.

59
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:01,486
I merely wished to visit our English
court until a ship came in at Bristol.

60
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,889
Why go a-chasing
halfway across the world?

61
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,424
Dame fortune's
an unpredictable wench.

62
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,092
She may be waiting
for you here.

63
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,660
She may well have
passed me by,

64
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,929
deeming me naught but
a monkey in a red coat.

65
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,098
Dame fortune
always knows a soldier.

66
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,833
The queen is less perceptive.

67
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,903
It seems her highness
mistakes me for an elder page.

68
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,539
She's charged me to deliver a
message to the Princess Mary.

69
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,607
Well, that's
no unpleasant duty.

70
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,176
I pray you
help me find her.

71
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,511
The princess is with her
ladies in the lower garden.

72
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,948
Thank you, sir.

73
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,118
And, Brandon...
Don't fall in love with her.

74
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,953
I didn't leave
my wits abroad.

75
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,889
Ah, but you haven't met
my Lady Mary.

76
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,127
Oh? Will I be blinded
at the sight of her?

77
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,497
Most men are.
Thank you, sir.

78
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,633
But have no fear. We
guardsmen never look above us.

79
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,208
Ah!

80
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,086
<i>Oh!</i>

81
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,894
Behold.

82
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,636
<i>Ladies.</i>

83
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,908
Have I the honor to find
the Princess Mary among you?

84
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,813
Is the Princess Mary a person
of so little consequence...

85
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,048
That she is not known to a
mighty captain of the guard?

86
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,960
Pray forgive a blundering
stranger of the court.

87
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,596
Since Princess Mary
is reputed to be gracious,

88
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,297
<i>I presume
she cannot be here.</i>

89
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,066
<i>Oh!</i>

90
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,306
I am
the Princess Mary.

91
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,306
If you have a message,
captain, deliver it.

92
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,954
Will your ladyship inform the
princess that her highness the queen...

93
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,188
<i>Awaits her coming
in the estate chamber.</i>

94
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,059
<i>Oh! Ooh!</i>

95
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,095
<i>Insolent fellow!</i>

96
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,031
There's impertinence!

97
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,833
Grating guardsman! He
should be put in the stocks!

98
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,570
I have never seen the like. Nor have I.

99
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,204
He acted like a man.
Oh!

100
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,874
Was that fellow
being troublesome?

101
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,843
No, milord, he did but bring
a message from the queen.

102
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,845
What does that Spanish
woman want of you?

103
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,081
I do not know, but as I am
compelled to do her bidding,

104
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,584
the game goes
to you by default.

105
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,254
I'd not win that way. There's
only one game I would win from you.

106
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,623
Oh, pray you, sir,
no more wooing.

107
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,024
You waste
your eloquence.

108
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,093
<i>Very well,
milady.</i>

109
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,798
Since eloquence is
denied me, I'll use logic.

110
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,300
Would you prefer
King Louis for a husband?

111
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,235
So you would win
by default.

112
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,937
'Tis no
laughing matter.

113
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,374
I have no fear
of Henry.

114
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,243
Nor would it be the first time
he's tried to trade me off.

115
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,613
It may be
the last.

116
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,350
The king has already sent his lord
chancellor to France to conclude a treaty.

117
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,684
You're to be part
of the bargain.

118
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,021
And you would dare to
oppose the king in this?

119
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,359
Milady, as lord high
constable of England,

120
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,127
I am master
of the tower,

121
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,296
and he who commands the
Tower, commands London.

122
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,332
And maybe
the kingdom?

123
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,005
Dangerous words for the
proud, Plantagenet duke.

124
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,874
I pray you do not voice
such thoughts to Henry.

125
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,877
I do not covet Henry's
throne, nor would I cross him.

126
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,346
But if it would serve your
need, I'd risk my head.

127
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:53,985
Dear, kind Buckingham,
I wish I could say yes.

128
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,055
But since my heart won't let me,
will you still remain my friend?

129
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,157
I will.

130
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,136
Good morrow,
Sister Kate.

131
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,809
When the Princess Mary
addresses me in public,

132
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,412
could she not find a term
of greater deference?

133
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,080
I paid your highness
the compliment...

134
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,282
Of calling you
my brother's wife.

135
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:29,087
I shall not presume upon the
intimacy again. Thank you.

136
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,257
And did your grace command
me here to tell me this?

137
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,428
I am concerned about
your may day ball. Oh?

138
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,799
It has come to my attention
that Sir Anthony Denny,

139
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,401
Sir Thomas Lovell,
Griffith and others...

140
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,071
Have as yet received
no invitation.

141
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,939
<i>True, your highness.
And why not?</i>

142
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,744
I have not as yet
made out the list.

143
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,047
But now that the royal
favorites have been singled out,

144
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,450
<i>I will give their names
my careful consideration.</i>

145
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,486
May it please
the queen's grace.

146
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,346
Sir Edwin?

147
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,863
Good Sir Edwin, will our
master of the revels...

148
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,300
Prepare a list of
invitations for my ball?

149
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,135
I will, milady.
The usual selection?

150
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,407
A new face or two might
make a pleasing diversion.

151
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,042
A real break
with tradition, milady.

152
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,046
Say a captain
of the guard...

153
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,148
To add
a martial flavor?

154
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,151
I doubt if the rowdy
fellow knows how to dance.

155
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:37,422
I'll wager ten crowns
he can. Strike on it.

156
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,458
Supposing we settle it tonight.
If you brought him privately,

157
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,260
we could try out his step
in my drawing room.

158
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,230
Excellent, milady.

159
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,132
In matters of this kind,
it's always best...

160
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,366
To observe the fellow
at close range.

161
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,276
¶

162
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,957
¶

163
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,964
I'm the richer
by ten crowns.

164
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,538
Will the princess forgive
my rudeness as a messenger?

165
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,208
It's I
who was wrong.

166
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,446
You could not have known me. I knew you.

167
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,183
Then I think you're
a very bold man.

168
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,153
And a very
good dancer.

169
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,995
Milady spoke too soon. I
have half forgotten the step.

170
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,334
Had you no time
between wars...

171
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,971
<i>For dancing with the French
and Spanish ladies? On occasion.</i>

172
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,307
But hardly
"la galliard. "

173
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,243
What did they dance? Why,
nothing but "la volta. "

174
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,379
Oh, then I must learn it.
What shall the tune be?

175
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,583
Can you play
a Coranto?

176
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,117
Oh, it's much
too difficult for me.

177
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,485
Let me try it.

178
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,957
¶

179
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,635
Sir! Boldness has its
bounds! I beg your pardon?

180
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,137
Would you turn our dancing
floor into a wrestling paddock?

181
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,041
On the contrary,
milady.

182
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,977
"La volta" has found favor
among ladies and gentlemen...

183
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,045
Of both the French
and Spanish courts.

184
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,014
But is that really
the way you dance it,

185
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,918
with your arm around her
- their waist?

186
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,954
I should not have dared to have ventured
upon such a familiarity otherwise.

187
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,589
<i>Did you say
the French court?</i>

188
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:56,060
Then as master of the revels,
I should see more of this dance.

189
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,097
If the princess would be so
indulgent, might not the Lady Margaret?

190
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,135
Milady has
no objection?

191
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,071
None whatever.

192
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,442
<i>¶
Oh!</i>

193
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,249
<i>Sir Edwin?</i>

194
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,986
Do you think me a prude? Nay, indeed.

195
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,358
<i>Oh, it's just
like flying!</i>

196
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,363
Whoo!

197
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,720
You're here as a guardsman?
As a gentleman.

198
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,289
Then I must ask you
to leave as a gentleman.

199
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,290
This is not
a common revel.

200
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,328
Did you hear me,
fellow?

201
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:13,404
Milord, you should know better than
to draw your sword in the palace.

202
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,207
As captain of the guard, I've a
mind to clap you in the gatehouse.

203
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,509
My lord duke!

204
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,312
Master Brandon did not
thrust his way in here...

205
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,448
But came at the personal
invitation of the princess.

206
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,985
Pray excuse us.

207
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,459
It is well you took him by surprise.

208
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,395
The duke's the deadliest
swordsman in the kingdom.

209
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,197
The Italian dueling masters
taught me a trick or two.

210
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:47,205
Room, room, room,
for the king's grace!

211
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,233
<i>Ahh!</i>

212
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,368
Is the princess ready
to choose her partner...

213
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,270
For the honor
of the opening dance?

214
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,533
<i>¶</i>

215
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,282
¶

216
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,218
¶

217
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,272
¶

218
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,193
¶

219
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,814
¶

220
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,235
¶

221
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,840
Well, sir?

222
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,256
Henry!

223
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,964
Bid the music cease!

224
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,887
Are the musicians
weary?

225
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,389
I ordered
the music stopped.

226
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,559
We cannot permit such
an indecent exhibition.

227
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,363
If your highness does not like
the way we do and dance at my ball,

228
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,632
you may retire
as soon as you see fit.

229
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,469
Will the king permit
me to be insulted thus?

230
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,637
I told you
she had sharp claws.

231
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:45,376
Shall I not have what music and
dances I like at my own ball?

232
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,250
That you shall,
sister mine!

233
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,922
Come, let the music
knock it!

234
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,658
We'll learn the step ourselves and
wear you ladies out at dancing too.

235
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,261
<i>¶</i>

236
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,919
Masterly.

237
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,055
Perfection itself,
your grace.

238
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,357
Master Brandon taught you
this dance, didn't he?

239
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,494
Yes, Brother. For mirth and
play, that fellow has no equal.

240
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,595
Pity he's only
a commoner.

241
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,998
¶

242
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,456
¶

243
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,535
<i>No.</i>

244
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:27,671
You've done more than
your share today, my beauty.

245
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,174
She has flown enough. 'Tis
time we tried the crossbow.

246
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,138
Now we'll see who's been obeying
my edict to practice archery.

247
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,176
<i>Ready your bows.
You too, Brandon.</i>

248
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,946
Set in the dogs.
Ho, ho, ho!

249
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,157
Well aimed, your grace! Fine shot, sir.

250
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,935
Bravo! Well done, Brandon!

251
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,203
I was but following
the royal example.

252
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,910
You ride ahead.
Go on.

253
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:53,491
Master Brandon!
Master Brandon!

254
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,092
I fear the girth
is loose.

255
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,008
'Tis tight as the horse
can well bear.

256
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,610
It's loose, I say.

257
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,912
I'm afraid
you were right.

258
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,549
Help me down.

259
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:10,167
The way you scowl, I marvel that
you came to my rescue at all.

260
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,136
<i>'Tis a guardsman's duty to
watch over the royal princess.</i>

261
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,573
A duty you've been
neglecting of late.

262
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,043
The king has kept us
busied with the hunt.

263
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:22,313
The while our summer beauties
are left to wither and die.

264
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:28,319
Did you never gather
a nosegay for a lady?

265
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,924
Then it's time you did.
'Tis my royal command.

266
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,272
And while you're about it, I'd
have you compose me a sonnet.

267
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:53,043
A sonnet?
I would not dare.

268
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,145
Can this be the bold
Charles Brandon?

269
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,250
<i>Were I
a better poet,</i>

270
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,253
and you, perchance, a burgher's
daughter, I might be tempted.

271
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,257
Pretend I am
a burgher's daughter.

272
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,093
Oh, please, sir,
will you try?

273
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,395
By royal command?

274
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,031
And sovereign decree.

275
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:26,243
O Mary mine, if thou wert
a burgher's daughter -

276
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:36,186
O Mary mine, wert thou
a burgher's daughter -

277
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,375
Go on.

278
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,320
O Mary mine, wert thou
a burgher's daughter,

279
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,890
yet thy fair self
in every other way,

280
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,359
I'd take thee with me
o'er the perilous water...

281
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,295
To the new world,
where none could say us nay.

282
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,335
O Mary mine,
sole mistress of my heart,

283
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:29,406
<i>fair jeweled star
set in the heaven above,</i>

284
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,743
<i>thou art a princess
in a world apart,</i>

285
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,978
of castles, diadems,

286
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,016
and of courtly love
beyond my dreams,

287
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,220
<i>for kings
will give thee gold,</i>

288
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,156
<i>and princes bring thee
gems from distant lands.</i>

289
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,862
The only wealth
that I may ever hold...

290
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:55,466
Are these fair flowers
for thy maiden hands.

291
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,472
Yet fragrant they'll remain,
and richly green,

292
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,745
if they're remembered
by a golden queen.

293
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,750
Oh, Charles.

294
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,487
How can you be so cruel?

295
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,457
In order
to be kind.

296
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,427
Is it kind to throw my
royal station in my face?

297
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,330
I must not forget it, milady.
I would, if you would let me.

298
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,868
Help me, Charles.

299
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,136
Milady,
I beg of you.

300
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,072
Am I a statue
on a pedestal?

301
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,218
<i>Milady!</i>

302
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,954
The hunt has reached the
castle. You will be missed.

303
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,215
<i>Ned!</i>

304
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:25,222
What think you if I were to bestow
knighthood upon Charles Brandon?

305
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:28,025
A man of parts and quite
deserving, no doubt.

306
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,927
No doubt
at all.

307
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,996
If you did bestow knighthood
upon Charles Brandon,

308
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,499
I'm sure the Princess
Mary would be overjoyed.

309
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,102
What?

310
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,178
Fiddle-faddle. That's
the general epidemic...

311
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,380
As far as
she's concerned.

312
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,150
Every man at court's
been struck.

313
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:56,186
But has the Lady Mary herself
ever been smitten before?

314
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,959
<i>No, by Lucifer, she
hasn't. Your highness.</i>

315
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,362
My lord chancellor and the
ambassadors from France...

316
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,064
Beg audience
with your grace.

317
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,365
Send them in.

318
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,872
King Louis must have
come to terms.

319
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,507
That's the physician
to cure my little sister.

320
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,984
"O Mary mine, sole mistress of my heart
-"

321
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,356
How does it go, Charles?
The part about the star?

322
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,658
Oh, I've forgotten,
milady.

323
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,061
Then you shall make me another
verse tomorrow. Au revoir.

324
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,964
Good-bye, milady.

325
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:45,269
My name is Mary.
Princess Mary.

326
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,979
Good-bye.

327
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,387
And, in conclusion,
your grace,

328
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,960
Would signalize
the alliance...

329
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:14,364
And guarantee everlasting peace and
amity between England and France...

330
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,334
By taking unto himself
in marriage...

331
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,537
The king's own sister,
the Princess Mary Tudor.

332
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,374
It likes us well,
this loving offer...

333
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,310
From our dear brother
of France.

334
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:33,684
And how much English gold does
he want to sweeten the bargain?

335
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:37,220
My most gracious master wishes it
understood that the matter of dowry...

336
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,589
Is of secondary
importance.

337
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:44,261
The person of the princess, seen by
him only on this painted medallion,

338
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:47,264
<i>bespeaks a maiden of so mild
and gentle a nature...</i>

339
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,069
That our king already
anticipates a love match.

340
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,236
Then you'll forego
the dowry?

341
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,741
Not quite,
your grace.

342
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:01,545
The sum of... Half a million
crowns has been proposed.

343
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,181
Half a million?

344
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,084
Odd's death! Why doesn't that old
usurer ask me to melt down my crown!

345
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,457
Give me leave,
good friends of France.

346
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,092
A word with
my counsel first.

347
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,333
My lords, I'm no
huckster and no haggler.

348
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:33,477
Let's offer old goat face half of what
he asks and see if he'll accept it.

349
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,113
I bargained with Louis for days, sire.

350
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:39,416
400,000 is the very
least they will consider.

351
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:43,353
Even so, they wish the world to
believe the sum a half a million.

352
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,323
Let the world think the sum a billion,
so be it we save a fifth of the gold.

353
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:49,393
I propose you raise the
full 500,000 crowns. What?

354
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:52,129
Give them
their 400,000,

355
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:56,233
and put the odd 100,000 in your
own private coffers, my king.

356
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:59,302
Ah! Well hit, my lord chancellor.

357
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,105
What say you,
Ned?

358
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,177
Our English citizens might
prefer to see their princess...

359
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,446
Wedded to an English lord.

360
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,549
Whose sister is she?
Theirs or mine?

361
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,185
By my faith, Ned,
I'm all amazement.

362
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:18,655
Would you deny me
a paltry 100,000 crowns?

363
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,557
Nay, not so, sir!

364
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,225
Then you shall raise
the money.

365
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,463
Our citizens of London
will listen to you.

366
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,499
Me, milord King? Aye. Take it up
with the mayor and corporation.

367
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,601
They'll kick like mules at such a tax.

368
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,337
Why did I make you
my lord high constable?

369
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,607
If they refuse, clap 'em in the
tower; that'll make 'em disgorge.

370
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,843
And the lesser rogues
will follow their example.

371
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,411
'Tis settled, sir.

372
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,149
Wolsey will disclose the
final terms of the agreement.

373
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,417
Merci, sire.

374
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,389
And now, if I may
wait upon the princess,

375
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:56,226
I have gifts
from my royal master.

376
00:34:56,228 --> 00:35:00,831
Poor though they be, they will
serve to exhibit his love and esteem.

377
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,439
Sir John! Go to the Princess
Mary and bring her to us straight.

378
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,459
Thank you. Meg, I may as well tell
you that I am mightily displeased.

379
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,764
A princess is not entitled
to much privacy, I know,

380
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:39,136
but certain things cannot be shared
with a prying, meddlesome Abigail.

381
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,837
I quite understand,
milady.

382
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,340
When a princess stoops
to pursue a commoner,

383
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,475
she must, indeed,
want privacy.

384
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,345
But what about
the commoner?

385
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,614
Would you put his neck in jeopardy
for the sake of a springtime dalliance?

386
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:55,318
Dalliance? I pray it is no more.

387
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,554
And what
if it is?

388
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,157
Then God defend you both.

389
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,327
Yes?

390
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
<i>With license
of your highness,</i>

391
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,503
the king commands you
to the royal presence.

392
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,339
The French ambassador
would offer his devoir.

393
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,441
Inform the king that I
am not disposed to come.

394
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,246
I will convey
your apologies to his grace -

395
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,515
No apologies. Just say
that I will not come!

396
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,458
Milady, you were born
to marry royalty.

397
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,761
<i>The king will see
that you do.</i>

398
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:39,963
It's time that you all
understood that Mary Tudor...

399
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,598
Will marry a beggar
if she chooses.

400
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:57,547
Y- your grace,
my liege.

401
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,250
<i>The princess wishes me to convey
- Come, Sirrah, speak up.</i>

402
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,822
She says
she will not come.

403
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,791
What?
Is this an answer?

404
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:11,361
Am I to be flouted under my own
roof? Defied by this titmouse?

405
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,730
Oh!

406
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,333
Odd's thunder! If she'll not
wait upon us, we'll wait upon her!

407
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:28,245
Where is she?
Milady is indisposed.

408
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,916
<i>Mary!
Yes?</i>

409
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,252
Come forth and receive
the ambassadors of France!

410
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,656
I command you!
Do you hear?

411
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,625
<i>Yes, Brother dear. Are you coming?</i>

412
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,327
<i>No,
Brother dear.</i>

413
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,271
Well met,
Brother.

414
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,908
Come in, gentlemen.
I will arise at once...

415
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,312
And receive you all
informally.

416
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,347
Cover yourself,
hussy!

417
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,983
Oh, nay, Brother. When the
king commands, I must obey.

418
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,452
Milady!

419
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,335
What a captain-general that jolt-head
would have made had she only been a man.

420
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,337
<i>My lord king?
Huh?</i>

421
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,505
A word with you
alone, sire.

422
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,510
Hmm!

423
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,914
We must forgive the Lady Mary, milords.

424
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,983
The sudden shock
of great events...

425
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,986
Has quite disordered the delicate
maiden balance of her mind.

426
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,856
Let us to our palace
at Greenwich...

427
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,026
And leave the princess
to the quiet of Windsor.

428
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,529
I can assure you that
when next we see her,

429
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:55,598
she will have remembered the
manifold gifts and kindnesses...

430
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,101
She has received
from an indulgent brother...

431
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,804
And the duty she owes
our royal person!

432
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:03,073
Come, let's to
Greenwich straight!

433
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,797
As soon as they've departed,
send word to Charles Brandon.

434
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,433
Tell him to meet me
in the library presently.

435
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,936
Milady, I beg you not to
continue in this madness.

436
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,839
The king will have his way in
the end. Not if I make haste.

437
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:39,075
Mary
- milady. If you won't serve me, find me a page.

438
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,877
You know I will
do your bidding.

439
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,074
Your highness.

440
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,412
Where is
Charles Brandon?

441
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:18,148
He resigned his place at
court and is off to Bristol,

442
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,417
there to take ship
for the new world.

443
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,086
Without a word
of good-bye?

444
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:40,904
And I thought his mention
of the new world mere poetry.

445
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,206
It was a decision he could
not have made lightly, milady.

446
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,491
<i>Well met, Sister.</i>

447
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,696
Go to her,
De Longueville.

448
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:15,505
Permit me,
most gracious princess,

449
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,741
that I may have the honor,
on behalf of King Louis,

450
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,977
to offer this
little testament...

451
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,079
Of his admiration
and love.

452
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,626
This is my answer,
sir.

453
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,997
Go home and tell
your silly old master...

454
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,665
That it is thus
I regard his suit!

455
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,503
Let me pass!

456
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,675
<i>By the soul of my father
and holy church,</i>

457
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,044
you'll marry Louis of
France within a fortnight,

458
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,947
or I'll have you whipped to
death on Smithfield pillory!

459
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,651
To horse!

460
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,664
There you are,
captain.

461
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,633
Thank you,
sir.

462
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:22,705
You'll find your quarters
of the very best, sir.

463
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,842
Now, if you'll just whistle up
a good westerly wind...

464
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:28,278
Come 50 days, I'll have you
in the new world.

465
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,147
<i>If we get the breeze, when do
we sail? On the first tide, sir.</i>

466
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,083
We'll send a boat ashore
for you all in good time.

467
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,623
There's no hurrying
the tide.

468
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,060
I'll warrant you a good five hours
before yon ship weighs anchor.

469
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,262
Be at your ease now, sir,
and drink your morning beaver.

470
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:55,638
Charles!

471
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:58,975
<i>Lady Mary!</i>

472
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,023
Are you alone,
my lady?

473
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,996
You must be mad! A
princess cannot run away.

474
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:21,598
How many hours of grace
do you think you'll have...

475
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,601
Before the king's officers
catch up with you?

476
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,603
No one saw me leave. And long
before I can be apprehended,

477
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,272
you and I will be on
our way to the new world.

478
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:32,675
It's out
of the question.

479
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:34,677
How can you say that?

480
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,247
Perhaps you do not feel
about me as I do about you.

481
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,752
I wish it were
as simple as that,

482
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,954
but the fates
are against us.

483
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,724
As yet no sailing master will permit a
woman on so long and perilous a voyage.

484
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,760
All that I know.

485
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,029
But any gentleman may
take his page along.

486
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,304
<i>You'd hazard this
for me?</i>

487
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,288
Your breeches are too
short. Untruss your points.

488
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,269
Now let's
see you walk.

489
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:09,272
<i>Don't
overdo it.</i>

490
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,978
<i>That's better.
Now you must not smile.</i>

491
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,248
You're far too beautiful
when you smile.

492
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:21,350
Oh, Charles!

493
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,056
Now scowl. That ship's master's no fool.

494
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:32,995
Here, boy,
my sword.

495
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:36,733
Now fall in
behind me.

496
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:52,482
<i>Ahoy, maintop!</i>

497
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,252
<i>Clear off
the arm!</i>

498
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,488
<i>Haul away!</i>

499
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,260
Here you are,
sir.

500
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,998
Now there's
courtesy for you.

501
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,835
Or is that what passes for
shore manners these days? Sir?

502
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,505
Are you wont to let your page
elbow you out of the doorway, sir?

503
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,241
No, by thunder!

504
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:25,848
Pardon, Master.
I forgot myself.

505
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,450
<i>Very well, but I'll cuff you
if you do it again!</i>

506
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,222
Does he suspect? No, but I'll feel
safer once we're out of Bristol Harbor.

507
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,463
Of course, he must never
know that you're a princess.

508
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,334
I think we may
count on THIS:

509
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,303
Should he discover that you're
a woman once we're out to sea,

510
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,906
he'll come to terms
rather than put back.

511
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:52,508
Very well, then. I'll not show
my face outside this cabin.

512
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,346
Weigh anchor!

513
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,282
<i>Aye, aye, sir!</i>

514
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,156
<i>Oh, let me do it. I
must learn. Anchor away!</i>

515
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,492
<i>We're moving.
¶ Heave Away, Boys ¶</i>

516
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:13,496
<i>Oh, Charles!</i>

517
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,001
<i>Indistinct singing ]</i>

518
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:29,011
Captain's respects, sir. All hands on
deck to drink a round to the voyage.

519
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,351
<i>I'll do the honors
for both of us.</i>

520
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,222
Rouse out,
ye lubbers!

521
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,059
Here's your
wine, sir.

522
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,996
Where's your page,
Master Brandon?

523
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:50,066
All must drink, sir. We'll
have no Jonahs aboard.

524
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,902
The poor lad's under
the weather. Sick, is he?

525
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,171
Well, sick or not,
let's have him out here.

526
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,174
I'll
fetch him.

527
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,881
A pint of wine will do him
more good than a drench.

528
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,321
Fill another bowl.

529
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:15,224
And a drink
for you, sir.

530
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,429
Now then,
bon aventure!

531
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,098
Bon aventure!

532
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,405
Caps
overboard!

533
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,341
Hooray!

534
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:42,318
Hold there, young fellow! Would you slight
an old custom and put a hex upon our voyage?

535
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,620
<i>Come, lad. You're no
better than your master!</i>

536
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,188
<i>Chuck
your hat over!</i>

537
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,159
Bilge and bedlam!
'Tis a wench!

538
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,128
A pretty lad.

539
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:12,214
<i>Set the sails aback! Pull up
the long boat! Aye, aye, sir.</i>

540
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,983
So you'd sail under
false colors, would you?

541
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,019
<i>Why, with a woman
aboard my ship,</i>

542
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,487
we'd be at the bottom
of Davy Jones' locker

543
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,589
before we're halfway
down the Channel.

544
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,391
Here's your passage money.
Put them ashore!

545
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:44,647
<i>Charles
Brandon?</i>

546
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,450
I arrest you in the king's
name for high treason.

547
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:50,419
I am charged to convey you
to the Tower of London.

548
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:54,290
Your royal highness will accompany
me to the royal palace at Greenwich.

549
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,058
A private word with
Master Brandon first.

550
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,032
Do not despair, Charles. You
will not languish in the Tower.

551
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:06,769
So long as I live,
my thoughts will be of you.

552
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,771
I know
my brother Henry.

553
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:12,508
Once he's shouted himself hoarse,
he will be reasonable enough.

554
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,542
Good-bye,
dear Mary.

555
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,446
You and I will be
together within a week,

556
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:20,549
or my name
is not Mary Tudor.

557
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,018
Nor can it be
otherwise...

558
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,154
Until I add
the name of Brandon.

559
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:43,072
My lord cardinal, good
morning. And to you, Ned.

560
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:45,274
<i>God save your grace.
My liege, I thank you.</i>

561
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,063
What's
your business?

562
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:53,681
<i>The matter of Charles Brandon.
That traitor!</i>

563
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:56,719
Since the abduction of a princess
is an act of high treason,

564
00:50:56,721 --> 00:51:00,556
<i>a warrant has been drawn
up for his execution. Hmm.</i>

565
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,629
<i>Hmm.</i>

566
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,408
Your grace, her highness Princess
Mary has arrived and begs an audience.

567
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,711
She does, does she?

568
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,481
Tell the wanton, shameless drab
she needn't show her face to me!

569
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,550
<i>Hold!</i>

570
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,587
Have her in.
We'll receive her.

571
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,569
I hope I find
you well, brother.

572
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,604
Well enough.

573
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,875
I see
you're blooming.

574
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,878
Nothing like a sea voyage to
put a glow in a maiden's cheek.

575
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:04,120
Brother, what I have to say
would be better said in private.

576
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,490
I've no secrets
from my counselors.

577
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:11,527
<i>Well? I am here not on my own behalf,</i>

578
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:14,230
but to speak for
Charles Brandon.

579
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:16,899
His arrest
is unjustified.

580
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:21,337
No doubt of it.
A mere matter of high treason,

581
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,305
causing trouble between
England and France.

582
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,841
And compromising the king's
sister as a common jade!

583
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,243
He did nothing
of the kind.

584
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,548
You may accuse me of
indiscretion, but nothing more.

585
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,517
Thanks to
Charles Brandon.

586
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:38,554
Hmm? When you attend
the rites tomorrow,

587
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:42,324
do not fail to convey our
gratitude to Master Brandon.

588
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,494
Do you intend to stretch
his neck or shorten him?

589
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:52,168
A prisoner of such consequence deserves
the dignity of the ceremonial ax.

590
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,904
He does indeed!

591
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:57,840
You mean,
he must suffer death?

592
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,578
It's the usual result when the
head is separated from the body.

593
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:10,286
If there is any guilt,
it is mine.

594
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:13,222
Charles Brandon did not offer
to take me to the new world.

595
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,823
I forced myself
upon him.

596
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,595
If you are determined to
punish someone, punish me.

597
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,499
Your pleading comes too late.
The warrant's signed.

598
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:27,469
Please, my brother.

599
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,573
Spare him, and I will
do anything you ask.

600
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,416
Will you marry
Louis of France?

601
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:43,586
Yes...

602
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,589
Even that.

603
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:55,231
I wonder, your grace,
if it would be wise? Eh?

604
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:59,468
Might she not endanger our treaty
being at best an unwilling wife.

605
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,238
<i>Our relations with France
are in delicate balance.</i>

606
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,906
Dare we run the risk
of further insults...

607
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,308
Flung in the faces of those
we would embrace as friends?

608
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,846
My liege, if I may
make so bold.

609
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:16,585
'Tis said that when the Lady
April mates with December,

610
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,487
she is looking forward
to a warm July.

611
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:24,393
So, my lord, with the
Princess Mary. Louis is old.

612
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,599
'Twill be a world's wonder
if he lasts a 12-month.

613
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,267
<i>Now, might not the lady behave
more dutifully in France,</i>

614
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,303
<i>if the choice of a second
husband could be her own?</i>

615
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,576
Well and good!
You have our promise!

616
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:44,346
Anyone I may
choose?

617
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:46,048
Even the devil
himself...

618
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,350
So be it you hurl no coronets
while Louis lives.

619
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:56,392
And now will my dear, kind brother
let an innocent man out of the tower?

620
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:59,995
No. We will release the prisoner
when you've proven yourself a queen.

621
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,332
But one more trick, even an interchange
of letters between you and that fellow -

622
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,437
Inform the French ambassador
the marriage can go forward.

623
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:15,044
And now, if you please,
milord.

624
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,084
Bless you,
my daughter.

625
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:33,395
Thank you...
With all my heart.

626
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,877
I have but one
CONSOLATION:

627
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,384
And since I cannot
go to him,

628
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:59,655
will you tell him of
my bargain with the king?

629
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:02,591
I will.
My truest friend.

630
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,095
And most devoted.

631
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,533
¶

632
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,869
¶

633
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:46,902
My lords, today we have added
to our fleur-de-lis...

634
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:50,873
This loveliest
English rose.

635
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:56,678
Ye noble knights, come.
Pledge with me your love.

636
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,615
<i>The queen of France!
¶</i>

637
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,618
¶

638
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:10,092
Cousin Francois, since my
queen is a stranger among us,

639
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,195
a pleasant labor
falls to your lot.

640
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:18,567
As dauphin and my heir,

641
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:22,104
I appoint you and the
Princess Claude, your wife,

642
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:25,874
as guides and governors in all
matters that should concern...

643
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,177
A queen of France.

644
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,487
You shall find me ever
willing, sovereign lady.

645
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:45,461
You are quiet, Mary,
and you neither eat nor drink.

646
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:50,165
This kingdom of France
quite overwhelms me.

647
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,768
So it must,
my love.

648
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,505
But soon I will take you away
from all these staring faces...

649
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,562
Where we'll
be alone together.

650
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,546
Not so, majesty, our guests
have come to honor us.

651
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,183
If I seem to mope,
do not indulge me...

652
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,587
But rather show me
my duty.

653
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:15,891
Show them your duty.
Me, your love.

654
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:44,786
Sire, as your physician,
I beg of you...

655
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:47,022
That in consideration
of your delicate health -

656
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,924
Listen!
Old pills and plasters!

657
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:53,061
'Twas I got married today,
not you!

658
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:54,897
Hmph!

659
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:07,643
Sovereign lady,
red wine of Burgundy...

660
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,045
Serves the need of our
most beautiful queen.

661
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:12,581
Thank you.

662
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:58,260
Milady, please
accept another one.

663
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:01,597
Merely to watch such loveliness
waste her warm lips...

664
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,968
Upon the cold glass
has quite intoxicated me.

665
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,236
Pray keep your compliments for
she who has a right to them.

666
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:13,275
Who would live by candlelight
once he has seen the sun?

667
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,190
Avert the eyes!

668
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,738
I fear, your highness, that
under the circumstances,

669
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,874
I must be in personal
attendance upon His Majesty...

670
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,376
Throughout
the entire night.

671
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,179
I quite understand.

672
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,268
So your lordship has finally
condescended to pay me a visit.

673
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,405
What has prompted this
extraordinary honor?

674
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:19,207
A promise I made to Her Royal
Majesty, the queen of France,

675
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,878
<i>she that was
Mary Tudor...</i>

676
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,080
<i>And is now the bride
of King Louis XII.</i>

677
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,684
You find that hard
to believe?

678
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,020
I do.

679
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,056
What boundless simplicity.

680
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:39,327
Are you dolt enough to imagine
that because a princess...

681
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,730
Had a last fling with you
that she'd marry a commoner?

682
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,467
Oh, she wept,
I'll admit.

683
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,303
And before she accepted
the crown of France...

684
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:51,239
And the jewels
and the silken gowns,

685
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,175
she had an hour's remorse
over you.

686
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:59,314
In fact, she wrung a promise from me since
she could not move the king on your behalf.

687
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:05,887
It was her wish, no doubt
to still her conscience,

688
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:09,057
that you be allowed to pursue your
interrupted journey to the new world.

689
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:16,064
Most thoughtful of her. And you'll
take it on yourself to release me?

690
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,067
Not openly, no.

691
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:22,204
I dare not risk
the king's displeasure,

692
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:25,273
however much I may desire to
oblige the exalted queen of France.

693
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,945
But an escape
might be arranged.

694
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:15,337
Is the king ready? His Majesty
is now being elevated, your grace.

695
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:55,043
I love these early
hours in the park.

696
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:59,180
And the late ones in the
ballroom, dancing the night away.

697
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:02,650
The hours fleet so swiftly
when I am dancing with my king.

698
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:07,222
I like this gay life too.
I have never felt younger.

699
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,193
But when will we
be alone together?

700
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,328
We are alone
together now.

701
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,265
Well... Yes.

702
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:21,336
But always in sight
of others.

703
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:25,673
Others? I can see no others
when I'm with my king.

704
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:30,145
Have I ever told you how... Gallant
and commanding you look astride a horse.

705
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:31,413
How dashing!

706
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,468
Allons!

707
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,580
A moi.

708
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,217
Allez, venez.

709
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:23,131
Ammenez tout
de suite le roi.

710
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,347
At last I have caught up
with the queen of my heart.

711
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:41,416
Your queen prefers
to ride with her king.

712
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:43,551
Impossible.

713
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,732
Be not dismayed, Madame. Life
will not always pass you by.

714
01:08:57,734 --> 01:09:00,835
One day you will have
a real king for your husband.

715
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:03,204
Never! Nor are you
worthy to be king.

716
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:08,510
Worthy or no,
you will soon make me one.

717
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:13,781
Each morning I think, "She will put
an end to that weak old man today. "

718
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,584
Tout passe,
tout lasse, tout casse.

719
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:19,287
And why,
as you English say,

720
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,223
the pace that kills.

721
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,448
Is he greatly exhausted?
Worse than that.

722
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,855
His condition gives me cause
for the deepest concern.

723
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:01,796
I did not realize how...
Very frail he is.

724
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:05,466
I pray you, Madame, it would
be malavise to disturb him now.

725
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,438
I will keep
you informed.

726
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,950
Margaret, I want you to go
on a mission to England.

727
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,886
At once.

728
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:30,858
Arrange for Sir Edwin to accompany
you. And leave you here alone?

729
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:34,562
King Louis is dying,
Margaret.

730
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,432
He may not
last the day out.

731
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:42,837
When he is gone, you know
what lies in store for me.

732
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,976
Dispatch you now
to London in all haste.

733
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:50,612
Seek out my trusted friend the
Duke of Buckingham at the Tower.

734
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:57,652
<i>Milady has kept the terms
of her agreement.</i>

735
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:59,854
<i>She would have
her brother keep his.</i>

736
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:02,523
Now that the French marriage
has ended,

737
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,959
she begs you to exert your
influence with King Henry.

738
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,796
Urge him to release Charles
Brandon from the tower...

739
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:10,498
And send him
straight to France.

740
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,036
Would that I might.

741
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,439
Milord?

742
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:25,880
Charles Brandon attempted a foolish
escape and was killed by the guards.

743
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,982
His body lies
at the bottom of the Thames.

744
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,854
Poor, hapless man.

745
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:38,459
And milady,
my poor dear Mary.

746
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,665
What will become
of her now?

747
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:46,367
<i>We must seek the king
without delay. You cannot.</i>

748
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:50,038
His grace is in
the north country.

749
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,940
<i>Every moment increases
the danger for Mary.</i>

750
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,610
Francois will scarce be crowned
before he forces himself upon her.

751
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:59,647
Then I myself shall go
to France at once.

752
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:05,987
Tell Henry when he returns
his sister's plight was such...

753
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,057
That I took it upon myself
to serve as his ambassador.

754
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,767
<i>Me master.</i>

755
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:23,004
Would you be Sir Edwin Caskoden? I am.

756
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,873
It's been a main hard
task searching you out, sir,

757
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:29,444
among the highroads and byroads
and little small lanes of London.

758
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:34,082
Day after day I watched and
asked and waited for you...

759
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:37,485
'Til I fair forget me gainful
occupation of selling Coster apples.

760
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,793
Thank you, sir,
and God bless you, sir.

761
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:48,029
Do you know where the man who
wrote this letter is lodged?

762
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,565
Lodged is the
grand word indeed.

763
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,567
Me pigs lie better
than that poor gentleman.

764
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,670
Can you take us to him?
I can, sir.

765
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:58,539
Though the sight of so a
fine lady on bankside might...

766
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,709
Draw attention as you might say
where 'twould better go unnoticed.

767
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,412
I'll go on to Greenwich
and await you there.

768
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:05,546
I pray
it is true.

769
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:19,894
Your Majesty, his grace,
the Duke of Buckingham.

770
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:32,840
My counselors inform me that my dear
brother of England wants his sister back.

771
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:36,611
He does, your majesty. And I
want her to remain here in France.

772
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,415
I shall make her
my queen.

773
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,884
But what of Your Majesty's
present wife?

774
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:46,687
The kingdom comes first.

775
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:49,891
Indeed my mind is so set upon
an alliance with England...

776
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,626
That I must
harrow my heart...

777
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:56,097
And set aside
my dear wife, Claude.

778
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:59,901
I know my master, sire. Henry
of England will never agree.

779
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,305
I know him too.

780
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,674
How vexed he was at the exorbitant sum
he sent to France for Mary Tudor's dowry.

781
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:13,548
But I would ease his mind
and gladden his heart.

782
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:18,719
Already I have dispatched my ambassador
to restore the full sum to his royal coffer

783
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,122
<i>in lieu
of his fair sister.</i>

784
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,458
Has the Lady Mary
been told of this?

785
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,893
The matter does not
concern her as yet.

786
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:28,162
I would speak with her. Milord,

787
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,632
you waste your time.

788
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,236
I have my orders.
My coach leaves Paris at noon.

789
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,505
I expect Mary Tudor
to be in it.

790
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,511
Even though you take her home,
Henry will send her back to me.

791
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:45,213
That's for Henry
to decide.

792
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:48,983
Tres bien.
L'audience est terminee.

793
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:50,918
Depars!

794
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:10,505
My dear, dear friend,
again you have rescued me.

795
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:13,608
Was there ever another
such as you?

796
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,948
And now tell me
what I want to know.

797
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:24,018
What would you hear first?
About Charles Brandon, of course.

798
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,343
What is it?

799
01:15:32,344 --> 01:15:33,660
Would the king not
let him leave the Tower?

800
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,565
He left it,
but in the dead of night.

801
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,968
The guards,

802
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,204
<i>knowing only that he was
an escaping prisoner -</i>

803
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:57,552
Why did he do it?

804
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,556
My dear, he was
a most adventurous man.

805
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,126
So restless
a spirit...

806
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:07,929
Could never be
imprisoned.

807
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:39,093
There she is, flying
Buckingham's flag.

808
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,228
<i>They're awaiting his return.</i>

809
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,331
We could waylay him on the
road from Paris to Calais.

810
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,066
I'd rather seek him out
than wait an ambush.

811
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,650
Where are we? The
little church at Wimille.

812
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,920
You almost slept
the clock 'round.

813
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:10,257
While they're changing horses,
you shall have some refreshment.

814
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:13,027
I could not eat.

815
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:17,932
You must. Come, Father Pierre
is noted for his hospitality.

816
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,327
Il faut bien manger pour
affronter les crises de la vie.

817
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:04,145
Life should seem better
on a fine morning like this.

818
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:06,247
And you've a long life
ahead of you, Mary.

819
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:12,119
Are you strong enough
to face another dilemma,

820
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,954
almost as intolerable
as the first?

821
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,992
I'll face it better
in England.

822
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:21,762
You may not remain in England
unless we solve it now.

823
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,065
It wasn't easy to free you
from King Francis.

824
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:28,803
He let you go only because he's
certain to have you back. Never.

825
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,805
He's already sent to Henry

826
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:34,275
the full amount of the dowry
you brought Louis.

827
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:36,243
<i>With it he hopes
to buy you for himself.</i>

828
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:38,479
Henry will refuse it.

829
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,383
400,000 crowns?

830
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:46,253
And all for his
private coffers.

831
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,489
He promised me my choice
of a second husband.

832
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:53,160
You heard him.
'Twas you who proposed it.

833
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:57,298
Thank God I did.

834
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,999
You and I shall hold him
to that promise.

835
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:05,005
We've only to step into that little
church and Father Pierre will marry us.

836
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,742
<i>Then you need fear no king
on either side of the water.</i>

837
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:13,280
No one can take the place
of Charles Brandon.

838
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:16,350
I will not be demanding.
I will respect your grief.

839
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,286
Then remain my friend.

840
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,357
Please do not talk
of love again... Ever.

841
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:29,263
Don't touch me! You were less
squeamish with Charles Brandon.

842
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:36,537
Am I so low and loathsome? The blood
of Plantagenet kings flows in my veins,

843
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:38,472
you brat
of a Welsh farmer.

844
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:48,949
You'll have me, madam, or I'll take
you straightway back to King Francis.

845
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:03,497
Charles!

846
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,369
The foremost knight and first
swordsman of England...

847
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:09,970
Forgot that killing
never thrives by proxy.

848
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:18,012
Mary, you start ahead
with Sir Edwin.

849
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:36,564
Will you let me draw?

850
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,098
Did you let me?

851
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,537
I do not cross swords
save with an equal.

852
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:46,307
But I would make you
the exception.

853
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:50,377
Thank you, milord duke. Once I've seen
milady safe, I shall accept with pleasure.

854
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:10,164
Milord!
Come on!

855
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,152
Hurry!

856
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,533
They've got Her Highness
with 'em! Come on, lads.

857
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:29,243
Hold them off until
I get Mary aboard the lugger.

858
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,285
Have at them!

859
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:19,119
They say in Italy it is not all brawn
and hewing that makes a swordsman,

860
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:20,387
but the parry and thrust.

861
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,133
You need two hands
for this game.

862
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:57,791
I've the weapon for him,
sir, if you'll say the word.

863
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:59,226
Stand back.

864
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,274
Ain't you going to do
for him, sir?

865
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,478
I could not be
so merciful.

866
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:52,279
<i>Mary!</i>

867
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:57,417
Your grace.

868
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:04,758
Oh, Henry!
Dear, dear Henry!

869
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,560
If you knew what it was
like to be home again!

870
01:26:07,897 --> 01:26:09,429
Come, come now.

871
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,304
Pardon my emotion,
Brother.

872
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:20,841
It's just the sight of
your good English face.

873
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:27,381
Ah, enough of this! You've
no cause for such display!

874
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:29,850
No cause!

875
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:34,922
Do you know what I've suffered
at the court of France?

876
01:26:34,924 --> 01:26:37,224
The vile insults
I've endured...

877
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:40,260
From that licentious dauphin
now puffed up into a king?

878
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:47,301
You could not dream of the contempt
in which he holds your royal person...

879
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,937
<i>Nor his palpable scorn
of our island kingdom...</i>

880
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:53,473
Headed by
the prince of usurers.

881
01:26:57,413 --> 01:27:00,614
How now, milord, think you to bribe the
king of England like some house lackey...

882
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:01,882
Or common scullion?

883
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,917
Permit me, sovereign lady,

884
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:07,588
I do but bear a gift of treasure
from His Majesty King Francis,

885
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,356
who begs of you to make him
your husband.

886
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:13,260
I already
have a husband.

887
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:19,433
Brandon!
I thought you were dead.

888
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,338
A false impression created by the
Duke of Buckingham, your highness.

889
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:27,374
Buckingham?
Where is Buckingham?

890
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:30,377
Your grace, I know
something of this matter.

891
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:33,480
Sir Edwin bears witness that the duke
of Buckingham paid the assassin...

892
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:35,782
And dares not show
his face in England.

893
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:40,921
We'll deal with him hereafter. With
you, Charles Brandon, now. Come here, sir

894
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:44,458
<i>how dare you marry into the
royal house without our consent?</i>

895
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,460
It was with
your consent, my king.

896
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:49,763
I had your plighted word given
before our eminent cardinal...

897
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:54,268
That I might choose a second
time as my heart led me.

898
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:59,373
Only forgive my widow's sensibility that
shunned the royal pomp and public show...

899
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:02,476
Attendant on a second wedding
and chose instead...

900
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:05,379
A simple service
at a quiet church in Dover.

901
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:09,383
You modest violet.

902
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:11,852
You shrinking,
blushful daisy.

903
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,524
Pray take the gold away
and tell your wicked master...

904
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,693
<i>That the king of England
is not yet so mean...</i>

905
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:21,995
That he would sell
his sister into slavery.

906
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:23,063
<i>Mary!</i>

907
01:28:25,434 --> 01:28:28,869
Forgive my lady wife, sire, if sometimes
she is forward and forgets herself.

908
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:36,076
The gold is not yours to accept
or refuse. 'Twas given to the king.

909
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:41,048
Forgive her too for her unseemly words
against the generous king of France,

910
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:45,052
who, out of his largess, has sent your
royal person this pledge of his affection.

911
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,657
Should you not consider it, sire,
like the Lady Mary herself...

912
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:53,026
As a loan repaid?

913
01:28:57,966 --> 01:28:59,866
Monsieur,
il faut consulter.

914
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:07,107
Hands off!

915
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:14,715
Rather than be thought churlish or
ungentle, we will accept the gold.

916
01:29:14,717 --> 01:29:18,385
Convey to our dear brother of
France our heartfelt thanks!

917
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:33,533
We cry you mercy. Here
we recovered our sister...

918
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,135
And gained
a newfound brother.

919
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:37,938
And now we would
be alone.

920
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,084
Charles, we owe you much.
What do you want?

921
01:29:51,086 --> 01:29:53,620
I have all I want.
I haven't.

922
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:58,158
He'd make a handsome
duke of Suffolk. Hmm?

923
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,596
Eh? Yes!
I'll make him duke of Suffolk!

924
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:06,466
Thank you,
Brother.

925
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:16,009
No!
I earned that money.

926
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:17,911
It was given to me!
Eh, Charles?

927
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:22,082
The title alone
will not feed us.

928
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:27,487
Very well, I'll give you 20 manors
and their rents to gild the title.

929
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:32,559
Brother, my own dear -
No!

930
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:37,164
No more! The dukedom and
20 manors on one condition!

931
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:41,201
That you take this plaguey, conniving little
baggage down to Suffolk and keep her there!

932
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:46,673
If she remains at court,
she'll wheedle my ears from me!

933
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:52,712
And, Charles,
beat her thrice a day.

934
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,981
Ha-ha-ha!

935
01:30:56,819 --> 01:30:58,151
And now, sir,

936
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:02,489
how dare you take me to task
in front of the entire court?

937
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,025
I love you.
