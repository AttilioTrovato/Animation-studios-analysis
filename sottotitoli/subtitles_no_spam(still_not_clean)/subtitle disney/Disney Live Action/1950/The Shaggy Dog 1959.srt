1
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,415
Arf! Arf!

2
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,485
<i>¶ He was the
shaggiest dog ¶</i>

3
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,555
<i>¶ he was the
shaggiest dog ¶</i>

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,259
<i>¶ he was the spookiest dog
I ever did see ¶</i>

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,064
<i>arf! Arf!
Arf!</i>

6
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,199
<i>Go on, get outta here!
Go on!</i>

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,802
<i>Git!</i>

8
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,772
<i>¶ I saw that dog
upon a stair ¶</i>

9
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:43,108
<i>¶ I looked again
and he wasn't there ¶</i>

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,278
<i>¶ I looked once more
and what did I see ¶</i>

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,114
<i>¶ that great big shaggy dog
a-grinnin' at me ¶</i>

12
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,217
<i>¶ he was the shaggiest dog
I ever met ¶</i>

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,354
<i>¶ he was the shaggiest dog
oh, what a pet ¶</i>

14
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:59,091
<i>¶ he was the spookiest dog
I ever did see ¶</i>

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,794
<i>¶ how do I know
well, give a listen to me ¶</i>

16
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>¶ he was the
shaggiest dog ¶</i>

17
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,167
<i>¶ he was the
shaggiest dog ¶</i>

18
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,603
<i>¶ he was the spookiest dog
I ever did see ¶</i>

19
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,807
<i>¶ how do I know
well, give a listen to me ¶</i>

20
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,692
<i>¶ I'll catch that dog
one happy day ¶</i>

21
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,829
<i>¶ I'll tie him up
I'll make him stay ¶</i>

22
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:40,199
<i>¶ I'll make him fetch
I'll make him heel ¶</i>

23
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,801
<i>¶ I'm gonna prove</i>
<i>to all the world</i>
<i>he's really real ¶</i>

24
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:46,305
<i>¶ he's the shaggiest
raggiest, spookiest dog ¶</i>

25
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,641
<i>¶ in town ¶¶</i>
- arf! Arf!

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,552
<i>This is a
shaggy dog story.</i>

27
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,892
<i>It could have happened anywhere
or to anyone.</i>

28
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,664
<i>It so happened that
it happened to Wilson Daniels,</i>

29
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,869
<i>a man who loved people
but hated dogs.</i>

30
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,771
<i>Go on, get out of here!
Go on! Git!</i>

31
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,674
<i>Go on,
get out of here!</i>

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,154
Morning, dear.
- Good morning,
dear.

33
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,763
Blast!

34
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>Yes, dear?</i>
That's ridiculous! Of all
the sickly sentimentality!

35
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,638
Giving a medal to a dog!
Don't get the paper
in the butter, dear.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,475
Making a big hero
outta him!
- What'd he do?

37
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,478
He dragged a baby
from a burning building.
Who couldn't do that?

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,713
Don't upset yourself,
Wilson.

39
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:06,518
Dogs!
Yapping and snapping
at a man's heels!

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,422
"Man's best friend."
If I ever find the idiot
who said that...

41
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:14,893
Most people love dogs.
I suppose I'm some kind
of freak because I don't.

42
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,530
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, dear.
Frankly, I think...

43
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,935
That dogs don't like mailmen
because sometimes they bring
bad news.

44
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:26,638
<i>Animals sense</i>
<i>those things, you know.</i>
Ahh!

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,676
Frieda, I am proud
of the 20 years I've spent
in the mail service.

46
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:34,580
Neither snow, nor rain,
nor sleet, nor dogs ever kept me
from my appointed rounds.

47
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,848
But those
blasted dogs tried!

48
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,651
You were very brave.

49
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,521
Where are the boys?
They had breakfast
early.

50
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,756
They're in the cellar
tinkering with something.

51
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,792
What with this time?
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,895
Is there something called
an "issle interceptor"?

53
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,897
"Issle interceptor"?
- Mmm.

54
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,399
You must mean
"missile interceptor."

55
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,768
Frieda,
I've been thinking.

56
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,572
As long as you're not taking
a firm hand with wilby, I've
got to do something about it.

57
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,941
What do you mean, dear?

58
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,510
For one thing, that mess
he got us into last week.

59
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,447
Which mess was that?
<i>The one where...</i>

60
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,950
He had the police throw the
new Dean of the divinity school
into jail as a public enemy.

61
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:16,021
Oh, well, that was
because of the picture
on the bulletin board...

62
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,457
<i>In the</i>
<i>post office.</i>
- Yeah.

63
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,926
It did look a little
like the new Dean.

64
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,263
What I propose to do
about wilby is...

65
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,265
Missile interceptor!

66
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,873
Grandmother hessy's
China!

67
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,419
Maybe you better
switch it off, wilby.

68
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,522
How can I switch it off?
I haven't switched it on yet.

69
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,396
Maybe we better take it
out to the launching site.

70
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,564
Yeah, hurry!

71
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,004
Never mind.
It's too late!

72
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,341
Get the upstairs area
cleared. Hurry up!

73
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:20,952
Pop, could you and mom
come outside now and
sort of hurry, please?

74
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,025
Well, save something!

75
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,401
Moochie,
where's wilby?

76
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,937
He's still
in the basement.
Still in the...

77
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,808
Come on, wilby!

78
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,396
Well, I guess we've
officially entered
the rocket age,

79
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,732
eh, pop?

80
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,871
It would be great to be
up there riding it,
wouldn't it, pop?

81
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,543
I wish I was on it
right now.

82
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,613
Wilson!

83
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,427
Pop sure was
sore.
- Yeah, I know.

84
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,497
I always seem
to rub him the wrong way.

85
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,773
Wilby?

86
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,942
Pop, how'd you
get up here?
I piled up some boxes.

87
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,745
I'm sorry to have
to say this to you,
but I want you...

88
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,047
To get rid of all that
junk in the basement.
All, sir?

89
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,151
All of it! I want you
to dismantle the workshop,
bury those chemicals,

90
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,421
and give away all those
mechanical gadgets.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,556
I want you to
lose or give away
or do something...

92
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,426
With all the mice,
hamsters, bats, crickets,
bugs, snails...

93
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,962
And heaven knows what other
plagues of mankind lurk there.
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:15,534
Now, get down off this roof,
both of you, before you fall off
and ruin the flower beds.

95
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,903
Be careful.
Those boxes look
kind of rickety.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,105
I'll do all right.
Thank you.

97
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,812
We better get down
from here!

98
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,826
Hi, Allison!

99
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,698
Ohh!

100
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,869
That's old knothead for ya.
Always showing off!

101
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,173
<i>The flowers!</i>
<i>That's just what</i>
<i>pop said not to do.</i>

102
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,548
You all right,
wilby?
- Sure, I'm fine.

103
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,817
Buzz, may I talk to you
for a moment?

104
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,487
Excuse me.

105
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,093
Look, wilby,
I'm in a hurry.
What about my seven bucks?

106
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,162
What about it?
- Cough it up.

107
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,832
Pop pulled the plug
on my allowance.
Look, I'm sorry.

108
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,168
You know how it is.
I've got a date with Allison.

109
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,972
I'm sick and tired
of financing
your romances.

110
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,108
I'd like to take
Allison out myself.

111
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,178
Y-you want a date
with Allison?
- And why not?

112
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,715
Wilby, have you ever
taken a girl,

113
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,584
any girl,
out on a date?

114
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,220
Well... not exactly.

115
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,824
Now you want to move
right in on the most
popular girl in town.

116
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,860
<i>Buzz, are we or are we not
gonna play tennis?</i>

117
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,863
Coming.
Excuse me.
- Just a minute,
buzz.

118
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,682
Great sufferin' cats!

119
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:19,257
Ah, chiffon.
J'adore tes yeux bruns,
mon petit chou...

120
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,561
<i>Tu es chou
toi maintenant.</i>

121
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,563
Wha...
What's she sayin'?

122
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,666
Ne pense pas a te sauver,

123
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,701
tu comprends?

124
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,703
Baby.

125
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:43,782
Frieda, what are you doing?
Just having a look at
the new neighbors, dear.

126
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,285
They're moving into that
gloomy, old coverly mansion.
You ought to be ashamed.

127
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,288
Give me my glasses.
Who are they, anyway?

128
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,291
He's the new
assistant curator at
the county museum,

129
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:57,095
a man by the name
of andrassy,
Dr. mikhail andrassy.

130
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,998
Doctor, huh?
- My reports
aren't in yet,

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,367
but Murphy Jones, who
leased the place, told me...

132
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,836
I'd rather not know how
you get your gossip,

133
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,838
but what else
do you know about them?
Well,

134
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,341
he's supposed to be
a well-known art expert.

135
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:13,211
He spent some time in
a prison camp after the war.
Reason, unknown.

136
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:18,083
He worked in the
famous uffizi museum
in Florence, Italy.

137
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:21,119
<i>There is a daughter,
seventeen years old.</i>

138
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,755
<i>Been studying art
in Paris.</i>

139
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,924
How dare they bring
a camel into this neighborhood!

140
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:30,228
No... it's a dog!

141
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,664
A blasted, dratted dog!

142
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:37,035
One
bratislavian sheepdog.

143
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,371
Supposed to be
a very rare breed.

144
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,841
I'm going to have to move
into the back bedroom.
Don't start falling apart.

145
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,945
That dog thing
is all in your mind!
All in my mind?

146
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,247
I itch, my sinuses
are ballooning up,

147
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,916
my throat is constricting
so I can hardly breathe.

148
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,020
Those old pekingese wounds
on my ankle are throbbing
like bongo drums.

149
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,390
You say it's all in my mind!
If you say so, okay!

150
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:01,359
Come along, Wilson.
Lie down and
rest for a while.

151
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,434
Wait a minute.
What about
my seven bucks?

152
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,875
What do you know?
I think he likes me.
That's his problem.

153
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,711
I'm more interested in
the little mam'selle
who owns him.

154
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,047
You shouldn't be running across
the street like that, dog.

155
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,817
You're liable
to be hurt.
- By golly,
you're right!

156
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,386
I'll bet she's
worried about him.
I better take him back.

157
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:32,424
Come on, pooch.
Wait a minute.
This dog came to me.

158
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:37,062
All right, come on along.
Maybe ol' buzz
can teach you something.

159
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,401
Well, of all the nerve!

160
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,945
Yes?
- We brought back
your dog.

161
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,414
- The mam'selle's dog.
<i>- Qui est-ce, Stefano?</i>

162
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,884
Deux jeunes gens.

163
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:05,390
Ah, chiffon, qu'as-tu fait?
D'ou viens tu, vilain.

164
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,759
Et qu'est-ce
que je peux faire
pour vous?

165
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,995
Um, uh, me...

166
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:15,200
Uh, bring...
Uh, dog... you.

167
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:20,004
Him, me...
We do this.

168
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,273
<i>What is it,
franceska?</i>

169
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,910
Chiffon ran away and
these two nice Indian boys
brought him back.

170
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,346
Indians,
this far east?
We're not...

171
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,348
I mean,
we're not Indian.

172
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,284
I didn't know
you spoke English.
But, of course!

173
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,788
<i>- My daughter speaks</i>
<i>seven languages.</i>
- - How many do you speak?

174
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,795
My name is franceska,
and this is my father,
Dr. andrassy.

175
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,232
How do you do, gentlemen.
Bring that over here, please.

176
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,467
I'm buzz Miller.
This is wilby Daniels.

177
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,537
He lives
down the street.
Then we're neighbors!

178
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,240
Won't you come in?

179
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,180
You'll have to excuse the house.
We're just moving in, you know.

180
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,283
Boy, look at all
the stuff!

181
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,319
Some of it is stuff,
but some of it
is rather priceless.

182
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,256
Look.
Here's a titiano.

183
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,493
A tintoretto, a rodin
and a vecchini.

184
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:27,038
This is a very
fine piece, a forzini,
early 16th century.

185
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,975
Probably worth,
oh, three or four
thousand dollars.

186
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,112
<i>I believe there's an</i>
<i>El greco over there</i>
<i>in the music room.</i>

187
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,114
<i>That's another
tintoretto.</i>

188
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,149
<i>I'd better put it
out of the way.</i>

189
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,320
Well, look at that!

190
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,091
I've never seen chiffon
take such a fancy to anyone!

191
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,428
He sure is friendly!

192
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,299
Who's she?
- Lucretia borgia.

193
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:59,037
You remember the borgias,
of course!
Oh sure. Who?

194
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,573
The borgias were
notorious during
the dark ages in Italy.

195
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:05,076
<i>Some people say the borgias
dabbled in black magic.</i>

196
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,378
<i>Black magic?</i>

197
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
<i>Hey!</i>

198
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,317
The dog in the picture,
isn't he the same kind
as this one?

199
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,220
Yes, a bratislavian
sheepdog.

200
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,288
The breed has mostly
died out now.

201
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,191
Chiffon is one
of the few left.

202
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,528
It's very lonely for him,
poor petit chou.

203
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,197
Excuse me, franceska.

204
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,235
Would you be good enough
to take the orsini artifacts
to Dr. Howard at the museum.

205
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,403
He's waiting
for them.
Certainly, father.

206
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,206
Why don't I drive you down?
My car's right outside.

207
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,143
Wait, we'll both
take you.
I'll get my purse.

208
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,146
What's the big idea?
I thought my driving
made you nervous.

209
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,949
The only thing about you
that makes me nervous...

210
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,252
Is my $7, if you know
what I mean?

211
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:52,090
All right, if you
want to come along,
glad to have you.
- Thank you.

212
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:56,427
What a sweet
little museum!
Yeah, it's not bad.

213
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,964
I put in quite a bit
of time around this place
studying the arts.

214
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,034
Then how come you
got lost gettin' here?

215
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,971
Say, that's not
a bad-looking deal!

216
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,040
C'est charmant.

217
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,378
Personally, I go in for
the old Egyptian stuff
like that.

218
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,348
That figures.

219
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,454
Franceska?

220
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,258
<i>Buzz?</i>

221
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,995
Buzz?

222
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,471
Buzz!

223
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,529
Buzz!

224
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,555
Eh! Eh!

225
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,561
You scared me, professor.
You ought to be.
Serves you right.

226
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,130
You shouldn't be wandering
around here until
the exhibit is open.

227
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,332
I've worked day and night
to get it ready.

228
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,370
I'm sorry, professor plumcutt.
I was looking for
some friends of mine.

229
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:49,073
You know me?
Why of course!

230
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,677
It's wilby Daniels,
isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,080
I used to deliver
your paper.
- So you did!

232
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,216
Or did you?
Come to think of it,

233
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,319
I don't recall getting
my papers lately.

234
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,623
No, sir. I gave up
my route two years ago.
Oh! Oh, well.

235
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,793
That just goes to show
how often I read a newspaper.

236
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,462
Nothing interesting happens
to people these days.

237
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:15,666
Now, in the delightfully
evil days of the borgias,

238
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,637
something interesting
happened to people
every day.

239
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:25,109
Yes, sir.
I guess they did, sir.
I'd better...

240
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:29,814
Wilby, do you realize
that this civilization
knew all about sorcery,

241
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,818
even about shape-shifting
and the casting of spells?

242
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,256
What's shape-shifting?
<i>Shape-shifting</i>
<i>was the medieval art...</i>

243
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:42,360
<i>Of borrowing</i>
<i>somebody else's body</i>
<i>to live in for a while.</i>

244
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,729
A most interesting practice.

245
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,532
You've heard all about
people being changed...

246
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,735
<i>Into cats, dogs</i>
<i>and other creatures,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

247
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,272
Ah, professor, you don't
believe in this stuff, do you?

248
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:59,477
Well, it may surprise you
to hear, my boy, that I do.

249
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,613
<i>I know people laugh
at these things today,</i>

250
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:06,751
but if they were honest,
they'd admit that there
are moments...

251
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:12,356
On dark and lonely nights when
something stirs within us...

252
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,226
<i>And reawakens ancient
fears and beliefs.</i>

253
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:19,097
I'd better be going now.
I have to find my friends.

254
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes, come in
and see me again.
Look out!

255
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,409
Sorry.
- No, no.
It's all right.

256
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:41,752
Oh, look, wilby.
Run along now, will you?

257
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,788
I-I'll take care
of these.

258
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,359
Are you sure
it's all right?
Yes, please. Please.

259
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,532
Well, they say
it takes all kinds.

260
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,447
Then it's a date?
- It's a date.

261
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,582
Good deal!

262
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,651
I wonder what happened
to wilby?

263
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,721
Don't worry about knothead.
He loves museums.

264
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,756
Bye, now.
- Au revoir.

265
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,568
Hi, wilby!

266
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,914
Who gets the mice
and the hamsters?

267
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,384
Pete hammers.
He always wanted 'em.

268
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,587
Mickey Warren gave me a buck
for your chemistry stuff.

269
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,390
I promised to throw in
Harry the bat for free.

270
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:57,295
What about
old Zachary here?
I couldn't unload him.

271
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:01,899
Nobody wanted him.
Poor ol' Zack.
I know just how you feel.

272
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,436
Come on, wilby.
Quit feelin' sorry
for yourself.

273
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:10,241
Pop'll get over it.
Yeah, pop'll get over it,
but I won't.

274
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,344
I'll still be
the same mixed-up guy
I've always been.

275
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,613
All right, boys.
Time for bed.

276
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,616
If you haven't finished,
be sure and finish tomorrow.

277
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:22,587
Be right up, pop.

278
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,790
You comin', wilby?
- In a minute.

279
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:46,911
What the heck is this?

280
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,248
How do you suppose...

281
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,685
Oh, I know. It must have
fallen in when I knocked over
the professor's case.

282
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,358
"In canis corpore,
transmuto."

283
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,693
Sounds like Latin.

284
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,596
Wish I knew more than
just first-year Latin.

285
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,300
Canis? Canis?

286
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,469
That's "dog."

287
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,305
Dog... into dog,

288
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,941
something... transmuto.

289
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:21,045
"In canis corpore,
transmuto."

290
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:24,815
"In canis corpore,
transmuto."

291
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,858
It's a transmuto,
and away we go...

292
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,627
With a Doe-see-Doe.

293
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,521
Wait a minute!

294
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,689
What's going on here?

295
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,096
Stop! Now wait,
somebody, whoever you are.

296
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,832
I was just kidding!

297
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,473
<i>Wilby!</i>

298
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,643
<i>Wilby, come on now.
It's getting late.</i>

299
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:37,988
No. No!

300
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:48,566
No. No!

301
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,935
- No-o-o!
<i>- Wilby?</i>

302
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,937
Yipe!
- <i>Wilby.</i>

303
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,806
Ohh!

304
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,042
Wilby, come on up now.
It's getting late.

305
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,010
Okay, pop.

306
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,715
You catching a cold?

307
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,551
Your mother told you
to wear a sweater down here.

308
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,721
A sweater?
I've got a sweater.

309
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,891
Well, come on up now.

310
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:21,465
Oh, poor pop.

311
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,902
This'll kill him.
What'll I do?

312
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,740
Gosh, what'll I do?
Professor plumcutt!

313
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,576
He'll know.

314
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:37,481
Now, to get by pop.

315
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,854
¶¶

316
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,699
¶¶

317
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,631
Professor plumcutt?

318
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,905
Hello, fellow.

319
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,907
I've gotta
talk to you.

320
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,009
You know, dogs are
not allowed in here.

321
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:43,948
I'm not a dog.
I'm wilby Daniels.

322
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,684
Wilby Daniels!

323
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:50,554
Are you really?

324
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,823
Well, well!

325
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,892
You know,
I'm not surprised.

326
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:59,730
The first time I saw you
I said to myself, "that boy's
a potential shape-shifter."

327
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,566
Is that what
happened to me?
- Of course!

328
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,735
How on earth
did you manage it?

329
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:09,740
I think this ring had
something to do with it.

330
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:13,577
The borgia ring!

331
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,614
Where did you find it?
I've looked everywhere for it.

332
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,817
Well, uh, it fell in
the cuff of my trousers.

333
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,952
Thank you very much
for returning it.

334
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,922
It's a very rare
and unusual ring.

335
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,191
Professor!
- What's the matter?

336
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,827
- What about me?
- What about you?

337
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,764
I don't wanna be
a dog!
- <i>You don't?</i>

338
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:37,868
No, of course not.
Can't you help me?

339
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,237
Yes, but... how?

340
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:45,009
Apparently you've become
involved with some old spell
cast upon this ring...

341
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:48,546
Probably by
one of the borgias.

342
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:51,048
It sounds
just like them.

343
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,019
How do I get out of it?
Don't ask me, my boy.
How should I know?

344
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:59,023
There are all kinds of spells.
Some of them break themselves
after a while,

345
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:02,726
while others come and go
like a headache.

346
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,563
Come and go?
- Yes. Sometimes
you'll be a dog...

347
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,698
And sometimes you'll be a boy
for hours at a time,

348
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,833
sometimes longer.

349
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,836
You never can tell.
That's what makes it
so interesting.

350
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,706
Well, how can I
break the spell?

351
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:19,310
An act of heroism
might break the spell.
Heroism?

352
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,580
Of course! Why didn't
I think of it first?

353
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:27,818
Heroism has always been
an important and most potent
factor in breaking spells.

354
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,988
Do you remember
"the hound of Florence"?
<i>"Hound of Florence"?</i>

355
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,325
<i>No, sir.</i>
- It's the famous story
of a young man...

356
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,927
Who was changed into a dog,
just as you have been.

357
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,599
He was in love with
a beautiful girl, and one night
got into a terrible fight...

358
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,668
Defending her against the
intentions of an evil Duke.

359
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,705
The Duke grabbed the dagger
and plunged it into the dog.

360
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,840
The dog fell to the ground,

361
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,910
and as the poor animal
lay there with the dagger
deep in his heart,

362
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:56,714
he suddenly changed back
into a man again.

363
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,949
Dagger in
the heart?
- Yes.

364
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,352
That'd kill me!

365
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:05,923
No, no. You, you don't
grasp the point of the story.

366
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:10,160
What I was trying to say
is that it is possible
to break such a spell.

367
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:14,064
Now, you must excuse me.
I have work to do.

368
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:19,403
Isn't there anything
I can do?
Yes. Be happy...

369
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:23,073
And keep a stiff
upper lip.

370
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,344
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

371
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:41,725
<i>One-l-two-nine, code six,
one-a-seven-nine, no warrant.</i>

372
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,662
<i>One-two-four-nine, Roger.
All units out at once.</i>

373
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,730
<i>Stand by.</i>
- Oops, sorry.

374
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,833
Oh, that's all right.

375
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,736
What'd you say?
- Hmm?
I said, I'm sorry.

376
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:55,973
That's what
I thought you said.

377
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,964
Kelly?
Yeah, what's the
matter with you?

378
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:24,902
You see a dog
just then?
Yeah, why?

379
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:28,839
Did you hear...
Hear what?

380
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,908
Forget it.

381
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
Forget it, I said.
Forget it!

382
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,882
All right, then.
I'll forget it!

383
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,488
<i>¶¶</i>

384
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,259
¶¶

385
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:45,175
Wilby, moochie!
Time to get up!

386
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,317
Be right with ya,
pop.

387
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,424
Hey, wilby, I had
the funniest dream last night.

388
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:04,494
I dreamed that
you were a dog.

389
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,331
Come on, wilby.
Wake up.

390
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,434
It was the greatest dream.

391
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:15,005
You came in this room
as a big ol' shaggy dog.

392
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:23,180
Hey, wilby,
wake up.

393
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,085
Oh boy!
How'd you get in here?

394
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,921
How did I get in here?
I live here.

395
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:34,925
You talk
just like wilby.
- I am wilby.

396
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:38,028
No, you're a dog.
Where you goin'?

397
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,898
Dog?

398
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,902
Oh! It can't
be true! No!

399
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,304
Do you think pop
will let me keep you?

400
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,539
Shut up a minute.
Let me think.

401
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,609
I'll be good to ya,
honest I will.

402
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:57,948
Boy, we'll have
great times together.
Great times together?

403
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,051
<i>What are you talkin' about?</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>
Uh-oh.

404
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:04,388
I hope pop
won't shoot you.
- Huh?

405
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,691
He swore that the
first time he caught a dog
in this house he'd...

406
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,994
<i>You two better be outta</i>
<i>bed when I get up there.</i>
<i>And open that door!</i>

407
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,196
Yipe!
Here he comes.

408
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,232
Hurry!
Get under there.

409
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,267
Come on!

410
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,240
All right,
come on, you birds.

411
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,309
Good morning, pop.
Good morning,
moochie.

412
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,478
How are you
this morning?
Very fine, thank you.

413
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,683
Wilby?
- Pop!
Listen to this.

414
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,953
Very nice.
Now stop playing it
and get dressed.

415
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:39,189
But, pop,
I just learned it.

416
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,191
Very good.
Now, get dressed.

417
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,294
Wilby, I want you
out of that bed right now!

418
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,663
And you
brush your teeth.

419
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,169
Oh, that was
a close one.

420
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:56,473
<i>Don't worry, boy.</i>
Gosh, why did this
have to happen to me?

421
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,110
It's just terrific, wilby.
How'd it happen?

422
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,313
I don't know exactly.
Remember,

423
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,583
<i>we were down in</i>
<i>the basement last night?</i>
Uh-huh.

424
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:10,120
Morning, dear.
Good morning,
dear.

425
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,599
Frieda, have you seen
any dogs around here?

426
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,302
Of course not.
They wouldn't dare.

427
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,606
Are my eyes
getting puffy?

428
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,342
You've always had
puffy eyes, dear.

429
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:37,280
I know that, but they feel
like they're getting puffier.

430
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,752
Frieda, if I thought
for a moment that...

431
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:53,397
- Frieda, I hope I can trust you.
- What do you mean?

432
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,633
You're always telling me
how much moochie wants a dog...

433
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,635
Yes?

434
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:02,172
I know you two wouldn't
gang up on me, but...

435
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:05,509
Sometimes I get the feeling
that you're not in sympathy
with my problem.

436
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:09,079
Wilson, I think
you'd better eat your eggs.

437
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,257
Did professor plumcutt
say...

438
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:23,527
You had to stay a dog
all the time?
- He didn't exactly know.

439
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,396
- Gee, I hope so.
- You what?

440
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,100
Gosh, you know how much
I always wanted to have a dog.

441
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,369
I'm not gonna be
your dog!

442
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:37,174
I'll teach you all kinds
How to sit up,
beg, roll over...

443
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:40,477
<i>And all that stuff!</i>
Cut it out, will ya?

444
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:43,613
<i>Boys!</i>
Stay here. I'll tell him
you're not hungry.

445
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,816
Hungry? I'm starved!

446
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:50,387
- You like nice, meaty bones?
- You know what I like. Hurry!

447
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:57,627
Don't worry, boy.
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

448
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:02,432
Take care of me!
Hmph!

449
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:13,877
<i>Psst! Psst!</i>

450
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,148
Pop?
- Hmm?

451
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,350
What's this ad?

452
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,352
It's a sale
on lawn mowers.

453
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,489
Interesting,
isn't it?

454
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:28,625
Yes, uh-hmm.

455
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,605
How did you
get in here?
Shoo! Shoo!

456
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,640
Go home!
Go home!

457
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,675
Don't you know
it isn't safe for
a dog in this house?

458
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,677
- Go home!
<i>- My toast!</i>

459
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,614
Toast coming up.
Shoo!

460
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,869
Frieda?
- Yes?

461
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:16,273
<i>Is there a dog</i>
<i>in the kitchen?</i>
<i>A dog?</i>

462
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,476
Yes, dog.
D-o-g.
- Dog.

463
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,679
What kind
of a dog?

464
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,415
That's all
I wanted to know!
Pop, where you goin'?

465
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,484
To the
hall closet.
What for?

466
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,620
To get my shotgun.
You can't shoot
your own...

467
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,957
My own what?
Your own
neighbor's dog!

468
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:37,827
Oh, can't I?
Pop, you can't shoot
that dog.

469
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:54,644
Ohh!

470
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,787
That's right, run,
you cowardly fleabag!

471
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:07,224
<i>Next time you come
on my property, I'll...</i>

472
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:10,460
I'll...
Well, I just will!

473
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,737
I just don't
understand it!

474
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,441
He's never stayed out
all night before.
I'm sure, mademoiselle,

475
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,644
he will return for his meals.
If you'd watch
him more carefully,

476
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,879
<i>these things
wouldn't happen.</i>

477
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,782
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>mademoiselle.</i>
<i>There you are!</i>

478
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,319
Where have you been all night,
you wretched beast?

479
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,993
Chiffon,
get down from there!

480
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:56,706
Oh, chiffon, mon petit.
I've been so worried about you.

481
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,776
What have you been up to,
vilain?

482
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,612
You're all forgiven.
Come on.

483
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,482
How 'bout
some breakfast?

484
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:11,755
Well, since when do you
eat at the table?

485
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,658
I'll get you breakfast.
Come on.

486
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:19,863
Stefano, the door.

487
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,810
Yes?

488
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,447
Dr. andrassy is expecting me.
My name is thurm.

489
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,350
Yes, Mr. thurm.
Come in.

490
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,957
Please, follow me.

491
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,936
<i>What's the matter?
I thought you were hungry.</i>

492
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:03,106
Well, go on!

493
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,926
Oh no, you don't.
Get back in the kitchen.

494
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,528
<i>A la cuisine.</i>
<i>Stefano?</i>
- Mademoiselle?

495
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,365
Take chiffon.
See that he doesn't
run away again.

496
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,067
Do you understand?
Oui, mademoiselle.

497
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,539
You're always causing
me trouble, aren't you?

498
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,511
Get in there.
I don't have time to
watch you every minute.

499
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:52,422
Now, let's see you
get out of there!

500
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,999
It's me!
It's me!

501
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,122
<i>Here, wilby.</i>

502
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,291
Wilby!
Here, wilby!

503
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:11,728
Wilby! Here, boy!

504
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,130
Here, wilby!
Wilby!

505
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,966
Here, boy.
Here, wilby!

506
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:20,236
Here, boy.
Here, wilby!

507
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,805
Wilby?
- What do you think
you're doin'?

508
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,809
Ah, gee!
<i>What's the matter?</i>

509
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,978
You're not a dog
anymore.

510
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,081
You were gonna put
this dog collar on me,
weren't ya?

511
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:36,252
Don't get sore about it.
Forget it. I'm through
with that dog business.

512
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,589
You sure?

513
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:43,059
No.
Where's pop?

514
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:48,765
He's in there
cleaning his gun.

515
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,905
Well, I guess I'll have
to hide these for a while.

516
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,710
Did you wash
your hands?
- Yep.

517
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,980
Wilson, if you don't mind,
we'll have dinner early
tomorrow night.

518
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:06,082
We're all going to
the country club dance.

519
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,018
Is my good suit
clean?
- Had it done
last week.

520
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,988
Wilby, why don't you
take a girl to the dance?

521
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,791
<i>Wilby?</i>

522
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:17,961
He's a little young
for dating, isn't he?
Nonsense!

523
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:20,830
Just because you
didn't go out with girls
until you were twenty-three.

524
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,199
That's not true.
I was twenty.

525
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,635
Besides,
I was shy.

526
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,972
Well, anyway, wilby
can't exist in a vacuum.

527
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,975
Besides, you've already
taken all his hobbies
away from him.

528
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,811
I'd say it was a big jump
from birds' eggs to girls.

529
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:39,716
There is nothing wrong
with girls.
They're character building.

530
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:42,185
Wilby, why don't you ask
Allison to the dance?

531
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,388
Allison?
Buzz takes her
to all the dances.

532
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,857
Oh. Well, then,
someone else.

533
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:50,793
There must be dozens
of lovely girls who'd be
delighted to go with you.

534
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,930
Why's he have to take a girl?
Why can't he go with me?

535
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,332
That's a great idea,
that is!

536
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:59,402
Why don't you take that
new girl down the street,

537
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,938
Dr. andrassy's daughter?

538
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,875
Franceska! No, I wouldn't
have a chance with her.

539
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:10,079
See who that is,
will you, wilby?

540
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,122
Wilby, could I talk to you
in private for a second?

541
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:26,763
You know, knothead,
uh, wilby, you're
the best friend I have.

542
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,798
Uh-uh, buzz.
Not a cent!

543
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,236
Oh, wilby,
I don't come to see you
just when I need money.

544
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:36,005
All right,
I'm sorry.

545
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,142
The point is, I, uh,
I do have a problem.

546
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:42,178
I'm supposed to take Allison
to the country club dance.
I know.

547
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,115
Well, I happened to mention
the dance to franceska.

548
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:49,285
You know how it is.
She's a smooth worker.

549
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:54,090
Before I knew it,
I asked her to go too.
What do you want me to do?

550
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:57,093
All you have to do
is come along and make
a foursome out of it.

551
00:44:57,095 --> 00:45:00,430
You don't have to be
with anybody.
- I don't get ya.

552
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,732
Don't ya see?

553
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,368
I'll handle it
so that both girls
think they're with me.

554
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:09,439
Then everybody's happy.
I don't see how that
makes me happy.

555
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:12,408
Well, sure you do!
It's fun.

556
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,445
We're playing a harmless
little joke on the girls.

557
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:19,215
Well,
what do you say?

558
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,752
Anything's better than going
with my little brother.

559
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:25,788
I just don't see how
it's gonna work.
You just come along...

560
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,124
And watch the ol' master
at work, huh, buddy, pal?

561
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,962
Oh!

562
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,398
Say, I'll need gas
for tomorrow night.

563
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,868
You don't happen to have
a buck on you, do you?

564
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:46,375
How nice you look,
wilby.
- Thank you.

565
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,479
So do you.
- Thank you.

566
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:22,779
Don't bother getting out.
I'll get your date for you.

567
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:26,282
<i>Imagine, taking the</i>
<i>prettiest girl in town</i>
<i>to the dance!</i>

568
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:30,153
Oh. Oh, well,
you know.

569
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:33,322
Franceska certainly seems
to find you attractive.

570
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:36,058
You really think so?

571
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,130
Of course, I'm not as
sophisticated as she is,

572
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:45,168
but there is something
about you lately,
something unusual.

573
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,543
You girls know
one another.
- Of course.

574
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:55,545
Hello, wilby.
- Hi, franceska.

575
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,247
You both better
ride in front with me.

576
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:03,019
The wind in the back
is murder on the hair.
You're so thoughtful, buzz.

577
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,521
Et tres charmante,
n'est-ce pas?

578
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:10,393
Sorry, I don't
speak French.
- Oh.

579
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:17,834

¶¶

582
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:37,019
Allison, will you do
something for me?
What is it?

583
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,956
You know, this is wilby's
first dress-up date...

584
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,991
And he's scared stiff.

585
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:45,161
Scared of what?
- Franceska!

586
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,463
That's silly.
She's his date,
isn't she?

587
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,966
Sure, but you know
how shy he is,

588
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:52,902
and franceska's
kind of spectacular.

589
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:56,606
It's got him
tied up in knots.
- So?

590
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:59,442
I thought if
you could dance the
first dance with him...

591
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,545
You're old friends.
It might break
the ice for him.

592
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,414
Since when are you
so concerned about wilby?

593
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:08,451
Well, I like to see
everyone happy.

594
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:12,555
Thanks, Allison.
You're a real doll.

595
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:18,427
Wilby, aren't you
and Allison gonna have
the first dance?

596
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,963
Well, sure.
How 'bout it, Allison?
Wanna dance?

597
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,232
Love to.

598
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,536
Shall we?
- Mais oui.

600
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,442
They're sweet together,
aren't they?

601
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:41,450
Yeah, that's what
makes it so tough.
What does?

602
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,453
Wilby's got a tremendous crush
on Allison.

603
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,589
Trouble is,
he's so shy.

604
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,593
Allison goes more for
the sophisticated type.

605
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:54,230
She can't see wilby
for sour apples.
Poor wilby.

606
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:57,133
He is very nice,
isn't he?
Don't you worry.

607
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:59,168
There's nothing
you can do about it.

608
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,508
Buzz?
- Hmm?

609
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,644
I have a rather
amusing idea.
- What's that?

610
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:13,049
Suppose I make a fuss
over wilby and pretend
to be interested in him.

611
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,318
You mean,
make Allison jealous?

612
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,956
Oh, just a little bit.
You're a genius!

613
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:24,126
I never would have
thought of that
in a million years!

614
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,368
The next number will be
a lady's tag dance.

616
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:51,320
Tag dance.
- Pardon?

617
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,522
It's customary.

618
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:07,069
The custom,
is it not?

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,489
What's the big idea?
You told me to break
the ice, didn't you?

622
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,125
Fine, break it.
Don't melt it!

623
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,327
Excuse me.

625
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:48,477
You know, it's amazing.
All those pretty girls,

626
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:53,215
they actually seem to enjoy
dancing with wilby.
And why not?

627
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,086
I'd have bet anything
he was gonna be the
all-American wallflower.

628
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:00,756
<i>There are a lot of things about
your son that you don't know.</i>

Excuse us, moochie.
No more cake,
sweetheart.

Wilby!

00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:35,151
Wilby!

642
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,391
What's the big idea?
Get down!

643
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:45,828
Don't give me trouble.
You got trouble.
Look at yourself.

644
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:52,401
Oh no! Not here!
Not now! Please!

645
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,642
Wilby, are you all right?

646
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,521
Oh boy,
you're a dog again!

647
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,557
What are you
so happy about?

648
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,228
Gosh, you know you're
a lot more fun as a dog
than you are as my bro...

649
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,530
Ah, shut up and
get me outta here.

650
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:25,301
Okay, boy.
I don't want anything
to happen to you now.

651
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:34,443
Come on.
Sneak out that way.

652
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:49,258
Chiffon!
What in the world
is he doing here?

653
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,428
Who?
- Chiffon.
Chiffon!

654
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:55,331
Get him, buzz.
- O-oh yeah!

655
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:06,008
Ahh!

656
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,882
There's that blasted
dog again! Get away!
What's he doing here?

657
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:18,454
See ya later, boy.
<i>Look out!</i>

658
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:22,024
Come here,
you mangy mutt!

659
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,262
<i>Come here!</i>

660
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,972
Come on, moochie.
Time for bed, dear.

661
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,546
Hello? Wilby,
where are you?

662
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:47,049
Pop!
- Just a minute.
It's late.

663
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:50,386
Isn't it time you
were getting home?
Is he all right?

664
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:53,656
Yes, he's all right.
We wondered what
happened to you.

665
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:57,626
I suppose you went chasing
after that girl's dog too.

666
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,929
Is it all right if you
stay at buzz's tonight?
It's all right, pop.

667
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:04,600
Yes, it's all right,
wilby.

668
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,947
Hey, Kelly,
you got a dime
for the phone?

669
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,917
Whoops!
Sorry, officer hanson.

670
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:58,821
<i>Bye!</i>

671
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:13,402
Kelly, here's your dime.
Can we go now, please?

672
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,572
I thought you were
gonna call home.
- I changed my mind. Let's go.

673
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:21,543
- You said it was important.
- I know what I said.
It was a whim.

674
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,012
Sometimes I'm just full
of little whims.

675
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,981
Can we go now, please?
<i>But you...</i>

676
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,851
Forget it, I said.
Forget it!

677
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:31,153
All right,
I'll forget it.

678
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,398
Don't bother, buzz.

679
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,001
Good night, franceska.
I hope you find your dog.

680
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:49,571
Thank you, Allison.
Good night.
Good night.

681
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,448
In the words of your
charming other date,

682
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,451
"don't bother!"
- Oh, wait!

683
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,953
I can explain
everything.
- Good night!

684
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,957
Well, that's gratitude
for you!

685
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,493
I beg your pardon?

686
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:15,831
Here I almost break my neck
trying to catch
that dog of yours,

687
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:19,201
<i>he drags me all over a parking</i>
<i>lot and you won't listen to me.</i>
So?

688
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:22,571
Besides that, I've got
a deep cut over my eye...

689
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:25,741
And it'll probably be infected
by the time I get home.

690
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:30,579
Oh well, I...
I guess I don't blame you.

691
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:34,183
Oh, come on inside.
I'll clean your scratch.

692
00:57:34,185 --> 00:57:37,753
Now you're talking!

693
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,223
Agh!

694
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,992
What the...

695
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,499
Oh, what a night.

696
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,205
Is chiffon here?
Yes, mademoiselle.
He's in the kitchen.

697
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:58,807
I'm quite displeased
with you, Stefano.

698
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,243
I distinctly asked
you to keep chiffon
locked up tonight.

699
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,513
<i>I left him in the kitchen,
carefully locked the door.</i>

700
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:07,483
<i>Still he escaped.</i>
<i>We won't</i>
<i>discuss it now.</i>

701
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:13,255
<i>Please, go in and sit down.
I want to see if chiffon is all right.</i>

702
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:15,824
<i>Will you forget about
that mutt for once?</i>

703
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,260
<i>It was all wilby's fault
that I got into this mess.</i>

704
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,196
Wilby's?
Yeah, it's all
his fault.

705
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:25,000
<i>Because I have</i>
<i>a soft heart, and was</i>
<i>trying to do him a favor.</i>

706
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:29,938
Ouch, that stings!
There.
It's all done now.

707
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,675
<i>Wilby didn't have enough nerve
to get himself a date,</i>

708
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:37,079
<i>so he cooked up this thing.</i>
<i>Why are you blaming this</i>
<i>all on wilby?</i>

709
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:41,283
Oh, don't let him fool you.
He's not as dumb as he looks.

710
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:44,186
Why, behind
that simple face...

711
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:48,690
Well, I don't want to talk
about my best friend like that.

712
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,826
Let's talk about us.

713
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:54,963
You know, franceska,
I've never met a girl like you.

714
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,099
No, I'm not kidding.

715
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,636
There's something
about you that...

716
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:04,006
Chiffon!
There you are.

717
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:06,842
What a bad dog
you've been, mon chéri.

718
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:10,579
Running away again and
scaring poor franceska
half to death!

719
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:13,215
Bad boy.

720
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,984
I sure hate to see you
waste all that on a mutt.

721
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:19,688
Why?
What do you mean?

722
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,026
I mean, forget about tonight.
Forget wilby and the whole mess.

723
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,595
Like I said before,
let's talk about us.

724
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:30,265
You know, franceska,

725
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,935
the first time I saw you...

726
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,937
I said to myself,

727
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:37,773
"buzz, there's just
the girl for..."

728
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,982
Does he have to keep
looking at me like that?

729
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,687
Look, fella, I've had just about
enough trouble for one night.

730
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,690
Now beat it!

731
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,733
Will you get lost?

732
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,302
Buzz!

733
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:09,805
Hey, what's
the big idea?

734
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:13,041
Get off, will ya?
Franceska!

735
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:16,011
- Chiffon, stop it!
- He's flipped his lid!

736
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:18,046
Let go!

737
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,215
Ca suffit!
- <i>Get him off!</i>

738
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:23,218
What has gotten into you?
Stop it this instant!

739
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,821
I think you'd
better leave, buzz.

740
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:30,225
I'm beginning to get the point.
Your dog doesn't like me.

741
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:33,295
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

742
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,964
I'll just find
my own way out.

743
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:39,935
<i>Bad dog, you.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
- Good night.

744
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:43,672
You behaved very badly
tonight, chiffon.

745
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:46,074
Buzz is really
a nice boy.

746
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:49,645
A little, shall we say,
conceited? Come on.

747
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,156
Yes?

748
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,129
I just wanted to say
good night, father.
- Did you have a pleasant time?

749
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:10,332
Yes, thank you.
But the odd thing was,

750
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,368
<i>I found chiffon</i>
<i>at the dance.</i>
Chiffon was there?

751
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,971
I don't understand how he
keeps getting out of the house.

752
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:18,173
May I leave him
with you tonight?

753
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,943
Certainly, dear.
I'm sure he won't
get away from me.

754
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,782
Good night,
franceska.
- Good night.

755
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:30,018
Now you
behave yourself,

756
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,021
you stupid,
wonderful dog.

757
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,190
Mm-mmm!

758
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,836
<i>Thurm, what is
the meaning of this?</i>

759
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,238
You were asked not
to come here at night!

760
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,709
It's most urgent, doctor.
I dared not use the phone.

761
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:56,244
<i>Is anything wrong at</i>
<i>the missile plant?</i>
<i>On the contrary.</i>

762
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:58,814
Good news. I've been
transferred to section 32.

763
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,149
<i>Section 32.
Excellent!</i>

764
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,385
<i>With what I've
already given you,</i>

765
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,988
this should be
all you need.
- How soon can you get it here?

766
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:10,158
<i>Taking all precautions,
I'd say tomorrow night by 8:00.</i>

767
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,360
That means that the
complete mechanism...

768
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:16,231
<i>Of the undersea hydrogen</i>
<i>missile will be in our hands.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

769
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,935
<i>Now we must get it out of
the country, immediately.</i>

770
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:28,243
<i>Oh, no you don't.
No you don't, my friend!</i>

771
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,246
You're not getting out
of this house tonight.

772
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,182
All right,
up on the couch. Up!

773
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,321
Good night, thurm.

774
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:42,357
I'll expect you
tomorrow night at 8:00.

775
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:57,873
I certainly would
like to know what has
gotten into you lately.

776
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,366
Spies!

777
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:27,135
I've gotta
tell somebody.

778
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:32,174
I've gotta get
outta here.

779
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:47,455
The laundry chute!

780
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,060
Well, here goes.

781
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,366
Aaah!

782
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,982
Easy, easy.

783
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,026
Yeah.

784
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,603
Whoa!

785
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:13,375
<i>What'll I do now?</i>

786
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,681
Hi, pop.
- Hi, son.
Wilby home yet?

787
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:21,950
No, sir.

788
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,453
<i>What's this
you're reading?</i>

789
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,226
"How to train your dog"?

790
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,261
Gosh, pop,

791
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:36,431
I thought someday you might
change your mind about dogs.

792
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,100
Let me tell you something,
young man.

793
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,337
As long as I've got a mind,
there'll never be a
dog in this house!

794
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,940
"How to train..."

795
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,381
There.

796
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,443
Hey, mooch!

797
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:30,418
Is that you, wilby?
- Well, now,
who'd you think it was?

798
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,620
Gosh, I've been
worried about you.

799
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:35,290
Will you stop patting me?
I don't like it.

800
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:39,227
Where you been?
Mooch, we've gotta
get some help, and fast!

801
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,229
That house is
full of spies.

802
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,332
Spies? Oh, swell,
that'll be fun playin'!

803
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,435
This isn't a game.
It's serous!

804
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,505
Ah, wilby.

805
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,542
<i>They're stealing something</i>
<i>from the missile plant.</i>
The missile plant?

806
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,212
I don't know
what it is exactly,

807
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:59,714
but they call it
section 32.

808
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,751
<i>They're sending it
out of the country tonight.</i>

809
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,353
Wow!
I'd better tell pop.

810
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,289
Pop?
- Sure, he'll know
what to do.

811
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:13,028
Now, you just
stay outta sight.
- Okay.

812
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:25,673
Pop, pop! Can I talk
to you for a minute?
Certainly. What is it?

813
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,675
Will you please
put down that paper?

814
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:31,179
It's very urgent.
- All right.

815
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:34,249
I just found out somethin'.
What did you
find out?

816
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:37,552
You know those people
down the street,
Dr. andrassy and them?

817
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,155
Yeah.
- They're spies.

818
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:43,558
Spies, huh?
Well.

819
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,529
Pop, I'm not kiddin'.
They're stealing somethin'
from the missile plant,

820
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:49,564
somethin' called
section 32.

821
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:54,069
Section 32, huh?
That's very interesting.

822
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,438
But pop,
you gotta believe me.

823
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,841
We gotta do somethin'
about it.
Moochie, I'm surprised at you.

824
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:03,845
I knew we had one wooly-headed
son in this family...
wilby isn't wooly-headed.

825
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:05,847
He's the one that
heard 'em talkin'.

826
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,751
Oh, he's the one that heard 'em.
That explains the whole thing.

827
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,786
Run along now,
huh, moochie?

828
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:15,657
But pop, we can't just
let 'em get away!
Moochie, run along.

829
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,258
Pop.

830
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,561
Moochie.

831
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:36,845
No soap.
Hmm, I guess I'll have to
give him the shock treatment.

832
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:39,447
Poor pop.

833
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,783
Uh, where's the gun?

834
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:45,453
In the hall closet.
I got the key.

835
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,523
Well, here goes.

836
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,544
Pop?
- Yes, wilby?

837
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:13,915
I've got something to
tell you, but I'm afraid.

838
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:17,452
You never have to be afraid
to talk to me, wilby.

839
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:20,188
Maybe sometimes I'm
a little impatient with you,

840
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,357
but that's because
you're my son.

841
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,427
I want you to be
something special.
Yes, sir?

842
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:28,630
So you just tell me
what's troubling you.

843
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:31,232
I'm sure it can't be
anything too serious;

844
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,602
but whatever it is,
I promise you I'll understand.

845
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:38,873
Really, pop?
You can bank on it,
wilby.

846
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:42,544
<i>Shake on it?</i>
- Certainly
I'll shake on it, wilby.

847
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:49,684
No!
- Oh, that did it.

848
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,926
<i>Frieda!</i>
- Wilson?

849
01:09:57,928 --> 01:10:00,695
<i>Frieda!</i>
- Wilson,
is that you?

850
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,771
What are we
gonna do now?

851
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:12,907
We've gotta
get help.
- Look!

852
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,577
<i>The police!</i>

853
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:22,350
I'd like to report
some spies, please.

854
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,752
All right,
what's the name?

855
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:27,855
Moochie...
Montgomery Daniels.

856
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,857
Daniels?

857
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:33,595
You any relation to that kid
who tipped us off about
that gangster last week?

858
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,631
Yes, sir.
Wilby's my brother.

859
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:39,968
But he didn't know
it was the new Dean
at the divinity college.

860
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,006
Remember, Kelly? Last week,
when I used to be a sergeant.

861
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,275
No kidding,
officer.

862
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,844
We need help.

863
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:52,413
Who are you?

864
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,749
Uh, wilby Daniels.

865
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,552
Wilby Daniels.

866
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,622
I knew it.
I knew it.

867
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:03,925
The first time that dog spoke
to me, I said to my wife...

868
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,494
Easy now, hanson.
It's all right.

869
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,896
It's probably some kid
dressed up in a dog suit.

870
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:10,999
That's right,
officer.

871
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,802
Sure, that's how he
spied on the spies.

872
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,905
All right,

873
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:20,008
take off the dog suit.

874
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,977
Can't. I don't have
anything on underneath.

875
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:27,282
You see, Kelly?
He can't.

876
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,950
You ought to know that.

877
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,452
Now that's enough.
Stop bothering officer hanson...

878
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,621
Before we take you
down to the station.

879
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,724
Fine, let's go!
Yeah, let's go.

880
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:38,726
Oh, no you don't.

881
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,629
- Not in this car.
- But they're spies!

882
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,032
Now, I'm afraid they're
gonna have to keep.

883
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:47,769
You see, there's a landing
of invaders from Mars
over by the stockyards,

884
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:51,472
and I'm afraid we're gonna
have to get over there.

885
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:03,484
Gosh, wilby, 2:00.

886
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,522
We've gotta think
of somethin'.
- Yeah.

887
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,625
I got it!

888
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:12,794
Here you are,
you miserable beast!

889
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:16,431
You can't take him!
He's my broth...

890
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Your what?

891
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:22,103
My, my pal.

892
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:25,506
This is the last time
you'll ever get away.

893
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,510
I can promise you that!
Come on, you devil.

894
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,979
Come along before I...
Come on!

895
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,618
No.
- Wilson.
Wilson?

896
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,021
No, no.
- Now, don't
you dare move.

897
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,890
I'll get the spirits
of ammonia.
- No.

898
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:46,361
Pop, snap out of it!
We've gotta get movin'!

899
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:49,764
No, moochie. Moochie,
is it true about wilby?

900
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,500
Did I see and hear
what I thought I saw?

901
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,869
You sure did!
Wilby's a dog now.

902
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,573
No... my own boy,
my own flesh and blood.

903
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,676
Somehow, someway
I failed him as a father.

904
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,479
How did it happen?
I'll tell ya later.
Hurry!

905
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,547
Are we going
somewhere?

906
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,784
Don't you understand?
We gotta get help.

907
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:12,653
We gotta stop
those spies.
<i>What spies?</i>

908
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:15,056
Remember?
I told you about 'em.

909
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,625
Spies!
That's right, you did.

910
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:20,928
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'm with you all the way.

911
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:25,466
We'll have to get
some help!
- Not that way, this way!

912
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:28,970
Wilson Daniels,
you are not stepping
a foot from this house.

913
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:32,607
Frieda, you stay outta this.
This is a job that
calls for cool heads!

914
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,576
Come on, moochie.
Oh, here, this way.

915
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,146
<i>Calm down,
Mr. Daniels.</i>

916
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:41,749
<i>I just want to get
this thing straight.</i>

917
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,151
Oh.

918
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:46,654
Now, you say that
this information
came from your son.

919
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:50,057
Yes, my older son.
He was there and he
heard them talking.

920
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:53,961
- And they knew he was there?
- I'm sure they knew
he was there...

921
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:57,064
Doesn't that strike you
as rather odd, Mr. Daniels,

922
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:59,634
that they'd speak of such
confidential matters...

923
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,937
<i>In front of your son?</i>
No, it's not
odd at all.

924
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,540
They probably didn't pay
any attention to him.

925
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,109
You see, my son
happens to be a dog.

926
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,712
Your son is a dog?

927
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,681
Yes. Now don't
get me wrong.

928
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:16,784
He's not a dog all the time,
just part of the time.

929
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,587
Oh, I see.

930
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,192
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Daniels.

931
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:28,062
We'll look into
the matter.
You don't believe me. Ow!

932
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:31,032
I'm sorry.
I just don't happen
to have my shoes on.

933
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,734
Don't you believe me?
Of course.

934
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:36,137
Then aren't you going to do
something about it now?

935
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:38,806
We must proceed with
caution, Mr. Daniels.

936
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:42,810
Dr. andrassy is a
well-respected man.
- But you
haven't got time for caution!

937
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,813
Don't you understand?
This thing that they stole,
whatever it is,

938
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,082
is being shipped out of
the country tonight!

939
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:51,986
I don't suppose you have
any idea precisely what
this thing may be?

940
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:56,858
No, all I know is that it's
something called section 32,
or something like that.

941
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,494
Section 32?
- That's right.

942
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:03,498
Are you sure?
That's what the dog said.
Well, my son.

943
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,067
Please sit down again,
Mr. Daniels.
I should think so.

944
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,102
All right.

945
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,605
Now, uh,
you still insist...

946
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:13,941
<i>A dog told you</i>
<i>about this.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

947
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:17,612
Why don't you ask my
younger son, moochie?
He's the dog's brother.

948
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:21,616
Just now it's you I'm
interested in, Mr. Daniels.

949
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:25,520
Me? You don't think I had
anything to do with this?

950
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:27,922
Now, you listen to me.
I came here in good faith.

951
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:30,525
I told you a simple,
straightforward story.

952
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:34,161
And just because I happen
to have a son who's a dog,
you look at me as though...

953
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:36,964
You look at me as though I had
wheels in my head or something.

954
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:39,667
Just you remember,
I'm a government man myself.

955
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,069
We have the utmost respect
for the members of...

956
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,705
The United States
post office department.

957
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:48,075
I wonder if you'd mind
repeating your story to
one of my colleagues.

958
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:50,077
I'd be glad to.

959
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,581
All I ask is that you gentlemen
keep an open mind...
- no, no, no.

960
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,316
Not them,
Mr. Daniels.

961
01:15:55,318 --> 01:16:00,054
Would you step into the hall
with these gentlemen, please?
Well, yes.

962
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,757
Excuse me.

963
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:06,794
It's fantastic, but he
knows about section 32.
How could he?

964
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:09,063
That's what
I've got to find out.

965
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,632
Meantime, check every man,
every sketch,

966
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,035
every piece of equipment
in that department.

967
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:17,104
That'll take time.
Get moving.

968
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:22,109
All right, Mr. Daniels,
this way, please.

969
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:26,948
I think you'll like
Dr. Galvin.
- Doctor?

970
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,284
Oh, uh, it's a kind of
honorary title.

971
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:33,054
Well, now,
just a minute, you...

972
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,963
I've just returned
from the museum.

973
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:44,131
I have our plan
worked out.

974
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,334
<i>Come upstairs.
I'll go over it with you.</i>

975
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:49,203
Yes, sir.

976
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:52,373
Is my daughter at home?
No, sir, not yet.
She went shopping.

977
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,609
Good.

978
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:09,323
<i>The girl</i>
<i>must know absolutely nothing</i>
<i>of what is happening here.</i>

979
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,692
<i>I understand, sir.
- As it is,</i>

980
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:15,262
<i>with matters coming to a head,</i>
<i>I don't quite know what</i>
<i>to do about her.</i>

981
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,032
<i>It is unfortunate</i>
<i>mademoiselle happens</i>
<i>to be your daughter,</i>

982
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:21,769
<i>otherwise a solution
would be quite obvious.</i>

983
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:24,338
<i>In any case, Stefano,
the problem is mine.</i>

984
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,808
<i>I'll decide what to do
when the time comes.</i>

985
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,647
<i>This is a sketch</i>
<i>of the packing case</i>
<i>containing the small fossils.</i>

986
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:36,984
Understand me clearly.
From here on, the slightest
hitch will be disastrous.

987
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,420
- You can depend on me, doctor.
<i>- When thurm arrives...</i>

988
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:43,090
<i>With the components of</i>
<i>section 32, take them to</i>
<i>my office at the museum.</i>

989
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,826
There you will find...

990
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,729
<i>The packing case containing
the etruscan fossils.</i>

991
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:50,931
Suppose the authorities
open the case?

992
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:55,870
<i>They may, but I doubt if they
will tamper very much...</i>

993
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:59,707
With such a fragile
and priceless collection...

994
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,876
<i>Dispatched to such
a distinguished man.</i>

995
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:05,446
The packing case will be
shipped on the midnight plane,

996
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:08,683
<i>consigned ostensibly
to the museum in Rome.</i>

997
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,352
Anders himself will
pick up the shipment?
Silence!

998
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:15,890
<i>You have instructions</i>
<i>never to mention his name!</i>
<i>What harm can it do?</i>

999
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:19,460
<i>Save for the dog downstairs,
we are alone in the house.</i>

1000
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:23,964
<i>Now, suppose we go over what
you must do, point by point.</i>

1001
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,171
What are you
doing here?

1002
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:33,841
Here?
O-oh, here.

1003
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:37,912
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm glad you asked me.

1004
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:41,348
I was wondering if you could
give franceska a message for me.

1005
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,452
There's going to be a barbecue
at Dawson's grove next Saturday,

1006
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,454
and I was
thinking of...

1007
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:49,790
I know what you heard,
and I know how to
make you forget!

1008
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,326
No, not now.
- What else can we
do with him?

1009
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,328
I said, not now!

1010
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,765
Tie him up and lock him
in the dressing room.

1011
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:06,974
<i>You've gained access to
certain secret information.</i>

1012
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:09,376
Now, fearful of
the consequences,

1013
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,979
you transfer the burden of
guilt to your second self,

1014
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:15,182
a submerged second identity
known only to you.

1015
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,219
What sec...
What second identity?

1016
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:20,888
Now this is very important,
Mr. Daniels.

1017
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:25,126
Do you often visualize
yourself as a dog?
- What?

1018
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:27,461
Now, let's be honest.

1019
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:31,398
Do you often stand in front
of your shaving mirror,

1020
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
and instead of
your own face...

1021
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:36,403
You see a shiny, moist,
black shoe-button nose,

1022
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,874
a strong,
intelligent head?

1023
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,308
No!

1024
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,378
Excuse me, sir,
it's getting awfully late,

1025
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,514
and mom will be
worried about us.

1026
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:49,784
I don't see any reason
why you can't go.
- Well, good.

1027
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:52,920
I've had enough of this.
No, I was referring
to the boy.

1028
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:56,390
I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you to remain
a while longer, Mr. Daniels.

1029
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:59,827
Just a few more questions.
Why don't you ask him
a few questions?

1030
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,962
He knows more about
this thing than I do.

1031
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,131
He'll tell you
I'm telling the truth.

1032
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,133
Perhaps we should
question the boy.

1033
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,903
There may be a heredity factor
present between father and son.

1034
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:12,173
Can it wait, sir?
I ought to be going.

1035
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:17,144
Yes, they say heredity sometimes
plays a role in lycanthropy.

1036
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,914
Who are you
calling a liar?

1037
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:24,285
Lycanthropy is the alleged
practice of turning humans
into witches and werewolves.

1038
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:28,422
Don't be ridiculous!
My son isn't any werewolf.

1039
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,458
He's just a big, baggy,
stupid-looking shaggy dog!

1040
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:35,262
Pop, I'm worried about wilby.
He may be in trouble.

1041
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:37,531
What do you think
I'm in?

1042
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:40,935
Now just a few
questions, my lad.

1043
01:20:40,937 --> 01:20:43,571
It won't do you
any good, sir.

1044
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:47,007
<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>about all this.</i>
Moochie!

1045
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,276
What did you say?

1046
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:52,546
I said, I don't know anything
and I'd like to go home, please.

1047
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:54,415
Moochie!

1048
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:58,619
Then you don't believe
your brother is a dog?

1049
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,922
Gosh, sir,
would you?

1050
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:03,390
Moochie!

1051
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:07,228
And your father made up
this entire story about the dog.

1052
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:11,298
It was his idea.
Pop's a great
storyteller.

1053
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,401
Kids come from all around
just to hear him.

1054
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,170
Moochie!

1055
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:21,141
Sorry, pop.
I had to do it.

1056
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:25,279
Betts,
I'm letting the boy go.

1057
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:29,083
Please see that he gets home
in a company car.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1058
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,218
All right, son.

1059
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,923
Moochie.

1060
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,358
You go back to my office,
and Mr. betts will
take care of you.

1061
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:41,228
Go ahead.

1062
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,264
Moochie.

1063
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:46,166
May I, doctor?
Oh, of course.

1064
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:49,637
Now, Mr. Daniels, we've had
our little joke about the dog.

1065
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:52,006
Suppose
we get down to cases.

1066
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:55,409
I want to know just how,
when and where...

1067
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,946
You found out about
section 32!

1068
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:14,428
Did you get it?
Yes, I have it.

1069
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,634
Section 32,
complete.

1070
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,603
Good!
- <i>But we're</i>
<i>in trouble.</i>

1071
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,673
Something's gone wrong
at the plant.
What do you mean?

1072
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:30,010
<i>An investigation.
I had to answer a few ticklish questions.</i>

1073
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:33,614
You knew the right answers.
Of course, but I didn't
like the sound of them.

1074
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:37,651
You know, I'm not even sure
that I wasn't followed here.

1075
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:40,554
We'll have to use
the emergency plan.

1076
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,423
The other is too risky now.
What about the boat?

1077
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,693
<i>It's tied up at Walker's dock, ready to go.
Very well.</i>

1078
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:50,130
Bring the sedan around.
What about
the boy?

1079
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,733
We'll be out of the country
before they find him.

1080
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,478
<i>I don't understand
what could have gone wrong.</i>

1081
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,381
You're sure that...

1082
01:23:07,383 --> 01:23:10,284
<i>Yes, what do you want?</i>

1083
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:14,121
I wanted to say I'm going
out with buzz Miller.
I'm sorry, franceska,

1084
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:18,058
but I've been called away
for a few days and I would
like you to come with me.

1085
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,061
Well, isn't this
rather short notice?

1086
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:23,530
Where are we going?

1087
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:26,033
I've no time for questions.
Please get ready!

1088
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:30,537
Well, if you don't mind,
I think I'd prefer to stay here.

1089
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,440
You'll do
as I say!

1090
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,012
What is this?

1091
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:41,648
<i>Franceska,
you're an intelligent girl.</i>

1092
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:45,352
I don't believe I have to
make any needless threats.

1093
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,354
Take her
to her room.

1094
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:50,758
See that she takes
what she needs. Hurry!

1095
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:08,075
Here you are, son.
- Thank you
very much, sir.

1096
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,177
I don't want to
attract attention.

1097
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:45,679
Drive at
a normal speed.

1098
01:24:54,156 --> 01:24:56,490
All right.

1099
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,103
Wilby!
Here, wilby!

1100
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:11,171
Wilby!

1101
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:26,120
Wilby. Here, wilby!
Wilby!

1102
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,793
Here, wilby!

1103
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:36,230
Here, wilby!
Here, wilby!

1104
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,466
<i>Wilby!</i>

1105
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,703
In here, moochie!
In here!

1106
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:53,480
In here, wilby!
In here!

1107
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:00,888
Wilby,
what's goin' on?

1108
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,923
Come on!
They're gettin' away!

1109
01:26:05,528 --> 01:26:08,695
They're headin'
for Walker's dock!

1110
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:13,667
Hey, look out!

1111
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,673
Someday I'm gonna
murder that dog!

1112
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:26,246
Hey, you mangy cur,
come back with my car!

1113
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:53,473
Wait, stop!
Stop!

1114
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:57,578
Officer! Officer!
Officer, get him!

1115
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:01,882
Get him! That shaggy
dog just stole my car!

1116
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,651
Shaggy dog.

1117
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:08,288
It's no use, Kelly.
I've just gotta face it.

1118
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:11,625
I gotta face it.
Follow that dog!

1119
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:19,399
Hey, wait!

1120
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,803
Wait for us!

1121
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:26,506
Never mind, buzz,
here comes my pop!

1122
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:36,416
<i>Pop, pop!
Follow that police car!</i>

1123
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,752
Montgomery, don't you
ever speak to me again!

1124
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:42,623
You can't let 'em get away!
You don't know what
you're asking me to do.

1125
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,626
Do you know what I've gone
through for the last few hours?
But, my car!

1126
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:47,794
Look, please,
I'm not a well man.

1127
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:17,958
Chicken.

1128
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:24,898
Patrol car 12, hanson.
Code 22.

1129
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:29,736
We are pursuing stolen car
headed west on highway 16
at high rate of speed.

1130
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:32,539
<i>Request other police units
be notified.</i>

1131
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:36,543
Patrol car 12.
We are pursuing stolen car...

1132
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:39,012
<i>Traveling west
on highway 16.</i>

1133
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:41,581
<i>Description of suspect

<i>Large, shaggy dog.</i>

<i>Dirty white

What's the matter with you?

1142
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:11,645
Patrol car 12,

Report in here immediately.
Hanson!

01:29:34,737 --> 01:29:39,740
Patrol car 7, patrol car 7.

01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:41,775
Patrol car 7,
Mercer. Over.

1152
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:45,011
Mercer, there are two
loonies by the name of
hanson and Kelly...

1153
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:47,481
Masquerading
as police officers.

1154
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:49,583
Now they're
headed your way.

1155
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:52,619
Pick 'em up and bring 'em
in here immediately! Over.

1156
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:55,389

Acknowledge and out.
Poor old hanson.

1158
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:05,665
There he is!

1159
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:42,202
Now get out
of there!

1160
01:30:42,204 --> 01:30:45,038
No, you don't.
There.

1161
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,609
Right over here.
Bend over that hood.

1162
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:55,715
Hanson!

1163
01:30:57,519 --> 01:30:58,919
What are you...

1164
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:02,656
Well, it's possible,
isn't it?

1165
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:05,792
- Look out!
- Ouch! Ouch!

1166
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,995
<i>- He bit me!</i>
- I don't see anything.

1167
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:18,839
No, Kelly!
That's our car!

1168
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:46,867
We're being followed.
Open it up!

1169
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:01,114
That wasn't hanson.

1170
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:06,052
Patrol car 7, Mercer.
Patrol car 7, Mercer.

1171
01:32:06,054 --> 01:32:08,522
Request additional
instructions. Over.

1172
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:11,625
You've got your instructions.
Bring in hanson and Kelly!

1173
01:32:11,627 --> 01:32:14,027
Mobile unit assigned to
officers hanson and Kelly...

1174
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:16,263
Passed this point
a moment ago.

1175
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:19,666
<i>Officers hanson and Kelly
were not in it. Over.</i>

1176
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:23,069
Really? Well,
may I ask who was in it?

1177
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:25,939
<i>A large,
shaggy dog, sir.</i>

1178
01:32:25,941 --> 01:32:27,941
<i>Description as follows:</i>

1179
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:32,045
<i>Dirty white,
brown patches.</i>

1180
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:35,815
<i>Was driving
the mobile unit.</i>

1181
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:39,819
Would you have them send
my car around, please?

1182
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,822
That is, unless it's been stolen
by a purple kangaroo...

1183
01:32:42,824 --> 01:32:45,292
Wearing a checkered vest!
Yes, sir.

1184
01:33:07,683 --> 01:33:10,817
No! No! No!

1185
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:16,756
No, no, no,
you idiots!

1186
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:18,792
No, no, no!

1187
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:21,995
Well, well, if it isn't
hot-rod hanson speeding.

1188
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:24,331
And you, who used
to be a sergeant.

1189
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:26,933
All right, Mercer,
very cute. Come on...

1190
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,069
Sorry, we're to
bring you in.

1191
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:31,738
Ed, I can't go back
without that dog.

1192
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,741
Sorry, I got the word from
scanlon, loud and clear.

1193
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:37,744
Ed, please, for the love
of a fellow officer.

1194
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:41,848
We were rookies together.
I married your sister, felice.

1195
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:46,052
I loaned you my
dress uniform for the
shriners' convention.

1196
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:49,623
Ed, don't these things
mean anything to ya?

1197
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:53,860
All right,
I'll take a chance, hanson.

1198
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:57,897
But you just better pray
you know what you're doing.

1199
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:23,323
<i>Cast off,
thurm!</i>

1200
01:34:24,893 --> 01:34:28,695
Aaah!

1201
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:32,265
Get down from there!

1202
01:34:46,882 --> 01:34:49,816
<i>Chiffon,
let go of me!</i>

1203
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:54,054
You devil, you!
I'll fix you.
<i>Chiffon, look out!</i>

1204
01:34:54,056 --> 01:34:56,456
<i>Chiffon, look out!
Stop it, you...</i>

1205
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:58,825
Chiffon, stop it!

1206
01:34:59,795 --> 01:35:01,861
Aaah!

1207
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:29,756
<i>Mercer, call the harbor police!
Have 'em stop that boat!</i>

1208
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,029
Oh!

1209
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:38,298
What's the matter,
Mr. Daniels?
- Go ahead.

1210
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,502
I'm all right.
I've just broken my foot.

1211
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:51,911
Did they get away?
Did they get away?

1212
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,981
<i>Where's wilby?</i>

1213
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:17,437
Apprehend 32-foot speed cruiser,
headed towards keeley's point.

1214
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:19,072
Over.

1215
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:34,220
You all right?
- Buzz.

1216
01:36:34,222 --> 01:36:38,057
There, there, now.
Everything's under control.

1217
01:36:38,059 --> 01:36:40,860
But how in the world
did you get here?

1218
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:43,263
The last thing
I remember, chiffon...

1219
01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:45,999
Don't you worry your
pretty little head.

1220
01:36:46,001 --> 01:36:48,868
<i>Old buzz got here just
in the Nick of time.</i>

1221
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:52,005
<i>But buzz...</i>
<i>don't thank me.</i>
<i>It was nothing.</i>

1222
01:36:52,007 --> 01:36:54,374
Nothing at all.

1223
01:36:54,376 --> 01:36:55,975
Hey!

1224
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,411
<i>Franceska!</i>

1225
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:02,382
Hey, what's the big idea?

1226
01:37:02,384 --> 01:37:06,252
What's the matter with you?
Let go of me!

1227
01:37:06,254 --> 01:37:10,990
What are you mad at me for?
I didn't do anything.

1228
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:14,294
Chiffon, let go,
you silly moth-eaten mutt!

1229
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:17,864
Ouch! Stop it!
You cut it out!

1230
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:23,436
That's the man, captain.

1231
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:27,340
<i>That's him!</i>
No, I'm innocent!

1232
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,276
No, no!
Look, I'm innocent!

1233
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:32,478
I haven't done
anything wrong.

1234
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,081
I'll explain the whole
thing to you again.

1235
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:37,150
<i>You see,
my boy's a dog...</i>

1236
01:37:39,287 --> 01:37:41,588
"Just got here
in the Nick of time."

1237
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,224
A great big hero,
are ya?

1238
01:37:45,327 --> 01:37:47,994
Wilby!
- Good old buzz, huh?

1239
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:52,031
Right in the Nick
of time, are you?
The great big hero, eh?

1240
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,434
<i>Wilby, will you lay off?</i>

1241
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:57,637
<i>I don't know what you're
talkin' about. Wilby!</i>

1242
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:01,407
<i>You don't know what</i>
<i>I'm talking about?</i>
<i>I bet you don't!</i>

1243
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:05,144
Chiffon!
Oh, it was you.

1244
01:38:05,146 --> 01:38:07,280
You saved my life.

1245
01:38:07,282 --> 01:38:11,284
<i>What a wonderful,
beautiful dog.</i>

1246
01:38:11,286 --> 01:38:14,621
<i>Mon Beau chien.
My hero.</i>

1247
01:38:14,623 --> 01:38:18,391
Je t'aime de mon coeur.

1248
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:39,012
<i>Over here with that.
Mr. Daniels, you're in the way.</i>

1249
01:38:39,014 --> 01:38:42,382
Do you mind?
No, not at all.

1250
01:38:42,384 --> 01:38:44,684
This stuff will clutter
up the picture.

1251
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:48,321
Would you mind
holding these, please?
Thank you very much.

1252
01:38:48,323 --> 01:38:51,257
<i>Ed, get ready
for a picture.</i>

1253
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,593
Now, Mr. Daniels,
a picture for our
Sunday follow-up story,

1254
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:55,595
a human interest angle:

1255
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:59,265
How your love for dogs made this
whole thrilling thing possible.
Oh, fine.

1256
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:02,602
Now, Mr. Daniels,
if you'll just sit on
the arm of the chair.

1257
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:04,671
Oh, right here?
All right, boy,
up in the chair.

1258
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,640
Now just a minute!

1259
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:11,277
I will not have that dog
up on my good chair with
his big, dusty feet!

1260
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,048
Don't worry about it, honey.
A dog can't hurt anything.

1261
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:17,450
How about me with my arm
around him, like this?

1262
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,619
Fine, fine.

1263
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,688
This all right?

1264
01:39:23,558 --> 01:39:27,694
<i>That's fine, fine.</i>
<i>Now, how about one</i>
<i>with your son?</i>

1265
01:39:27,696 --> 01:39:29,996
Oh. Well,
why not?

1266
01:39:29,998 --> 01:39:32,498
Come here, son.
Not you, the little fella.

1267
01:39:36,371 --> 01:39:39,005
Come on, wilby,
let's take a walk.

1268
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:42,408
You stay just
like that. Good.

1269
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:45,678
Mr. Daniels, you'll be
looking at your son.
All right.

1270
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,680
Anyway,

1271
01:39:47,682 --> 01:39:51,117
it sure was nice of franceska
to give us the dog.

1272
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,687
That old house is sure
gonna seem empty with
her gone back to Paris.

1273
01:39:54,689 --> 01:39:57,357
Yeah, swell girl.

1274
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:00,093
Oh well, I guess
it's all for the best.

1275
01:40:00,095 --> 01:40:03,629
I was gettin' kind
of tired of all that
French lingo, anyway.

1276
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:07,200
You wanna know somethin' else?
I don't think we've been
quite fair to Allison.

1277
01:40:07,202 --> 01:40:11,371
She's a swell girl too.
Yeah, good sport,
real good sport.

1278
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:14,007
Anyone else
might've gotten sore.

1279
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:19,312
Hi, Allison!

1280
01:40:29,758 --> 01:40:32,725
You know them?

1281
01:40:32,727 --> 01:40:36,529
Oh, just a couple of
neighborhood children.

1282
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:44,804
Let's get the medal
in this picture.
Medal? What medal?

1283
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:49,175
Valor award!
- Mm-hmm.

1284
01:40:49,177 --> 01:40:51,711
Well!

1285
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:54,680
No, Mr. Daniels,
the medal is for the dog.

1286
01:40:56,451 --> 01:40:58,718
Oh.

1287
01:41:04,626 --> 01:41:07,260
There.
- <i>That's</i>
<i>good.</i>

1288
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:12,098
Well, I finally
got a dog!

1289
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,333
What do you mean,
you've got a dog?

1290
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:16,536
We've got a dog!

1291
01:41:24,546 --> 01:41:26,612
Arf! Arf!
Arf!
