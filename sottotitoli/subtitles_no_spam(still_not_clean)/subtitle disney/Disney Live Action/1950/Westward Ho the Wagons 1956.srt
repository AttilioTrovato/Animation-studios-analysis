1
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,832
 Westward roll the wagons

2
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,234
 Always westward roll

3
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,864
 Westward roll the wagons

4
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,999
 For Oregon's our goal

5
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:38,408
 Westward roll the wagons

6
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,776
 Always westward roll

7
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:43,475
 Westward roll the wagons

8
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,711
 For Oregon's our goal

9
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,415
 America's in motion

10
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,685
 And her hopes are turnin' west

11
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,023
 Let's all get a-goin'

12
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,359
 For a new land's always best

13
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,762
 Westward roll the wagons

14
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,165
 Westward roll them far

15
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,999
 Westward roll the wagons

16
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,971
 Toward the western star

17
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,741
 Keep them bull whips crackin'

18
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:14,177
 And a smile on every face

19
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:16,215
 Keep the teams all pulled and even

20
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,580
 And each wagon in its place

21
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,984
 Westward roll the wagons

22
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,284
 Westward roll them far

23
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:25,790
 Westward roll the wagons

24
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,191
 Toward the western star

25
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,122
 It's time to halt the wagons

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,928
 Circle for the night

27
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,369
 Tomorrow roll the wagons

28
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:39,701
 When the sun is shinin' bright

29
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:42,105
 Westward roll the wagons

30
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,473
 Always westward roll

31
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:47,138
 Westward roll the wagons

32
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:51,479
 For Oregon's our goal 

33
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:56,617
Ah, we did pretty good today.

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,885
Golly, l thought
you were never gonna stop.

35
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,787
Come on, princess.

36
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,632
Well, there you are, trail mates.
Chimney Rock.

37
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:15,074
Chimney Rock!
Wow, we're almost there.

38
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,006
-  Almost where;
- Oregon.

39
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,441
Well, hardly, Jerry.
The rock is a milestone.

40
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,708
lt's one of the most famous
along the trail.

41
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,813
Sort of marks the end of the prairie.

42
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,686
Come on over.
l wanna show you over here.

43
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,623
See that notch up there;

44
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,024
Tomorrow we'll pull right up through it.
And once we're through it,

45
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:39,497
we'll be out of Pawnee country
and into friendly Sioux territory

46
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,591
all the way to Fort Laramie and beyond.

47
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,432
- A real fort;
- Now you just wait and see.

48
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:48,204
Now, come on,
we all got chores to do. Get!

49
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,425
This beats everythin'.
A layover to graze up the stock.

50
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,494
l tell you, Doc,
these stubborn pot hoppers think

51
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,665
they know more about this here land
than you and me put together.

52
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,768
Outvoting us like they was the Congress
of these here United States itself.

53
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,369
Well, majority rules, Hank.

54
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,210
Majority;

55
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,715
There ain't gonna be no majority

56
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,184
if the Pawnees catch us
lying out here in the open

57
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:34,811
with that precious herd of extra horses

58
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,379
that Obie Foster
and Armitage brought along.

59
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,891
Well, these folks are farmers.
Horses are important to 'em.

60
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,587
Yeah; Mighty important to Pawnees, too.

61
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,789
Best lnjun bait there is,
you know that.

62
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:50,802
Just a plain invitation to
any scouting party might happen along.

63
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:53,403
Now don't get your priming all afire.

64
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,202
We're almost across Pawnee territory

65
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,936
and we haven't seen
any sign of them yet.

66
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,775
When there ain't no sign of them
ornery, horse-thieving, red devils

67
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,610
is when l mistrust 'em most.

68
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,173
Why couldn't these wall-eyed,
greenhorn, sodbusters wait

69
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,718
until we get up that notch yonder

70
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,276
before they had to
sit down in the hunkers

71
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,754
to watch their horses graze grass;

72
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,453
l tell you, Doc,
if l ever get this outfit to Oregon,

73
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:18,224
l'm never gonna sign up
a bunch of greenhorns again...

74
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,995
What are you doing;

75
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,231
Sit down.

76
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:31,835
- What's the matter;
- Stick out your tongue. Stick it out.

77
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,025
Now, wait a minute, Doc.
That stuff ain't for me.

78
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,224
Oh, we can't afford
to lose our scout halfway to Oregon.

79
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,290
Just you listen to me! l never
taken that stuff in my whole life

80
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,892
and l ain't gonna start in now.

81
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,303
Well, now just simmer down before
you bust every pipe in your carcass.

82
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,641
Now, come on. What you need is a little
music. That's good for what ails you.

83
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,673
And dig a smile out of those whiskers.

84
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,985
All right.

85
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,506
Dr. John, how about that story
you've been promisin' us;

86
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:52,578
Please;

87
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:55,750
Well, l can't tell you a story
without my guitar.

88
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,415
Have at it, Doc.

89
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,327
Looks like there's no help for it.

90
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,364
- How about a mountain man story;
- A real mountain man;

91
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,372
- A true story;
- Yeah.

92
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
- Who was he;
- Well...

93
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,571
 John Colter was a trapper

94
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,111
 And he knew the ways of game

95
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,112
 But it wasn't for his trappin'

96
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,376
 That he won immortal fame

97
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:30,354
 He traveled up the Yellowstone

98
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,550
 And discovered Colter's Hell

99
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,492
 But it isn't of his geysers

100
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,554
 That my yarn is going to tell

101
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,859
No, sir!

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,935
 Sing of the bravest mountain man

103
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,301
 Sing of the strong and the fleet

104
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:50,137
 Colter's courage was in his heart

105
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,076
 And his speed was in his feet

106
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,014
 Now, John Colter heard the Blackfeet

107
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,883
 Claimed the land off to the west

108
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,284
 But he said he'd do his trappin'

109
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,880
 Where the trappin' it was best

110
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,983
 He went and took his share of fur

111
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,552
 Then started back to Fort Manuel

112
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,260
 And he didn't get no warnin'

113
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,925
 Till he heard the Blackfeet yell

114
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:21,170
 Sing of the bravest mountain man

115
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,698
 Sing of the strong and the fleet

116
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,541
 Colter's courage was in his heart

117
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,843
 And his speed was in his feet

118
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,254
Well, John Colter knew
the Blackfeet must believe him unafraid

119
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,449
He looked his captor in the eye

120
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:40,719
And a dangerous game he played

121
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,952
The Blackfoot chief said to his men...

122
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,397
''This prisoner is so brave.

123
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,959
We take his clothes and turn him loose

124
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,505
with a chance his scalp to save.''

125
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:57,369
They set him loose without his clothes

126
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:59,377
Without his shoes and gun

127
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,675
His courage was his only hope

128
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,647
A race for his life to run

129
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:07,414
Their fastest runners after him
Their lances waving high

130
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,955
The knowledge poundin' in his heart

131
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:12,889
That he had to win or die

132
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,819
 Sing of the bravest mountain man

133
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:20,058
 Sing of the strong and the fleet

134
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,665
 Colter's courage was in his heart

135
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:26,296
 And his speed was in his feet

136
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,238
Well, John Colter ran and ran

137
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,073
And he ran and he ran
like an antelope in fright

138
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:36,343
Straight across the cactus thickets
like an arrow in its flight

139
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,407
Lungs a-burstin' with the effort
Every muscle starts to scream

140
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,851
- Six miles of endless runnin'...

141
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,321
And suddenly there's a stream

142
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:48,987
Dives deep into the water
breathin' through a hollow reed

143
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,861
Leavin' Blackfoot runners baffled
by the wonder of his speed

144
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,726
John waited till the red men left

145
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,894
Then walked back to Fort Manuel

146
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:01,399
Three hundred miles of barefoot trail

147
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:04,269
Said he'd like to rest a spell

148
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,442
 Sing of the bravest mountain man

149
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:11,108
 Sing of the strong and the fleet

150
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:14,411
 Colter's courage was in his heart

151
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,819
 And his speed was in his feet

152
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,551
 And his speed was in his feet 

153
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,659
All right now.
lt's time all you youngsters turned in.

154
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,223
Come on, Bobo.

155
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:37,308
Obie, l'm lookin' for Captain Stephen.
You seen him;

156
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:40,038
He pulled out with Hank and Doc
earlier this mornin'.

157
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,774
Said they was going up through
the notch yonder to take a look.

158
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,372
Probably looking for lndians.

159
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,884
Won't be satisfied
till they find some.

160
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:49,945
Yeah, they're sure trying
to keep us worked up, all right.

161
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:54,757
Pretty fair stock you got, Obie.
Lot of money tied up in them.

162
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,329
lt'll be a big risk
trying to drive them through to Oregon.

163
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,695
Same risk you're taking with yourn.

164
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,666
Speculation's my business.

165
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,861
Take them off your hands at a price.

166
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,204
What kind of price;

167
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,867
- Oh, 50 dollars a head.

168
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,342
These folks with just wagon horses

169
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,248
is gonna hit Oregon
with a bunch of gone'd wind-broke stock

170
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,718
that won't be fit to work in the fields.

171
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:25,951
They'll have clearing and plowing
and log-raising to head up.

172
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,391
You have to have fresh stock
to even get a crop in.

173
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,951
And where are they gonna get it;

174
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,657
From me, naturally.
That's the whole idea.

175
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:36,460
Yeah, at maybe ten times the price
you're offering me.

176
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,368
l told you. l am a speculator.

177
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,397
Well, Mr. Armitage,
l'm keeping my horses.

178
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,532
[clicks tongue]

179
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,817
Mrs. Stephen,
have you seen the children;

180
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,478
Oh, they're around somewhere
gathering firewood.

181
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:56,453
They'll probably turn up
and start raising dust

182
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,356
- the minute l get my wash on the line.
- Here, let me help you.

183
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,629
Say, we got pretty far away from camp.

184
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:12,899
Nothing but a lot
of old buffalo chips back there.

185
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,068
lndians! l think they saw me.
Scatter and hide.

186
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,239
- Let's get out of here.
- Dan said not to move.

187
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:44,680
Maybe more of 'em around.
Better wait here till dark.

188
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,050
[crying]

189
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,903
Jim, l thought you'd never get here.

190
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,171
- What's the matter;
- The children are missing.

191
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:14,735
Missing; What do you mean;

192
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:18,010
Bobo and Jerry and Jim,
they haven't come back yet.

193
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,051
- Dan and Myra...
- And my boy, too.

194
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,952
The last l saw them, they were going up
on the ridge late this afternoon.

195
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,514
The ridge! What tarnal idget would
ever let them get that far out of camp;

196
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,423
Well, the two older boys
were with 'em. l don't...

197
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:31,292
Of all the redneck greenhorns
l ever see'd...

198
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:32,955
- Hold it, Hank.
- Hold it, nothing!

199
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,125
l've told 'em before
and l'll tell 'em again that...

200
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,860
Oh, Mommy!

201
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:44,731
Are you all right; You had your mother
scared to death, you know that;

202
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,906
Hold on, young'uns. Hold on.
What's this all about;

203
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:51,211
The lndians took Dan.

204
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,342
- lnjuns;
- Yeah, they were all painted up.

205
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,319
- How many;
- We saw four.

206
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,411
But they didn't see us.

207
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:58,319
Dan walked right up to them
before they could.

208
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,618
Scouts for a war party.

209
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,853
Well, let's just don't stand here,
let's go after 'em.

210
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,189
Come on.

211
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:07,860
- Just when did this happen;
- lt was still sunlight...

212
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:10,731
- Maybe three, four hours ago.
- Four hours.

213
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:12,829
Hank.

214
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:21,108
Might as well unsaddle.
They got a four-hour start.

215
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,842
''Unsaddle;''
What do you mean ''unsaddle;''

216
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,680
Only the good Lord knows
what that boy is up against out there.

217
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,415
And only the good Lord can track
them Pawnees before daylight.

218
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,753
John, isn't there
anything we can do to...

219
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,094
Do we have to wait;

220
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,167
Afraid so, until daylight, anyway.

221
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,033
lf we went out there now,

222
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,667
we'd just trample out any tracks
they may have left.

223
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:24,174
 Hear us, O Lord

224
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:29,978
 We need your guiding light

225
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:32,539
 Hear us, O Lord

226
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:38,613
 Shine upon the prairie night

227
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:43,258
 Hear us, O Lord

228
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:47,458
 Strengthen our faith

229
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:52,765
 We must be brave at dawn...

230
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:57,435
Be light enough to reach Cheyenne
in another hour.

231
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,239
Thought l caught a wink
of something moving out there.

232
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,846
l told you l see'd something.

233
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,190
lt's no Pawnee. Come on.

234
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,839
Easy, boy.

235
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,240
lndians.

236
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,039
Where, Danny;

237
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:38,276
They're back on the hills.

238
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,942
Now, how many was there;

239
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,484
Hundreds.

240
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:45,280
Some of them chased me.

241
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:48,888
Maybe... close.

242
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,723
The main Pawnee war party.

243
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,722
And they know we're here.

244
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,832
- They'll hit with the sun.
- Yeah.

245
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,395
And we ain't got a chance.

246
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:03,830
Well, not here.

247
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:08,669
We might up in the notch.

248
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:11,847
Yeah, if we could get up there in time.

249
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,076
We sure can try.

250
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,925
All right, break up the camp.

251
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:28,726
Laura!

252
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,561
Dan! Are you all right;

253
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:36,038
He'll be all right soon as he gets
some rest. Let's get him in the wagon.

254
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,507
- Hold it! Hold it!

255
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,034
Now don't get excited,
but there's a Pawnee war camp nearby.

256
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:42,102
They may attack.

257
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,206
Our best bet's to get up into the notch
yonder afore daylight.

258
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,183
Span up your wagons
as fast as you can.

259
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:49,584
Lighten up your loads
'cause every extra pound counts.

260
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:50,814
Throw away everything you can spare

261
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,754
and half of what
you can't get along without.

262
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:56,351
All right, get moving! Come on!
Come on, now get moving!

263
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,959
l'll get your team.

264
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:05,903
Hurry up there with them horses!

265
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:15,102
Jim, get the horses.

266
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:31,960
All right now! You don't need
to keep that stuff. Throw it out.

267
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,942
Throw out that stuff!
You don't need it!

268
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:57,016
- About ready, Cap;
- Just about.

269
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,551
- Got our packs made up, Doc.
- Good.

270
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,060
Send any extra men and guns
to the end of the train.

271
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:06,996
l'm gonna rig a couple of wagons
as sort of a rear guard.

272
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,028
We ain't never used
these horses before, Pa.

273
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:14,629
Yep, l'm just making sure
nobody runs off and leaves us.

274
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,240
This will be the toughest drive yet.
Sure you can make it;

275
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,905
- l have so far, haven't l;
- Sure have.

276
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:29,053
Get those horses over there!
Hitch 'em up.

277
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,123
- Joe.
- Yeah.

278
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,168
- Take over my pack horse, will you;
- Sure thing, Doc.

279
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:51,839
All right, boys, the best shots
take the guns, the rest load.

280
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,310
- Pile in.
- Let's go. Come on.

281
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,911
Roll your wagons!

282
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,477
Get 'em moving. l'll cover the rear.

283
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,453
Rope up them wagons!

284
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,084
Hyah! Hyah!

285
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,137
Let 'em have it!

286
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:29,881
- Spread out! Spread out!
- When the wagons clear, fall back!

287
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:15,419
Let's pull back a bit
where we're not spread out so much.

288
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,392
Pull back!

289
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,738
They'll come
straight through this time.

290
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:39,544
We couldn't turn 'em
if we had three times as many guns.

291
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:42,576
Obie, Armitage.

292
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,890
This involves you two.

293
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,329
They're gonna charge straight up here
and we can't stop them.

294
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:54,888
- There's just one thing to do.
- What's that;

295
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:59,362
Well, a Pawnee'd rather take a horse
than a scalp any day.

296
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,236
l wanna turn your loose horses
against them.

297
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:06,003
- Now, wait a minute, Grayson.
- lt's the horses or our hide.

298
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:14,179
Obie!

299
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:16,618
- Not my horses, you won't.
- No;

300
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,178
[grunts]

301
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,726
Come on, give me a hand.

302
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,066
 Wringle wrangle

303
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,605
 Jingy jong jangle

304
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:17,140
[whistles] Ha!

305
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,143
 A mighty fine horse
looking round the course

306
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:22,873
 Gonna find me a pretty woman's love

307
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:25,676
 Wringle wrangle

308
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,240
 Jingy jong jangle

309
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:28,512
Ha!

310
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,178
 Got my spurs on my boots

311
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,846
 And I don't give a hoot

312
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,721
 Gonna find me a pretty woman's love

313
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,185
 I'll get a dollar's worth of beans

314
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:38,694
 A new pair ofjeans

315
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,288
 Get a woman to cook and wash

316
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,528
 And things

317
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,662
 Wringle wrangle

318
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,328
 Jingy jong jangle

319
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:48,895
[whistles] Ha!

320
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,806
 When I die, I ain't a-gonna cry

321
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,572
 If I have me a pretty woman's love

322
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:58,080
 If I have me a pretty woman's love 

323
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,566
Bissonette, you old horse!

324
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,437
Breckenridge!
So you're still alive, eh, mon ami.

325
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:28,000
So, the trading post is still up
and you're running the fort.

326
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,104
Meet Doc Grayson.

327
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,581
Bissonette, here,
is the boss of Fort Laramie.

328
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,844
Please to meet you, doctor.

329
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,410
This country sure needs
some white medicine men, eh;

330
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,547
l'm afraid l'm a better mule skinner
then l am a doctor.

331
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:42,320
Oh, welcome to Fort Laramie.

332
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:43,655
You have good crossing;

333
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:46,856
Kind of rough, thanks to the Pawnees.

334
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,826
lt's mighty good
to see friendly lndians for a change.

335
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:55,100
Oh, the Sioux are never
what you call ''friendly,'' by God.

336
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:58,300
- That's why l rode out to meet you.
- They got their dander up again;

337
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,072
Yeah, that's Chief Wolfs Brother's men.

338
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,739
Oh, l never heard of him
making trouble for wagon outfits.

339
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:05,679
Oh, no, not usually.

340
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,015
But the last wagon train through here
killed a couple of his braves

341
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,520
and the whole tribe's
in a pretty bad mood.

342
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,819
They wouldn't try nothing
this close to the fort.

343
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,449
Oh, probably not.

344
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,985
But it's Sioux country
for a long way west of here.

345
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,498
You think he might close up the trail;

346
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,159
Mon ami, how do you guess
with an lndian;

347
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,264
Well, it won't do no harm
to keep out of his way.

348
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,940
Supposing you show us
where you want us to camp.

349
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,670
Here will be a good place. Right here.

350
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:37,111
Circle your wagons!

351
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,390
Looks like that hide
has seen better days.

352
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:32,561
We're gonna make robes out of them.

353
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:35,196
Real robes,
like the lndian chiefs wear!

354
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:38,366
Well, if that's what you want,
aren't you going about it the wrong way;

355
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:39,841
How do you mean;

356
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,437
Well, if an lndian wants something
a white man has,

357
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:46,074
- what does he do;
- Scalps 'em!

358
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,742
l mean a friendly lndian.

359
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:52,880
He takes what he has to trade to their
trading post and trades for something.

360
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:56,688
l... wonder who'd be going in
to Fort Laramie this morning.

361
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:00,557
Mr. Armitage.

362
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,660
Seeing as you don't mind
for company this morning,

363
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,928
how about taking
my young friends over to the fort

364
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:06,560
and helping them with their trading;

365
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:10,034
Well, l...

366
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:15,774
Tell Bissonette to see
that they get a fair trade.

367
00:42:15,846 --> 00:42:18,280
Why don't you take care
of your own errands, Grayson;

368
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:21,409
Can't this morning.
l got something else to do.

369
00:42:23,687 --> 00:42:26,554
As a matter of fact, l need your help.

370
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,395
Well, come on, let's go.

371
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,891
How about playing teacher;

372
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:37,560
Injuries to the Head.

373
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:40,968
Must have suffered one myself
to think l can learn this.

374
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,562
Let's see that.

375
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:51,075
Salvage. Hope you don't mind.

376
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:53,708
l hoped this would happen
when l threw them away.

377
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,945
l think Dad would be pleased, too,
if he could know.

378
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,753
- Oh, will you give me a hand;
- Later.

379
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,094
But l have this washing to do now.

380
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:14,938
And a little soap and water
wouldn't hurt this either.

381
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,139
Careful with that shirt!
lt's the only dress-up one l got!

382
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:56,136
Lean 'em up against there.

383
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:15,727
Are you arming these savages,
knowing the mood they're in;

384
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:19,064
That savage, as you call him,
is my customer.

385
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:23,004
And guns are good for hunting
as well as fighting, by God.

386
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:25,667
But if he pays my price,
l sell him what he wants.

387
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:27,301
To sell is my business.

388
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:29,346
No matter who gets the bullet
in the back, eh;

389
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:33,440
lt's an easier way to die
than by the arrow, monsieur.

390
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:35,280
Can l do something for you;

391
00:44:35,352 --> 00:44:38,480
Yes, my little friends here
would like to make a trade.

392
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,688
And see you make it a fair one.

393
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:49,362
And what is your pleasure,
ladies and gentlemen;

394
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,731
- Well, we got these here hides.
- Real good hides!

395
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:52,826
From real buffalo!

396
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:55,838
They smell a little
but they're almost cured.

397
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,274
Oui, l can see.

398
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:04,207
And what do you want for these
real good... [sniffs] hides, huh;

399
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,340
- Buffalo robes.
- All finished up.

400
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,511
- Like the lndian chiefs wear.
- One for each of us.

401
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:13,956
You... You catch me
at just the right moment.

402
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:16,822
l'm over-stocked
with these finished robes.

403
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:21,831
And l just cannot get my hands
on enough good green... hides.

404
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:23,389
What should l do with these;

405
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:26,798
Drop them right there.

406
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,302
This way.

407
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:38,979
One each a piece, huh;

408
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:59,102
He says to tell you
to keep them folded this way.

409
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:01,831
And when you get to the snows
of the big montagne,

410
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:03,099
put them on your beds.

411
00:46:03,173 --> 00:46:06,108
They'll keep you warm
and you'll have no sickness.

412
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:10,040
Pretty soon then you'll be big enough
to wear them like chiefs, huh;

413
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:12,878
[speaking native language]

414
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:21,521
He says to tell you
his name is Many Stars,

415
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:24,254
the great medicine man of the Sioux.

416
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:27,195
He says to tell you
your days will be long

417
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:29,892
and your enemies will fall before you.

418
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,312
You had better buy him
the tobacco, monsieur.

419
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:52,187
lt is customary, eh.

420
00:47:58,422 --> 00:47:59,912
Now, just a minute.

421
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:12,862
Now, look...

422
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:15,835
- What's going on;
- Shh.

423
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:19,966
Daughter of Rising Sun.

424
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:25,215
Skin like white snow on mountain.

425
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:33,486
Daughter of Rising Sun, great medicine.

426
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:41,026
Take your hands off her!

427
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:52,941
Wolfs Brother, hold on!

428
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,503
You could have
lost your scalp, monsieur.

429
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:25,565
- Never put a hand to an lndian.
- But he put his hand to her.

430
00:49:25,642 --> 00:49:27,803
Only because he thought
she was pretty.

431
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:32,076
Because Many Stars told him
she was good medicine, good luck.

432
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:38,412
Go back to your camp now.
l try to make this right with the chief.

433
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:05,277
- Oh!

434
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:23,483
Little Thunder.

435
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:25,586
Dan.

436
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,364
Let's try that once more.

437
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:55,715
Just once more.

438
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:35,526
Dan says some of the company are
getting impatient to be moving again.

439
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,365
Still a long way to Oregon.

440
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:40,129
l know.

441
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:43,362
But just a few more days.

442
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:45,403
Trouble is...

443
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:50,478
...every day lost brings us just that
much closer to snow in the mountains.

444
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:51,878
l suppose.

445
00:52:52,783 --> 00:52:55,877
But today l wish
the whole world were like this.

446
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:59,417
The good grass, the sun.

447
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:03,449
No problems, no hardships.

448
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,121
lt's asking a lot, isn't it;

449
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:13,562
l'll settle for an hour like this
whenever it comes along.

450
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:20,571
- Laura.
- Hmm;

451
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,669
That old chief made
Little Thunder go home

452
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,543
just when we were
starting to have fun.

453
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:27,174
Well, maybe it's time for his supper.

454
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:31,312
And it's nearly time for yours.
Run along, get cleaned up.

455
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:41,853
l didn't want to say nothing in front
of Laura, but that bull-headed Armitage

456
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:44,230
had a run-in with Wolfs Brother
down at the fort.

457
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:45,290
What about;

458
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:46,835
The chief seemed quite taken
with little Myra.

459
00:53:46,903 --> 00:53:49,497
Said something about
her being good medicine.

460
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:51,803
l think we've been in his camp
just about long enough.

461
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,173
Cap, we better get out of here
before something else happens.

462
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:55,472
l agree.

463
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:57,638
Let's keep it
just between the three of us.

464
00:53:57,714 --> 00:54:00,547
And just be sure we're
ready to roll in the morning.

465
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,217
And then,
Dr. John told Captain Stephen

466
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:09,281
that it would be forever
before he got to wear his clean shirt

467
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,759
- if we didn't have the dance tonight.

468
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:14,319
And Hank said
that we wouldn't have any dancing

469
00:54:14,397 --> 00:54:16,695
after we left here tomorrow morning.

470
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:19,065
So Captain Stephen said, ''Yes.''

471
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:23,030
- You look awfully pretty.
- And so do you.

472
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:25,700
And you're a pretty accomplished
little gossip, too.

473
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,474
l wonder if Bobo
would like this for her hair.

474
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:33,107
Look, you get your shoes and stockings
on, l'll be right back, hmm;

475
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:34,514
All right.

476
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:45,378
 I used to have a sweetheart
But now I got none

477
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:49,585
 Since partin', my darlin'
I care not for one

478
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:53,254
 The day that I left her
she started to cry

479
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,198
 Says, ''If I can't love you
I surely will die''

480
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:01,432
 Green grow the lilacs
all sparklin' with dew

481
00:56:01,504 --> 00:56:05,702
 I'm lonely, my darlin'
since parting with you

482
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:09,233
 And by your next meeting
I hope to prove true

483
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:11,280
 And exchange the green lilacs

484
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:13,213
 For the red, white and blue

485
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:20,985
 I passed my love's window
both early and late

486
00:56:21,057 --> 00:56:25,153
 The look that she gave me
it made my heart ache

487
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:29,130
 The look that she gave me
was harmful to see

488
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,190
 She loved another one...

489
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,327
 Better than me

490
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:36,861
 Green grow the lilacs
all sparklin' with dew

491
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,933
 I'm lonely, my darlin'
since partin' with you

492
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:44,674
 But by next meetin'
I'll hope to prove true

493
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:46,682
 And change the green lilacs

494
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,684
 For the red, white and blue

495
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:50,913
 And change the green lilacs

496
00:56:50,987 --> 00:56:53,888
 For the red, white and blue 

497
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:00,153
Just a little song
to pay you for my laundry.

498
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:05,664
Why is it doctors
are never good at tying ties;

499
00:57:07,203 --> 00:57:08,295
Here.

500
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:19,340
Hank.

501
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:32,319
Dan.

502
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:38,298
- Ride over and fetch Bissonette.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:40,733
And hurry!

504
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:45,864
Benjamin, you and Obie
spread some buffalo robes over there.

505
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:05,694
They want to palaver with us.

506
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,144
What does it mean, John;

507
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:34,721
lt's hard to tell.

508
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:02,718
Do as he did.

509
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:49,529
Be friendly,
but be very careful, mes amis.

510
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,161
Tell the chief he's welcome to our camp.

511
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:03,171
- You chief;
- l am.

512
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:08,143
Are you father, little daughter,
Rising Sun;

513
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:10,643
He means little Myra Thompson.

514
01:00:11,621 --> 01:00:15,182
The little girl has no father.
Only a brother and sister.

515
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:20,654
Good.

516
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:32,908
The chief says his gods have told him
to make a trade with the white man.

517
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:45,678
Those ponies are trained hunters.
The best of the Sioux herd.

518
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:49,691
With them you will always be able
to keep your cooking pot full of game,

519
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,590
all the way to the Big Water.

520
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,461
The white buffalo robe is sacred.

521
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,292
That robe will protect you

522
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:30,195
from bad spirits
the rest of your journey.

523
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,528
The ceremonial whistle is a sign
to all Dakota chiefs and braves

524
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:38,199
that you are friends to be protected.

525
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:40,768
ln other words, mes amis...

526
01:01:40,843 --> 01:01:43,937
ln other words, he's offering us
a guarantee of safe passage.

527
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:46,004
What does he want for it;

528
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:51,047
Well, these gifts
are the greatest he can give.

529
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,180
Them ain't no gifts.
He's looking to trade for something.

530
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:57,351
- What's he want;
- He wants to trade for the little girl.

531
01:01:57,427 --> 01:01:59,361
Trade;

532
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:04,025
The chief claims that the great spirit
has spoken to him through Many Stars,

533
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,625
the great medicine man of the Sioux.

534
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:09,198
He says his gods have told him

535
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:12,935
that the little one will bring good luck
to the Dakotas.

536
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:18,104
And the chief also promises
to raise her like a Sioux princess

537
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:21,514
and take care of her as his own.

538
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:27,687
ln time, she will become wife
to Little Thunder, his son.

539
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,260
Tell him no.

540
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:39,000
You understand, Captain, if you try
to take your wagons on from here

541
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,468
without giving up the little one,

542
01:02:41,537 --> 01:02:43,562
he will set the whole Sioux tribe
against you.

543
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,733
Does he think we're as pagan as he is;

544
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:48,103
The answer is no.

545
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,837
You not father.

546
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:57,115
- Who speaks for little yellow hair;
- l speak for my sister.

547
01:02:57,186 --> 01:03:00,121
No talk with woman. You not father.

548
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,218
- l'm her father and mother.
- No talk to woman!

549
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:07,593
You'll talk to me! You pompous savage.

550
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:10,394
You heard our captain. We won't trade.

551
01:03:11,668 --> 01:03:15,035
How about your son;
Would you trade him to us;

552
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:17,231
You have gods,
you must believe in them.

553
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:18,774
Would they let you do this;

554
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:25,346
Bissonette.

555
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:29,112
Tell the chief Little Yellow Hair
has no magic for his people.

556
01:03:29,185 --> 01:03:30,243
No medicine.

557
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:35,056
Tell him she's a little child and
would sicken and die among strangers.

558
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:38,321
lf Many Stars
has told his chief otherwise...

559
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:42,694
...he gives bad advice
and his own medicine is weak.

560
01:03:46,969 --> 01:03:48,994
[speaking native language]

561
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,348
Tell him...

562
01:04:03,252 --> 01:04:07,882
Tell him we know the honor he pays us
and the value of the gifts he offers.

563
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,650
But we will not part with the child.

564
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,638
Well, what do we do now;

565
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:06,699
Camp right where we are
and be as stubborn as he is, l reckon.

566
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:09,404
l guess they won't try nothing
this close to the fort.

567
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:24,452
Stay out of it.
We're in enough trouble as it is.

568
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:28,058
The boy is hurt.

569
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:40,802
- That was mighty close.
- The boy is badly hurt.

570
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,531
l was talking about you.

571
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,539
You know that tap
you got on the shoulder;

572
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:48,065
That means your scalp belongs to him
now anytime he wants to claim it.

573
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,903
lf he's as seriously hurt
as l think he is,

574
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,675
he's out to get all of our scalps.

575
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,683
All right. Close up the gates.

576
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:20,793
- What's the idea closing up the fort;
- A Sioux was just now here.

577
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,168
Old Many Stars cannot bring
the boy around.

578
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,503
Most of the lndians
don't think he can do it.

579
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:28,771
- Even if he makes the buffalo prayer.
- The buffalo prayer;

580
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:33,406
Yes. The lndian believes his strength
comes from Tonka Shonka, the buffalo.

581
01:09:34,483 --> 01:09:36,451
And when he has great trouble
he prays to him.

582
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:39,815
lt's a medicine man's
most powerful medicine.

583
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:42,414
He only uses it
when everything else fails.

584
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:45,756
lf that boy dies,
you folks are bad medecin.

585
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:48,422
We figure your fort's safer
than our wagons.

586
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:51,466
We wanna bring our women
and young'uns over here.

587
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:54,992
lf that boy dies,
the Sioux will get the little one,

588
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,336
even if they have to take my fort down
piece by piece.

589
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:01,073
- You mean you won't help us;
- Did l say that;

590
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:05,943
lt's just that my fort is not any safer
than your wagons.

591
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:09,979
lf there's trouble, l'll do what l can.

592
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,338
Well, the old man
made his talk to the buffalo

593
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,171
and it ain't done no good.

594
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:06,554
You go near that boy now
and they'll kill you.

595
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:18,189
lt's too late l tell you!

596
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:21,931
Maybe. But l've got to try.

597
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:28,634
He'll need help.

598
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,509
The crazy fools.
They ain't got a chance.

599
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:08,214
White man, big medicine.

600
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:12,275
Come to help you save boy's life.

601
01:15:12,988 --> 01:15:14,148
Go!

602
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,854
Two medicines better than one.

603
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:33,899
Prayers of Many Stars good.

604
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,275
Great Spirit hear.

605
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:41,042
Your medicine bring white doctor.

606
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:44,547
Many Stars have big magic.

607
01:15:45,654 --> 01:15:47,144
Now use magic.

608
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,871
The boy's mother
begging a chance for us.

609
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:12,873
Well, if l can help the boy,
the old man can claim the credit.

610
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:15,439
- He ought to see that.
- Don't worry.

611
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,418
He ain't missing no bets.
Not that old devil.

612
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,483
Right now he's figuring out
who he'll blame if the boy dies,

613
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:28,052
after you work on him.

614
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:30,492
You think of that.

615
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:20,605
This is the trouble.

616
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:25,474
lt's a broken clavicle.

617
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:30,050
Bone splinters punctured a vein
in the neck.

618
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:33,883
lnternal bleeding and swelling
are interfering with his breathing.

619
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,956
l'll try to relieve the pressure.

620
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:41,185
How much chance;

621
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,026
Hours ago,
would've been fairly simple.

622
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:47,360
- And now;
- l don't know.

623
01:22:46,241 --> 01:22:48,232
How does it feel
to be a mighty important man

624
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,073
instead of a mighty dead one;

625
01:22:57,586 --> 01:22:59,679
- We're all ready.
- Oh, yeah;

626
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:15,757
You are friend.

627
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:20,724
Wolfs Brother of the Dakotas
take you safe to Big Water.

628
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:43,417
Like to take my place up in front, Dan;

629
01:24:44,225 --> 01:24:45,954
Sure. Come on, Chieftain.

630
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:20,193
Medical man's got more to do
than pound a saddle all day.

631
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:23,758
Yo! Hup!

632
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:28,166
Roll your wagons!

633
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:35,031
 Westward roll the wagons

634
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:37,340
 Always westward roll

635
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:39,937
 Westward roll the wagons

636
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,040
 For Oregon's our goal

637
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,881
 There's magic in the wind

638
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:49,253
 And a brightness in the sky

639
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:51,121
 There's a promised land awaitin'

640
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:53,592
 And we'll get there by and by

641
01:25:53,662 --> 01:25:56,062
 Westward roll the wagons

642
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:58,292
 Westward roll them far

643
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:01,164
 Westward roll the wagons

644
01:26:01,236 --> 01:26:02,931
 Toward the western star

645
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:06,235
 Westward roll, westward roll

646
01:26:06,307 --> 01:26:12,303
 Westward roll
