00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,546
<i>Old Yeller, Old Yeller</i>

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,274
<i>Old Yeller</i>

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,676
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

4
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,803
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,407
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,934
<i>Old Yeller was a mongrel</i>

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,437
<i>An ugly lop-eared mongrel</i>

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,106
<i>Fancy-free without a family tree</i>

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,609
<i>But he could up and do it</i>

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,903
<i>And prove there's nothin' to it</i>

11
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,598
<i>And that's how a good dog should be</i>

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,743
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,871
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:01:02,212
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

15
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,423
<i>Old Yeller was a hunter</i>

16
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,675
<i>A rarin', tearin' hunter</i>

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,553
<i>In any chase he knew just how to run</i>

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,056
<i>And when he hunted trouble</i>

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,184
<i>He always found it double</i>

20
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:19,710
<i>And that's when Old Yeller had fun</i>

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,107
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

22
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,151
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

23
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,380
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

24
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:34,020
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,124
<i>Old Yeller was a fighter
A rootin', tootin' fighter</i>

26
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>In any scrap he knew just what to do</i>

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,420
<i>Knew what to do</i>

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,672
<i>A rough and ready feller</i>

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,841
<i>Although his coat was yeller</i>

30
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,844
<i>His bold Texas heart was true blue</i>

31
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,287
<i>True blue</i>

32
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,640
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,725
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

<i>Here, Yeller</i>

00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,875
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,554
<i>Best doggone dog</i>

39
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,810
<i>In the west</i>

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,292
- What's Pop gonna sell our steers for?
- For money, of course.

41
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,963
- What's money?
- It's what you buy things with.

42
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,465
What do you mean by "buy things"?

43
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,677
Well, if you got money,
you give it to people for stuff.

44
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,263
They say you can get anything for money.

45
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,765
Anything? What's it look like?

46
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,226
Well, I never seen but one piece,

47
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,728
a dollar bill Papa had. It's paper.

48
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,232
- What'd Papa get with this dollar?
- Nothin'. It wasn't no good.

49
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,360
But you just said you could
get anything with money.

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,571
Well, ya can.
But Papa's was Confederate.

51
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,366
- What's Confederate money?
- Confederate money?

52
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,810
Well, it's...

53
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,765
- Well?
- Don't you ever run outta questions?

54
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,419
I wish you didn't have to go.

55
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,546
Right now I feel
sorta the same way, but...

56
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,715
I put 100 head of our steers
in that pool herd

57
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,260
and in Kansas, we can get, maybe,
$4, $5 a head for 'em.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,847
- Cash money, too.
- I know, but...

59
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,099
Ain't nothin' to be sad about,
Katie girl.

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,226
When you think on it, we're lucky.

61
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,729
There's us and the young 'uns,
good land,

62
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,332
plenty of water, game for the killin'.

63
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,861
Cash money is all we need
to get a tight tail-hold on the world.

64
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,089
Will you really be gone three months?

65
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,305
All of three months, maybe four.

66
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,607
Now, honey,
it ain't nothin' to cry about.

67
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,760
It's just that we've
never been separated before.

68
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,720
You know what I'm gonna do
when I sell them steers?

69
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,763
What?

70
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,723
I'm gonna get you a store-bought dress.

71
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,952
The first one you've had
since we come to Texas.

72
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,496
Let's see.

73
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,583
Is this about the right size?

74
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,181
Papa! I aim to go with ya!

75
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,792
You better stay here
and take care of your mama.

76
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,566
Aw, gee, Papa.

77
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,923
But I wanna go. I tell ya, I wanna go!

78
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,425
- I wanna go! Wanna go!
- Arliss.

79
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,053
- You ride a piece with me, Travis.
- All right, Papa.

80
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,682
I wanna go! But I wanna go!

81
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,706
I can ride them old cows same as you.

82
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,772
You can't go on no cow drive, boy.
Them Injuns would scalp you for sure.

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,046
- You think so, Papa?
- I'm certain.

84
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,144
Good-bye, Katie.

85
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,688
Good-bye, Jim dear.

86
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,767
Well, son, while I'm gone,
you'll be the man of the house.

87
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,039
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,189
There'll be the pigs to mark,
fresh meat to shoot.

89
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,066
And mainly, there's the corn patch.

90
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,154
If you don't work it right,
we'll be without bread this winter.

91
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,907
It's sure enough a man-sized job.

92
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,994
Think you can handle Old Jumper
when he's hooked to a plow?

93
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,205
I'll handle him,
or I'll bust his jawbone with a club.

94
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:52,332
Well, all right, boy.
I'll see you this fall.

95
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,797
- Papa, you ain't forgettin' the horse?
- What horse?

96
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,276
Now, Papa, you know I've been
achin' all over for a horse to ride.

97
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,927
I told you time and again.

98
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,325
Well, what you're needin'
worse than a horse is a good dog.

99
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,391
Yes, sir, but what I'm wantin' worst
is a good horse.

100
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,837
All right, boy. You act a man's part,
and I'll bring you a man's horse.

101
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,960
Wanna shake on it?

102
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,269
Whoa.

103
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,770
Whoa!

104
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,196
Whoa, Jumper! Whoa!

105
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,497
Whoa! Whoa, Jumper!

106
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,367
Get away from that mule!

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,877
Let that mule alone!

108
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,967
Papa ain't gone a full day
and look what a mess.

109
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,890
- It's not your fault, son.
- Maybe not, but...

110
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,399
Get, you crazy fool dog! Get!

111
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,766
I know one thing.

112
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,666
That old dog better not come around
here while I got me a gun in my hands.

113
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,485
- Who busted down the fence?
- Where have you been?

114
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,196
Bear huntin'. Who busted the fence down?

115
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,450
- Danged old stray dog.
- Dog? Where is he?

116
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,975
You won't ever see him.
I done rocked him clean off this place.

117
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,765
But I need me a good huntin' dog.

118
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,083
Arliss, go wash up
before supper's all cold.

119
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,356
- Aw, Mama.
- Go on!

120
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,239
- What do you got in that pocket?
- Nothin'.

121
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,717
- Let's see what you got this time.
- Aw, Mama.

122
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,678
Come on. Come on.

123
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,140
Oh, Arliss! How can you even
touch those ugly things?

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,183
They aren't ugly.

125
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,811
Look it here at his belly,
how soft and smooth and pretty it is.

126
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,356
I know. Everything you catch is pretty.
But take him outta here.

127
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,523
You can't keep him in the house.

128
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,150
You mean I gotta throw him away?

129
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,152
And everything else
you got in those pockets.

130
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,480
My frog, too?

131
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,475
Arliss, what all have you got
in those pockets?

132
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,432
Aw, Mama, it's just
a little old garter snake.

133
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,150
I don't care. Get it out of here!

134
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,631
Arliss, if you don't stop catchin' things
and bringin' 'em into the house,

135
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,699
I'm gonna switch you good.

136
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,887
And don't you ever,
ever pick up a snake again.

137
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,806
- Ya understand?
- Yes'm.

138
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,766
Now, go out there
and wash up for supper.

139
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,834
Little old garter snake ain't harmful.

140
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,437
If he'll pick up one kind of snake,
he'll pick up another.

141
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,898
Next time it could be a rattler.

142
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,819
I wish he did have a good dog,
like Old Bell.

143
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,406
When you were little, Old Bell
wouldn't let you near anything harmful.

144
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,635
Ain't another dog in this world
like Old Bell was.

145
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,185
Sure would've made short work
of that old, yeller stray.

146
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,796
Mama.

147
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,184
I was just thinkin'.

148
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,374
About your papa.
I guess he's eaten his breakfast by now.

149
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,568
Probably wanted to get an early start.

150
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
I wonder how far they got yesterday.

151
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,050
Oh, I don't know.
Papa says 15 mile a day

152
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,469
is a long haul for a trail herd.

153
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,913
I guess he made about 10 mile.

154
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,724
Mush is about ready.
If you want middling meat with it,

155
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,642
better go out and cut some down.

156
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,164
All right.

157
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,052
Mama, what happened
to the middling meat?

158
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,763
Why, you no-account, thievin' rascal!

159
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,353
Get outta here!

160
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,183
A dog!

161
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,486
All right!

162
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,033
You hit my dog
and I'll wear you to a frazzle.

163
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,469
Travis, Arliss, whatcha doin' out there?

164
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,139
- Let go of my stick!
- Arliss! Arliss.

165
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,350
Don't you dare hit your brother.

166
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,185
He was tryin' to kill my dog.

167
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,854
He's not your dog,
and I never even touched him.

168
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,356
Where on earth did he come from?

169
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,525
He's that same stray dog
that wrecked the fence.

170
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,377
Stole that big side
of middling meat there too!

171
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,380
He's my dog.
Ain't nobody gonna try to hurt him.

172
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,304
Well.

173
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,229
Looks like we've got us a dog.

174
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,708
Mama, you don't mean we're gonna
keep that old, ugly yeller dog

175
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,085
after what he done?

176
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,756
He isn't a ugly yeller dog.
He's a pretty yeller dog.

177
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,153
Come on now.

178
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,321
Come on.

179
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,062
Why not let Arliss claim him?

180
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,148
And have him stampedin' Jumper again?

181
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,607
You could break him of that.

182
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,318
He's a thief, Mama!
He'll steal us blind.

183
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,779
Most creatures will steal
when they're hungry enough.

184
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,473
All right, but I still don't want him!

185
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,910
Now, Travis, you're not bein' fair.

186
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,330
You had a dog when you were little,
and Arliss has never had one.

187
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,875
He's too little for you to play with.
He gets lonely.

188
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,089
After breakfast, you can
take to the woods and get us a deer.

189
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,800
And, Travis, do some thinkin'
on what I said

190
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,870
about Arliss and that old, yeller dog.

191
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,532
Come on, boy.

192
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,244
Jumper, you jug head!

193
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,771
A bunch of bobwhites,
and you act like you ain't got the brains

194
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,249
of a blind goose in a hail storm.

195
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,603
Arliss, get that dirty,
old dog outta our drinkin' water!

196
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,081
Aw, mind your own business!

197
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,462
Get outta there!

198
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,057
You quit rockin' my dog!

199
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,162
Quit chuckin' them rocks at me!

200
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,481
Stop it, Arliss! Stop it!

201
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,466
You rock my dog again

202
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,635
- and I'll bust your head open!
- Arliss!

203
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,782
Arliss!

204
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,140
Travis, what are you doin'
to your little brother?

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,476
Him and that dirty, old, yeller dog
were wallowing in our drinkin' water.

206
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,811
He was rockin' my dog!

207
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,563
Look here, young rooster.
If you wanna keep outta trouble,

208
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,232
you start minding your big brother.

209
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,109
You mean I gotta mind him?

210
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,443
He ain't my papa.

211
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,694
You start mindin' him just the same.

212
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,198
Now go inside
and take off those wet clothes.

213
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,643
What I oughta do is get me a sprout
and give him one good thrashing.

214
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,371
Take it easy, son.
He's only a little boy.

215
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,441
Papa wouldn't want that old dog
in our drinkin' water.

216
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,544
Papa wouldn't have started
a rock fight with Arliss either.

217
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,920
I never started no rock fight. He...

218
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,283
Arliss rocks me. Mama blesses me out.

219
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,748
And you. You get off scot-free.

220
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,539
What I oughta do is
run you clean off this place.

221
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,367
You touch a bite of this meat,

222
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,266
and come mornin' I'm gonna
shoot you right between the eyes.

223
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,303
I'll be dogged.

224
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:08,072
Mama? Did you
feed that old dog anything?

225
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,467
Well, no, I forgot to.
Been so long since we had a dog.

226
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,492
Well, he's sure gone
and rustled up some grub somewhere.

227
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,412
He ain't touched a bite of that venison.

228
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,768
You might know
he'd be too smart for that.

229
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,771
You could've put it on the ground
and he wouldn't have touched it.

230
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,608
You better get dressed if you want
an early start cuttin' fence posts.

231
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,925
Yes'm.

232
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,502
Come on, Yeller boy, get him!

233
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,345
Get him, Yeller! There he is!

234
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,809
There he goes, over there!

235
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,521
Missed him!

236
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,777
That's got him! Good for you, boy!

237
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:36,035
Mama! Mama, look at the fish
that I caught! Ain't he a whopper?

238
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,824
Oh, Arliss!
You're all wet and muddy again.

239
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,660
- But, Mama, I had to.
- Had to?

240
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,171
Had to dive way down
deep under to catch this fish.

241
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:51,255
He was way down deep under
where there was this cave

242
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,173
and it was real dark and muddy.

243
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,323
And there's about a million other
fish and they all tried to eat me.

244
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,408
And I had to throw rocks at 'em.

245
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,011
And then there's
these two big snakes and...

246
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,455
Sounds like that cottontail
you roped this mornin'.

247
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,874
But I did rope him, didn't I, Mama?

248
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,853
He came runnin' by,
and I roped him right by the ears.

249
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,756
Well, you certainly brought home
a rabbit, and now this big catfish.

250
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,779
You're gettin' to be
as good a hunter as Travis.

251
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,135
Here, Mama.

252
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,930
Come on, Yeller! Come on, boy!

253
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,890
Yeah!

254
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,768
Mama, you know them
is just big windies Arliss is tellin'.

255
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,771
Now, Travis, let him
tell his stories the way he wants to.

256
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,941
But, Mama, I just seen that old,
yeller dog catch this fish.

257
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,860
Arliss is just a little boy
with a big imagination.

258
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,779
Won't hurt him to let him use it.

259
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,615
We keep that old, yeller dog much longer

260
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,969
and it's gonna make
Arliss the biggest liar in Texas!

261
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,659
Here, boy, come and get some bread.

262
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,955
Here.

263
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,408
Come on.

264
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,102
A little closer.

265
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,251
Come on. I'll give you some more bread.

266
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,215
Come on.

267
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,444
Come on. Come on.

268
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,797
Come on.

269
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:27,057
What's that?

270
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,404
Come on, boy.

271
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,048
Arliss, turn it loose!

272
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,050
Arliss, watch out!

273
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,580
Turn it loose!

274
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,064
Go on, ya old fool, before she kills ya.

275
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,202
Oh, you crazy, wonderful dog!

276
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,791
He acts like it's a great big romp,
doesn't he, Travis?

277
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,318
Crazy as a bull bat.

278
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,672
But he's a heap more dog
than I ever had him figured for.

279
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,165
Just listen to those
songbirds this mornin'...

280
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,983
Singin' their heads off.

281
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,171
It's like the year
your Papa and I settled here.

282
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,966
We meant to build over
at the Salt Licks settlement

283
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,819
where it would've been safer
from the Indians, but...

284
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,433
That last day, we camped by the spring.

285
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,644
And the bee myrtle was in blossom

286
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,840
and full of singin' birds, like now.

287
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,551
And it was all so pretty,
I just couldn't go on.

288
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,389
And I said to your Papa,
"Jim, this is it.

289
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,634
"This is home."

290
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,642
Hello, the house!

291
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,459
It's Bud Searcy and Lisbeth, too.

292
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,278
You might know he'd land
right at mealtime.

293
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,425
Howdy, Miss Coates. Howdy do?
Howdy, boy. How's everybody?

294
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,510
- Hello, Mr. Searcy.
- Slide down, child.

295
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,553
Hello, Lisbeth.

296
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,264
Just dropped over to see
if there's anything I could do.

297
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,726
Travis, take this pony to the corn crib
and strip the saddle gear off him.

298
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,771
- Yes, Mr. Searcy.
- Might feed him a bit of corn

299
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,481
while you're at it, boy.

300
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,857
Won't you come and set a while?

301
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,652
Well, I believe I will shade
up for a spell, Miss Coates.

302
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,029
Come on, Lisbeth. Hot, ain't it?

303
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,199
We don't get some rain pretty soon,
this country's gonna burn up bad.

304
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,077
Corn crop ain't gonna be worth nothin'
more than a whirlwind nubbins.

305
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:57,648
Some folks'll be scrapin' the bottom of
their meal barrels come wintertime.

306
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,002
This here's hanged too long.

307
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,420
Lisbeth, honey, run down to the spring

308
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,069
and fetch your poor old pappy
a bucket of fresh water.

309
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,260
I'll tell you, Miss Coates...

310
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,055
It's a heavy responsibility
ridin' herd on the settlement

311
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,224
while the menfolks is gone.

312
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,184
Wears a man right down to a frazzle.

313
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,560
But I ain't complainin', though.

314
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,834
I was chose for this job
and I'll get her done.

315
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,153
I, kinda figured to head up
that cow drive to Kansas myself.

316
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,572
But when man after man
called me all spoke private like...

317
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,907
Beggin' me to stay behind,

318
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,760
look after you womenfolks
and the young ones, I seen my duty.

319
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,538
Knowed I was bein' called on
for a bigger job.

320
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,748
Jim said you were gonna protect us all.

321
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,960
Mighty lucky thing I done it, too.
Know what happened the other day?

322
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,294
That fool kid of Jed Simpson's

323
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,171
shot at a bunch of javelina hogs
and wounded one of 'em.

324
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,092
Set it too squealin'. Ha! Be dogged
that the rest of them didn't tree that boy.

325
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,412
Kept him up there too till I happened
along and seed what a pickle he was in.

326
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,391
Of course I couldn't chase
them pesky javelinas off.

327
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,978
But I did go tell that boy's Mama where
he was, so she could rest easy

328
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,173
till the varmints left out
and give him a chance to climb down.

329
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,612
Yep. Lookin' out after you womenfolks

330
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,431
and the young ones
sure keeps a man a-hoppin' around.

331
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,368
Biggest bother I've had, though, lately

332
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,620
is the thievin' what's been
goin' on at Salt Licks.

333
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,625
Meat stole out of smoke houses.
Hen's nests gettin' robbed.

334
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,795
- Mama, I'm hung...
- Hush, baby. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

335
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,257
Womenfolks losin' bread what they
set out in their windows to cool.

336
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,802
- Sounds like some varmint.
- There ain't no varmint that clever, boy.

337
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,845
Mama, I'm hungry.

338
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,346
- When we gonna ea...
- Arliss.

339
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,349
I told you, don't butt in.
Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

340
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,393
That's all right, Miss Coates.

341
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,665
Ain't nothin' like a little old boy
to know when it's time to eat.

342
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,279
Well, I guess it is gettin'
on toward dinnertime.

343
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,657
Travis, will you go down to the corn
patch and pick us some roastin' ears?

344
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,432
Now, just a minute, Miss Coates.
That boy need help to tote all that corn.

345
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,438
Yes, sir.

346
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,646
Lisbeth, go along with Travis.

347
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,440
Be sure you pick out ears
what is sweet and juicy.

348
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,064
Why, coons been in this corn!
Them thievin' rascals!

349
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,650
You'll have to take to
doggin' 'em overnight.

350
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,485
I got me just the dog for it.

351
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,259
Old Yeller will wipe up the ground
with them pesky varmints.

352
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,200
You think he can't do it?

353
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,578
Oh, no. It... It ain't that.

354
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,182
Well, I didn't wanna
tell you at the house, but...

355
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,064
It was him what done it.

356
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,729
What done what?

357
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,033
What stole all them eggs
and bread and meat and stuff.

358
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,573
You mean Old Yeller?

359
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,621
I seen him suck a batch of eggs.

360
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,206
Seen him swipe a pan of
Grandma's corn bread too.

361
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,998
- But I ain't gonna tell.
- I bet you do.

362
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,649
No, I won't.

363
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,219
Wasn't goin' to even before
I knowed he was your dog.

364
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,717
How come?

365
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,307
Because Miss Priss is gonna have pups.

366
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,309
Your dog'll be their papa.

367
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,514
And I wouldn't want him
to get shot for stealin'.

368
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,632
Just an old arrowhead I picked up.

369
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,985
Comanche, Papa said.

370
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,701
Well, you can have it.

371
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,043
I won't never, never tell.

372
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,938
When you git right down to hogs,
just about the best eatin' there is alive.

373
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,025
And I reckon just about the meanest
critter alive go after his meat.

374
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,485
Cut you 14 different ways
before you can get fixed to rot.

375
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,862
They scare me to death.

376
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,385
Always dread the time when Jim
comes to do the markin'.

377
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:03,619
Yep, hogs is bad, mighty bad. I had me
an uncle once down in east Texas,

378
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,455
tangled a bad hog, he did.
Got cut all to pieces.

379
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,852
Kill him?

380
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,126
Kill him? Why, it killed him
deader than a doornail.

381
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,504
Mr. Searcy, I roped me a rabbit once.

382
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,732
Arliss, be quiet. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

383
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,118
Well, I did. A mean old bitin' one.

384
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,000
Well now, boy,
that's really doin' some ropin'.

385
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,396
You know, speakin' of ropin', I always
done my hog work from up a tree.

386
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,748
Heap safer that way.

387
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,046
How can you work hogs from a tree?

388
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,153
Why, it's strict as a whistle, boy.

389
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,906
Pick you out a tree with a low
hanging limb, but still out of hog reach.

390
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,325
Get your dog to rally
them hogs around the tree.

391
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,099
Reach down your loop,
pull up your pig and go to work on him.

392
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,431
By golly!
That sounds like it might work.

393
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,457
Work? Why, of course it works!

394
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,835
Them old hogs can fuss and charge
around all they please, but up a tree

395
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,108
you're as safe as at home in bed.

396
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:10,477
Travis, boy, you go fetch my pony,
and we'll be pullin' out for home.

397
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,501
I've got a powerful lot to do
before supper time.

398
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,431
It was right neighborly like
of you to feed us, Miss Coates.

399
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,535
Now, don't you fret yourself at all
while your man's gone.

400
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,372
We'll be lookin' in on you again before
you know it. Bye, boy. Bye, Miss Coates.

401
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,019
Bye, Lisbeth.

402
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,813
Bye.

403
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,990
No wonder they don't want him
on no cow drive.

404
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,636
By the time he finished eatin' and visitin'
with everyone this side of Abilene,

405
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,514
them cows would be dead of old age.

406
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,058
Mama, Lisbeth says it's Old Yeller

407
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,228
what's been doin'
all that stealin' out in Salt Licks.

408
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,272
Claimed she catched him at it.

409
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,692
Why, the old rogue.
We'll have to break him of that,

410
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,403
or else everyone
in Salt Licks'll be mad at us.

411
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,614
Somebody'll shoot him! Yeller!

412
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,763
Come here!

413
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,639
You old rascal. You been stealin'!

414
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,584
Maybe we better
take to pennin' him overnight.

415
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,503
I reckon we won't
have to bother for a while.

416
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,008
Listen! I'm gonna keep you
so dang busted busy

417
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,531
you won't have time to go off prowlin'!

418
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,329
No, you don't!

419
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,554
We're stayin' right here and
keepin' them coons run out, you hear?

420
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,848
Look at all them stars, Yeller.

421
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,771
Bushels of 'em.

422
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,044
I wonder if maybe Papa's lying out there

423
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,320
on the trail somewhere,
lookin' at 'em, too.

424
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,861
I wish I was with him,

425
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,763
way off yonder,

426
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,241
up in Kansas...

427
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,169
Seein' all that...

428
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,000
Big...

429
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,043
Country.

430
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,496
Get 'em, Yeller!

431
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,973
Get 'em, Yeller!
Wipe up the ground with 'em!

432
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,552
Yeller sure has been givin'
them coons the mortal fits.

433
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,747
- You tired, son?
- No, ma'am.

434
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,564
Where's Old Rose?

435
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,629
She didn't come up last night.

436
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,757
I figured she hid out somewhere
and had her calf.

437
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,700
I guess I better go hunt her up.

438
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,571
Come on, Yeller.

439
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,876
Remember now, if she's had her calf,
she'll be on the fight.

440
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:59,228
Come on, Yeller!

441
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,986
Quiet, Yeller! Don't rile her!

442
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,314
That's gettin' her, boy!

443
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,278
Get her, Yeller! Bust her again!

444
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:25,169
Try it again, sister,
and Old Yeller'll bust you wide open.

445
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,055
All right, Yeller, get her home.

446
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,513
All right, old sister, you take it easy.

447
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,538
I aim to milk you if I have to
break every bone in your body.

448
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,001
So now, Rose, you know
as well as I we're not gonna hurt ya.

449
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,050
Now, Rose, you take it easy.

450
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,492
You ain't got a chance, sister.

451
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,141
You're done milked
and you don't know it.

452
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,110
I know what!

453
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,905
Here, Yeller.

454
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,114
Son, you bring that dog in here
and Rose will go crazy.

455
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,987
All right, Yeller, hold her there.

456
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,289
Well, if that don't beat all.
I never saw such a dog.

457
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,410
And you won't never see
another one like him.

458
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,131
Hello, the house!

459
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,882
I thought maybe it was Papa.

460
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:50,371
Mornin', ma'am. I'm Burn Sanderson
from down near San 'Tone.

461
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,791
Runnin' me a few head
of cattle over on Devil's Creek.

462
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,334
Yes, Mr. Sanderson?

463
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,670
Bud Searcy told me about an old,
stray dog you had.

464
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,649
Sounded like it might be the one I lost.

465
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,365
You mean a... Big, yeller dog?

466
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,887
That's him all right.

467
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,615
The worst egg-sucker
and camp-robber you ever laid eyes on.

468
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,642
Steal you blind while you're watchin'.

469
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,122
But there never was a better
cow dog born, or a hog dog either.

470
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,505
Travis, go call Old Yeller to the house.

471
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,635
- But, Mama...
- Travis!

472
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,887
Yes, Mama.

473
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,870
Won't you get down, Mr. Sanderson?

474
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,847
Thank you, ma'am.

475
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,567
Arliss.

476
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,927
- What do you want?
- Bring Old Yeller to the house.

477
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,076
- What's the matter?
- You'll find out.

478
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:59,232
Ma'am, you and the boys
don't have much protection out here.

479
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,693
Bad as I need that old dog,
I could give you a loan of him

480
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,403
till your man comes home.

481
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:09,784
No, Mr. Sanderson. If he's
your dog, better take him now.

482
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,682
Well, maybe you're right, ma'am.

483
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,727
Come on, boy.

484
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,643
Why, you prowlin' old rascal.

485
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,831
Come on, boy.

486
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,075
Well, good-bye, ma'am.
I'm sure much obliged.

487
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,167
Come on, Yeller.

488
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,172
That's my dog! You can't take my dog!

489
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,129
You can't take my dog!
You can't take my dog!

490
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,798
- Whoa, boy!
- You can't take my dog!

491
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,495
Arliss, aren't you ashamed,
throwin' rocks at that man?

492
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,832
I'll bust him with another
if he takes my dog off!

493
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,083
Arliss!

494
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,004
Maybe he's right, ma'am.

495
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:06,199
Man comes to take my dog off,
I'd throw a fit too.

496
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,777
Let me talk to this boy a minute.

497
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,705
Well, boy?

498
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,286
Go on, Arliss.

499
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,454
Go on.

500
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,688
Whatcha got in that pocket?

501
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,157
Come on. Let's take a look.

502
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,516
Why, ain't he a jim-dandy.

503
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,337
- Finest lookin' horned toad I ever seen.
- What about my dog?

504
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,585
You mean you really want
that thievin', old, yeller dog?

505
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,466
I sure do.

506
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,735
Well, then maybe we can
do some swappin'.

507
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,465
I've been wantin' mighty bad to get me
a big horned toad like you got there.

508
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,184
You mean you'd swap me Old Yeller
for this here horny toad?

509
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,455
Well, now, that's a fine horny toad,
and I want him bad.

510
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,933
But on the other hand,
he ain't hardly as big as a dog.

511
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:26,237
- Seems like I oughta get a little to boot.
- Like what?

512
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,948
Well, I'll tell you how it is.

513
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,178
I've been in that cow camp
starvin' on my own cookin' so long,

514
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,431
I don't hardly throw a shadow no more.

515
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,767
Now, if you could talk your mama

516
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,246
into feedin' me one,
big woman-cooked meal,

517
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,274
why, I figure it and that
horned toad would be worth

518
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:50,345
at least a lop-eared Yeller dog,
don't you?

519
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,221
Well, I guess so.

520
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,390
Will you feed him, Mama?

521
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,352
Of course I will.

522
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,393
All right, I'll swap ya.

523
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,860
Here, boy!

524
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,739
He's all yours, boy.

525
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,302
Come on, Yeller. Come on, boy.

526
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,406
Hey. What about my toad?

527
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,482
Come on, boy.

528
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,108
Come on.

529
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,661
I haven't ate like this...

530
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,540
Since the time I splurged on a big feed
at the Menger Hotel in San 'Tone.

531
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,418
Well, I'm happy you enjoyed it,
Mr. Sanderson.

532
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,296
Well, ma'am, I guess
I better be gettin' back to camp.

533
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,672
Come with me, boy,
while I get my horse settled.

534
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,799
Yes, sir.

535
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,676
When Mr. Coates gets back,
I want you to come and see us.

536
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,969
I want him to meet ya.

537
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,118
That's mighty nice of ya, ma'am.
Thank you.

538
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,619
Good-bye, boy.
Take good care of that old, yeller dog.

539
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,043
Yes, sir. And you take care
of my horny toad.

540
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,233
I will. Bye, ma'am.

541
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,210
Good-bye.

542
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,870
Didn't tell your Mama this.
Didn't want to fret her.

543
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,206
But there's a plague of hydrophobia
in these parts.

544
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,375
Hydrophobia? You sure?

545
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,400
I've done shot two wolves,
a fox and a skunk that had it.

546
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,074
I wanted to warn you
not to take any chances.

547
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,515
Well, I don't know if I could tell
if a critter's got the sickness.

548
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,725
You can't hardly tell at first.

549
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,329
Not until they get to the point
of slobberin' and staggerin' around.

550
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,753
You see a critter in that fix,
you know for sure.

551
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,653
But you wanna watch
for others that ain't that far along.

552
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,114
Now you take a bobcat and a fox...

553
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,908
You know they'll run
if they get the chance.

554
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,036
But when one don't run,
or maybe makes fight at you,

555
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,289
why, you shoot him and quick.

556
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,983
After he's bitten you, it's too late.

557
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,213
You done with your
hog markin' for this year?

558
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,340
No. I'm aimin' to start tomorrow.

559
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,659
You watch them hogs same as everything.

560
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,263
I know your papa left you
in charge of things while he's gone.

561
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,866
And I figure you're
man enough to handle the job.

562
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,044
Don't scare you, does it, boy?

563
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,987
No, sir.

564
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,606
Well, yes, sir,

565
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,193
it scares me a little bit,
but I'll sure do like you told me.

566
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,546
That's a way a man talks, son.

567
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,592
Hog tracks, Yeller! Get 'em, boy!

568
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:14,638
Hold 'em, boy!

569
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,471
All right, Yeller.
Fetch 'em right under here.

570
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:47,009
Over bit the right ear.
Under slope the left.

571
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,579
All right, pig,
now you're wearin' the Coates' mark.

572
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,456
Easy.

573
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,556
Whoa-ooo!

574
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,863
Yeller! Yeller!

575
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,979
Yeller.

576
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,156
Yeller!

577
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,209
Oh, Yeller.

578
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,970
Oh, Yeller. You're all cut to pieces.

579
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:33,449
You're gonna be all right, ya hear?

580
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,304
I'll get Mama.
Mama'll fix you up for sure.

581
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,296
Come on, boy. Gonna put you in here.

582
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:15,475
Come on, Yeller. Want them hogs
to come back and get ya?

583
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,078
You gotta stay here till I get back.

584
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,619
I mean it, boy. I'm comin' back.

585
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,642
I promise.

586
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,343
Come on now.

587
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,178
I'll help you to bed.

588
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,055
Mama, we gotta go back after Old Yeller.

589
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:24,935
You're not goin' any place until that leg
gets well. I've doctored hog cuts before.

590
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,209
This one of yours could be as
dangerous as a rattlesnake bite.

591
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:33,420
Mama, you don't understand.
I promised Old Yeller, and I'm goin'!

592
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,596
Travis!

593
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,032
- Travis!
- I aim to go after Old Yeller.

594
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,679
He'll die without help!

595
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,269
All right, then. We'll all go.

596
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,922
Mama, them buzzards ain't got him!

597
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,166
What's a matter with Yeller, Mama?
Who stopped him up in this hole?

598
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,460
We've come to get him out, baby.

599
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,171
But first, I wonder if you'd
do somethin' for me.

600
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,216
- What?
- Go catch me a green-striped lizard.

601
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,052
We passed one back there a piece.
Prettiest I ever saw.

602
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,325
Sure, Mama. I'll catch him.

603
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,308
We're gonna have to hurry
if we wanna get him patched up

604
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,376
before Arliss gets back.

605
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,630
Oh, Travis.

606
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,242
I didn't know it was gonna be this bad.

607
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,452
Them hogs would've never touched him.

608
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,226
He was keepin' 'em off of me.

609
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,624
We'll have to sew him up.

610
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,853
Go jerk me a hair
out of Old Jumper's tail.

611
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,486
Yes, Yeller.

612
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:08,203
Take your ax and go cut
two long poles for a litter.

613
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,293
The sooner we get him home, the better.

614
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,753
Mama, I got your lizard.

615
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,991
- Ain't he pretty?
- Ooh, yes. He really is.

616
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,995
Now if you'll just keep him for me until
we get home. We're gonna play a game.

617
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,749
- What kind of a game?
- We're playin' Old Yeller is sick.

618
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:37,002
- You're gonna take care of him.
- Is that why he's all wrapped up?

619
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,881
That's right. Now, you're gonna
ride here and hold him.

620
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,824
Like we was two sick injuns?

621
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,152
And you make sure he don't fall off.

622
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,930
On account of
he's a sicker Injun than me?

623
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,890
That's right. Now remember,

624
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,100
don't lean on him
and don't play with him.

625
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,952
He's a very, very sick Indian.

626
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,851
Come on, Jumper.

627
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,199
Mama?

628
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,348
Them prickly pear roots
gonna make Travis well?

629
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,058
I hope so, son.

630
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,394
Mama?

631
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,272
When you're done, will you play with me?

632
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,716
I'm sorry, Arliss. I'm too busy now.

633
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,385
You go out in the backyard and play.

634
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:48,341
But I tell you, there ain't nothin'
to do out in that old backyard.

635
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,995
Now, Arliss, you stop it,
and go outside this minute.

636
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,289
Hello, the house!

637
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,391
It's Mr. Searcy!

638
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,947
Ain't he pretty? Is he for me?

639
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,842
Partly. Mostly he's for Travis.

640
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,679
But Travis can't play with no puppy.
He's sick.

641
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:14,079
- Sick?
- Him and Old Yeller. Hog cut.

642
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,228
Good mornin', Mr. Searcy.
Hello, Lisbeth.

643
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,314
What's this about that boy of yours
gettin' hog cut?

644
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,900
- Whatcha doctorin' with?
- Prickly pear root.

645
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,425
Miss Coates, I brung somethin'
for Travis. Can I take it to him?

646
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,113
Go right in there, honey.

647
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,199
Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Searcy,
I'm makin' up some new poultice.

648
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,327
You know, it's right providential
I come along when I did.

649
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,245
'Tain't nothin' better
than a prickly pear poultice,

650
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,268
providin' a body knows how to fix it.

651
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,000
You hurt pretty bad?

652
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,604
I'm all right. It'd take more
than them old hogs to kill me.

653
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:48,175
Well, I... I brung you a surprise.

654
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,948
One of Miss Priss' pups.

655
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:55,119
Thems was born in a badger hole.
Seven of 'em.

656
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,168
This 'un's the best of the bunch.

657
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:03,712
See? He don't holler
when you hold him up by the neck hide.

658
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,818
Papa says that means he's a good dog.

659
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,612
That don't mean nothin'.

660
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,841
If his mouth's black inside,
that's what counts.

661
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,475
Well, anyhow, I...

662
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,144
I brung him to ya.

663
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,527
Well, I got me a dog. Old Yeller.

664
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,459
Well, why don't you give him to Arliss?
He'll like him.

665
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,198
Here, you can have him.

666
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,141
Golly!

667
00:59:56,218 --> 01:00:00,330
- Golly!
- That's the secret, Miss Coates,

668
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,374
a-beatin' them roots
till they're all soft and squishy...

669
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:06,445
Mama, look at the little,
bitty puppy Lisbeth give me.

670
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,240
Oh.

671
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,722
Sure cut up, ain't ya, boy?

672
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,266
Clean to the bone, looks like.

673
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,227
That there poultice is sure the stuff
to suck out the poison,

674
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,937
provided, of course,
he ain't got hydrophoby.

675
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,398
- "Hydrophoby"?
- Could be. It's all over the countryside.

676
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,401
Stuff dyin' like flies.
Foxes, wolves, polecats, hogs...

677
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,111
- Hogs?
- Hogs can get it.

678
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,555
Same as that there boy
or that old, yeller dog there.

679
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,867
Seen either one of them foamin'
at the mouth, shown any signs of fits?

680
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,952
- Fits of temper?
- Of course not!

681
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,955
Well, you better keep a close watch
on them. Liable to show up at any time.

682
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,499
Recollect had me an uncle once
down in east Texas.

683
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,293
Got mad dog bit, he did.

684
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,296
Knowed he was bound to die.
Chained himself to a sweet gum tree.

685
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,797
Stayed right there
till sickness took ahold.

686
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,049
Mr. Searcy, please.

687
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,717
But it's the gospel truth, Miss Coates!

688
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,427
He went to snarlin' and snappin'
at everything in sight.

689
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,970
He run at his woman
and young 'uns, tryin' to bite 'em.

690
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,244
He'd have done it too
if that chain hadn't held him back.

691
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,577
Stayed right there
till he died of the slobberin' fits.

692
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:04,978
They buried him
under that sweet gum tree...

693
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,522
Mr. Searcy, that's enough!
Not another word!

694
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,919
Biggest, nicest funeral you ever did...

695
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,697
What do you mean,
tellin' an ugly story like that

696
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,324
to a boy who's just been hog cut?

697
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,410
Now, Miss Coates, I was just
tryin' to give a word of warnin'.

698
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,579
Reckon if I can't be
of no more help around here,

699
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,997
I'll be makin' tracks for home.

700
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,833
Help. There are plenty of ways
a man could help around here.

701
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,086
By doin' what, Miss Coates?

702
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,630
Like hitchin' up the mule
and gatherin' in the corn crop

703
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,674
before the deer eat it up,
or the blowin' rain rot it in the field!

704
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,511
Now, don't you fret yourself
at all about that corn crop, Miss Coates.

705
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,534
I'll be glad to take care
of that. Lisbeth?

706
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,890
Yes, Papa?

707
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,226
Lisbeth, honey, Miss Coates here,
she's in kind of a bind.

708
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,769
Ain't got her corn in the crib yet.

709
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,522
Figured I'll leave you behind
to help her with the job.

710
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:52,484
Mr. Searcy, Lisbeth's nothin'
but a little girl.

711
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,569
Yeah, well, she ain't much for size,

712
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,696
but she's just like her old pappy...
Stout and willin'!

713
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,538
Now, don't you forget, Miss Coates.
If there's any other thing I can do for you,

714
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,082
don't you be bashful about tellin' me.

715
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,150
I'm on call day or night.

716
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,153
Bye! Bye.

717
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,566
Oh!

718
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,904
I do believe you are cooler.

719
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,867
Mama, don't let
what Mr. Searcy said bother you.

720
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,219
I'm gonna be all right!

721
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,396
I'm sure you will be.

722
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,250
I know, Mama. Mama, I know.

723
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,586
I got a good look at them hogs.

724
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,881
Now, them hogs was mean,
but they weren't mad.

725
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:15,342
Travis, we got lots of corn.
Me, Mama and Lisbeth.

726
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,613
Ain't that Old Rose I hear bawlin'?

727
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,308
She's been actin' flighty lately,
like she was scared of her own shadow.

728
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,328
And this mornin' she wouldn't
let her calf suckle neither.

729
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,455
I think, maybe,
she's got a bit of pea vine.

730
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,916
No, Mama, it can't be pea vine.
Not this late in the year.

731
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,300
Oh.

732
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,744
The poor thing.

733
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,073
She's blind sick.

734
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,648
Mama, that cow's got hydrophoby.

735
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,525
Hydrophoby? Oh, no, Travis.

736
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,630
Mr. Sanderson said when they stagger
and slobber around, you know for sure.

737
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,097
I'll go get my gun.

738
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,578
Let's get finished
and go burn the carcass.

739
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:54,399
If the varmints get at it,
could be that might spread the disease.

740
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,424
I'm hungry.

741
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,862
Well, I'll go rustle you up
some bread and milk.

742
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:27,407
- How come you shot Old Rose?
- She was sick.

743
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,535
Well, you were sick too.
How come they didn't shoot you?

744
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,808
Well, that's somethin' different.

745
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,415
Where'll Rose go now she's dead?

746
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,792
Nowhere, I reckon. She's just dead.

747
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,504
- Will she go to heaven?
- I don't much reckon.

748
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:45,654
Ain't there no cows in heaven
for the angels to milk?

749
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,011
Well, how do I know?

750
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,704
Here's your supper.

751
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,879
How fer off is heaven?

752
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,803
Oh, I don't know. A fer piece, I guess.

753
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,725
Is heaven as far off as Papa went?

754
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:15,441
A heap further than that.

755
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,397
- Where'd Papa go to?
- Kansas.

756
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,655
Arliss, quit eatin'
with that nasty old pup!

757
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,740
Well, he's hungry too!

758
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,033
Travis! Bring your gun!

759
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,348
That's Mama! What's the matter with her?

760
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,725
You stay in this house,
Arliss, you hear?

761
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,123
Travis! Travis!

762
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,961
Travis! Bring your gun!

763
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:47,095
Travis! Travis! A wolf!

764
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,006
Mama!

765
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,861
- Don't let Arliss come down here.
- I'm comin', Arliss!

766
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:56,806
- What happened?
- It was so sudden, I don't hardly know.

767
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,661
- The wolf came leapin' out at us.
- Lucky you had Old Yeller.

768
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:26,148
It was lucky for us, son,
but it weren't lucky for Old Yeller.

769
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,192
He's chewed up some,
but he ain't bad hurt.

770
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,885
No wolf in his right mind
would've jumped us at the fire,

771
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,237
not even a loafer wolf.

772
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,615
That wolf was mad.

773
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,272
I'll... Shoot him...

774
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,215
If you can't.

775
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,221
But either way, we've got it to do.

776
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,033
Mama, listen.

777
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,078
Old Yeller just saved your life,
and Lisbeth's too!

778
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,830
And he saved mine and Arliss'! We can't!

779
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,058
We don't know for certain.

780
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,733
I'll pen him up where he can't get out.
And then we'll wait.

781
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,383
We can't just shoot him
like he was nothin'.

782
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,281
Don't you understand?

783
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,848
All right, son.

784
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,667
If you think there's a chance.

785
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:29,440
Hear that?

786
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,902
Well, now, that sounds
like a healthy dog to me.

787
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,051
Take a look at him, Mama.
See for yourself.

788
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,998
He sure looks fine, all right.

789
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,834
Two whole weeks,
and nary a sign of a thing.

790
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,436
Think we could let him out?

791
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,782
No, son, not yet.

792
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:02,373
They say sometimes
it takes a month to tell.

793
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,531
Now, I told you,
if everything's all right,

794
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,867
we'll let Old Yeller out come Saturday.

795
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,952
But, Mama, why not now?

796
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,746
No, we've waited this long.

797
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,373
I guess we can stand it
another couple of days.

798
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,475
Aw, Mama.

799
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,988
Here we are, boy. More grub.

800
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:40,561
Yeller?

801
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,527
What's the matter, boy?

802
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,005
Come on. It's time to eat.

803
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,917
- How is he tonight?
- All right, I reckon.

804
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:36,275
- Are you sure?
- I said he was all right, didn't I?

805
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,363
I guess you wouldn't like it, either,
if you had to stay shut up in a corn crib!

806
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,908
You ain't gonna keep my dog
locked up in that crib no more!

807
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:47,638
You stay away from that dog.
You understand?

808
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,192
It's time for you to go to bed, Arliss.

809
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,045
- Aw, Mama.
- Do as I say.

810
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,772
Yes'm.

811
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,743
Don't you worry, boy.
I'll get you outta here.

812
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,122
- Where's Arliss?
- I don't know.

813
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,421
Arliss!

814
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,215
Arliss!

815
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,850
Arliss! Don't open that door!

816
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,471
Arliss! Keep away from that door!

817
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:13,848
Arliss!

818
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,861
No, Mama.

819
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,597
There's no hope for him now, Travis.

820
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,668
He's sufferin'.
You know we've got to do it.

821
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,788
I know, Mama.

822
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,837
But he was my dog.

823
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,384
I'll do it.

824
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,580
Hello, the house!

825
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,666
Papa! Ya done came home!

826
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:59,184
Hiya, boy.
Ain't them injuns scalped you yet?

827
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,753
- Papa, what'd you bring me?
- I brought you somethin', all right.

828
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,527
Just hold your potatoes
while I go kiss your Mama.

829
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,360
Jim! Oh, Jim!

830
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,201
What'd you bring me home, Papa?
Where is it?

831
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:30,277
Hear this, Katie? Money. Cash money.

832
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,005
First we've had since the war.

833
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,470
That ain't all.

834
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,411
- What?
- I got that dress.

835
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,413
- Prettiest thing you ever seen.
- Oh!

836
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,331
And a fancy pair of shoes to go with it.

837
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,584
- Gee-whiz!
- Put it on, son.

838
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,256
There you are.

839
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,049
All right, Chief. Let's hit the warpath.

840
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:56,428
Come on, boy!

841
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,510
Oh, Jim!

842
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,381
It's lovely.

843
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,053
I been achin' to see it on you.

844
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,791
Where's Travis?

845
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,545
I wanna get a look at his face
when he sees the horse I brung him.

846
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,114
Him and Lisbeth Searcy
are over at North Hill...

847
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,405
Burying Old Yeller.

848
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,737
Old Yeller?

849
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,739
Come in the house
and I'll tell you about it.

850
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,181
Travis?

851
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:08,084
If you could just come
to like the pup...

852
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,420
He... He's part Old Yeller.

853
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,693
He may be part Old Yeller,

854
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,238
but he ain't Old Yeller.

855
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,152
Your mama told me about the dog.

856
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,066
Come sit down, son.

857
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,728
That was rough, son.

858
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,440
As rough a thing as
I ever heard tell of.

859
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,570
But I'm mighty proud
of how my boy stood up to it.

860
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,014
Couldn't ask no more of a grown man.

861
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,807
Thing to do now is... Try and forget it.

862
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,038
Go on bein' a man.

863
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,859
How, Pa? How you gonna
forget somethin' like that?

864
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,355
I guess I don't quite mean that.

865
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:39,300
Reckon it's not a thing you can forget.

866
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,324
Maybe not even a thing you wanna forget.

867
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,955
What I'm tryin' to say is...

868
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,706
- Life's like that sometimes.
- Like what?

869
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,134
Well.

870
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:02,781
Now and then, for no good
reason a man can figure out,

871
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,660
life will just haul off
and knock him flat.

872
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,061
Slam him again' the ground so hard
it seems like all his insides is busted.

873
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,502
But it's not all like that.

874
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,570
A lot of it's mighty fine.

875
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:22,509
And you can't afford to waste
the good part frettin' about the bad.

876
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,987
That makes it all bad.

877
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,390
You understand
what I'm trying to get at?

878
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,163
Yes, sir.

879
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,836
It's just that...

880
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,124
Yeah, sure, I know.

881
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,046
Sayin' it's one thing
and feelin' it's another.

882
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,532
But I'll tell you a trick
that's sometimes a big help.

883
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,618
You start lookin' around
for somethin' good

884
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,436
to take the place of the bad.

885
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,435
As a general rule, you can find it.

886
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,442
- Brought you that horse I promised.
- Yes, sir.

887
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:07,846
I reckon you ain't in no shape
to take pleasure in him yet.

888
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,598
No, sir.

889
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,767
We'll just keep him a while.

890
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,311
Maybe you'll come to
feel different later on.

891
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,397
Your mama was fixin' supper
when I left the house.

892
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:20,252
Might hurt her feelings
if we're not there on time to eat it.

893
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,476
Leave that alone! You get outta here!

894
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,560
Put it down! Put it down!

895
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,814
Why, you thievin', little wretch!

896
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,889
Who's that beatin' my dog?

897
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,892
You can't beat my dog!

898
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,103
You can't beat my dog!

899
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,922
Hold it, Chief. I think you're
fixin' to raise the wrong hair.

900
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,066
Mama was tryin' to kill my dog.

901
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,402
- I never even touched him.
- Of course, she didn't.

902
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,905
Ooh, whee! Supper ready?

903
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,133
- Ready and waitin'.
- Good.

904
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,008
Looks like it's about time

905
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,236
I started learnin'
this old pup to earn his keep.

906
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:32,281
Don't look like to me he's hardly
big enough to learn nothin' yet.

907
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,183
He's big enough to learn

908
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,627
if he's big enough
to act like Old Yeller.

909
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,509
<i>Young Yeller is a puppy</i>

910
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,287
<i>A little ol' lop-eared puppy</i>

911
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:59,142
<i>It's plain to see he's got a family tree</i>

912
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,543
<i>The image of his pappy</i>

913
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,737
<i>He's frisky and he's happy</i>

914
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:08,342
<i>- And that's how a good pup should be
- Frisky and happy</i>

915
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,490
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

916
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,721
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

917
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,307
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

918
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,059
<i>In the West</i>

919
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,269
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

920
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,371
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

921
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:25,818
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

922
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,092
<i>Best doggone dog</i>

923
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:33,392
<i>In the West</i>
