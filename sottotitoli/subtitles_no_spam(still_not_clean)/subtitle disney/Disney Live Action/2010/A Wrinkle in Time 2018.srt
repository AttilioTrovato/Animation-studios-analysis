1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,639
<i>All right,
think good thoughts.</i>

2
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,359
<i>Then on three,
let the good thought go.</i>

3
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,030
Yeah. That's good.

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,110
I think that's pretty, right?

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,431
That's gonna be a good luck
charm for us today, right?

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,239
Okay, Meg,
important question.

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,834
Van Halen or Bono? Bono?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,320
- That one.
- That's what I thought.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,710
That's my girl. Whoo!

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,994
Oh, yeah! Stick your
tongue out, come on.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,117
Ah!

12
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,471
You got your frequency,
you got your voltage, okay?

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,472
<i>They're like a salt silica,
right? You don't wanna eat it.</i>

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,393
- Just go crazy with it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,279
...this little gizmo
right here,

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,589
and we're gonna
choose a frequency.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,910
<i>We're gonna choose
the frequency.</i>

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,116
<i>You would intently
watch this plate.</i>

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,795
<i>Let's see what happens
to the sand.</i>

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,474
<i>Because very interesting,
magical things</i>

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>- will happen to the sand.</i>
- Whoa!

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,795
So...

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,959
are you ready to meet
your new brother?

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,199
Do you think
we'll like each other,

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,636
like real brothers
and sisters?

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,192
I think we'll all
love each other.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,198
Out of this wide,
wide universe...

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,757
this huge universe...

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,638
with all these brothers

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,792
and sisters and moms
and dads...

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,753
he found us.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,870
And we found each other.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,190
<i>That's pretty rare.</i>

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,510
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,032
Okay, so...

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,352
This is our love.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,236
Don't worry.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,629
It's not gone.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
It's just...
It's just enfolded.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,999
Love is always there.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,038
Even if you don't feel it...

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,589
it's always there for you.

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,594
Not gone...

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,919
just enfolded.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,470
Hey.

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,030
Hi, Meg.

47
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,393
Let's be exclusive.

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,870
What?

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,317
That's my new word
for the day. Exclusive.

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,510
Do you like it?

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,073
Love it, Biscuits.

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,033
Couldn't sleep either?

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,631
Why didn't you just come up
to my room?

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,272
'Cause I knew
you'd be down.

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,834
Hey. You made sandwiches.

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,599
And I'm cooking milk.

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,400
This is a lot of milk,
Charles Wallace.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,517
It's good to be prepared.

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,110
You never know
who will stop by.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,874
<i>And I'm Michele Norris.</i>

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,430
<i>Tomorrow marks
the four-year anniversary...</i>

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,475
<i>of the disappearance of NASA
scientist Dr. Alex Murry.</i>

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,835
<i>Dr. Murry went missing</i>

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,910
<i>just a week
after publicly announcing...</i>

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,230
They're talking
about Daddy.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,716
<i>...he could travel
the universe with his mind.</i>

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,475
<i>91
billion light-years traveled,</i>

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,630
<i>like that.</i>

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,269
<i>Authorities
note there are still</i>

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,477
<i>no leads in the case.</i>

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,553
Everybody say,
"Hi, Meg."

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,279
Hi, Meg.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,396
Hi, Meg.

74
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,396
I mean, he's been gone

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,073
four years to the day.

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,118
He's probably just pretending
to be in outer space...

77
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,237
but he's really
hiding out in Tijuana.

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,193
I bet
it involves another woman.

79
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,629
Either that
or a Martian.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,190
Seriously though,
something so horrible

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,390
had to have happened
to him.

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
To leave his kids
like that?

83
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,191
And just after
they adopted Charles Wallace.

84
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,234
They seemed so happy.

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,518
And Meg used to be so engaged,
and now she is a mess.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
But the boy is brilliant.

87
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,596
- Absolutely brilliant. Oh.
- But odd, so odd!

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,670
I guess
I would be too

89
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,750
if my dad ran away, huh?

90
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,197
Shame on you
for talking like that!

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,799
Uh... Oh.
My dear, I'm sorry...

92
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,870
And I'm not odd, you are...

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,316
because you think making up
mean stories about people...

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
makes you feel better
about yourselves.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,554
Well, it doesn't,
does it?

96
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,672
Charles Wallace, we don't
talk to teachers like that!

97
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,035
And Meg might be a mess...

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,759
but she has
more potential in her pinky...

99
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,593
than you do
in your whole body!

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,636
Did you hear that, Meg? Meg!

101
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,430
Over here. Did you hear that?
Meg! You may be a mess...

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,910
but you have more potential
than anybody here!

103
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,633
Oh, no, no, no.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,790
Mommy was awkward

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,109
and funny-looking
at your age, too!

106
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,598
And look at her now.
She's beautiful!

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,278
So, looks like crazy
runs in the family.

108
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,635
What did you just say?

109
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,959
I see why your dad left.

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,831
Who does she even think
that she's talking to?

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,150
Hey, Veronica.

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,597
You're next, Charles Wallace.

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,796
Veronica Kiley's
parents are on their way here.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,310
They're worried for
their daughter's safety.

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,278
Their daughter is mean.

116
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,193
You hit her in the face.

117
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,674
You...

118
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,075
You were a top student.

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,314
Top attitude.

120
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,354
But look at you now. You...

121
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,870
You're aggressive,
you're hostile...

122
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,269
you shut everybody out...

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,031
and then wonder
why they don't like you.

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,430
I don't wonder
and I don't care.

125
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,470
Hmm.

126
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,630
Well...

127
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,677
maybe that's your problem.

128
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,839
I don't have a problem.

129
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,877
You can't keep using
your father's disappearance

130
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,599
as an excuse to act out.

131
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,153
What do you think he would say
about all this?

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,279
Seriously. If he walked
in that door today...

133
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,630
what would happen?

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,910
The world would
make sense again.

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,156
Listen.

136
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,472
All I'm saying is,
it's been four years.

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,916
Odds are he's not
coming back.

138
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,675
I did not excuse you,
young lady. Meg.

139
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,835
I want you to write an apology
to Principal Jenkins.

140
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,272
And one to Veronica.

141
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,710
Mom!

142
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,676
She called
Charles Wallace crazy!

143
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,559
That's no excuse.

144
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,396
Well, Dad always told me

145
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,119
to stand up
for what I believe in.

146
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,357
Don't use Dad like that.

147
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,913
It's not fair.

148
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,154
He's not coming back,
is he?

149
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,275
Don't give up hope, Meglet.

150
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,836
I knew
it was you! Come on in.

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,718
Wow! Talk about
a dark and stormy night.

152
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
Are those
Mrs. Buncombe's sheets?

153
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,750
Maybe.

154
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,836
Excuse me.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,435
Oh, aren't you dazzling!
You must be Dr. Murry.

156
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes. And...

157
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,833
Your house is so warm.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,992
You've done a wonderful job
keeping the darkness out.

159
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,232
Mom. Mom!

160
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,357
Do you want me to call 911?

161
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,358
Well, almost all the darkness.

162
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,034
You must be Meg.

163
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,473
How... How do you
know my name?

164
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,756
Because I told her.

165
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,638
Guys, calm down.

166
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,996
Don't worry.
She's my friend.

167
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,759
Call me Mrs. Whatsit.

168
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,950
Mrs. Who?

169
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,674
No, Mrs. Whatsit.

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,320
Mrs. Who is...

171
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,709
She's, like,
a billion years older

172
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,950
and way more
knowledgeable.

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,958
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Whatsit?

174
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,120
I caught her stealing sheets.

175
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,158
Guys, she's harmless.

176
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,630
You're six. Come on.

177
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
What do you know
about harmless?

178
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,953
Have I ever been wrong?

179
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,316
One of these days,
you might be, Charles Wallace.

180
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,510
Oh, I highly doubt that.

181
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,797
He's one of the greatest minds
in recent history.

182
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,795
He's prodigious.

183
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,478
But of course, we can't take
any credit for our talents.

184
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,996
It's how we use them
that counts.

185
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,671
Okay, then.
The thing is...

186
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,192
we don't know you,
and it's late, so...

187
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,315
Oh, is it?
I'm terrible with time.

188
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,192
Mrs. Which
usually handles that.

189
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,394
Uh... Right.

190
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,795
Um...

191
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,916
The thing is, uh...

192
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,519
the kids need
to get to bed...

193
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,315
so if you don't mind
visiting some other time.

194
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,837
Oh, of course I will.

195
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,834
I just wanna tell you
one thing before I go.

196
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,830
I want you to know
that no matter what happens...

197
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,956
you and your husband achieved
something truly extraordinary.

198
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,317
What are you
talking about?

199
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,039
Just that there really is

200
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,874
such a thing
as a tesseract.

201
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,030
What?

202
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,477
A tesseract?

203
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,751
That's what I said.
Tesseract.

204
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,435
Is... Is this
some kind of joke?

205
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,757
Did Veronica
put you up to this?

206
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
You really don't
trust easily, do you?

207
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,676
Hmm.

208
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,118
Charles Wallace,
I'm not sure about Meg.

209
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
Give her a chance.

210
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,795
Okay.

211
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,713
You're the boss.

212
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,553
I better run.

213
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,390
Ah! Wild nights are my glory.

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,639
Never do that again.

215
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,872
Never let anyone in the house
without our permission.

216
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,034
And please stop talking
to strangers.

217
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,157
I don't
talk to them, they talk to me.

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,919
Doesn't mean
you have to answer.

219
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,311
Now,
that's just bad manners, Meg.

220
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,153
Charles Wallace.

221
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,356
Hey, buddy!

222
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,590
How's it going?

223
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm cool.

224
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,394
Hello, princess.

225
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,513
See?
Told ya.

226
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,478
Yeah, be yourself.

227
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,393
Don't be like me.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,593
What's wrong
with being like you?

229
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,874
You have a pretty good arm.

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,516
Veronica.

231
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,475
Direct hit.

232
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,232
Hi. I'm Charles Wallace,
Meg's brother.

233
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,238
- You're Calvin, aren't you?
- That I am.

234
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,433
What are you doing here?

235
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,633
I don't know.

236
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,313
I was doing my homework...

237
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,630
and suddenly
I got this feeling

238
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,836
that I had to come here.

239
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,155
Like, right here.

240
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,556
Is that weird?

241
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,634
Maybe a little.

242
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,560
The truth is,
you were called here.

243
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,359
You're good at diplomacy.

244
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,516
What do we need diplomacy for,
Charles Wallace?

245
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,076
Well, the fact that you asked
is exactly why we need it.

246
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,078
So what do you say, Calvin,
you wanna come with us?

247
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,991
Sure.

248
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,630
Why not?

249
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,236
Great.

250
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,352
Let's go meet Mrs. Who.

251
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,351
No! No, Charles Wallace!

252
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,079
Charles Wallace,
do not go in there.

253
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,160
That house is falling apart,
it's off-limits.

254
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,437
He's a fearless little guy.

255
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,432
Unfortunately.

256
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,079
I told you no.

257
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,436
We cannot go in there.
It's not safe.

258
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,634
It's practically
the safest place...

259
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,479
in the universe.

260
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,435
Look.

261
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,439
Mrs. Who, it's me,
Charles Wallace.

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,512
Oh.

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,473
"Life without love...

264
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,400
"is like a tree
without blossoms or fruit."

265
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,829
Gibran, Lebanese.

266
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,315
Calvin. Uh, American.

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,750
Mrs. Who prefers

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,399
not to think for herself.

269
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,234
That's just rude,
Charles Wallace.

270
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,915
No. She's just evolved
past language...

271
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,799
so when
she needs to think...

272
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,759
she cheats and uses
other people's words.

273
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,400
It's nice how
she gives them credit.

274
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,953
Mrs. Who, meet my Meg.

275
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,470
Okay.

276
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,676
Okay.

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,560
"The wound is the place
where the light enters you."

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,269
Rumi, Persian.

279
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,838
Poor Mrs. Who.

280
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,149
We tired her out.

281
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,392
I guess she was
really tired.

282
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,910
She's still adjusting.

283
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,193
Adjusting to what?

284
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,073
Sorry, you're almost,

285
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,038
but not quite ready
to find out.

286
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,076
Charles Wallace...

287
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,230
whatever she is,

288
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,277
whatever that is,
whatever all this is...

289
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,556
I don't like it.

290
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,830
You'll manage.

291
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,120
Come on, time to go.
Let's let Mrs. Who rest.

292
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,431
We'll see her again
very soon.

293
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,430
Charles Wallace,
can you, um,

294
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,749
pass me the pepper, please?

295
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
Thank you.

296
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,480
So, they met in college.

297
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,960
She was tutoring him.

298
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,952
It's a great story,
actually.

299
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,395
Oh, really?

300
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,553
Is that his work?

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,639
Mommy's, too.

302
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,790
Cool.

303
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,079
What's it about?

304
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,110
Well...

305
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,154
I'm mostly interested
in the small...

306
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,591
atoms, particles...

307
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,154
<i>the unseeable energies
that move through us all.</i>

308
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,834
Go get 'em.

309
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,432
<i>Their dad
is all about the big.</i>

310
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,355
<i>So, what if
we are here for a reason?</i>

311
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,351
What if we are not just
in the universe...

312
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,480
but the universe
is within all of us?

313
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,711
Think about
quantum entanglement.

314
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,594
Two electrons
once bonded together,

315
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
in love, if you will...

316
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,117
suddenly separated
by a galaxy...

317
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,556
but somehow
still just as connected.

318
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,080
An unbroken union
despite being galaxies apart.

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,959
And our most
recent calculations show us

320
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,396
that these fields
connect us...

321
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,717
to other dimensions.

322
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,872
Dimensions outside
of the limitations

323
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,110
of space and time.

324
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,953
Imagine that. Imagine...

325
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,952
rather than enduring
the oppressive rules

326
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,112
of time and space,
we could wrinkle it.

327
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,553
91 billion light-years
traveled, like that.

328
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
And we don't need rockets.

329
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,152
We don't need spaceships.
We don't need anything.

330
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,197
To utilize a tesseract...

331
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,479
all you need is to tap into
the right frequency.

332
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,156
You just need your mind.

333
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,909
He wanted
to touch the stars...

334
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,551
unlock the secrets
of the universe...

335
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,473
Find its origin and...

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,673
shake its hand.

337
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,233
You messed up.

338
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,470
You were impatient.

339
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,120
You couldn't follow the plan.

340
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,714
Couldn't you see it
in their eyes?

341
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,075
It was written
all over their faces.

342
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,594
They weren't ready.

343
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,035
They're not...

344
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,510
Kate, they're not ready,
so what are we supposed to do?

345
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,717
We're supposed to wait
until they catch up with us?

346
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,152
We are on the precipice
of something spectacular!

347
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,232
Listen, listen, listen.
Look. Hear me out.

348
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,833
So, in order to be great...

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,469
it isn't enough
just to be right.

350
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,832
You have to actually
be great.

351
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,553
And we are.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,152
So, why can't we help
the others along?

353
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,190
Yes.

354
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,235
Or we could just
beat them up.

355
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,754
Let's beat them up.

356
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,440
Honestly, it'd be
so much fun.

357
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,479
Come here. Come here.

358
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,676
Oh, God.

359
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,320
I almost lost you.
I got so scared.

360
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,233
You crazy,
brilliant scientist.

361
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,872
You know,
you have great hair.

362
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,436
What?

363
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,150
No, I don't.

364
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,915
Please don't say that.

365
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,750
Okay.

366
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,719
I had a great time.

367
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,674
Your mom is insanely nice.

368
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,195
Your house is warm.

369
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,919
It smells good.

370
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,753
And it's full of...

371
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,430
I don't know what.

372
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,874
But it's amazing.

373
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,750
It's far from amazing.

374
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,271
My mom's upstairs in her room
preparing for yet another...

375
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,990
parent-teacher conference
for her delinquent daughter.

376
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,069
Oh, no. Not now.

377
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,071
Come here.

378
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,197
- Veronica's your neighbor?
- Yes.

379
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,113
Come here, please.

380
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,272
So you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?

381
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,275
Yeah, right.

382
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,195
Other way around.

383
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,079
She's gonna tell everybody
that you were here with me.

384
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,717
And I'm just trying
to protect your reputation...

385
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,837
so can you come here?

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,356
She already saw us,
besides...

387
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,199
there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

388
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,719
You say that now...

389
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,554
but you don't know
what it's like

390
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,518
having every move
you make...

391
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,990
mocked and ridiculed.

392
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,312
You'd be surprised.

393
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,994
Come on, Calvin.

394
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,230
Everybody likes you.

395
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,677
Even the teachers.

396
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,953
You do everything perfectly.

397
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,350
Tell that to my dad.

398
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,716
At least you have your dad.

399
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,711
Right. Sorry, that...

400
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,951
You must really miss him.

401
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,835
More than anything
in the universe.

402
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,512
Then how about
we go and find him?

403
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,913
I've never understood
the point of fences.

404
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,753
Wait.
What are you doing here?

405
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,393
This is it, kids!
This is it!

406
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,476
No! Hey, no! You're supposed
to be upstairs!

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,992
"You need to get up,
get out, and get something.

408
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,231
"How will you make it
if you never even try?"

409
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,390
I know that one.

410
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,078
Outkast, American.

411
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,269
How's it going, Mrs. Who?

412
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,114
I did it, Mrs. Who.
I got them ready.

413
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,557
And not a moment
too soon, my little warrior.

414
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,200
- What was that?
- Who said that?

415
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,510
Not Who.

416
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,831
Which. Mrs. Which.

417
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,111
She's the final piece
of the puzzle.

418
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,520
Come on, Mrs. Which,
show yourself.

419
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,515
How's this?

420
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,679
Is this good?

421
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,071
Great. Perfect.

422
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,790
Wonderful!

423
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,031
You're the wrong size,
Mrs. Which.

424
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,034
Is there such thing
as the wrong size?

425
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,520
No, no. Never.

426
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,353
And... And might I say
how honored I am

427
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,756
to be on this,
my very first mission.

428
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,072
I was chosen
for my great verbalizing

429
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,640
and materializing skills.

430
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,111
What are you?

431
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,994
I am a part of the universe.

432
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,270
Just like you, Meg.

433
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,954
What... What do you
want with us?

434
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,391
I don't know
about her, Charles Wallace.

435
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,997
But I have a very good vibe
from this Calvin kid.

436
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,951
Let's focus, shall we?

437
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,910
We heard a call,
out in the universe.

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,150
A human call.

439
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,354
A desperate one.

440
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,952
We couldn't tell
where it was coming from...

441
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,591
so we followed it here,
to its destination.

442
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,196
It brought them here, Meg.
To our house.

443
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,437
The call
must have been Daddy's.

444
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,432
My father's alive?

445
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,270
We believe he is.

446
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,510
Your father has done
an extraordinary thing.

447
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,640
No human has ever traveled
so far out in the universe.

448
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,839
But he may be in danger.

449
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,310
And we're here
to help you find him.

450
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,071
Why would you
wanna do that?

451
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,440
Because that's what we do.

452
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,396
We're warriors who serve

453
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,637
the good and light
in the universe.

454
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,759
Sometimes we rescue,
sometimes we guide.

455
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,479
Think of us as big-hearted.

456
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,630
Indeed.

457
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,596
Listen, Meg. We must find him
as soon as we can.

458
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,472
Are you up for it?

459
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,399
I bet she says no.

460
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,596
What?

461
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,750
Hmm?

462
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,996
No.

463
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,991
Hmm. No.

464
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,470
No, yes. No. Yes, I'm going.

465
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,835
Of course, I am.

466
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,074
And we know I'm up for it.

467
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,118
And Calvin already said
he'd come.

468
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,836
I did?

469
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,671
I did.

470
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,910
Then let's go!

471
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,192
Mom. Wait.
We gotta get Mom.

472
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,596
We'll get
your mother later. I promise.

473
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
Don't worry, Meg.

474
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,591
Tessering is almost nearly
perfectly natural.

475
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,350
Tessering?

476
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,590
"Almost"?

477
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,270
What's happening?

478
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,037
Wait. No, no. Charles Wallace,
don't go over there.

479
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,839
No time to waste, Meg.

480
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,953
Come on, Mrs. Whatsit!

481
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,797
You just have
to find the right frequency...

482
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,998
and have faith in who you are.

483
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,351
Let's find your father.

484
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,714
Shall we?

485
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,600
Tessering.

486
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,390
Tessering.

487
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,353
Is this really happening?

488
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,918
We did it, Meg. We actually,
really, very much so tessered!

489
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,120
Why does my whole body hurt?

490
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,158
We were in your backyard
and now...

491
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,909
It's real.

492
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,912
Let's make sure
she's all right.

493
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
Ow!

494
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,230
Yes, she's fine.

495
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,154
Whatsit, we don't kick people.

496
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,072
Oh, I didn't know.

497
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,030
"The foot feels the foot
when it feels the ground."

498
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,237
Buddha, Nepali.

499
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,393
New word for the day.

500
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,790
Luminous.

501
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,277
This is my favorite planet
in the entire galaxy.

502
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,954
They call it Uriel.

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,680
We think your father
tessered here.

504
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,194
Don't be shy.

505
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,476
Go ahead, look around.

506
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,790
Yes!

507
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,992
Come on, Meg.

508
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,272
Go ahead.

509
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,756
Whoa.

510
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,469
You should talk to them.

511
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,154
Everyone knows that flowers
are the best gossipers

512
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,839
in the entire universe.

513
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,239
You should show them
a picture of your father

514
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,551
and ask them
if they've seen him.

515
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,599
How are we gonna
understand each other?

516
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,838
At least try.

517
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,798
Seriously, Charles Wallace,
I'm underwhelmed.

518
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,758
Keep the faith, Mrs. Whatsit.

519
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,115
See, I told you
this was too hard for her.

520
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,351
I don't know why we brought
her in the first place.

521
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,354
Whatsit, she can hear you.

522
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,355
Oh.

523
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,710
Oh, man.

524
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,679
Let's just concentrate
on finding her father.

525
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,879
This is our father.

526
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,678
Can you help us find him,
please?

527
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,870
Please.

528
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,638
I can't tell
what they're saying.

529
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,436
I can.

530
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,114
They speak color.

531
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
Oh, he did?

532
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,071
Really?

533
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,235
Oh. You don't say.

534
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,551
Yep! He was here!
They saw him tesser here.

535
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,077
But he continued to explore,
they say.

536
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,674
Somewhere in that direction.

537
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,671
Let's go!

538
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,956
I'll get changed.

539
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,676
Changed?

540
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,792
Do you, uh,
need some privacy?

541
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
No, this is fine.

542
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,239
Whoa, Mrs. Whatsit,
humans don't just get naked.

543
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,154
Patience, sir.
I'm not finished yet.

544
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,239
"Dang."

545
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
Tucker, American.

546
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,600
Whoa.

547
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,470
No!

548
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,191
Wow!

549
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,713
This is wild!

550
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,836
Whoo!

551
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,878
One, two, three.

552
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,392
Whoa!

553
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,074
I'm flying!

554
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,797
Put your arms out!

555
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,233
How are we actually
flying right now?

556
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,629
Well, it's a phenomenon

557
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,633
associated with
continuum fluid mechanics.

558
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,360
It's called lift!

559
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,880
What is that?

560
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,430
Whoa!

561
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,639
Calvin!

562
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,070
My friends of light,

563
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,913
please assist
our young friend.

564
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,157
I'm all right.

565
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,355
- Calvin!
- I'm sorry.

566
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,511
I'm okay.

567
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,239
Whatsit,
those from Earth

568
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,470
need more help than most.

569
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,630
You know this...

570
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,753
You could have
prepared them better.

571
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,156
We must help them
stay focused on light

572
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,435
when darkness is present.

573
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,273
I mean, I'm trying.

574
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,433
But they're human.
They're very limited.

575
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,310
Well, tell me you at least

576
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,675
found something up there.

577
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
Unfortunately, no.

578
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,314
Their father's moved on.

579
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,790
And that thing got in our way.

580
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,838
It's spreading fast,
Mrs. Which.

581
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,753
What is that thing?

582
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,791
It's called Camazotz.

583
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,473
Home to a purely evil energy.

584
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,120
Known simply as The IT.

585
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,755
Evil?

586
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,560
But, like, what kind of evil?

587
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,756
How many kinds of evil

588
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,870
- do you need?
- Whatsit.

589
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,710
Okay.

590
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,158
An evil
that's actively spreading

591
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,435
throughout the universe.

592
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,715
So, as we continue on...

593
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,475
we must avoid it
at all costs...

594
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,797
and focus
on finding your father.

595
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,796
But we don't know
where he's gone.

596
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,954
What do we do?

597
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,591
"Love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind."

598
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,153
Shakespeare, British.

599
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,997
Oh, yes, a seer!

600
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,793
We should go visit
one of the seers.

601
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,474
They'll narrow
the search for us.

602
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,869
What's a seer?

603
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,400
A moderate visionary.

604
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,394
An occasional motivator
of insight. Hit or miss.

605
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,040
But I know a very cute one.

606
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
I mean a good one.

607
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,592
That sounds sort of promising.

608
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,435
Misses, grab a child.

609
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,957
Our journey continues.

610
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,598
She's intact.

611
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,029
She's fine.

612
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,750
Fine?
After that beautiful tesser?

613
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,070
She should be glorious.

614
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Everyone else is glorious.

615
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,519
She makes absolutely no sense.

616
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,756
I absolutely do not understand
that girl whatsoever.

617
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,354
Okay, it's over here.

618
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,159
Wait till you see it.
It's so cool.

619
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,760
The seer lives here?

620
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,471
Wow. You're our size.

621
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,630
The three of you...

622
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,598
are beautiful.

623
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,674
Thank you.

624
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,433
And so are you.

625
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,354
Where are we?

626
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,274
Orion.

627
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,114
Home of the Happy Medium.

628
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,352
So this guy
is your boyfriend?

629
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,550
Well, when you're

630
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,711
over a billion years old,
you don't really need labels.

631
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,120
Why do I have to be in pain?

632
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,312
- Instead of...
- Glorious?

633
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,590
You don't tesser well.

634
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,274
In what way?

635
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,434
Because I don't feel or see
anything when we tesser.

636
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,559
And you won't
until you become...

637
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,997
one with the universe
and yourself.

638
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,913
As it is, it seems like...

639
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,357
you don't even want
to return as yourself.

640
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,075
Oh...

641
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,070
Is there any way
I can return as somebody else?

642
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,913
That I might like?

643
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,234
Do you realize...

644
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,240
how many events and choices...

645
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,754
that had to occur since
the birth of the universe...

646
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,835
leading to the making
of you...

647
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,676
just exactly the way you are?

648
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,918
I guess I never really
thought about that.

649
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,756
Maybe now's the time

650
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,274
to start thinking about it.

651
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
We are here!

652
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,517
You can do it, Meg.
You just need balance.

653
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,034
Whoa!

654
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,349
This is awesome!

655
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,193
No, not awesome!

656
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,033
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody home?

657
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,837
- Whoo-hoo!
- Nice balance, Mrs. Who.

658
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,679
Oh, no, no, no.

659
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,590
Finally, a little color.

660
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,117
Whoa!

661
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,910
Who's there?

662
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,829
Uninvited guest
is very unsettling!

663
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,433
I do not like visitation!

664
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,436
Whatsit.

665
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,913
I really need a doorbell.

666
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,991
Whoo! Well, you obviously
don't understand

667
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,275
the importance of balance...

668
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,954
of moderation...

669
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,400
of the Happy Medium.

670
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,433
You sound like my mother.

671
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,519
Is your mother a baritone?

672
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,394
How's it going, Happy?

673
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,239
Everything's fine, Whatsit.
You look nice.

674
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,312
- I do?
- I like your outfit.

675
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,918
It's like a person outfit.

676
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,673
Oh, thank you.

677
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,479
You look like a person.

678
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,156
Thank you. You look
pretty okay as well.

679
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,234
Thank you. Earth tones.

680
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,234
We need your insight.

681
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,760
We are looking for a man...

682
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,351
who's lost in the universe.

683
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,235
My father.

684
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,234
Dr. Murry.

685
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,229
Handsome fellow.

686
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,192
How am I supposed
to say no?

687
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,755
Okay.

688
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,189
Center yourself.

689
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,638
One foot up, please.

690
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,037
Okay.

691
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,475
Now, very little is up to <i>moi.</i>

692
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,517
All right? Your energies
will affect what we see.

693
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,071
So, core in, spine long...

694
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,636
...shoulders down...

695
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,270
buttocks taut.

696
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,751
Close your eyes.

697
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,196
You're kidding.

698
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,634
Do I look like I'm kidding?

699
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,870
Very much so.

700
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,473
- A little.
- I'm not.

701
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,279
I'm not.

702
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,592
Let's try this again.
Now...

703
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,359
relax the face...

704
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,477
close your eyes...

705
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,711
and open your memories.

706
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,232
Think about your father.

707
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,792
No!

708
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,151
I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

709
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,395
I'm sorry, but...

710
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,598
I really just... I really
don't understand...

711
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,271
how thinking about him
is going to help us find him.

712
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,110
All I do is think about him.

713
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,509
I'm sorry, Mrs. Which,

714
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,717
but I think we need
to show her something.

715
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,315
She needs to understand
what's possible.

716
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,680
She needs to know
what's at stake.

717
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,873
Close your eyes.
See with mine.

718
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,430
This time...

719
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,075
don't look away.

720
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,791
<i>The IT's home
may be Camazotz...</i>

721
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,111
<i>but through darkness,</i>

722
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,238
<i>The IT's reach
spreads far beyond.</i>

723
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,717
<i>Even to your own planet.</i>

724
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,037
<i>The only thing
in the universe...</i>

725
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,796
<i>that travels
faster than light...</i>

726
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,950
<i>is the darkness.</i>

727
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,240
<i>The IT invades
the place inside of us</i>

728
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,277
<i>where hope and joy lives...</i>

729
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,760
We're happy to announce
the promotion

730
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,638
of one of our current
faculty members...

731
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,839
to be our new principal.

732
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,520
That faculty member

733
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,160
is three-time science teacher
of the year...

734
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,549
James Jenkins.

735
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,155
Come on up, Principal Jenkins.

736
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,756
...<i>replaces it
with jealousy...</i>

737
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,680
<i>and judgment...</i>

738
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,800
<i>pain...</i>

739
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,234
<i>and despair.</i>

740
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,914
What's up, Pops?

741
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,110
How you doing tonight?

742
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,680
Hey, man, don't do that.

743
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,955
- What you got up in here?
- What are you doing, man?

744
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,112
Man, do you know how I work
for this stuff?

745
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,760
Hey, man.

746
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,549
84...

747
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,035
82...

748
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,475
82?

749
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,673
I mean, are you even trying
or are you just an idiot?

750
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,435
Because if this is the best
you can do, it's pathetic!

751
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,757
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!

752
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,559
This is pathetic!

753
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,435
You see?
This is what The IT does.

754
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,913
One person at a time...

755
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,236
until fear takes over.

756
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,392
Fear turns to rage.

757
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,758
And rage leads to violence.

758
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,392
And then
there's a tipping point.

759
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,439
If we do not act soon...

760
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,152
darkness will fall
across the universe.

761
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,594
We...

762
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,835
we're in search of warriors
who can fight The IT...

763
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,160
and who can bring hope back.

764
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,594
Your father.

765
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,869
My father?

766
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,511
Be a warrior.

767
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,000
Can you?

768
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,632
I'll try.

769
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,639
Your father sounds
like a good man.

770
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,029
How about we find him?

771
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,279
Good. Okay.

772
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,470
Good, good, good.

773
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,835
- Yeah.
- Okay.

774
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,590
Now, we're grounded.
We're centered, right?

775
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,433
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

776
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,520
You can do this. Okay?

777
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,351
You're choosing not to.

778
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,671
But what if...

779
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,391
What if he doesn't
wanna be found?

780
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,716
It's okay to fear
the answers, Meg.

781
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,240
But you can't avoid them.

782
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,473
Trust me.

783
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,552
You don't wanna
end up like me,

784
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,075
a weirdo with a beard
living in a cave.

785
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,479
Your father didn't forget you.

786
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,792
You're too precious.

787
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,599
All right, you ready?

788
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,399
Mmm. Yeah.

789
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,470
Center yourself. Where is he?

790
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,080
Okay.

791
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,157
Now we're getting a vision.

792
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,590
Okay.

793
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,351
<i>Flower</i>

794
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,831
<i>of the universe</i>

795
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,992
<i>A child of mine</i>

796
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,950
<i>Flower</i>

797
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,752
<i>of the universe</i>

798
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,391
Love.
That's the frequency.

799
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,438
<i>That's it, Meg.</i>

800
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,396
<i>He started in Uriel.</i>

801
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,474
<i>Then he went to Ixchel.
Keep going, Meg.</i>

802
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,955
<i>Oh! There's Aunt Beast!</i>

803
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,513
<i>Oh, no,
he's going to Camazotz.</i>

804
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,270
No!

805
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,432
- Whoa, whoa.
- No.

806
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,993
I'm so sorry, Meg.

807
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,356
The IT got to him
before we could.

808
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,398
We thought he could
join the fight,

809
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,119
but now we need
to fight for him.

810
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,915
So, how are we gonna
get my father off Camazotz?

811
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,434
We can't tesser to Camazotz.

812
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,038
We can only tesser
where we find light...

813
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,077
for we are light.

814
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,838
Camazotz is all darkness.

815
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,276
This is no longer a search.
It's a rescue.

816
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,597
We must go back to Earth...

817
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,350
speak to your mother...

818
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,599
regroup.

819
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,473
No, no, no. I cannot leave
here without my father.

820
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,479
It's for the best, Meg.
We have to make a plan.

821
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,439
Please. Please!
I've come all this way.

822
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,399
We're too close to finding
him to turn back!

823
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,951
"Planning is essential."

824
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,793
Churchill, British.

825
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,713
No, no, no. Please!
He's running out of time.

826
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,553
No, we cannot!

827
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,790
<i>We have to save him.</i>

828
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,640
<i>We can't give up.
There must be a way!</i>

829
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,913
<i>Don't leave him!
We can't!</i>

830
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,911
<i>Dad!</i>

831
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,279
Where are we?

832
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,240
Where are the Misses?

833
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,832
This place feels weird.

834
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,558
Look! The Misses.

835
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,830
Thank goodness
you made it.

836
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,070
I was so worried.

837
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,600
Are you okay,
are you hurt at all?

838
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,750
We're okay.

839
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,790
Am I losing my senses or did
you just use your own words?

840
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,670
She's weakening.
As am I and Mrs. Whatsit.

841
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,311
Wait, what's wrong?

842
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,954
Where... Where are we?

843
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,674
Camazotz.

844
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,078
Your will to find your father
took over our tesser...

845
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,751
and re-directed it from Earth.

846
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,634
We must leave this planet.

847
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,790
And we do not have
the strength

848
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,030
to take you with us.

849
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,591
We can
barely tesser ourselves.

850
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,716
You must continue on
without us.

851
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,592
You must find your father.

852
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,160
And know that
you're going to be tested

853
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,709
every step of the way.

854
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,679
You'll encounter things
you think you know

855
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,989
but you don't.

856
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,031
Here is the place
to be suspicious, okay?

857
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,790
We're fading.

858
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,112
Can't we at least leave them
with something to help them?

859
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,476
Yes. Gifts.

860
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,199
I love gifts.

861
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,073
They work well
in a moment of peril...

862
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,117
for they see
that which is enfolded.

863
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,670
Not gone, just enfolded.

864
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,120
Meg. Trouble, problematic Meg.

865
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,714
To you I give
the gift of your faults.

866
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,271
You're welcome.

867
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,478
You do know my faults
are the bad qualities, right?

868
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,998
Are they really? Hmm.

869
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,357
Well then, you're all set.

870
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,150
My gift is my command.

871
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,635
Stay together.

872
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,069
Don't let anyone separate you.

873
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,558
This is a planet
of many faces...

874
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,037
run by one cruel
and vicious mind.

875
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,760
The IT desires
our strongest lights.

876
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,072
Do not give in.

877
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,433
We're going now.

878
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,511
Be careful.

879
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,432
"When shall we three
meet again?

880
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,910
"In thunder,
lightning or in rain?"

881
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,995
Shakespeare.

882
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,076
Keep going.
We'll be watching.

883
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,913
What's happening?

884
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,714
Wait. Where's
Charles Wallace?

885
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,236
He was just here!

886
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,559
Charles Wallace!

887
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,632
- Charles Wallace!
- Charles Wallace!

888
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,435
<i>There's danger here.</i>

889
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,035
<i>He's safe over the wall.</i>

890
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,634
<i>Wait at the stream.</i>

891
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,314
<i>Get to the wall.</i>

892
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,196
What is that?

893
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,870
<i>Get to the wall!</i>

894
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,030
Run!

895
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,277
It's getting closer!

896
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,874
Go, go, go! Faster!

897
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,954
There's the wall!

898
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,632
We gotta get over the wall!

899
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,590
Run faster!

900
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,514
- Faster is not gonna help!
- Faster!

901
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,230
Calvin!

902
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,394
Look, look!

903
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,516
See what it's doing?

904
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,034
It's picking up stuff
and throwing it over!

905
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,590
Range is at fifty,
I don't know. Velocity...

906
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,353
We won't make it that way!

907
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,156
No, Meg!
We have to keep going!

908
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,913
This is the only way!

909
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,671
Do you trust me?

910
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,754
I trust you!

911
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,640
Okay.

912
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,991
Run, Calvin, run!

913
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,714
How did you do
that whole thing with the log?

914
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,635
It's just a physics thing.

915
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,677
The classic

916
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,320
slingshot maneuver.

917
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,757
Just a physics thing?

918
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,239
You have no idea
how incredible you are...

919
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,200
do you?

920
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,480
You're the one
who came with me.

921
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,509
You didn't
have to do that.

922
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,234
You're the one who
doesn't have to be here...

923
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,871
but you are.

924
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,239
You're the one who's...

925
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,476
I like your hair.

926
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,512
Thank you.

927
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,835
Meg! Calvin!

928
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,437
You made it!
I couldn't see you!

929
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,238
I couldn't tell!

930
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,191
I saw houses down there.
Come on!

931
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,594
Is Daddy down here?

932
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,113
I hope so.

933
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,437
I smell food.

934
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,598
Like good, roasted food.

935
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,831
Who else is starving?

936
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,313
I can't stand the sound.

937
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,392
The rhythm. It hurts.

938
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,031
Come here.

939
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,240
Cover your ears.

940
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,435
Darling, time for dinner!

941
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,998
Are you lost, children?

942
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,680
I bet you're hungry,
and in need of comfort.

943
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,394
I have roasts...

944
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,632
and potatoes,
and cakes of all sorts.

945
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,229
I could eat.

946
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,830
Um...

947
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,795
Uh...

948
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,996
No.

949
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,960
Thanks. We're good.

950
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,514
- No.
- Cakes of all sorts!

951
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,670
No!

952
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,911
Trust no one, remember?

953
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,636
It's changing again.

954
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,992
Is this still Camazotz?

955
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,510
They said it was
a planet of many faces.

956
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,438
Do you think this person would
mind if I ate all their food?

957
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,795
Probably.

958
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,832
Hey! I'm right here!

959
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,798
I'm right here!

960
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,634
Hello!

961
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,631
Hello! Friends!

962
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,120
Hello, friends. Hey.

963
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,879
How are you guys?

964
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,269
Who are you?

965
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,999
Oh, me? I'm nobody.

966
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,989
But you can call me Red.
And you are...?

967
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,160
Oh, I'm Calvin. This is Meg.
And this is Charles Wallace.

968
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,356
Oh!

969
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,637
You're Alex Murry's kids,
aren't you?

970
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,635
You know my father?

971
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,274
Yeah, yeah! I totally
know your father.

972
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,079
He's a great guy. I just
saw him a couple minutes ago.

973
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,070
Where?

974
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,515
I mean, we've been
looking for him.

975
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,756
Can you take us to him?

976
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,274
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, no, no, no.

977
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,318
Yeah. Almost. He should be
done working pretty soon.

978
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,958
He's kind of a busy guy.
You know, bit of a workaholic.

979
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,600
But I don't have
to tell you that. Right?

980
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,718
You know what?
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

981
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,996
Relax.
There's nothing to do here.

982
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,070
Nothing to worry about.

983
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,559
Are you guys hungry?

984
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,752
Everything's taken care of.

985
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,231
In total. Without options
or alternatives.

986
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,310
Hmm.

987
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,359
You guys hungry?

988
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,398
Well, I'll brave it for us.

989
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,353
What's wrong, little guy?

990
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,676
It tastes like...

991
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,594
like sand.

992
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,234
Does it?

993
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,359
I don't taste any sand.

994
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,515
Try mine.

995
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,192
It's all sand!

996
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,630
Ha!

997
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,030
I thought you were like me,
Charles Wallace.

998
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,757
I thought you were special.

999
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,280
And you are.

1000
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,440
You passed the test.

1001
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,440
It's as simple as that.

1002
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,276
Simple as twice one is two.
Twice two is four.

1003
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,000
Twice three is six.

1004
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,679
Twice four is eight.

1005
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,638
Twice five is 10.

1006
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,553
Twice six is 12.

1007
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,074
Twice seven is 14.

1008
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,356
What are you doing?

1009
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,914
Twice eight is 16.

1010
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,390
Uh, we'd
like to see our father now.

1011
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,791
You got it.
I'll take you right to him.

1012
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,074
Charles Wallace.
Take my hand now.

1013
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,475
Please.

1014
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,074
No, thanks.

1015
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,910
Oh, and, Meg...

1016
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,597
Hey.

1017
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,639
Thanks for everything.

1018
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,797
You brought him right to us.

1019
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,430
No! Stop!

1020
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,149
My little brother!

1021
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,470
- Charles Wallace!
- Please!

1022
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,034
Charles Wallace!

1023
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,030
Charles Wallace!

1024
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,270
Move!

1025
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,751
Charles Wallace!

1026
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,994
Well, that was fun.

1027
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,436
Welcome to Central
Central Intelligence.

1028
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,029
Get away from him!

1029
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,350
Relax. Don't fight it.

1030
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,352
It'll make it much easier,
I promise.

1031
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,871
Please, Charles Wallace.
Please. He is dangerous.

1032
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,030
What has he done to you?

1033
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,156
Shut up, Meg!

1034
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,390
Yeah. Shut up, Meg.

1035
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,152
Sorry, Red.
Meg's always been a problem.

1036
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,919
She's quite an aberration,
you know.

1037
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,400
Yeah, I can tell.

1038
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,912
But aberrations
are far more interesting.

1039
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,077
Don't you think,
Charles Wallace?

1040
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,920
That's so like you to try
to come to the rescue,

1041
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,030
isn't it, Calvin?

1042
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,319
Always so helpful.
Overly cheery.

1043
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,595
Trying to please everyone.

1044
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,673
Hoping to convince them...

1045
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,032
that you're not just a burden
to your father and your world.

1046
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,429
Pathetic.

1047
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,752
That's not why I do it.

1048
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,434
Of course, it is!

1049
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,557
Why else would you come
on this ridiculous

1050
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,552
journey with people
you barely know?

1051
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,757
Now that's enough,
Charles Wallace!

1052
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,830
You need to stop!

1053
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,469
It's enough when The IT
says it's enough!

1054
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,276
Sit. I can take it from here.

1055
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,352
No doubt about that,
little guy.

1056
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,315
Would you like to meet The IT?
That happy sadist.

1057
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,434
Not especially.

1058
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,876
Watch your tone!

1059
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,280
I'm sorry.

1060
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,471
We're just here to see Dad.
Remember?

1061
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,194
Your dad.

1062
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,875
Flower of the universe.
Child of mine.

1063
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,070
No.

1064
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,391
I think you mean your dad...

1065
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,593
who left you...

1066
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,037
who'd rather be anywhere else
in the universe than with you.

1067
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,758
Why would you even
want to see him?

1068
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,870
Oh, well.

1069
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,193
I wish I could
take you to him.

1070
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,320
But I can't.

1071
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,310
He's gone.

1072
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,994
He's not gone.

1073
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,231
You're right.

1074
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,994
He's not gone.
And yet, I don't see him.

1075
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,357
He's...
He's not gone.

1076
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,433
He's not gone.

1077
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,553
Just enfolded.

1078
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,833
What is it?

1079
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,633
What do you see?

1080
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,238
Topological order.

1081
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,549
Um, fractal dimension.

1082
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,791
Ooh. Clever.

1083
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,280
That she is.

1084
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,630
Oh.

1085
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:11,351
<i>They come to see
the fire burning</i>

1086
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,040
<i>In your heart</i>

1087
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,639
<i>They want to witness</i>

1088
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:29,517
<i>This love from the start</i>

1089
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,634
<i>They hear you
when you cry</i>

1090
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,555
<i>This love is far and wide</i>

1091
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,231
<i>When you smile,
the stars align</i>

1092
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:02,238
<i>Flower of the universe</i>

1093
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,191
<i>Child of mine</i>

1094
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,115
<i>Ooh</i>

1095
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,996
Meg.

1096
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,837
- Meg.
- Dad, it's...

1097
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,114
- Dad.
- Meg.

1098
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,590
Dad.

1099
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,874
Dad.

1100
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,875
Dad.

1101
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,911
Is this a trick? A dream?

1102
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,750
It's me, Dad. It's me.

1103
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,038
I missed you so much.

1104
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,717
My beautiful Meg.

1105
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,714
I missed you
every second of every day.

1106
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,159
Let me look at you.

1107
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,600
Daddy.

1108
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,440
Hi, Dad.

1109
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,589
How long
have I been gone, baby?

1110
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,799
How long have I been gone?

1111
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,514
Four years.

1112
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,871
You left four years ago.

1113
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,670
No.

1114
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,117
No. No. No.

1115
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,511
No, that can't be. No.

1116
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,919
No. I didn't.

1117
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,314
No, I didn't leave you, baby.
I wouldn't.

1118
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,517
I would never leave you,
sweetheart.

1119
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,880
I've been trapped here.

1120
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,680
How did you get here?

1121
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,956
It's dangerous here, Meglet.

1122
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,713
You can't be here.
How did you get here?

1123
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,480
You called out for us.
We came for you.

1124
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,477
We're here
to bring you home, Dad.

1125
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,190
"We"?

1126
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,079
My friend Calvin and...

1127
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,837
Charles Wallace came with me.

1128
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,077
Charles Wallace.
My baby boy is here?

1129
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,230
Where is he?

1130
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,760
Is he okay?

1131
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,476
The IT has done
something to him.

1132
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,239
Charles Wallace.

1133
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,394
Is that you, son?

1134
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,471
Son?

1135
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,599
Depends on who you ask.

1136
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,920
Let me get a good look at you.

1137
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1138
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,749
Charles Wallace.

1139
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,673
You don't look like
how I pictured you.

1140
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,234
I'm underwhelmed.

1141
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,352
Charles Wallace.

1142
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,110
Hey.

1143
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,633
What has The IT done to you?

1144
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,391
The IT has shown me
my potential.

1145
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,069
I can see the weaknesses
of any soul.

1146
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,833
Like, take your soul.

1147
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,158
So desperate
to matter in the universe...

1148
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,953
you'd abandon your own family
and never look back.

1149
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,512
That's not true, I swear.

1150
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,550
Doesn't matter.

1151
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,160
Let's go meet The IT.

1152
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,633
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

1153
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,591
Come on, now.

1154
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,592
Don't make me drag you.

1155
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,677
Okay. How about
you just take me?

1156
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,671
No.

1157
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,832
- Meg. Meg. Take me.
- Dad, no. No!

1158
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,712
No.

1159
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,439
I have
to do this, sweetheart.

1160
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,750
We don't want you!

1161
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,115
We've already had you!

1162
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,076
Stop it!

1163
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,191
Grab onto it!

1164
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,436
Let us go!

1165
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,998
Stop clawing the walls.
The IT's waiting for you.

1166
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,230
You're hurting them!

1167
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,635
And you're just
being impolite!

1168
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,990
Stop!

1169
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,470
Stop! Please!

1170
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,156
Don't do this, please!

1171
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,872
Please, don't do this!

1172
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,675
This is all your fault,
Mr. Murry!

1173
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,520
Can you
hear me? Meg!

1174
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,830
Meg!

1175
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,076
Meg, wake up, baby!

1176
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,230
Resist. Resist, Meg.

1177
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,517
Don't give in to the darkness.
Don't give in! Meglet...

1178
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,875
Meglet, wake up.

1179
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,599
Wake up! Wake up! Meg!

1180
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,790
Meg! Wake up!

1181
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,710
Come on. Hold on.

1182
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,439
Hold on, come on. Hold on!

1183
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,596
Breathe.

1184
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,240
Breathe, Meg, breathe!

1185
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,119
Let her go. Let her give in.

1186
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,760
Give up.

1187
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,755
This is what you get when you
put yourself before family!

1188
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,959
Please. Charles Wallace,
I'll do anything you want.

1189
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,319
Charles Wallace
isn't here right now.

1190
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,439
And even if he were...

1191
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,596
you're powerless against us.

1192
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,229
You have nothing that we want.

1193
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,275
Except for her.

1194
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,271
No.

1195
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,873
Forgive me.

1196
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,280
Meg! Meg, wake up. Wake up!

1197
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,075
Come on. Here.

1198
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,072
You brought light
back to me, Meglet.

1199
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,356
Maybe I can tesser again.

1200
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,800
Hold on.
Hold on, stay with me.

1201
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,513
It's working!

1202
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,430
It's working.

1203
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,595
Meg.

1204
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,877
Meg. Meg, baby. Meg.

1205
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,510
We're going back home.
We're going back home.

1206
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,630
Just a little longer.

1207
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,160
Charles Wallace.

1208
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,913
Just breathe. Just breathe.

1209
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,438
The darkness has him.
We can't take him with us.

1210
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,997
If we don't leave now,
we'll be trapped here forever.

1211
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,997
How could you? How...

1212
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,993
Meg, we have to.
The IT is gonna destroy us.

1213
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,913
- It's gonna destroy you, Meg.
- How could you leave him?

1214
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,072
I'm gonna come back
for him, Meg.

1215
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,919
How could you leave him again?

1216
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,190
I have to. I have to.

1217
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,752
I can't lose
both of my children.

1218
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,312
No, don't leave!

1219
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,836
I won't leave him!
I won't leave my brother!

1220
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,159
Stop! Stop!

1221
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,036
Stop!

1222
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,157
I won't tesser without him!

1223
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,959
Stop!

1224
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,871
Charles Wallace, I'm coming.

1225
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,350
Welcome.

1226
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:34,157
You made the right decision
to join us.

1227
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,317
Don't you feel better?

1228
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,391
You look better.

1229
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,516
I've known you
for a long time.

1230
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,669
It's good
to finally have you here.

1231
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,240
Charles Wallace.

1232
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,919
Charles Wallace.

1233
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,919
Charles Wallace!

1234
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,194
Hi, Meg.

1235
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,554
We knew you'd be back.

1236
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,634
We gotta say...

1237
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,753
nothing we love more
than stupid courage.

1238
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,830
"We"?

1239
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,198
Oh.
Where are my manners?

1240
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,270
Meg, meet The IT!

1241
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:29,910
No!

1242
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,870
Welcome to the darkest mind

1243
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,275
in the universe.

1244
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,438
Extraordinary,
don't you think?

1245
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,672
That's one word for it.

1246
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,911
We could really use
a gal like you.

1247
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,392
So, what do you say?

1248
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,315
You wanna join us?

1249
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,710
No thanks.

1250
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,392
Take a good look
at her.

1251
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,472
She's a better version
of you.

1252
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,119
She's sure to be popular.
Great student.

1253
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,920
Principal Jenkins
is going to love her.

1254
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,120
And Calvin probably will, too.

1255
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,873
She doesn't just have to
live in your imagination...

1256
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,111
I can make her real.

1257
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,999
You said
you wanted to come back

1258
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,196
as someone else.

1259
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,992
Join us, and I can make you
just like her.

1260
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,875
She's perfect.

1261
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,037
No!

1262
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,035
You better watch yourself...

1263
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,590
or we'll do to you
what you did to her.

1264
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,235
We don't care
whose sister you are!

1265
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,314
We're your only option,

1266
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,631
and we're starting
to not want you!

1267
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,951
A feeling you're very
used to, actually.

1268
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,880
No one in school likes you.

1269
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,795
Your father left you
without so much as a goodbye.

1270
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,431
Every bad thing you think
about yourself is true.

1271
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,153
<i>"The wound is the place</i>

1272
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,311
<i>"where the light enters you."</i>

1273
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,709
<i>Be a warrior.</i>

1274
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,513
<i>Can you?</i>

1275
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,479
<i>To you I give
the gift of your faults.</i>

1276
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,591
I know my faults.

1277
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,072
How I'm messy...

1278
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,200
uncoordinated...

1279
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,116
I don't trust anyone.

1280
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,952
And most days,
I hate myself.

1281
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,313
I'm impulsive...

1282
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,800
and suspicious.

1283
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,910
And yet...

1284
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,709
you love me.

1285
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,156
- What?
- Don't you, Charles Wallace?

1286
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,359
- No!
- Shut up!

1287
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,389
It's okay.

1288
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,150
Few understand
just how weak light is.

1289
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,198
Few are willing
to accept the fact

1290
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,999
that love is just a word.

1291
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,755
It's an empty,
meaningless word.

1292
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,271
You can hurt me
when I say I love you,

1293
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,589
but I'll love you anyway!

1294
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,195
And you love me!

1295
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,993
That's why you make milk
for me on stormy nights.

1296
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,635
That's why you check in
on me during recess.

1297
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,311
That's why you wanted to
find Daddy, to make me happy!

1298
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,436
That's why the Misses
took a chance on me.

1299
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,273
Because they felt your love.

1300
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,078
And you should love me
because I deserve to be loved!

1301
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,351
Stop it! Just, stop it!

1302
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,991
I love you! I love you,
Charles Wallace! I love you!

1303
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,310
Stop it!

1304
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,995
Please...

1305
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,152
I love you, Biscuits.

1306
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,478
No love!

1307
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,478
Only darkness!

1308
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,070
Meg!

1309
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,836
Meg.

1310
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,790
Meg.

1311
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,835
Meg, wake up.

1312
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,960
Come on, Meg.

1313
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,156
Please.

1314
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,990
<i>Flower...</i>

1315
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,550
<i>of the universe</i>

1316
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:54,791
<i>Child of mine</i>

1317
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,310
Whoa.

1318
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,876
The Misses.

1319
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,750
They came back.

1320
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,315
Charles Wallace,
your light has returned.

1321
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,000
Meg, you did it.

1322
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,393
I tried.

1323
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,156
Well, I knew
you could do it all along.

1324
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,872
I never doubted you
for a second.

1325
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,716
Well...

1326
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,190
I used my faults,
like you said.

1327
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,591
Such beautiful faults.

1328
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,592
I'm so proud of you, Meg.

1329
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,959
The universe is bright tonight
because of you.

1330
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,032
You weakened The IT...

1331
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,190
and you've given your Earth

1332
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,034
and everyone on it
a real chance.

1333
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,873
You should be proud.

1334
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,272
Some of our best warriors
have come from Earth.

1335
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,358
Einstein, Curie, Gandhi.

1336
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,313
Austen. Kahlo.

1337
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,317
Schindler.

1338
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,716
Nelson Mandela.
Maya Angelou.

1339
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,635
And now, Meg Murry.

1340
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,350
Me?

1341
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,993
What?

1342
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:43,915
All those who are willing
to face the darkness...

1343
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,478
and bring the best
of themselves to the light...

1344
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,233
for the world.

1345
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,597
This is where we leave you...

1346
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,990
to become warriors on Earth.

1347
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,032
Now, Meg, it's time...

1348
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,712
for you to start the tesser
for all of us...

1349
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,076
and make your way back home.

1350
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,830
What?

1351
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,276
Me?

1352
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,552
You want me
to start the tesser?

1353
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,117
"Tomorrow, there'll be
more of us."

1354
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,317
Miranda, American.

1355
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,674
<i>Goodbye, my loves.</i>

1356
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,795
<i>Farewell,
my little warriors.</i>

1357
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,635
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

1358
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,154
See you at home!

1359
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,840
Oh!

1360
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,474
Meg, you did it!

1361
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:00,030
You absolutely,
gloriously tessered.

1362
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,516
Daddy!

1363
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,189
Hey.

1364
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,760
You did it.

1365
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,679
I sure did.

1366
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,391
Mommy!

1367
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,950
Hi. Uh...

1368
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,513
Are you okay?

1369
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,075
I'm okay, Dad.

1370
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,716
Good.

1371
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,117
I'm sorry, Meg.

1372
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,310
I, uh...

1373
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,712
I wanted to shake hands
with the universe.

1374
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,231
But I should've been
holding yours.

1375
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,112
I love you so much.

1376
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,193
I love you, too.

1377
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,793
Charles Wallace?
What are you doing outside?

1378
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,030
Mommy!

1379
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,759
Well, well, okay.

1380
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,310
Thanks. What's going on?

1381
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,956
Wait.

1382
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,793
Am I asleep?

1383
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,235
Am I dreaming?

1384
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,916
No...

1385
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,759
you're not sleeping.

1386
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,476
And it's important
you know that.

1387
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,390
Why?

1388
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,713
Because Meg
brought you something.

1389
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,077
I'm sorry I'm late.

1390
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,351
I'm so, so sorry.

1391
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,839
How...

1392
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,431
- Where...
- Your calculations.

1393
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,957
They gave us the universe.

1394
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,437
I think
I'm gonna go home.

1395
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,914
You sure?

1396
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,116
Yeah.

1397
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,838
There are some things
I need to say to my dad.

1398
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,951
Maybe now I can
finally say them.

1399
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,273
It's funny
how it took a trip

1400
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,636
around the universe
to get me there.

1401
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,794
Can I call you later?

1402
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,829
Yeah.

1403
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,193
I knew you could do it.

1404
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,354
Love you.

1405
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,400
Always.

1406
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,949
- Hey!
- Daddy,

1407
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,633
I have a new word for the day.
Wanna hear it?

1408
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:30,790
Absolutely.

1409
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:31,871
Home.

1410
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,520
Thank you.

1411
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,917
<i>Ooh</i>

1412
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:02,351
<i>They come to see
the fire burning</i>

1413
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,869
<i>In your heart</i>

1414
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,953
<i>They want to witness</i>

1415
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,031
<i>This love</i>

1416
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,439
<i>From the start</i>

1417
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,713
<i>They hear when you cry</i>

1418
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:38,277
<i>This love is far and wide</i>

1419
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:45,356
<i>When you smile
The stars align</i>

1420
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:53,238
<i>Flower of the universe</i>

1421
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,990
<i>Child of mine</i>

1422
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,232
<i>When you sleep</i>

1423
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,439
<i>Softly the angels come</i>

1424
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,313
<i>Like diamonds</i>

1425
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,352
<i>Like my love</i>

1426
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,432
<i>They want to know it's true</i>

1427
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,680
<i>There's someone in the world</i>

1428
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,074
<i>Lovely as you</i>

1429
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,191
<i>They hear you when you cry</i>

1430
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,351
<i>This love is far and wide</i>

1431
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:57,153
<i>When you smile
the stars align</i>

1432
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,432
<i>Flower of the universe</i>

1433
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,431
<i>Child of mine</i>
