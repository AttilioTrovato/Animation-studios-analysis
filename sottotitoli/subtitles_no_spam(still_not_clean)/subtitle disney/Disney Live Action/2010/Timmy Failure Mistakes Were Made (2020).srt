What you are about to see

of my life as a detective.

It has been rigorously fact-checked.

It is also highly confidential.

11

00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:23,805
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Okay, this is work. I have to take this.

689
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,017
I want my Segway back,
the moment that rally is done.

690
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,024
And I'm calling Molly Moskins's mother.

691
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,196
And don't go anywhere.

692
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:40,907
TIMMY: If she was calling
Molly Moskins's mother,

693
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,825
I had to get to Molly first...

694
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:48,331
and make a deal.

695
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,088
A seedy backroom deal.

696
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,882
MOLLY: Tea?

697
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:00,553
Can we stick to business?

698
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:02,679
Okay.

699
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:05,766
So, you want me to tell my mom
to tell your mom,

700
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,726
that we're using your Segway in the rally?

701
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:09,270
Correct.

702
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:11,230
Why did you choose me?

703
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:13,899
My agency chose you.

704
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,693
Talent agency?

705
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:19,560
- Detective agency.
- Oh!

706
00:42:19,822 --> 00:42:22,908
Did you hear about the purse snatchings?
I saw it on the news.

707
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,287
I deal with bigger cases...
Holy smokes!

708
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:28,248
That's my cat, Señor Burrito.

709
00:42:28,748 --> 00:42:29,749
Is it trained?

710
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:34,546
Aw, she likes you. Probably because
you're odd and mysterious.

711
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:37,257
Get it off me, before I'm mauled.

712
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:40,093
Señor Burrito, vamonos, vamonos.

713
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:45,140
- Isn't this fun?
- It's business.

714
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:47,809
The future of my agency is at stake.

715
00:42:48,768 --> 00:42:51,480
Okay, okay.
So, you want me to be your cover.

716
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:53,357
Affirmative.

717
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:56,611
Well, my answer is yes.

718
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:59,238
I will cover you anytime, Timmy.

719
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:04,160
Be professional, Molly.

720
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:07,330
Fine.

721
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,333
I'll be professional.

722
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:15,004
If you want my help, you have to sign up
for the Animal Awareness rally.

723
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:17,173
- Negative.
- And...

724
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:25,724
- you have to paint my nails.
- Absurd!

725
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:28,568
And when we're done,
I'm going to paint your nails.

726
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:30,812
I think you've had too much tea.

727
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:33,660
You want me to be your cover, don't you?

728
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,110
Well, right now your cover
isn't feeling very cover-y.

729
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:46,245
TIMMY: Blackmail comes in many shades.
Including hot pink.

730
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:57,590
- Did you study?
- Negative.

731
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,051
We had a deal.

732
00:44:05,223 --> 00:44:07,934
- Would you help me with the bank?
- No way.

733
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:10,938
No bank, no deal.

734
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:12,231
MR. CROCUS: Failure...

735
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:15,150
no talking.

736
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,779
I wasn't talking, I was mouthing.

737
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:21,990
No mouthing, either.

738
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,708
ROLLO: If my mom finds out
I went downtown,

739
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,127
- I'm dead.
- TIMMY: She won't.

740
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:36,423
You just say that because your mom
has no idea where you are.

741
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:37,924
She works all the time.

742
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,386
Negative. I say it because this mission
is highly classified.

743
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,305
This is a bad idea. I just know it.

744
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,933
Stop panicking. We have backup.

745
00:44:57,652 --> 00:45:01,614
It's a vast complex.
Numerous points of ingress and egress.

746
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,827
It's huge. This is nuts.

747
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,746
Did you bring the marbles?

748
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,165
Yes.

749
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,376
- (CLATTERS)
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

750
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,718
What are these for anyway?

751
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,388
Contingency plan. Let's put on the masks.

752
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,017
These are just on loan, by the way.

753
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,136
- ROLLO: Now what?
- TIMMY: Follow me.

754
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,790
The Failure Mobile
is undoubtedly in the vault.

755
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,543
ROLLO: People are staring at us.

756
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,755
TIMMY: Jealous, ignore them.

757
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:03,930
- ROLLO: What are you doing?
- TIMMY: Gathering intel.

758
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:05,723
ROLLO: Good idea.

759
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,434
Can I help you boys?

760
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:13,648
TIMMY: Uh, we'd like to inspect
your vault. It's very important, Sir.

761
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,234
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

762
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,987
ROLLO: Okay. Then we'll just be
heading home. Right, Timmy?

763
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,866
- TIMMY: Negative.
- Would you mind removing your masks?

764
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,911
- ROLLO: Why?
- Bank policy. No masks.

765
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:29,081
We need to see everyone's face.

766
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,125
- TIMMY: We're being watched.
- ROLLO: Of course we are!

767
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,087
We're in a bank.
And we're wearing fencing masks.

768
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,549
TIMMY: That's when it hit me...

769
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,218
it was a trap.

770
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:45,472
We were surrounded.

771
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:48,685
But who tipped them off?

772
00:46:50,395 --> 00:46:53,231
Of course, it was a family affair.

773
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,986
- TIMMY: Oh, no.
- You need to remove those masks, now.

774
00:46:58,528 --> 00:47:00,446
ROLLO: Timmy, we need to remove
our masks.

775
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:03,283
- TIMMY: Never. Get ready.
- ROLLO: Get ready for what?

776
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:04,659
TIMMY: The diversion.

777
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,788
- Plastic?
- ROLLO: Yeah, it's safer.

778
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:14,253
TIMMY: It's an ambush, run!

779
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:16,857
- SECURITY OFFICER: Hey, stop!
- ROLLO: Why did you do that?

780
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,733
- TIMMY: Thank me later.
- ROLLO: I can't breathe.

781
00:47:18,757 --> 00:47:20,926
- TIMMY: Keep your mask on.
- ROLLO: I'm suffocating!

782
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,097
Papa Bear! Papa Bear!
Papa Bear! Need backup.

783
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,474
Repeat, need backup.

784
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:33,772
Okay, Timmy. Classified information,
bugs, armor-plated desks.

785
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:35,878
I have to ask.

786
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,443
Are you a spy?

787
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,030
- Negative.
- Don't worry.

788
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,366
I had the place swept for bugs.
We can talk freely.

789
00:47:45,118 --> 00:47:46,161
I'm a detective.

790
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:50,290
Ah! Yes, that makes sense.

791
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,685
So, you're having trouble
with your agency.

792
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:56,004
- Affirmative.
- How so?

793
00:47:56,963 --> 00:47:58,673
Someone is attempting to sabotage it.

794
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:02,259
- Do you know who?
- I can't discuss it with you.

795
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,095
Ongoing investigation.

796
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,807
But the success of my agency is at stake.

797
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:08,517
Oh, yeah?

798
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:10,895
What is your idea of success?

799
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:12,813
Greatness.

800
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,621
Have you talked to your mom
about any of this?

801
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:19,362
Why not?

802
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:22,615
She's collaborating
with local law enforcement.

803
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,295
Mother, can I have a tissue?

804
00:48:42,427 --> 00:48:44,137
He's low level, but very corrupt.

805
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:47,015
Also he maims rabbits.

806
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,017
Hmm.

807
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,980
Well, I know this is probably
not the best time to ask but...

808
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:56,024
is there any chance I could hire you?

809
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:57,860
What's the case?

810
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:00,833
I'd like you to do
a little undercover work for me,

811
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,407
in Mr. Crocus's class.

812
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:07,161
- You want intel.
- Yeah, I want intel.

813
00:49:07,704 --> 00:49:08,705
How in depth?

814
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:10,832
Let's start with the homework
he's assigning you.

815
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:12,972
I want to see it,
make sure it's on the up and up.

816
00:49:13,376 --> 00:49:15,420
- Completed homework?
- Yes, completed.

817
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:17,213
That will definitely cost more.

818
00:49:22,802 --> 00:49:26,223
All right, people. Lock it down.
Lock it down!

819
00:49:27,182 --> 00:49:29,810
Hey, we've got a rally to plan,
and awareness to raise.

820
00:49:29,935 --> 00:49:32,813
Now, who are my domesticated animals?
Raise your hands.

821
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:36,650
Good. Who are my wild animals?

822
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,903
All right, is that everyone?

823
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:42,239
Yes, you.

824
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,118
I don't know what group this is exactly,
but I'd like to do a tribute

825
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:47,911
to Hammy Ham, our class hamster.

826
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:50,040
He's dead...

827
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:54,002
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

828
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:55,587
of natural causes.

829
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:59,466
I like it. Very thoughtful.
Molly, take a note.

830
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:00,800
Copy.

831
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:03,636
FLO: Timmy, what group are you in?

832
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,806
- I'm in no group.
- You have to be in a group.

833
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:09,476
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

834
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,561
Not if he's protesting.

835
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:13,396
What is he protesting?

836
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,900
Probably the anti-bear policy.

837
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:18,486
There's an anti-bear policy?

838
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:21,113
Absolutely, I've heard about it, too.

839
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,074
- From who?
- Timmy.

840
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:27,870
Okay. Timmy, can you tell us
about the anti-bear policy?

841
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:31,499
Timmy?

842
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,377
Listen, if you feel strongly
about something, you have to speak out.

843
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,004
Right? Why do you think I'm here?

844
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,633
Because I like you? No. Definitely not.

845
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:44,763
It's because I want to teach you guys
to make an impact on the world.

846
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:49,643
Because if you don't,
we are collectively screwed. You got it?

847
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,020
Timmy.

848
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:57,234
Come on.
Buddy, you gotta give me something.

849
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:00,570
Affirmative.

850
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,906
All right, I'll take it.

851
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:06,173
All right, people, let's get up.
Let's get to work! Got a lot to do.

852
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:07,994
Come on, get to your tables.

853
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:10,252
We've got two weeks
to get this rally together,

854
00:51:10,373 --> 00:51:11,707
that's not a lot of time.

855
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:15,628
TIMMY: But that was a profound
understatement. Time was running out.

856
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,549
I had to liberate the Failure Mobile
from the bank, tonight.

857
00:51:20,508 --> 00:51:24,262
And that meant sending my bear,
who was often unreliable.

858
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:27,390
I told him to avoid well-lit places.

859
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:29,642
He did not listen.

860
00:51:31,227 --> 00:51:34,857
I advised him to steer clear
of any obvious entrance.

861
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:37,734
He did not listen.

862
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:42,197
And I urged him to avoid any distractions.

863
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,325
Once again, he did not listen.

864
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:50,789
But most importantly, I told him
to approach the Failure Mobile

865
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:53,333
with caution and the utmost delicacy.

866
00:51:57,838 --> 00:51:59,298
But he was too fat.

872
00:52:25,366 --> 00:52:26,534
How you doing, buddy?

873
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:29,747
What are you doing here?

874
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:33,038
Well, I was working in the area,
I thought you might want a ride home.

always keeps his enemies close.

- Sometimes, too close.
- How was school?

877
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:42,927
You have some fun?

878
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:45,846
Good times?

879
00:52:47,014 --> 00:52:50,476
Hey, do you like bear claws?
Picked some up at the bakery today.

880
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:52,061
They're yummy.

881
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:54,481
- What now?
- His claws.

882
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:57,400
They've all been... clipped.

883
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:02,030
No chance.

884
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:06,451
Oh, do you bowl? You ever been bowling?

885
00:53:06,868 --> 00:53:08,703
I could take you bowling,
give you some tips.

886
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,544
Hey, Timmy, you know, I know,
it's weird I'm dating your mom.

887
00:53:17,337 --> 00:53:19,840
It's weird that you want to give me
tips on bowling.

888
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:22,510
Fair enough.

889
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:25,699
I... I just want you to know though,
that I... really like her.

890
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:30,142
She's so smart, and cool,
and funny, and pretty.

891
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:33,980
I'm actually kinda surprised
she likes spending time with me.

892
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,315
Not that I am a bad guy at all.

893
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:38,734
I'm not, I just got
some stuff I'm working out.

894
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:41,654

which is going great.

898
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,042
- Hmm.
- Actually, I've been thinking

899
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:57,421
about robots a lot lately.
About how they could take over everything.

900
00:53:57,879 --> 00:54:00,632
You know, Timmy.
When someone opens up like that...

901
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,315
to you, like, then you can say something.

902
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,430
- Like what?
- Oh, like,

903
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:08,918
you know, "Thank you for sharing,"
something like that.

904
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:12,520
- Thank you for sharing.
- Yeah, that's a normal thing to do.

905
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,232
- Normal's for normal people.
- What does that mean?

906
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:20,111
It means you're normal.
And my mother doesn't like normal people.

907
00:54:22,405 --> 00:54:24,490
Okay. Okay.

908
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:34,292
So, first of all, just so you know,
I'm not that normal.

909
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:37,003
I'm a nice parking enforcement officer,
which is rare.

910
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:41,300
And, secondly, what you said,
that was kind of mean.

911
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:44,303
- I've never been mean to you.
- Yes, you have.

912
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,055
What? When?

913
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:49,058
- You just kidnapped me for starters.
- Oh!

914
00:54:49,391 --> 00:54:51,268
You dis... No, I didn't kidnap you, buddy.

915
00:54:51,393 --> 00:54:53,896
No this isn't... I'm just taking you home
from school.

916
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:55,386
You can get out any time you want.

917
00:54:55,856 --> 00:54:57,149
I never forced you to...

918
00:54:57,858 --> 00:54:59,109
Timmy, oh!

919
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,404

Oh, no. Come on, buddy!

TIMMY: Having thwarted
an attempted kidnapping,

922
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:14,084
I sequestered myself in my office,
to focus on the Jenkins case.

923
00:55:17,921 --> 00:55:20,173
- Hey.
- Hello, Mother.

924

Doing your homework, that's great.

926
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:35,272
So, I heard what happened today
with Crispin.

927
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:37,733
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Negative.

928
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:42,655
Timmy, I know it's not easy for you
having someone new around,

929
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:43,906
but I really like Crispin.

930
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,368
He's... he's a sweet guy
and we have fun together.

931
00:55:47,952 --> 00:55:51,080
Like yesterday, we just went for a drive.
It was nice.

about something else. It's important.

936
00:56:16,688 --> 00:56:18,148
We gotta move, Timmy.

937
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:21,901
- Impossible.
- No, it's not.

938
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:25,279
They're raising our rent again,
and I just... I can't afford it.

939
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,197
What about my office?

940
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,745
You... Well, you'll have to
make a new one.

941
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,243
I can't do that!

942
00:56:31,577 --> 00:56:32,778
I have a very heavy case load,

943
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,300
- this is not a good time for me.
- But we don't have a choice.

944
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:37,583
And besides,
I found a nice apartment nearby,

945
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,126
and you can still walk to school.

946
00:56:39,506 --> 00:56:41,406
What does school have to do
with any of this?

947
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:44,923
- I'm talking about my agency!
- Timmy, I know it's not easy...

948
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,426
I can't just move my business
at the drop of a hat.

949
00:56:48,718 --> 00:56:51,559
Not to mention, I'll have to make
new business cards. These are useless.

950
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:54,348

Construction on it began in 1933.

968
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:08,461
These turbines
generate 1200 megawatts of power.

- Is that it?
- Well...

too far in depth,

I find field trips like this
to be very helpful in my development.

- Nothing. I'm just being appreciative.

the restricted area. I'm going in.

1026
01:02:32,924 --> 01:02:35,301
Failure! Get over here, you little rat.

1027
01:02:36,177 --> 01:02:37,178
I'm warning you.

1028
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:41,224
If you go through that door,
I guarantee you'll never make it

1029
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:42,517
to sixth grade.

1030
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:48,064

01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:18,510
Next time, I'm keeping him on a leash.

1035
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:25,224
Huh!

1036
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,813
- Failure, get back in here. Now.
- Can't. Stuck.

1037
01:03:31,897 --> 01:03:32,982
So, unstick it.

1038
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:38,737
- Still stuck.
- Take it off and leave it there.

1039
01:03:39,446 --> 01:03:40,489
It's one of a kind.

This is the final straw, Failure.

No more threats, no more detention.

1044
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:03,595
I gave 43 years to this profession

1045
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,472
and I never quit on a single student.

1046
01:04:07,348 --> 01:04:10,351
But I'm quitting on you, did you hear me?

1047
01:04:10,435 --> 01:04:12,644
I am quitting on you, Failure.

1048
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:14,479
This is Dan.

1049
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:18,442
He's gonna open up the spillway
and release a whole lot of water.

1050
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:20,152
Cover your ears.

1051
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:23,113

- (SCREAMS) Oh, no!

- What's happening?
- I don't know!

1054
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:35,751
- Take off the scarf, take it off!
- Never!

1055

We're going to die!

1056
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:39,879
My scarf!

1057
01:04:40,379 --> 01:04:43,132
- You ripped it!
- Go. Go. Go!

No! No!

1061
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:57,104
Here comes the water! Get down!

1062
01:04:57,396 --> 01:05:00,650
- Why?
- 'Cause we're gonna get washed away!

1063
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:04,986
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

often at odds.

Now bound by adversity.

1066
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:18,375
But we had made one miscalculation.

1067

Water. Us.

1068

- I think it's over, Mr. Crocus.

- Mr. Crocus?

TIMMY: The aftermath of the operation
was complicated.

1072
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,026
First, they debriefed my mother
on the Russian plot.

1073
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:49,822
- Then she debriefed her boss.
- PATTY: Come on, I need this job, man.

1074
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:51,865
(GROANS)

1075
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:58,037
TIMMY: But the operation
was so top secret...

1076
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,332
that my mother didn't want to debrief me.

1077
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,587
Until we got home.

1078
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:12,593
You're suspended for three days,
Timmy, three days.

1079
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,721
They wanted to expel you.

1080
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,142
If your counselor hadn't stepped in,
then we'd be looking for a new school.

1081
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,769
- Are you listening to me?
- Of course.

1082
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,921
But, shouldn't you be returning
to work, Mother?

1083
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,441
Yeah, I should. But I'm not.
And do you wanna know why?

1084
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,110
Because when I told my boss
that I had to stay home

1085
01:06:30,193 --> 01:06:32,195
and take care of you
for the next three days,

1086
01:06:32,362 --> 01:06:35,574
he told me not to bother
coming in at all. He fired me.

1087
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,368
I can pay you ten times what he's paying.

1088
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:41,538
No, you can't. This... this has to stop.

1089
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,333
- You're going to middle school next year.
- No, I'm not.

1090
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,879
I'm not going to middle school.
I am moving my agency downtown.

1091
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:51,775
We've talked about this.

1092
01:06:52,882 --> 01:06:55,092
You don't have an agency, Timmy.
Not anymore.

1093
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:05,352
What are you doing?

1094
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:07,117
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1095
01:07:07,146 --> 01:07:10,608
I'm putting an end to all this pretending.
I'm shutting it all down.

1096
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:11,697
- Stop!
- No!

1097
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:14,986
You have got to understand
that there are consequences.

1098
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:19,824
Hey! That's my official license.
I need that.

1099
01:07:19,908 --> 01:07:22,160
- I have open cases.
- No, you don't. You're a kid.

1100
01:07:22,243 --> 01:07:23,828
Kids don't have open cases.

1101
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:26,122
I can't operate my agency
without a license.

1102
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:29,125
Exactly! You're gonna stop
running your agency,

1103
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:31,419
you're gonna start acting
like a normal kid.

1104
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:34,506
And normal is for normal people,
you told me that.

1105
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:36,883
I was wrong! I was wrong, Timmy!

1106
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:41,303
You have got to fit in,
you've got to grow up.

1107
01:07:43,347 --> 01:07:44,473
Do you understand?

1108
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:48,602
- Affirmative.
- I didn't hear you!

1109
01:07:52,264 --> 01:07:53,432
Yes.

1110
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:05,285
TIMMY: And just like that...

1111
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:07,036
I lost my agency.

1112
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,501
That meant no more clients.

1113
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:17,713
No more office.

1114
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:21,843
No more house.

1115
01:08:27,473 --> 01:08:32,019
A man without his agency
is like a turtle without his shell.

1116
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,613
Stripped of his place...

1117
01:08:45,782 --> 01:08:47,080
and his purpose...

1118
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,912
destined for mediocrity.

1119
01:08:54,499 --> 01:08:58,295
Thus, I had no choice
but to surrender to my fate.

- Good morning, everyone.

01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:23,694
So sorry I'm late.
My alarm clock didn't go off.

1127
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:25,029
Can you believe it?

1128
01:09:25,403 --> 01:09:26,613
Crocus is gone.

1129
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,450
- That’s his replacement.
- She said he's on vacation.

1130
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,786
But I think it's because of what happened
with you at the dam.

1131
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:36,456
My dad said Crocus snapped.

1132
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:41,419
TIMMY: Adding insult to injury,
the loss of Fredrick Crocus.

1133

- How was school?
- Good.

1137
01:09:56,266 --> 01:09:57,351
Got any homework?

1138
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,228
I did it.

1139
01:09:59,853 --> 01:10:01,938
Oh?
Good.

1140
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:05,163
I'll get dinner ready then.

1141
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,069
Okay.

1142
01:10:09,696 --> 01:10:10,739
Timmy...

1143
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,325
everything’s gonna be all right.

1144
01:10:14,785 --> 01:10:16,119
I even found a new job.

1145
01:10:17,204 --> 01:10:18,204
Okay.

1146
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,873
TIMMY: The good news
about Mother's new job

1147
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:26,420
should've lifted my spirits.

1148
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,423
But as her employment fortunes rose...

1149
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:31,550
my continued to fall.

With no clients and no agency,

1151
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:38,266
I had no choice
but to lay off my only employee.

1152
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,272
So Total and I agreed to part ways
as two professionals.

1153
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:18,470
But sometimes,
the professional can sure feel personal.

1154
01:11:27,146 --> 01:11:29,898
And being normal can sure feel lonely.

Just take one. They're really good.

- I don't need to go anymore.

1165
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:17,444
I'm being normal now.

1166
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,571
Got it.

1167
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:21,448
So, what's the plan?

1168
01:12:23,116 --> 01:12:24,242
Go to middle school.

1169
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,202
Act like them.

1171

TIMMY: Why not?

1172
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,667
Because you're different.

1173
01:12:35,044 --> 01:12:38,047
That's right. Your life is big...

1174
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:43,135
and original, and weird, and you.

1175
01:12:45,763 --> 01:12:47,014
I don't have a choice.

1176
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:49,475
I had to close the agency.

1177
01:12:50,309 --> 01:12:52,728
(SIGHS) That's a bad break.

1178
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,830
I suppose it had something to do
with the dam, getting suspended.

1179
01:12:57,482 --> 01:13:00,527
- Mistakes were made.
- By you.

1180
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:06,449
You left that part out.
Agency or no agency,

1181
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:08,743
you make a mistake, you own it.

1182
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:11,538
Then you learn from it and adapt.

1183
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:14,416
- Adapt?
- Absolutely.

1184
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,919
You see, professionals take
whatever the world throws at them

1185
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:20,504
and they use it to become
a better version of themselves.

1186
01:13:21,004 --> 01:13:23,006
Like I did when my car got stolen.

1187
01:13:24,174 --> 01:13:25,175
That's right.

1188
01:13:25,384 --> 01:13:27,469
From right in front of my house.
Sucked.

1189
01:13:28,429 --> 01:13:30,472
You should've contacted my agency.

1190
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:32,516
I didn't know you then.

1191
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:33,976
The point is,

1192
01:13:34,518 --> 01:13:36,937
after the car got stolen
I had no way to get to work.

1193
01:13:37,521 --> 01:13:38,856
But I love my work.

1194
01:13:39,565 --> 01:13:41,442
Like you. It's who I am.

1195
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:44,111
So I adapted.

1196
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,571
Started riding my bike to school.

1197
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,907
Wasn't gonna let a stolen car stop me.

1198
01:13:51,242 --> 01:13:53,786
And I lost ten pounds
from bike riding so...

1199
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:55,663
it's all good.

1200
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:59,792
- You lost ten pounds?
- Yes, I lost ten pounds.

1201
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:04,547
So, I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your business, okay?

1202
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:08,009
But I do know, if you love what you do...

1203
01:14:08,718 --> 01:14:10,011
you gotta fight for it.

1204
01:14:10,887 --> 01:14:12,767
And if something isn't working,
you gotta adapt.

1205
01:14:13,555 --> 01:14:14,723
You do that,

1206
01:14:15,056 --> 01:14:18,727
then no one can take away your agency.
Not your mother, not Mr. Crocus.

1207

And that's when it hit me.

1211
01:15:01,185 --> 01:15:02,442
Russians never quit.

1212
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:04,355
And neither could I.

1213
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:23,498
That meant I was going to need my partner.

1214
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:37,678
But retrieving Total was a daunting task.

1215
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:41,390
Which meant it was time to collaborate
with local law enforcement.

You scared me. Everything all right?

01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:00,520
Would I be standing here if it was?

No, guess not. Uh, is it about your mom?

Negative. About the zoo.

1224
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:08,874
I need admission. It's urgent.

01:16:10,251 --> 01:16:11,919
Okay. Why?

Hey, man, you can trust me. Really.

I'm a solid dude.

1228
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:27,601
A Russian agent stole the Failure Mobile,

1229
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:31,313
so she could destroy my agency
and achieve her master plan.

1230
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:34,608
That forced me to part ways
with my business partner.

1231
01:16:35,275 --> 01:16:36,401
I want him back.

1232
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:40,071
- And he's at the zoo?
- Correct.

1233

He's a polar bear.

where is the polar bear enclosure?

1242
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:09,475
It is right here, but it's closed.

- Renovations.

- Where are the polar bears?
- Utah. Hogle Zoo.

- Utah.
- Absurd.

- It's not absurd.
- It is, too.

He's just a kid,
and he's really upset all right?

1250
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:27,950
But he's a rude kid, so...

1251
01:17:28,234 --> 01:17:31,404
Well, he's just under the impression
that his partner is at this zoo.

1252
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:34,183
Let me get some clarity on that situation
and we'll figure this out, all right?

1364
01:27:19,457 --> 01:27:20,757
How do you want to play it?

1365
01:27:22,355 --> 01:27:25,983
Note to file. Possible police collusion
with the Russians.

1366
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:34,784
TIMMY: The crimes were piling up.
Gunnar's backpack, A dead hamster,

1367
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:36,227
and double-dealing cops.

1368
01:27:36,869 --> 01:27:39,372
But was I surprised? Negative.

1369
01:27:39,705 --> 01:27:41,290
After all, this was Portland.

1370
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:44,668
Stumptown. A place rife with crime...

1371
01:27:45,377 --> 01:27:47,837
corruption, and Russians.

1372
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:03,353
Thank you to the Carverette Elementary
Student Teacher Band.

1373
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:05,939
And thank you all for being here today.

1374
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:10,192
Our young activists worked very hard
to put this all together.

1375
01:28:10,317 --> 01:28:11,568
And I'm damn proud of them.

1376
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:13,320
And you should be, too.

1377
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,781
I'm serious.

1378
01:28:16,282 --> 01:28:17,283
Clap.

1379
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:21,871
Good.

1380
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,333
Now, welcome our student organizer,
Molly Moskins.

1381
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:30,671
MALE VOICE: Yes, Molly!

1382
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:34,008
- Where's Timmy?
- I don't see him.

1383
01:28:34,174 --> 01:28:36,509
- MOLLY: Thank you.
- Or my Segway, for that matter.

1384
01:28:37,176 --> 01:28:38,617
- Oh, yeah.
- MOLLY: Welcome, everyone.

1385
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,846
- What?
- Nothing.

1386
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:43,975
We, the students
of Carverette Elementary School,

1387
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:49,147
urge you to join us in celebrating
the glory that is the animal world,

1388
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,400
in our commitment
to wildlife conservation.

1389
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:56,821
We dedicate this rally
to our late class hamster,

1390
01:28:56,946 --> 01:28:58,698
the beloved Hammy Ham.

1391
01:28:59,019 --> 01:29:00,699
May his soul rest in peace.

1392
01:29:02,807 --> 01:29:07,497
And now, please welcome to the stage,
Timmy Failure.

1393
01:29:08,415 --> 01:29:09,416
No.

1394
01:29:12,711 --> 01:29:15,252
There's Timmy. And he has your Segway.

1395
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,082
He does.

1396
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:23,388
(INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

1397
01:29:27,558 --> 01:29:29,143
Greetings, fellow humans.

1398
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:34,482
Oh, boy.

1399
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:40,613
Please be advised that this school
has a "no polar bear" policy on campus.

1400
01:29:41,197 --> 01:29:42,823
That is not just.

1401
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:44,533
I'm gonna kill him.

1402
01:29:45,076 --> 01:29:47,328
You're the one who told him
to stand up and be heard.

1403
01:29:48,537 --> 01:29:51,457
A polar bear may be different.
He may be lazy.

1404
01:29:52,124 --> 01:29:55,794
He may eat garbage
and he may have a poor attitude.

1405
01:29:56,628 --> 01:29:59,672
But, he is also a vulnerable species

1406
01:30:00,215 --> 01:30:01,674
and worth protecting.

1407
01:30:04,636 --> 01:30:09,307
For a polar bear is loyal, and noble,
and capable of greatness.

1408
01:30:11,226 --> 01:30:15,814
In fact, all of the animals in this rally
are capable of greatness.

1409
01:30:20,526 --> 01:30:22,861
- Right on.
- Oh, he's so delicious.

1410
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:26,907
So, it may be time for us to move on
to middle school.

1411
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:30,661
It may be time for us to adapt
to a new way of life.

1412
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,873
But it will never be time for us
to stop being us.

1413
01:30:38,877 --> 01:30:42,464
You can tell that to our parents,
you can tell that to our teachers,

1414
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:44,611
and you can tell that to the Russians.

1415
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:48,094
Go, Timmy!

1416
01:30:49,762 --> 01:30:53,266
God bless Carverette Elementary,
God bless Portland,

1417
01:30:53,599 --> 01:30:55,935
and God bless Fredrick Crocus!

1418
01:30:56,561 --> 01:30:59,856
(ALL CHEER, APPLAUD)

1419
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:09,532
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1420
01:31:23,293 --> 01:31:25,493
TIMMY: It was a moment
of unmitigated triumph.

1421
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:32,512
I only wish that Fredrick Crocus,

1422
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:36,141
an educator unrivaled,
could have been here to witness it.

1423
01:31:42,813 --> 01:31:44,444
But then I knew why he wasn't.

1424
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:55,451
Save me!

1425
01:32:02,405 --> 01:32:04,029
TIMMY: She was plotting more evil...

1426
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:08,379
and we would be there to stop it.

1427
01:32:11,758 --> 01:32:16,012
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1428
01:32:17,764 --> 01:32:22,060
There's a man who leads a life of danger

1429
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:28,107
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger

1430
01:32:29,234 --> 01:32:34,780
With every move he makes
Another chance he takes

1431
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:39,493
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

1432
01:32:40,827 --> 01:32:46,708
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1433
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:52,464
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1434
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,806
Beware of pretty faces that you find

1435
01:33:03,933 --> 01:33:09,021
A pretty face can hide an evil mind

1436
01:33:09,355 --> 01:33:15,278
Ah, be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away

1437
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,199
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

1438
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:27,414
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1439
01:33:27,789 --> 01:33:33,378
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1440
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:08,287
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1441
01:34:08,495 --> 01:34:14,000
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1442
01:34:19,505 --> 01:34:23,551
Swingin' on the Riviera one day

1443
01:34:24,844 --> 01:34:30,224
And then layin' in the Bombay alley
Next day

1444
01:34:30,683 --> 01:34:36,981
Oh no, you let the wrong word slip
While kissing persuasive lips

1445
01:34:37,273 --> 01:34:41,443
The odds are you won't live
To see tomorrow

1446
01:34:42,819 --> 01:34:48,825
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1447
01:34:49,076 --> 01:34:54,748

And taken away your name
