1
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,452
Hurry, hurry, step this way.

2
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,532
Get your tickets now.

3
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,378
Don't be shut out, friend.
Step this way.

4
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,248
See the most wondrous sights
imaginable...

5
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,208
pulled from the four corners
of the Earth.

6
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,380
Acts to delight, to thrill
and to mystify!

7
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,637
Walk through these gates and
into a world of wonder!

8
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,975
She is here, ladies and gents,
live and in person.

9
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:03,017
That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting
honey-pie of the Wild West.

10
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,770
He has traveled the world and
baffled the crown princes of Europe.

11
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,315
He will amaze!
He will astound!

12
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,281
The Great and Powerful, Oz!

13
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,412
I always knew that I was
destined for show business.

14
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,417
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.

15
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,045
To think, an hour ago I was
just...

16
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,872
selling oil cakes on the midway.

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,506
Yes, well, opportunity comes...

18
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,333
when you least expect it,
my dear.

19
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,552
Wow!
What a get-up.

20
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,600
You won't need this.
Oh.

21
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,430
You are playing the simple
country girl.

22
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,188
Oh!

23
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,697
A gift, in honor of your debut.

24
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,773
Oh!

25
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,909
Now, this belonged to my
grandmother.

26
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,539
A tsarina from Mirkutsk, and
a decorated war hero.

27
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,703
Your grandmother?

28
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,127
Yes. She was killed in battle,
the poor thing.

29
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,378
Which battle?

30
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,164
Which battle?
Uh-huh.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,082
Well, there are so many.

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,093
You've heard of the Battle
of Kreplach?

33
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,170
No.

34
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,426
No? Good.
That's where she died.

35
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,935
And this music box was the
only thing to survive.

36
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,441
But I know that Grammie would
want you to have it.

37
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
Professor!

38
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,440
Frank!
The sock is on the door.

39
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,695
We're rehearsing.

40
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,784
How many times do I have to
tell you to knock?

41
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,446
Knock.

42
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,301
I knocked.

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,844
What is it?
Showtime.

44
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,004
Why didn't you say something?

45
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,890
Only a half a house.
Here's the take.

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,930
Pitiful.

47
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,442
All right,
this is your cut.

48
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,285
For you, the applause will be
approbation enough.

49
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,747
Well, how do you think I feel?

50
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,207
A man of my talents...

51
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,129
I should be playing the Orpheum
Circuit!

52
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,165
Instead of some dusty podunk...

53
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,053
in a second-hand jacket,
falling apart at the seams.

54
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,463
You're gonna have to patch
this thing again.

55
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,881
Again?
Yeah.

56
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,262
Let's go.
Hat!

57
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,142
Hat.
Hat. Okay.

58
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,805
You're the new girl, huh?
Yes.

59
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,767
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.

60
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,773
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.

61
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,984
Attack.
Heart attack.

62
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,408
But she's resting comfortably
now in Abilene...

63
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,319
expected to make a full recovery.

64
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,533
Perhaps you'd like to join her.

65
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,458
Now, remember, when I ask for
a volunteer...

66
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,243
I raise my hand.

67
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,288
You are overqualified for this
job, my dear.

68
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,623
Let's go make some magic.

69
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,133
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,627
the show has already begun.

71
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,674
There are still a few seats
left.

72
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,886
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!

73
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,601
Journey with me now, across
those deserts...

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,185
to the mystical lands of the
Arabian Peninsula.

75
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,903
For 5,000 years...

76
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,570
her lonely spirit has been
trapped.

77
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,575
But tonight, we will attempt
to free her.

78
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,167
I shall require a volunteer
from the audience.

79
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,169
Anyone.

80
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,594
Anyone.

81
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,513
How about you, madam?

82
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,099
Oh!
Yes, I would like to volunteer.

83
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,486
How kind of you.
Please.

84
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,524
Just remember what I told you.

85
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,284
A simple country girl, ladies
and gentlemen.

86
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,125
Now, you have nothing to fear,
just so long as you believe.

87
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,706
For when you do believe...

88
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,463
anything is possible.

89
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,801
You are growing sleepy.

90
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:49,395
Your eyelids become heavy.

91
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,397
Sleep!

92
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,775
Come, Fernanda!

93
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:08,288
Allow yourself to merge with
this woman before me.

94
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:19,087
Can you hear me, oh, Queen
Fernanda?

95
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,251
Yes.

96
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,346
Then rise.

97
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,102
Rise!

98
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,396
I command you to rise!

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,585
Rise from your tomb of sand.

100
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,293
Rise as your spirit...

101
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,928
I see a wire!

102
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,430
You are mistaken, sir.

103
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,516
I am not!

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,225
There is a wire!

105
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,649
There is a wire holding her up!

106
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,979
A wire?

107
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,361
I see it, too.
It's right there.

108
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,689
Clear as day.
Can't you see 'em'?

109
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,443
He's fooling us.

110
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,995
A wire!

111
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,536
What need have I of wires?
Frank.

112
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,062
Make me walk!

113
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,811
What's that?

114
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,402
Make me walk.

115
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,201
Not now, kid.
Let us leave the wonders...

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,534
But I believe in you.

117
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,545
Look, it's not much, but it's
all that we have.

118
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,332
Whatever you could do.

119
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,179
I would make you walk?
It's just...

120
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,132
It's just that...

121
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,092
Well, go on, then.
Make the girl walk.

122
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,602
Make the kid walk.

123
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,512
Come on, you big phony.

124
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,222
Yeah, come on!

125
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,442
I would make her walk, of course...

126
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,570
but unfortunately there is a
distemper in the ether tonight.

127
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,901
Make the kid walk, you big phony.

128
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,236
You see?

129
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,572
I'm sorry, but...

130
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,537
Thank you.
Thank you.

131
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,244
Oz, the Great and Powerful.

132
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,545
Why didn't you close the damn
curtain sooner?

133
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,047
I was dying out there.

134
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,207
There was nothing you could
have done.

135
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,759
I didn't really think it was
that bad.

136
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,887
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,929
You know, you shouldn't be so
mean to me all the time, Professor.

138
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,938
After all, I'm the only friend
you've got.

139
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,599
Friend?

140
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,645
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.

141
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,530
What I need is someone who knows
when to close the damn curtain.

142
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,329
It's a woman.

143
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,996
Ah!
Finally some good news.

144
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,287
You want me to wind up a
music box?

145
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,956
No.

146
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,334
Not for this one, Frank.

147
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,512
Hey, Annie.

148
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,133
Hello, Oscar.

149
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,510
Hmm.

150
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,645
You look lovely.

151
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,643
Thank you.

152
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,904
What is this?
Gingham?

153
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,152
You know it is.

154
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,326
It was a wonderful show.

155
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,113
Oh, don't tell me you watched
that debacle.

156
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,995
I don't know why you didn't just
tell that poor girl the truth.

157
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,958
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,169
And worse, they would have
demanded a refund.

159
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,959
Come on, have a seat.

160
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,963
I'll get you some tea.

161
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,345
Ooh!

162
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,396
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...

163
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,306
The last time you rolled into
town.

164
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,648
It's not often enough, Oscar,
seeing you once every few months.

165
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,190
Well, it is a traveling circus.

166
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,194
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma'?

167
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,612
She didn't send me a pie this
time.

168
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,867
I hope she's not mad.

169
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,030
I meant to write.

170
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,325
I need to tell you something,
Oscar.

171
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,869
That's never a good start to
a conversation.

172
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,879
John Gale asked me to marry
him.

173
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,252
That's why I've come.

174
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,551
I thought you should know.

175
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,924
Oh.

176
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:28,146
I think that's... that's
wonderful, Annie.

177
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,735
I said I had to think about it.

178
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,691
Oh, men love that answer.

179
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,533
I wondered what you thought
I should do.

180
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,288
You could do a lot worse than
John Gale.

181
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,419
He's a good man.

182
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,710
So are you.

183
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,253
No.

184
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm not.

185
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,926
I'm many things, but a good man
is not one of them.

186
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,428
But you could be.

187
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,769
If you wanted to.

188
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,101
Well, that's just it.

189
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,604
I don't want to.

190
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,238
See, Kansas is full of good men.

191
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,076
Church-going men that get
married and raise families.

192
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,616
Men like John Gale.

193
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,831
Men like my father...

194
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,835
who spent his whole life
tilling the dirt...

195
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,841
just to die facedown in it.

196
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,962
I don't want that, Annie.

197
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,759
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.

198
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,601
I want to be Harry Houdini
and Thomas Edison...

199
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,811
all rolled into one.

200
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,536
That's all I ever wanted for
you, you know.

201
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,706
Greatness.

202
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,290
Then you understand.

203
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,878
I do.

204
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,135
But do you?

205
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,427
Uh, Professor, you need to
look outside.

206
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,309
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.

207
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,514
Ah!

208
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm gonna rip him in half!

209
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,775
No, please!
Get off!

210
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,772
It was just his grandmother's
music box.

211
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,028
It meant nothing.

212
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,233
Oz!

213
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,237
I have to go.

214
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,622
Congratulations on the engagement.

215
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,289
Oscar.

216
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,459
I'll see you in my dreams.

217
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
Oz!

218
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,544
I'm gonna rip your head off!

219
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,551
Zim Zallah Bim!

220
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
Oz!

221
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,983
There he is!
He's out here!

222
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,117
No, Vlad!
Don't hurt him!

223
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,907
Vlad!

224
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,696
Vlad, no!
Whoa!

225
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,499
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!

226
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,121
I'm gonna crush you!

227
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,585
Oz! Where are you going?

228
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,627
Mr. Baum, I'll catch up with
you in Milwaukee.

229
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,590
Half of that balloon is mine!

230
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,300
And the other half is mine!

231
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,259
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!

232
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,140
Oz!

233
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,195
No, no, no.
You're not getting away!

234
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,605
Where's my thing?

235
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,535
Come here.
Get him down, Clowny.

236
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,828
No, you don't!
Oh, no, you don't!

237
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,880
Ah!

238
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
So long, sucker!

239
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,214
Get back here!

240
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,295
Oz!

241
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,339
Oz, you're gonna need these!

242
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,304
Throw it!
Now!

243
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,643
Hat!
Hat!

244
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,429
Ha-ha!

245
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,144
You're a dead man!

246
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,310
Farewell! Au revoir!
Auf Wiedersehen!

247
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,811
Run!

248
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,196
Run!

249
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,540
No, no, no, no, no!
No!

250
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,512
Whoa!

251
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,126
Please, I don't wanna die!

252
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,298
I haven't accomplished
anything yet!

253
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,886
Just get me out of here and
I'll do great things!

254
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,972
Please!
Give me a chance!

255
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,727
I promise!

256
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,605
I promise.
I can change.

257
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,502
Thank you.
Thank you!

258
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,035
Come on, come on!

259
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,829
Come on, come on!

260
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,061
Oh, no!

261
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,831
No, no. No, no.
Come on, buddy.

262
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,669
I can't swim.
No! I can't swim.

263
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,550
Somebody, help me!

264
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,381
Thank goodness.

265
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,516
I thought I was dead.

266
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,560
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?

267
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,020
There is still hope for me!

268
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,068
You won't regret this!

269
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,403
I saw you fall from the sky.

270
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:48,075
Oh. Uh... Yes, my balloon hit,
uh, an inverted thermal.

271
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,538
I couldn't compensate.

272
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,915
I'd get out of the water if
I were you.

273
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,043
Oh.
It's actually quite nice.

274
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,250
I'd be more concerned with
the River Fairies.

275
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,916
Their teeth are small, but
very sharp.

276
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,756
River Fairies?
What's a River Fairy?

277
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,836
Ow!

278
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,889
Ow!
Get off!

279
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,882
Ow!
Ow!

280
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,096
Psst.
Psst.

281
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,274
Go on, get out of here.

282
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,830
Spiteful little things, aren't
they?

283
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,922
Where... where am I, exactly?

284
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,832
Where do you think you are?

285
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,802
I have no idea.
It's...

286
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,464
It's like no place I've ever
seen.

287
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,595
You're in Oz.

288
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,593
Oz?

289
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,851
But that's my name.

290
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,015
Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac
Norman...

291
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,483
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.

292
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,816
But everyone calls me Oz.

293
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,995
I knew it!
The king's prophecy was true.

294
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,451
He said that a great wizard
bearing the name of our land...

295
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,666
will descend from the heavens,
and save us all.

296
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,619
And here you are.

297
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,500
Here to claim your throne.

298
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,005
"Claim my throne"?

299
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,670
You mean, like a king's throne?

300
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,382
Well, yes.
Because you will be our king.

301
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,304
Your king?

302
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,683
Like, in a palace, with a crown
and a scepter?

303
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,641
Yes, a beautiful scepter and
a grand palace.

304
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,192
Was that a gold scepter?

305
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,405
Yes, there's more gold than
you could ever imagine.

306
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,863
And Oz will now be what it
once was.

307
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,030
Because you are the Wizard,
aren't you?

308
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm the Wizard.

309
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,138
What was that?
The Wicked Witch's minions.

310
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,431
They've been sent here to
kill you.

311
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,716
Kill me?

312
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,100
A wicked witch?
What?

313
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,435
Oh!

314
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,227
We better hurry or your reign
will be over before it's begun!

315
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,768
Whoa!
Whoa!

316
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,482
Oh! Whoa!
Oh!

317
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,072
Come on!

318
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,578
In there!

319
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,751
Give me your leg.

320
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,093
Huh?

321
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:07,445
Oh... Perhaps the Wicked Witch
has summoned them back.

322
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,481
I don't think I like witches.

323
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,113
What?

324
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,121
I... I, too, am a witch.

325
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,327
I am Theodora, the Good.

326
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
You're not a witch.

327
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,119
Of course I am.

328
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,835
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?

329
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,125
What would I do with a broom?

330
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,338
Fly.

331
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,127
With a broom?

332
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,217
Never mind.

333
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,678
You were afraid?

334
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,648
That something might happen
to you.

335
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,208
So, this Wicked Witch...

336
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,043
just how wicked is she?

337
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,707
She's as wicked as they come.

338
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,550
She poisoned her own father.

339
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,842
That's pretty wicked.

340
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,421
He was a king and a wizard,
like you.

341
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,715
But she wanted the throne all
to herself.

342
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,258
Poor man.

343
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,224
But my sister chased her away
from the Emerald City.

344
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,473
I can't wait for her to meet you.

345
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,563
She was starting to doubt you'd
ever come, but now she'll see.

346
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,070
And you're going to fix everything.

347
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,610
Yeah.

348
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,598
You know what I think we need?

349
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,980
A little music.

350
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,267
Is that magic?

351
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,434
In a way.

352
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:57,072
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?

353
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,820
Well, this belonged to my
grandmother.

354
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,239
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.

355
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,455
Go on.

356
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,083
I want you to have it.

357
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,458
No one's ever given me anything
just because they wanted to.

358
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,342
A pretty girl like you?

359
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,845
With the visage of Helen of
Troy, no less?

360
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,014
I'm sure you have dozens of
admirers.

361
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,095
You don't know much about
witches, do you?

362
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,511
Maybe not, but I'm told I'm
a fast learner.

363
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,097
May I have this dance, milady?

364
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,734
Now you're gonna tell me no one's
ever asked you to dance before.

365
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,987
No one ever has.

366
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,149
Then it's high time that you
learned.

367
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,918
Put your hand here.

368
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,379
And your other hand here.

369
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,846
Nice, isn't it?

370
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,011
It's incredible.

371
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,095
Yeah.

372
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,564
Here I thought I'd live a
lonely life...

373
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,940
and then you showed up.

374
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,066
Not only are you the Wizard...

375
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,819
but you're the person I belong
with.

376
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,910
Well, we sure get along.
And...

377
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,575
And?

378
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,324
And.

379
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,335
Like you said, we belong together.

380
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,084
Oh!
I was hoping you would say that.

381
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,589
Yeah.

382
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,625
Help me!

383
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,214
Somebody, save me!

384
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,762
That poor little creature.

385
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,261
Wizard, we must save him.

386
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,767
Somebody, help me.

387
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,306
Oh, no, no, no.

388
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,263
Allow the Wizard.

389
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,768
Help me!
Come on!

390
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,692
Of course I'll save this...

391
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,067
little talking monkey in a
bellhop's uniform.

392
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,073
You, mister!
Please, hurry up.

393
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,735
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.

394
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,903
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?

395
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,286
Calm down, it's gonna be
all right.

396
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,449
You gotta get me out of
these vines.

397
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,993
Calm down.

398
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,962
I'm gonna die.
It's gonna eat me.

399
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,165
Don't worry. These vines aren't
gonna eat you.

400
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,960
Not the vines, the lion!

401
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,837
Lion?

402
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,221
We're gonna die.

403
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,511
We're gonna die!

404
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,679
Eat him first!
Eat him first!

405
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,149
Zim Zallah Bim!

406
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,361
Be gone, coward!
Fear my greatness!

407
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,034
You were wonderful, Wizard.

408
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,361
"Wizard"?

409
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,371
You mean the prophecy was true?

410
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,656
Indeed.

411
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,951
All right, well, I've saved
the day.

412
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,121
It was nothing, just a little
prestidigitatic display.

413
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,540
Shall we to the palace?
Yes!

414
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,753
Good day, sir.

415
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,334
Wait, please, sir.

416
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,173
My name is Finley.

417
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,509
My master's home was ransacked
by the Wicked Witch's baboons.

418
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,175
And I've been hiding in these
woods ever since.

419
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,390
But now you've saved my life,
oh, Wizard.

420
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,523
So I hereby swear a life debt
to you.

421
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,599
No... no need.

422
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:05,142
From this moment on I shall be
your loyal and faithful servant...

423
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,678
until death.

424
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,150
Well, he is cute.

425
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,366
All right, you're hired.

426
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,447
Wonderful.

427
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,747
Let's shake on it!

428
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,366
My bag, monkey.

429
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,541
Surely.
You must travel light.

430
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,377
I got it.

431
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,377
You two run along.

432
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,394
It's the Emerald City.

433
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,272
Just down this hill, along the
Yellow Brick Road.

434
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,603
Wow.

435
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,402
It'll all be ours now.

436
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,109
It's a good thing green is
my favorite color.

437
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,078
You are going to make the best
king Oz has ever known.

438
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,076
Thank you.

439
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,707
And I will be so proud to be
your queen.

440
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,202
My queen?

441
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,958
We'll spend a lifetime together.

442
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,872
But right now, there's thousands
of people in Oz...

443
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,088
waiting to witness your miracles.

444
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,762
Thousands?
That's a big show.

445
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,352
Phew!

446
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,603
What now, Wizard?

447
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,688
Monkey, tell me again about
that life debt.

448
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,355
I devote my life to you.
Mmm-hmm.

449
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,775
Whatever you wish, whatever
you want.

450
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,364
It is my sworn duty to deliver
for you...

451
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,616
until the end of my days.
Mmm-hmm.

452
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,031
And there's no getting out
of it?

453
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,120
None, sir.
It is irrevocable.

454
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,455
Good.
Because I'm not the Wizard.

455
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,210
Oh, sir, your sense of humor is
as boundless, as it is wondrous.

456
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,386
You remind me...
Monkey.

457
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,929
I'm not the Wizard.

458
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,554
Well, you could have told me
before I sealed the life debt.

459
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,764
It's too late.

460
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,803
You got to come clean for that
innocent young girl.

461
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,972
I'll deal with her later.

462
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,143
As my new assistant, all you
need to know are the three "ups".

463
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,981
Show up, keep up, shut up.

464
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,069
But...

465
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,146
What's the third "up"?

466
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,448
Right. Now, listen, I'm
depending on you.

467
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,988
We need to convince the good
people of Oz...

468
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,490
that they've found their wizard.

469
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,218
Hello, Knuck.

470
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,508
Theodora, we've been expecting
you.

471
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,434
I shall blow a fanfare.

472
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,765
No, no, no, no.
No. Not now.

473
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,401
This is the Wizard.

474
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,560
How do you do, sir?

475
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,775
This is the Wizard?

476
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,938
Is there a problem?

477
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,243
Yeah.

478
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,783
Halt.

479
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,083
All hail the Wizard.

480
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,619
All hail the Wizard.

481
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,710
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.

482
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,798
The greatest, most powerful...

483
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,552
and most genuine of real and
true wizards.

484
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,629
Thank you.

485
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,229
A wizard above scrutiny, with
no covert agenda...

486
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,639
or subversive intention,
whatsoever.

487
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,556
A wizard of the highest moral
rectitude.

488
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,102
He's just a real, good, solid
wizard, everyone.

489
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,737
The Wizard, here he is.

490
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,070
How'd I do?

491
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,743
Forward, march!

492
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,075
Hello?
Guys?

493
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,206
Can I get in the carriage?

494
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,788
Can I please get in the carriage?

495
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,099
I shall blow a fanfare.
Not now.

496
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:10,474
Is that it?
Is that my throne?

497
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,231
Do you like it?

498
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,989
I do so hope you like it...

499
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,462
because I've been personally
watching over it...

500
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:22,450
awaiting your arrival.

501
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:23,528
Oh...

502
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,995
Much obliged.

503
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,454
Praise be you are here at last...

504
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,290
and the prophecy shall be
fulfilled.

505
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,332
Oh, this is a glorious day
for us all.

506
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:40,504
And may I add, you're as handsome
a king as we've ever had.

507
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,638
Flatterer.

508
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,017
Who is this fetching woman?

509
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,603
This is my sister.

510
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,981
I am Evanora, the royal advisor.

511
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,268
I have been protecting the
Emerald City...

512
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,101
whilst we awaited your arrival.

513
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:00,027
I am here to serve you as I
served the king before you.

514
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,988
Well, I look forward to being
served.

515
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,449
Oh, sister, I like him already.

516
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,324
Oh... my scepter.

517
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,039
Oh, yes, go on then, have a seat.

518
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,498
How does it feel?

519
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,834
Fits like a glove.

520
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,837
Goodness. Knuck will show you
to your chambers...

521
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,297
and then we can, uh...

522
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,504
we can chat more later.

523
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,389
Can't wait.
Monkey? My bag.

524
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,802
Yes, Wizard, right away, oh,
great and powerful one.

525
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,061
Thank you, sourpuss.
Whoa!

526
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,521
My name is Knuck!

527
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,987
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?

528
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:47,029
You dare escort that oaf
in here...

529
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,823
and allow him to climb on
the hallowed throne?

530
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,833
And why not?
He is the Wizard.

531
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,290
"The Wizard."
Or so he says.

532
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,548
Did it not occur to you...

533
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,676
that he might be an imposter in
league with the Wicked Witch...

534
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,211
and sent here to kill us?

535
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,221
The Wicked Witch?
Don't be ridiculous.

536
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,226
Oh, I'm not the one who's
underestimating her cleverness.

537
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,689
Or maybe it's you I'm
underestimating.

538
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,820
Have you finally joined her
side, sister?

539
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:24,066
I am on no one's side.
You know that.

540
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,529
I simply want peace.

541
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,740
It's all I ever wanted, and
the Wizard can do that.

542
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,903
He's a good man.

543
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:31,910
Oh, what do you know about goodness?
Deep down, you are wicked.

544
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,620
I am not wicked!

545
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,924
That temper really is wasted
on you.

546
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,004
Do you honestly think...

547
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,720
that I could conspire against
you, with her?

548
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,601
You are my sister and I love you.

549
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,942
All right.

550
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,402
But I do need proof that he
is who he claims to be.

551
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,692
But he has already proven
himself.

552
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,906
Not to me, he hasn't.

553
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,455
Thank you for the tour.

554
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,210
It's my job.

555
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,416
Giving tours?

556
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,377
Taking care of the king.

557
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,132
Of course.
And on that note...

558
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,761
I was thinking it might be
nice to have a royal feast.

559
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,886
Maybe a grand roast.
You know...

560
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,541
my sister has been telling me...

561
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:32,467
that your magic is really
quite powerful.

562
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,805
Oh, really?

563
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:38,599
Yes, uh, boggling to the minds
of all who witness it.

564
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,142
Oh, I do wish I could see it
for myself.

565
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,309
Yes.

566
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,978
Why not show me now?

567
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,151
Now?
Here.

568
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,487
All things in good time.

569
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,994
And a good time for all things.

570
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,828
So wise, so true.

571
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,748
Well, um, there is one last
room...

572
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,171
that I would like you to see.

573
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,504
The royal treasure of Oz.

574
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,639
It belongs to whoever is king.

575
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,691
It's all right, Wizard.

576
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,353
Go and enjoy your riches.

577
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,195
It's mine!

578
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,830
Mine!

579
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,117
Oh, no more second-hand suits
for you, baby!

580
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,703
Nothing but the silks and satins!

581
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,292
Ali Baba!

582
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,262
And one of these things!
What is this?

583
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,383
A chalice.
A chalice!

584
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:59,020
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.

585
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,102
Well, uh, not quite yet.

586
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,435
You see, you only become the
king...

587
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,520
after you defeat the Wicked
Witch.

588
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,064
That's the prophecy.

589
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,359
And since you haven't done that
yet, you're not...

590
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,744
I'm not actually king.
Not yet, no.

591
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,156
You still have to get rid of
the Wicked Witch.

592
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,824
Right.

593
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,585
And killing her won't be easy.

594
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,337
No, I don't suppose it will be.

595
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,505
Mmm.

596
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,667
Wait a minute.

597
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,710
No one said anything about
killing anybody.

598
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,207
Oh. Well, if you're not
interested in being king...

599
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:35,294
that's all right with me.

600
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:36,344
We can just forget about the
whole thing.

601
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,886
The gold and the rubies, the
chalice.

602
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,719
I'm interested!
I...

603
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,648
I'm just not too keen on killing
a lady.

604
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,517
She's not a lady.

605
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,813
She's a wicked witch.

606
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,529
And your magic is the only thing
strong enough to destroy her.

607
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,615
All you have to do is journey
to the Dark Forest...

608
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,820
and destroy her wand.

609
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:58,988
Her wand.
Yes.

610
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,202
It's the source of all her power.

611
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,162
Without it, she dies.

612
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,078
I haven't even said goodbye to
Theodora. She will be upset.

613
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,370
I will talk to her in the
morning.

614
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,379
I will tell her how much you
love her, how much you...

615
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:09,464
No.

616
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,085
No, don't... don't say anything.

617
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,256
All right. I will say whatever
it is you want me to say...

618
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,598
but are you going to save us
all, or not?

619
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,322
I'm your wizard.

620
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,702
We're really gonna do this?

621
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,704
How hard could it be to kill
a wicked witch?

622
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,911
Hard.
Really hard.

623
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,953
It's very, very hard to kill
a wicked witch.

624
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,836
And what about that poor girl,
back there?

625
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,040
I think she really liked you.

626
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,085
She'll get over me.
They always do.

627
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,252
She's a pretty young witch.

628
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,212
There'll be plenty of wizards
knocking at her door.

629
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,057
Oh, every lie you tell gets us
one step closer...

630
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,750
to the Emerald City dungeon.

631
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:02,135
Then don't think
of them as lies.

632
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,430
Think of them as stepping stones
on the road to greatness.

633
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,514
Wait, I got it.

634
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,816
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.

635
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,069
You apologize for lying about
being the Wizard...

636
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,770
and for lying to that poor
girl. Okay?

637
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,440
You gotta really seem contrite.
You gotta sell it.

638
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,450
Maybe you could even cry. Can
you cry? I could cut up an onion.

639
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,861
We're not going back.

640
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,495
We're gonna find this wicked
witch...

641
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,787
steal her wand...

642
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,449
I'll get that big pile of gold...

643
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,494
and you can have a nice pile
of bananas, all right?

644
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,752
Bananas.

645
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,496
Oh, I see.

646
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,128
Because I'm a monkey, I must
love bananas, right?

647
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,385
That is a vicious stereotype.

648
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,216
You don't like bananas?
Of course I love bananas.

649
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,550
I'm a monkey, don't be ridiculous.

650
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,721
I just don't like you saying it.

651
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,798
How about this?

652
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,350
We offer to wash all the windows
in the Emerald City...

653
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,852
for an entire year.
Uh-huh.

654
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,429
They'd have to forgive us.

655
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,689
Or, we could give them a little
help with their infrastructure.

656
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,101
I noticed some yellow brick
potholes, back there.

657
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,750
That looks bad.

658
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,630
We're not going down there.

659
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:13,331
Someone might need our help.

660
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,498
Not that you care.

661
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,587
Get back here!
You get back here!

662
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,682
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?

663
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,987
What happened here?

664
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,671
Hello?

665
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,854
Hey, there.

666
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,774
Are you all right?

667
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,775
Don't worry, we're not gonna
hurt you.

668
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,282
This is Finley.

669
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,362
Hi.

670
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,618
My name is Oz.

671
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,208
Are you...

672
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,328
are you the Wizard?

673
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,830
You've heard of me.

674
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,965
Everyone has.

675
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,552
Good. Then you know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

676
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,011
So, just come on out of there.

677
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,475
But I can't.

678
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,350
Oh.
All right, hold on.

679
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,731
Get this off of you.

680
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,236
Oh, no.

681
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,540
I'll never get back together.

682
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,218
Don't worry.
I think I have something.

683
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,050
Give me that bag.

684
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,806
I, uh, packed something.

685
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,263
There it is.

686
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,686
What is that?

687
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,766
Magic in a bottle.

688
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,734
Magic?

689
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,895
Let's give it a try.

690
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,780
All right.

691
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,611
Just give it a little dab.

692
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,117
Like so.

693
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,909
Okay.

694
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,500
Should work.

695
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,130
There we go.

696
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,796
Ta-da!

697
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,507
Oh, no, no, no!

698
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,761
They're coming back!

699
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,322
It's okay.

700
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,870
They're gone.

701
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,251
The Wicked Witch sent them.
Why?

702
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,833
Last night...

703
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,921
the whole town was celebrating
out in the streets...

704
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,836
because we had heard that you
finally arrived.

705
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,838
Me?

706
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,174
Everyone was so happy.

707
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,677
But then...

708
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,894
but then those things flew in.

709
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,601
And then...

710
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,019
and then they...

711
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,873
Here we go.

712
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,455
Last piece.

713
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,215
Would you like to try to stand?

714
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,555
There.

715
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,895
All right.

716
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,272
There we go.

717
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,404
Easy.

718
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,565
Okay.

719
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,823
I'm gonna let you go.
Oh!

720
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:38,910
Okay.

721
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,411
Now walk to me.

722
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,751
I don't think I can.

723
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,416
I think you can.

724
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,460
Come on.

725
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,821
All right.

726
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,607
You did it.

727
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,699
Thank you.

728
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,681
All right, this is it.

729
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,392
Just head on down that way,
about two, three hours.

730
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,019
You'll hit the Emerald City.

731
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,351
Tell them I sent you, they'll
take great care of you.

732
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,187
Nice meeting you.

733
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,235
But...

734
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,489
I wanna go with you.

735
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,319
What?

736
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,567
Aw...

737
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,202
On a witch hunt?

738
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,829
No, you're just a little girl.

739
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,161
I'm not as delicate as I look!

740
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,908
That didn't hurt.

741
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,494
I'm coming with you.

742
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,379
Listen, we have one rule in
show business.

743
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,540
Never work with kids, or animals.

744
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,209
And I'm already working with
this thing.

745
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,590
Relax.

746
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,508
The answer's no.

747
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,180
Oh, no, no, no.

748
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,887
Don't... don't do that.

749
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:25,979
You're fine.

750
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,022
You're gonna leave me alone!

751
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,354
Look, you're... you're fine.

752
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,190
On a road, in the middle of
nowhere?

753
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,899
All you have to do is take
the Yellow Brick Road.

754
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,234
You'll get there.

755
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,025
It's crying again, what do
I do?

756
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,737
Oh, no.

757
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,032
Off.
Come on, off.

758
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,617
Off of there!
Scat! Get off!

759
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,701
Please let me come with you.

760
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:48,869
No!
Get off of there!

761
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,629
I promise I won't bother you!

762
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,705
No dolls on the witch hunt!

763
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,085
Please, let me come!
Fine.

764
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,296
Fine!
You wanna come, come.

765
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,215
We'll all go, it'll be a big
party.

766
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:05,056
Great. Let's go kill ourselves
a witch!

767
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,015
You'll die, you'll die, you'll
die!

768
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,928
Did those crows just say we
were gonna die?

769
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,472
They did.

770
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,106
Wizard?

771
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,034
Come on.

772
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,465
I'm scared.

773
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,217
Think there are ghosts out here?

774
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,474
No.
Of course not.

775
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,677
Evil spirits, maybe?

776
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,479
The undead?

777
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,853
The undead?

778
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,651
Will you stop that?

779
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,164
No.
Get off!

780
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,206
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!

781
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,543
Will you calm down?

782
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,592
No!
What is it?

783
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,719
Look out!
I wanna go home!

784
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,429
I wanna go home!

785
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,219
Hey!
Hat!

786
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,345
Thanks.

787
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,680
Look out!

788
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,189
Come on.

789
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,524
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.

790
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,361
Oh, my gosh.
That was close.

791
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,822
Where are we?

792
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,737
This must be the place.

793
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,541
So, how are you gonna kill
the Wicked Witch?

794
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,624
All I need to do is get her
magic wand.

795
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,165
Once I destroy that, she's
finished.

796
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,548
Why don't you just use this?

797
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,550
It's got a knife!
Where'd you get that?

798
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,177
I'm made of china.

799
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,550
I gotta protect myself somehow.

800
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,056
Give me that.

801
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,432
Hey!

802
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,219
Honestly.
Honestly yourself.

803
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,721
Look.

804
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,108
That must be her.

805
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,566
Come on.

806
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,755
She put down the wand.

807
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,007
But how are we gonna get it?

808
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,918
Hey!

809
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,420
Now, listen up.

810
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,131
Here's the plan.

811
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,593
The Wicked Witch is the triangle.

812
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,021
Monkey, you're the X.
I'm the O.

813
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,181
China Girl, you're the squiggly
line.

814
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,942
I wanna be a heart.
Can I be a heart?

815
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,854
All right, fine.
You're a heart.

816
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,695
Okay, now, heart stays here...

817
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,786
as O makes his way over here.

818
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,447
X counters thusly.

819
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:54,990
Clear so far?

820
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,870
Bless you.

821
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,376
Good work.
You just sneezed away the plan.

822
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,881
Sorry.
Never mind.

823
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,793
Just go over there and make
some of your animal noises.

824
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,461
I'll grab the wand when she's
not looking.

825
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,504
Get out of here.

826
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,775
Yes!
Come on, come on.

827
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,322
Oh, no!

828
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,178
Moo!

829
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,476
Moo!

830
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,893
A cow?

831
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,185
Come on, come on.

832
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,113
Hurry!
I got it!

833
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,314
Break it.
Break it, Wizard.

834
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,698
All right.
Break it!

835
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,029
Did you say "Wizard"?

836
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,533
No!

837
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,657
Are you really the Wizard?

838
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,826
Um... that's a complicated
question.

839
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,456
I mean, what is a wizard?
I...

840
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,206
Um...

841
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,308
I'm the Wizard.

842
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,389
Then there's hope.

843
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,849
What's going on?

844
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,810
Not sure.
I sneezed the plan away.

845
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,396
I have waited so long to
meet you.

846
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,358
So, we've never met?

847
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,363
Certainly not.

848
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,532
I'd remember a thing like that.

849
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,318
You've never been to Kansas?

850
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,986
What is Kansas?

851
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,076
Is that where you're from?

852
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,542
My, you must have traveled very
far to get to the Land of Oz.

853
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,328
I did.

854
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,748
I'm Glinda, the Good.
The Witch of the South.

855
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,546
I thought Evanora was the
Good Witch.

856
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,087
Evanora is the true Wicked Witch.

857
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,676
Conniving and as cruel as
they come.

858
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,933
She's fooled most everyone,
including her own sister.

859
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,220
She made everyone believe that
I poisoned my father...

860
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,559
but it was her.
Then...

861
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,354
she's the one who destroyed
my village?

862
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,696
I'm so sorry, child.

863
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,706
Here's your wand.

864
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,084
Sorry I mooed.

865
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:48,414
And to think, you almost killed
Glinda for a bit of gold.

866
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,581
A bit?

867
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,921
There were mountains of it,
buddy.

868
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,131
Not that I was going to do it.

869
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,797
I wasn't really going to break
your wand.

870
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,928
Follow me.

871
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,713
Okay.

872
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,357
No.

873
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,770
No, no, no, no, no.
It cannot be!

874
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,522
Curse you, Glinda.

875
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,986
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead, yet.

876
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,698
Curse you and your pretty
little face.

877
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,077
Sister?

878
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,989
Sister, the Wizard is missing.

879
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,541
I've looked everywhere, but
he's gone.

880
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,168
What is it?

881
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,504
Where is the Wizard?

882
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,126
Where's the Wizard?

883
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,250
With Glinda.

884
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,928
Then it's happening.

885
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,888
Oh, sister, he's fulfilling
the prophecy.

886
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,851
He'll bring her darkness to the
light and peace to the land.

887
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:52,110
Yes, I'm certain that's what
is happening. It must be.

888
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,158
Where did you get that?

889
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,036
This?

890
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,296
Oh.

891
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,758
It was a gift.
From him.

892
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,596
He came to my chambers last night.

893
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,681
Oh, how we danced!

894
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,846
For hours, it seemed.

895
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,060
Oh, I can still feel his body
pressed against mine.

896
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,400
Oh, sister, you were right
about him.

897
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,651
He is the great Wizard.

898
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:42,945
He must be, to make me feel
the way I feel.

899
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,130
Oh, no.

900
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,879
Not you, too, sister?

901
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,216
He said we would rule Oz
together.

902
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,264
He said I would be his queen.

903
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,640
Did he?

904
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:18,731
Are you quite sure it wasn't
you who said it to him?

905
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,675
You fool!

906
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,159
Serves you right.

907
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,828
I want Glinda and that wizard
torn to shreds.

908
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,960
Do not fail me a second time.

909
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:17,168
Fly!

910
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:37,814
On the day my father died, we
lost a kind and noble leader.

911
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,606
And a dark shadow was cast
across this land.

912
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,617
I've had to stand alone
against Evanora and watch...

913
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,697
as towns were destroyed, children
were orphaned...

914
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,286
and my heart was broken.

915
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,500
I've been unable to protect the
good people of Oz by myself.

916
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:03,051
With only faith in my father's
prophecy, I've waited.

917
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:04,711
For you...

918
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:11,556
great Wizard from Kansas, to
come and set things right.

919
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,803
Oh.

920
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,147
So, that's the prophecy.

921
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,894
Um...

922
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:24,196
you see, when I agreed to
be king...

923
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,699
I didn't realize how complicated
all of this was.

924
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,656
She knows.

925
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,612
What?

926
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,665
Evanora knows you know the
truth now. Look!

927
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:34,912
Oh, no.

928
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,874
Uh...

929
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,710
What do we do?

930
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,094
Wizard, now is the time.

931
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,254
The time?

932
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,760
Use your magic.

933
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,637
Oh...

934
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,811
My magic.
Yes. Uh...

935
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,775
I think we should run.

936
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,685
Run?

937
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,445
Yeah.

938
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,731
You heard the Wizard.
Run!

939
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:07,815
Let's get out of here!

940
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:08,900
Let's go!

941
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,623
They're gaining on us!

942
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,287
What are you doing?

943
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,119
Is... is that gonna stop them?

944
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,878
I don't know.

945
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,467
Nice work.
We lost them.

946
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,725
Phew!
That was close.

947
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,136
Yeah.

948
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,273
Wait, I hear something.

949
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,108
They're getting closer!

950
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,911
Wait for me!

951
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,958
Look out!

952
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,676
Monkey!

953
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,517
Little China Girl!

954
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,857
Wizard!
I'm over here!

955
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,362
Help! Catch me, please!
Got you!

956
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,698
Are you all right?
Yes.

957
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,446
I'm okay, too.

958
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:34,986
Just go!

959
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,704
Great!
A bunch of fog.

960
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,286
This is her big idea on how
to save us?

961
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,373
Well, it was the best I could
do, under the circumstances.

962
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,208
Uh...

963
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,127
Oh, okay.

964
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,133
Whoa!

965
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,547
Catch her!

966
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,182
Get me!
Don't let go!

967
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,885
Monkey, grab her!

968
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,224
Don't let go!
Don't let go!

969
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,184
Pull my tail.
Ow!

970
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,439
Not so hard.

971
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,060
They're getting closer!

972
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,353
What do we do?

973
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,692
What do we do?

974
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,949
Just do what I do.

975
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,452
Unless you've got something.
Uh...

976
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,201
No, you go.

977
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,494
Wait.
What are you doing?

978
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,709
Wanda!

979
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,040
Where are you going?

980
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,750
She said to do what she did.

981
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,428
Just because she jumped off
the cliff...

982
01:09:32,528 --> 01:09:33,755
you're gonna jump off the
cliff?

983
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,551
I have wings.

984
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,091
What about me?
Come on!

985
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:43,763
Um...

986
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,794
Whee!

987
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,134
Whoa!
Oh! Oh!

988
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,921
Whoa!

989
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,947
Wow.

990
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,752
Whoa!

991
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,963
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

992
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,551
These things go kind of fast,
huh?

993
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,854
Hey, is... is that a wall?

994
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,112
Of sorts.

995
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,774
It repels our enemies and
protects us from harm.

996
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,534
But we're headed straight
for it.

997
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,703
Yes, we are.

998
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,626
And going very fast.
How do you, uh...

999
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,667
Does this thing have any brakes?
Uh...

1000
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,590
I'm going too fast!
I'm gonna die!

1001
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,592
You needn't worry, Wizard.

1002
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,378
It's a magic wall.

1003
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,548
And all good-hearted souls get
to pass through.

1004
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,891
I'm gonna die!

1005
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,308
Wanda!

1006
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,184
Oh!

1007
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,782
It's beautiful.

1008
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:26,225
They've waited a long time
for you, Wizard.

1009
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,695
All hail the great and powerful
Oz!

1010
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,614
Hail!

1011
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,745
Thank you!

1012
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,743
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.

1013
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,129
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."

1014
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,586
Hi, what's your name?

1015
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,925
You're very beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

1016
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,467
Girls, listen, I am not a toy.
I am not a toy!

1017
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,385
Oz!
Oz!

1018
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,803
Hello!

1019
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,056
What?
No fireworks?

1020
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,350
What are fireworks?

1021
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,151
Remind me to show you, sometime.

1022
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:21,156
Glinda, I didn't know if you'd
like these, or these.

1023
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,113
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.

1024
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:25,986
We need your help, Wizard.

1025
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,071
Please save us!

1026
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,615
You know, I should tell you,
um...

1027
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,753
I might not actually be a wizard.

1028
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,414
Yes, I know.

1029
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,581
Oh.

1030
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,292
At least, not any kind of wizard
we were expecting.

1031
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,128
You could tell?

1032
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,674
I can also tell you're weak,
selfish...

1033
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,969
slightly egotistical, and
a fibber.

1034
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,309
I see. Anything you don't know
about me?

1035
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,941
Whether or not you'll save
my people.

1036
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,693
Uh, no. I just told you I'm
not the Wizard.

1037
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,025
But they don't know that.

1038
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:06,947
If you can make them believe,
then you're wizard enough.

1039
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,080
These are desperate times,
after all.

1040
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,084
Can you make them believe?

1041
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:24,548
Will I still get that gold?

1042
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,591
Uh-huh.

1043
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,723
Good people of Oz.

1044
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:36,226
Your Wizard is here!

1045
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,704
What's the matter, sister?

1046
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,758
Look at how happy they are.

1047
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,759
Do you think she'll be his queen?

1048
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,966
Well, of course she'll be
his queen.

1049
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,135
What did you expect?

1050
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,220
You can't compete with Glinda's
charms.

1051
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:13,764
No one can.

1052
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,270
Oh, God.
Sister, it hurts.

1053
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,434
Such is a broken heart.

1054
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,194
Your precious wizard did that
to you.

1055
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,856
Make it stop.

1056
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,279
Would you like me to?

1057
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:44,006
One bite, is all it takes.

1058
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,553
One bite, and your world will
change forever.

1059
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,142
One bite, and your heart will
become impenetrable.

1060
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,313
One bite, and you and I will
finally share the throne.

1061
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,639
Unless you'd rather see Oz
and Glinda there.

1062
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,504
You're the wicked one.
Not Glinda!

1063
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,338
Sister, you lied to me.

1064
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,879
It's nice, isn't it?

1065
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,719
How clear everything becomes.

1066
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,274
What is happening to me?

1067
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,439
Oh, it's just your heart
withering away.

1068
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:57,197
Fear not, Theodora, for soon you
will feel nothing at all, except...

1069
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,867
beautiful wickedness.

1070
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:20,599
Sister?

1071
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,084
Oh, sister, you're hideous.

1072
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,121
I can cast a simple enchantment...

1073
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,416
and have you looking just the
way you were before.

1074
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:50,674
No!

1075
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,427
This is who I am, now.

1076
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,466
I want him to see me like this.

1077
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,937
I want him to know that he was
the one who made me this way.

1078
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,433
Oh, dear.

1079
01:18:20,187 --> 01:18:22,478
It's imperative that you behave
like the great leader...

1080
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:23,898
that they think you are.

1081
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,461
Morale is essential, if we have
any hope of defeating Evanora.

1082
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,998
And I assume you have a plan.
No.

1083
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,800
You have a plan.

1084
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,962
You're going to lead us into
battle and take back the throne.

1085
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,554
And do we have an army to help
do this?

1086
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,302
Of sorts.

1087
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,144
The Quadlings, Your Highness.

1088
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,685
You're soldiers?

1089
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,321
No, sir.
Farmers, mostly.

1090
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,481
Farmers?

1091
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:57,741
But you can fight.

1092
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,994
No, sir.
Many of us can hoe.

1093
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,320
Oh, you can hoe.

1094
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,747
And I can work with iron.
That's good.

1095
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,290
I bake bread.
Yummy.

1096
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,118
I can sew.
Not so helpful.

1097
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,373
I can make a scarecrow.

1098
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:09,954
Ah!

1099
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,506
Well, that'll come in handy.

1100
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,338
It might.
Hmm.

1101
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,585
And these are the Tinkers.

1102
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,256
Are you kidding me?

1103
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,971
We're tougher than we look,
Wizard.

1104
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,434
What they lack in stamina, the
Tinkers make up for ingenuity.

1105
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,564
They can build anything.

1106
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,360
And I'll tell you what else.

1107
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,521
We can build anything.

1108
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,863
Yeah, I got it.

1109
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,322
And we're prepared to storm
the Emerald City.

1110
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,871
If you don't keel over, on the
way there.

1111
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,199
Ow!

1112
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,793
And, finally, the Munchkins.

1113
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,762
Please tell me, you gentlemen
can fight.

1114
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:04,842
No.

1115
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:06,636
But we make pretty clothes.

1116
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,349
Also, we sing.

1117
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,355
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.

1118
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,609
I like it, I think it's cute.
I hope you like it.

1119
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,151
The prophecy was clear...

1120
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,777
the wind would bring you here.

1121
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,817
And so it was a man named Oz...

1122
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,119
would magically appear.

1123
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,279
All right, enough.

1124
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,746
So, sound the battle call.
The Wicked Witch will fall.

1125
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,952
And so it is the wondrous Wiz...

1126
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,036
will come to save us all!

1127
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,162
All right, that's enough!

1128
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,622
Munchkins, stop!

1129
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:42,129
They do make beautiful clothes.
All right.

1130
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,594
Now listen, Wanda.

1131
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,225
Glinda.

1132
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,932
Guys, um, take five.

1133
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,896
Uh, Glinda, these are all very
lovely people.

1134
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,774
But do you honestly believe that
they can kill a wicked witch...

1135
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,859
and an army of flying baboons?

1136
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,155
I don't expect them to kill
anyone.

1137
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,246
What do you mean?

1138
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,825
I mean the good people of Oz
are forbidden to kill.

1139
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,789
Forbidden to...

1140
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,002
You want me to lead an army
that can't kill?

1141
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,889
If this was easy, we wouldn't
need a wizard, would we?

1142
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,679
Somethings wrong!

1143
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,802
Look!
What is that?

1144
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,892
The wall!
What's happening?

1145
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,148
The Wicked Witch isn't powerful
enough to get through the wall.

1146
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,394
It looks like she's managing.

1147
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,363
Not by herself, she isn't.

1148
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,899
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?

1149
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,317
Everyone, take cover!

1150
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,485
Run quickly!
Take cover!

1151
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,456
Get the children to safety!
Run!

1152
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,324
Glinda!

1153
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,222
There's so much good here.

1154
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,479
It sickens me.

1155
01:22:59,016 --> 01:22:59,983
Ah!

1156
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:03,813
Still think your Wizard can
save you from the likes of me?

1157
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:11,074
Speak up, or I will tear out
your tongue!

1158
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,658
Now, who is that?

1159
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,580
Don't you recognize me, Wizard?

1160
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,502
Have I changed so much?

1161
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:21,538
Theodora?

1162
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,917
May I have this dance?

1163
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,427
Huh?

1164
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:29,759
Hey, hey!

1165
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,263
I get it!
You're a little upset!

1166
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:43,485
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.

1167
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,127
Theodora, what happened to you?

1168
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,707
You happened to me.

1169
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,837
This isn't you.

1170
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,883
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.

1171
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,305
I'd hoped you'd be able to
see through her.

1172
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,563
Oh, Glinda, so naive.

1173
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,354
Just like your father.

1174
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,612
That's why it was so easy for
my sister to kill him.

1175
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:32,986
She only killed a man, not what
he believed in.

1176
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,746
Begone, Witch, before the Wizard
makes mush of you!

1177
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,450
Oh.

1178
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,003
How sweet.

1179
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,839
You all believe in him.

1180
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,753
Well, so did I, once.

1181
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,973
And as for you...

1182
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:58,807
my pretty one...

1183
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,519
when I return with my sister
and her army...

1184
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,809
the Yellow Brick Road will be
red with the blood...

1185
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:10,072
of every Tinker, farmer and
Munchkin in your kingdom.

1186
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,033
You underestimate us, Theodora.

1187
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:18,823
We are a strong and united
people.

1188
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,038
And now the Wizard is here
to lead us.

1189
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,542
And as for your Wizard...

1190
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:29,208
he will be the first to die.

1191
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:33,550
And you will all see that he
is nothing but a deceitful...

1192
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:38,893
selfish and extremely mortal man.

1193
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,100
Give me that!

1194
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,062
It was a broom that you wanted.

1195
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,610
Wasn't it, Wizard?

1196
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,117
It's all right.

1197
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:05,869
It's all right!

1198
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:09,756
She's gone now.
Don't be frightened.

1199
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,917
Now that the Wizard is with us...

1200
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,919
Wizard?

1201
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,133
Leaving?

1202
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,763
But you promised to help us.

1203
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,554
Yeah, well, that was before
I knew what we were up against.

1204
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,814
An army and yet another wicked
witch?

1205
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:29,067
This one bent on destroying
everyone, especially me?

1206
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,569
We can defeat them.

1207
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,479
There must be something.

1208
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,068
Something we haven't thought of.

1209
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,273
Something that we're not seeing.

1210
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,612
Something we're just on the
verge of.

1211
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,277
Glinda.

1212
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:41,117
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.

1213
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,156
But you're all I have.

1214
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,292
So, you're not the wizard
I was expecting.

1215
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,591
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.

1216
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,965
But you're here.

1217
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,677
There must be a reason.

1218
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:02,810
Maybe you're capable of more
than you know.

1219
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,766
Glinda, I wish I had the answer.

1220
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,814
But I'm just a con man.

1221
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,771
I'm a carnival magician.

1222
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:20,494
I'm just not the man you want
me to be.

1223
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,994
Someone needs to tuck me in.

1224
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,876
Yes, of course.

1225
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,218
Allow me.

1226
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,883
My papa used to do it.

1227
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,388
I see.

1228
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,847
Perhaps you'd prefer the Wizard,
then?

1229
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,017
Yes, please.

1230
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,617
All right.

1231
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,044
In you go.

1232
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,831
Here you are.
Uh-uh.

1233
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,507
Just a moment.

1234
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,420
Bring forth the covers, now.

1235
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:21,930
Yes, ma'am.

1236
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,427
Comfy?

1237
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,433
All right.
Goodnight.

1238
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,223
Do you grant wishes?

1239
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:33,691
Do I what?

1240
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,397
Grant wishes.

1241
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,938
The old wizard could grant
wishes.

1242
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,523
Ah.

1243
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:42,485
People would travel to the
Emerald City...

1244
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,410
and ask him for things.

1245
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:48,039
And if they were good and
noble wishes...

1246
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,415
he would grant them.

1247
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,247
Is that right?

1248
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,037
Do you know what I'd wish for?

1249
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,085
Hmm.
A pretty dress?

1250
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,585
To have my family back.

1251
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,805
I know.

1252
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,386
I'm sorry.

1253
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,260
I can't grant wishes.

1254
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,146
I'm not that kind of wizard.

1255
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,808
That's what I thought.

1256
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:20,943
Um, you see, where I come from
there aren't any real wizards.

1257
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:25,403
Although, there is one.

1258
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,998
Thomas Alva Edison.

1259
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:34,502
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.

1260
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:37,790
Did he grant wishes?
No.

1261
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,631
But he could look into the
future and make it real.

1262
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,343
He created the electric light,
the phonograph.

1263
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,135
He created a camera that could
take moving pictures.

1264
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,678
Pictures that move?

1265
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,642
Yeah.
Can you imagine?

1266
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,354
And all he had was a little
bit of wire and some glass.

1267
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:01,276
With almost nothing, he made
the impossible real.

1268
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,532
Is that the kind of wizard
you are?

1269
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:11,827
It's the kind of wizard I'd
like to be.

1270
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,665
Well, you are that kind.
I can tell.

1271
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:22,047
I'd rather you grant wishes,
but that's a good wizard, too.

1272
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,383
Goodnight, Wizard.

1273
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,855
Glinda.
I've got it.

1274
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,440
What have you got?

1275
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,688
I've got a way out of this mess.

1276
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,699
What is this?
A battle plan.

1277
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,196
It's all in there.

1278
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:54,199
Illusion, misdirect, sleight
of hand.

1279
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,038
Look...

1280
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,831
I know I'm not the wizard
that you were expecting...

1281
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,374
but I might just be the wizard
that you need.

1282
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,429
You said you were just a con man.

1283
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:09,885
Precisely.

1284
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,220
Nothing but a trickster?

1285
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,018
A terrible cheat?

1286
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,516
The best there is.

1287
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,899
The carnival magician's going
to put on a show.

1288
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:21,776
I'll put on the show of a
lifetime.

1289
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:25,235
The likes of which the Land of
Oz has never seen!

1290
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:30,744
Magic, mystery, prestidigitation!

1291
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:35,328
It'll be my greatest trick, yet.

1292
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,831
Tinkers, gather around!

1293
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,587
Quickly, now.

1294
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,588
This is what you're gonna build.

1295
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:46,092
Where I come from, this is
called a praxinoscope.

1296
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,094
Although, I've made a few
modifications.

1297
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,215
It allows you to project an
image into space.

1298
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,928
Impossible.

1299
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:56,436
Nothing's impossible if you
put your mind to it.

1300
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,016
Bully.
Bully!

1301
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,933
These three roads all lead to
the Emerald City.

1302
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,522
To the east are the deadly
poppy fields.

1303
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:05,695
We'll have to steer clear of them.
Why is that?

1304
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,613
One good whiff and it's
everlasting sleep.

1305
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,447
And we're not exactly a terrifying
army when we're awake.

1306
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,907
All right.
We'll steer clear.

1307
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,789
Or maybe not.

1308
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:19,576
In the conjuring business,
flash is always good.

1309
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,461
Gives the audience a little "wow".

1310
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:25,753
You gentlemen will be combining
sulfur rock, nitrate of potash...

1311
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:30,216
and charcoal to create what is
commonly known as black powder.

1312
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,426
Whoa!

1313
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,891
Mr. Quimby, we need 200 bales
of hay...

1314
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,593
delivered to the main road
by noon.

1315
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,730
Mr. Zim, have the Quadling
carts...

1316
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,449
Looks good.

1317
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,814
My very own Winkie Guards...

1318
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:35,531
soon you will be facing Glinda
and her army of weaklings.

1319
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,913
And when they see our towering
might...

1320
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,363
they will run and flee for the...

1321
01:33:41,463 --> 01:33:43,033
hills and...
No!

1322
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:44,961
We shall not let them flee!

1323
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,543
We shall show them no mercy!

1324
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,635
Now, I've added this adjustable
lens to your design...

1325
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,721
along with a few other things.

1326
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,135
Have a look.

1327
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:06,817
Yes!
Edison himself would be proud.

1328
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:13,114
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.

1329
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:16,072
But I'd rather you just keep
it between us.

1330
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,486
Yes?

1331
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,163
Do you know how to build a
hot air balloon?

1332
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,000
This is all very impressive...

1333
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:34,193
but you still haven't told me
how you plan...

1334
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:35,898
to get this thing into Emerald
City.

1335
01:34:36,033 --> 01:34:37,714
Relax.
I know someone.

1336
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,554
What do you mean, you know
someone?

1337
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,597
Hello, Wizard.

1338
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,559
Well, well, well.
If it isn't ol' Sourpuss.

1339
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:47,185
My name is Knuck!

1340
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,691
Now, you two be nice to each
other.

1341
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,568
Let's move it, Wizard.
Can you give me a break?

1342
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,145
I'll break your nose!

1343
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,774
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?

1344
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,025
Cue the con man.

1345
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:00,203
Would you stop? A con man
couldn't have done all this.

1346
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,322
You're much more than that.

1347
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:05,496
Well, then, it looks like I've
got you fooled, too.

1348
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,954
The only person you've got
fooled, is yourself.

1349
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,732
For protection.

1350
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,813
Not that you need it.

1351
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:51,079
Great people of Oz.

1352
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:54,125
Today we fight to free the
land...

1353
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,255
from the villainy of the
Wicked Witches.

1354
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,341
We are few...

1355
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,756
but we are mighty!

1356
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,433
Quadlings!

1357
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,260
Tinkers!
Bully!

1358
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,144
Munchkins!

1359
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:12,188
We face great odds, but we are
armed with our courage...

1360
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,978
our hard work, and most of all...

1361
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,231
our faith in one another.

1362
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:22,494
We have nothing to fear, as long
as we believe.

1363
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,738
For when we do believe...

1364
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:28,040
anything is possible!

1365
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,919
Onward!

1366
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:58,604
Halt!

1367
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:02,233
Good day there, fellow Winkie
guardsman.

1368
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:03,484
What is your business here?

1369
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:04,903
Supplies for battles.

1370
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:07,622
We bring supplies for battle.

1371
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,789
I was told of no such delivery.

1372
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,957
Where are your papers of transit?

1373
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,132
Why this delay?
Do you not recognize me?

1374
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,588
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.

1375
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,003
Sir, I'm just trying to do my...

1376
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:24,798
What I meant was...
Hmm?

1377
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,008
Let them pass!

1378
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,306
Let them pass.

1379
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:29,491
What's this?

1380
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,553
They dare march on us?

1381
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:48,597
Tear them apart!
Fly!

1382
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,065
It's a trick.

1383
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,271
Pull!

1384
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,244
Retreat!
Retreat!

1385
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,594
Curse you!

1386
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,603
Oh, it's not over yet.

1387
01:40:19,472 --> 01:40:23,852
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.

1388
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,486
Into the woods!

1389
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:27,647
Watch out!

1390
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:31,984
Ah!

1391
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:51,550
Away with her.

1392
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,230
Oh!

1393
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:44,607
Herald.
Great Wizard.

1394
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:45,766
Who's this?

1395
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,069
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.

1396
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:49,979
Yes, sir.
To the rear.

1397
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,063
Let's go!

1398
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:52,447
Let's go.

1399
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:53,699
You two, get the trolley.

1400
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,610
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.

1401
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:56,694
Yeah, come on.

1402
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:57,778
I just have to do one thing,
first.

1403
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:58,863
There's no time.

1404
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,373
Get this carriage in position.
Yes, sir.

1405
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:01,623
Hurry!

1406
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,750
I told Glinda you would do this.

1407
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,208
She said I was wrong about you.
I guess I wasn't.

1408
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,288
What are you talking about?

1409
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,123
I'm talking about that thing
the Tinker built.

1410
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,133
The balloon.
What balloon?

1411
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:14,886
That's my cue.

1412
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,052
All right, you guys.

1413
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,429
Just remember, stick to the plan.

1414
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:20,809
Stick to the plan?

1415
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,220
The plan was you.

1416
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:23,600
We're supposed to stick to you.

1417
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:25,936
You guys will do great.
So long.

1418
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:27,896
Come back!
We can't do it alone.

1419
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:30,232
Wizard!
Wizard, I don't know what to do!

1420
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:58,931
Citizens of Emerald City...

1421
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:03,596
witness what happens when you
defy me.

1422
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:11,478
Glinda did very well for herself
today, I'll admit.

1423
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:12,941
Leave her alone!

1424
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:14,481
Unchain her, you witch!

1425
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:15,944
We know the truth.

1426
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,199
You poisoned the king!

1427
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,486
Guards!
Get them under control.

1428
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:22,656
The citizens of Emerald City
will not tolerate this!

1429
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,039
We will not!

1430
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:25,116
Silence!

1431
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,665
Silence!

1432
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:32,964
Ooh.

1433
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,585
What should I do now?

1434
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,088
I'd get your sister and fly
out of here.

1435
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:39,301
Really?

1436
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,136
While you still can.

1437
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:43,180
Well, I think I'm going to do
something quite different...

1438
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:45,344
and I'm going to do it...

1439
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:49,854
ooh, very, very slowly, because...

1440
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,487
I just can't take the sight
of that...

1441
01:43:54,787 --> 01:43:59,032
pretty, pretty face.

1442
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,240
Ooh, I'm going to wipe out
your light...

1443
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:05,285
until there is nothing left
but my darkness.

1444
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,328
I have been waiting for this
for a long time.

1445
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:32,683
Oh, no.

1446
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:37,238
He said it was going to be his
greatest trick, yet.

1447
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:40,195
Did he tell you the trick was
on us?

1448
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:52,044
How predictable.

1449
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:19,063
I knew that buffoon of yours
couldn't be the Wizard.

1450
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,288
Out of my way!

1451
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,589
Give up, Glinda.

1452
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,803
Why do you continue to resist?

1453
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,180
Because I believe in the Wizard.

1454
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:51,596
So did I, once.

1455
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,769
Behold!

1456
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,112
Your Wizard!

1457
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:02,694
Where is he going?

1458
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,404
He's abandoning us.

1459
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:06,444
How could he?

1460
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:18,963
No!

1461
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,341
No!

1462
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,572
Aw!

1463
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,782
Not so great and powerful,
after all.

1464
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:03,793
You, there!
Move back!

1465
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:22,106
Hey!

1466
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:29,860
Hello, monkey.

1467
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,700
Oz!

1468
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:34,786
I thought you were dead.
Shh.

1469
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,163
You were crying pretty hard.

1470
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:38,498
Was that for me?

1471
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:41,460
Oh, no. Some of the smoke got
in my eyes.

1472
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,044
Oh, right.

1473
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:46,211
Wow, you fooled everybody.

1474
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,011
That was your greatest trick,
yet.

1475
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:49,797
That was just the opening act.

1476
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:52,012
Let this be the final word.

1477
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:54,848
Your prophecy is dead.

1478
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:59,099
Like the king who spoke it, and
the wizard who tried to fulfill it...

1479
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:01,266
all dead.

1480
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:02,476
It's showtime.

1481
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:07,486
And they will be joined in death
by Glinda, the Good.

1482
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:15,372
Farewell.

1483
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:19,918
Say hello to your daddy for me.

1484
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:32,177
The dreams of the people live on.

1485
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:02,704
Fear me not, good people of Oz.

1486
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,793
Fear me not.

1487
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:07,249
For it is I...

1488
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,839
the great and powerful...

1489
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:12,972
Wizard of Oz!

1490
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,634
More tricks?
After everything.

1491
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,768
How dare you defy us!

1492
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,474
Dare?

1493
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:23,186
How dare you, wicked sisters?

1494
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:24,770
No one defies Oz!

1495
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,312
Guards.
Destroy him.

1496
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:29,981
Forward!

1497
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:34,660
Attack!

1498
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:54,050
Guards!
Come back here, this instant!

1499
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,685
You thought you could kill me?

1500
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,472
Me?

1501
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:05,938
Thanks to you, I've shed my
mortal shell...

1502
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:10,025
and taken my true ethereal form.

1503
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:15,694
I'm now more powerful than ever!

1504
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,663
I'm invincible!

1505
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:22,200
Do you still doubt me?

1506
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:24,876
Doubt you?

1507
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,458
I defy you!

1508
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,723
Beautifully done, sister.

1509
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:47,186
Thank you.

1510
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,397
Hurry.

1511
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:50,894
You're taking too much time.

1512
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:52,821
Hold...

1513
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:56,734
hold...

1514
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:03,533
They think they're winning.

1515
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:05,617
Turn it back on!

1516
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,918
What?
Turn it back on!

1517
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,252
Oh, we got a loose wire.

1518
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:12,416
Oi!

1519
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,501
Screw's stuck.

1520
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:15,586
Hold on.

1521
01:51:16,793 --> 01:51:18,718
Use this.

1522
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:23,260
Got it.
Right.

1523
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:29,600
This can't be.

1524
01:51:31,268 --> 01:51:33,612
You cannot defeat me.

1525
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:35,940
I'm immortal!

1526
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:41,158
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!

1527
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,580
Now witness and observe...

1528
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:50,167
as I unleash the stars!

1529
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:53,085
Behold!

1530
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,353
So, those are fireworks.

1531
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:19,821
He is the Wizard.

1532
01:52:24,947 --> 01:52:26,540
We got Evanora.
She's on the run!

1533
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:28,040
All right!
We got one!

1534
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:29,785
Yeah!

1535
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:37,675
Come back here, you coward!

1536
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:38,752
Glinda.

1537
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:39,802
It's you.

1538
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:42,677
And you said that I was the
weak one!

1539
01:52:57,813 --> 01:52:58,939
I may not be able to kill you.

1540
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:00,820
Now.
Okay.

1541
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:03,907
But I can kill the one you love.

1542
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:07,447
Higher.

1543
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:09,078
I'm trying.

1544
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,056
Ready!
Fire!

1545
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:37,611
Begone, Wicked Witch!

1546
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:39,112
Begone!

1547
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:42,320
I hate you.

1548
01:53:48,113 --> 01:53:51,458
Begone, forevermore!

1549
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:55,249
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!

1550
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:56,667
Whoo-hoo!
Bully, bully!

1551
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,207
I knew we could do it.

1552
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,291
Right.

1553
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:02,420
Theodora, I know your wickedness...

1554
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:04,095
is not your doing.

1555
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:05,597
And should you ever again...

1556
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:07,766
find the goodness within you...

1557
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,976
you are welcome to return.

1558
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,856
Never!

1559
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:30,371
Not so fast.

1560
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,997
You and I aren't finished yet.

1561
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:39,131
You have the throne, Glinda.

1562
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,583
What more could you want?

1563
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,173
You can't give me that.

1564
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,140
You took what mattered most
to me.

1565
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:50,050
My father.

1566
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:54,225
I'll never again feel the
comfort of his kindness...

1567
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:56,641
but I'll settle for the freedom
of his people.

1568
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:58,813
Of course, Glinda.

1569
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:01,812
I think at the very least, they
deserve that.

1570
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,160
What's the matter, Glinda?

1571
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,000
Out of bubbles?

1572
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:20,502
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.

1573
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,542
What have you done?

1574
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:18,373
Look what you've done to me!

1575
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:22,127
Now everyone will see you as
you truly are.

1576
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:29,085
In the name of my father, I banish
you from the Emerald City...

1577
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:31,549
never to return.

1578
01:58:05,328 --> 01:58:07,126
Good people of Oz...

1579
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:11,510
I have here a missive from the
great Wizard, himself.

1580
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:15,005
"With little more than pluck
and belief...

1581
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,299
we made the impossible happen.

1582
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:22,267
As your Wizard, I hereby decree...

1583
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:25,023
the Land of Oz will forever
be free."

1584
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:47,041
Okay.

1585
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:48,876
Close the curtains, please.

1586
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:51,007
I'm trying.

1587
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,759
All right.

1588
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:56,220
Let's give it a try.

1589
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:58,681
Is it on?

1590
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:00,717
Is this thing working?

1591
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,719
It's wonderful.

1592
01:59:03,219 --> 01:59:04,562
Well.

1593
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:08,893
If it isn't the most beautiful
witch in all of Oz.

1594
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:11,561
Hi, Glinda.

1595
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:14,568
Hello, Wizard.

1596
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,823
Well done, Tinker.

1597
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:20,700
Your machine works beautifully.

1598
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,906
That's just workmanship.

1599
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:26,543
What you displayed was real
courage.

1600
01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:29,375
Your father would have been
more than proud.

1601
01:59:29,537 --> 01:59:32,711
He would have marveled at the
woman you've become.

1602
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:36,928
Zim Zallah Bim!

1603
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,431
Excellent work, everyone.

1604
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:42,183
Now we're ready, in case anyone...

1605
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:44,431
wants to speak with the Wizard.

1606
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,221
Now, remember...

1607
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:48,390
Oscar Diggs died...

1608
01:59:48,473 --> 01:59:50,976
so that the Wizard of Oz
could live.

1609
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:54,942
When those witches come back,
and they will come back...

1610
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:58,075
we're going to need everyone
to believe.

1611
01:59:58,233 --> 02:00:00,110
Your secret's safe with us.

1612
02:00:00,276 --> 02:00:01,493
Good.

1613
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:05,078
And now it's time for some
gifts.

1614
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:06,207
Gifts?

1615
02:00:06,282 --> 02:00:07,829
Gifts!

1616
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:10,128
Knuck, not now.

1617
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:12,418
What kind of gifts?

1618
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,332
Well, you know I can't grant
wishes...

1619
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,801
so this will have to do.

1620
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:19,846
First, the Master Tinker.

1621
02:00:20,004 --> 02:00:23,975
To the man who can make
anything, my lucky...

1622
02:00:25,093 --> 02:00:26,185
thingamajig.

1623
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:28,934
May it assist you in the
reconstruction...

1624
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:30,356
of the Emerald City.

1625
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:32,813
I will cherish this forever.

1626
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:35,312
Thank you for your faith in me.

1627
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:39,483
And now, for Sourpuss.

1628
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:41,321
My name is Knuck!

1629
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:44,112
Sourpuss, I grant you something...

1630
02:00:44,195 --> 02:00:45,492
you are in need of most.

1631
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:47,912
Something that, where I come
from...

1632
02:00:47,991 --> 02:00:49,618
can turn the saddest day...

1633
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:52,792
into a happy one.

1634
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,878
I don't want that.
It is yours.

1635
02:01:00,044 --> 02:01:02,467
Take it back.
I cannot.

1636
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:08,310
Knuck...

1637
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,347
you look nice with a smile.

1638
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:13,892
You do look nice.

1639
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,193
Thank you.

1640
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:21,241
Finley, you stood by my side...

1641
02:01:21,399 --> 02:01:25,370
when any monkey in his right
mind would have flown away.

1642
02:01:26,154 --> 02:01:29,203
To you, I give something that
I've never given to anyone.

1643
02:01:37,415 --> 02:01:39,588
My friendship.

1644
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:45,056
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.

1645
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:49,261
That's all I ever really
wanted.

1646
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,439
My turn, my turn.

1647
02:01:53,556 --> 02:01:54,773
Come here.

1648
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:02,449
I'm afraid I can't give you what
I know you want most of all.

1649
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:07,074
All I can offer you is this.

1650
02:02:10,448 --> 02:02:11,950
It's us.

1651
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:16,079
I know it's not the family
that you had in mind.

1652
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:17,589
It's perfect.

1653
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:23,131
Thank you.

1654
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:36,182
I wonder what you're gonna get.

1655
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:38,693
Oh, I don't need anything,
child.

1656
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:41,446
You better have something
for Glinda.

1657
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,106
But of course.

1658
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,943
I've saved the best for last.

1659
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,452
For you...

1660
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:55,994
a sight envied by all and seen
by none.

1661
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,161
You'll be astounded...

1662
02:02:57,245 --> 02:03:00,795
by what you find behind the
curtain.

1663
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:07,555
Oh, my!

1664
02:03:07,755 --> 02:03:09,382
It's very tight in here.

1665
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,176
It's nice, isn't it?

1666
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:13,974
I know what you're up to,
Wizard.

1667
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:17,232
What?
I'm just giving you a tour.

1668
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:20,147
And I want to thank you.

1669
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,896
For opening my eyes.

1670
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:24,814
And what do you see?

1671
02:03:28,484 --> 02:03:30,907
That I have everything I ever
wanted.

1672
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,537
For the record, I knew you had
it in you, all along.

1673
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:41,665
Greatness?

1674
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:44,668
No.
Better than that.

1675
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:46,587
Goodness.

1676
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,408
Now, Knuck.
