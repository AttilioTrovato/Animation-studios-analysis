1
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:17,056
Charles, you have finally lost
your senses.

2
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,924
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,125
For some. Gentlemen, the only
way to achieve the impossible...

4
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,098
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,965
That kind of thinking could
ruin you.

6
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,127
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,732
Imagine trading posts in Rangoon,
Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,113
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,816
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,821
I'm falling down a dark hole...

11
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,326
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,828
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,768
Well, there's a dodo bird...

14
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:05,849
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a
smiling cat.

15
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,635
I didn't know cats could smile.

16
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,935
Neither did I.

17
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,246
And there's a blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,979
Blue caterpillar.

19
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,779
Hmm.

20
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,550
Do you think I've gone round
the bend?

21
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:31,657
I'm afraid so. You're mad,
bonkers, off your head.

22
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,699
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

23
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,366
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

24
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,700
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up.

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,677
Like this.
Ow!

26
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,559
Must we go?

27
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,599
Doubt they'll notice if we
never arrive.

28
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,369
They will notice.

29
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,844
Where's your corset?

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,045
And no stockings.

31
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,418
I'm against them.

32
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,184
But you're not properly dressed.

33
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,749
Who's to say what is proper?

34
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,205
What if it was agreed that
"proper" was wearing...

35
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,043
a codfish on your head.
Would you wear it?

36
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,256
Alice.

37
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,162
To me, a corset is like a
codfish.

38
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,534
Please, not today.

39
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,629
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:50,669
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,205
Did you have bad dreams again?

42
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,681
Only one.

43
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,845
It's always the same, ever
since I can remember.

44
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,481
Do you think that's normal?

45
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,220
Don't most people have
different dreams?

46
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,555
I don't know.

47
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,905
There.
You're beautiful.

48
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,536
Now, can you manage a smile?

49
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,919
At last. We thought you'd
never arrive.

50
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,898
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

51
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,902
You do realize it's well
past 4:00.

52
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,600
Now everything will have to be
rushed through.

53
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,336
I am sorry.
Oh, never mind!

54
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,774
Forgive my wife.

55
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:02,885
She's been planning this affair
for over twenty years.

56
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,883
If only Charles were here...

57
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,080
My condolences.

58
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:12,922
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

59
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:18,093
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

60
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:21,626
Of course not. I'm pleased that
you purchased the company.

61
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,737
I was a fool for not investing
in his mad venture...

62
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,917
when I had the chance.

63
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,293
Charles thought so, too.

64
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,799
Hamish, do you ever tire
of quadrille?

65
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,860
On the contrary.
I find it invigorating.

66
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,266
Do I amuse you?

67
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,403
No.

68
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,605
I had a sudden vision of all
the ladies in trousers...

69
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,776
and the men wearing dresses.

70
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,751
I think you'll do best to keep
your visions to yourself.

71
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,255
When in doubt, remain silent.

72
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:25,664
Pardon us, sir. Miss Kingsleigh
is distracted today.

73
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,426
Where's your head?

74
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,438
I was wondering what it would
be like to fly.

75
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,564
Why would you spend your time...

76
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,836
thinking about such an
impossible thing?

77
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,207
Why wouldn't I?

78
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,543
My father said he sometimes
believed in six impossible things...

79
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:39,706
before breakfast.

80
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,810
Come along.

81
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:50,185
Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely ten minutes.

82
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,023
We have a secret to tell you.

83
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,122
If you're telling me, then it's
not much of a secret.

84
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,724
Perhaps we shouldn't.
We decided we should.

85
00:06:58,768 --> 00:06:59,894
If we tell her, she won't be
surprised.

86
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,905
Will you be surprised?
Not if you tell me.

87
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,736
But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

88
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:07,368
No, we don't.
In fact, we won't.

89
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,037
I wonder if your mother knows...

90
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,674
that you two swim naked in the
Havershims' pond.

91
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,116
You wouldn't.
Oh, but I would.

92
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,347
There's your mother, right now.

93
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,413
Hamish is going to ask for
your hand.

94
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,652
You've ruined the surprise!

95
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,427
I could strangle them!

96
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:29,625
Everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret.

97
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,326
Does everyone know?

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,393
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

99
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:39,500
Hamish will ask you under the
gazebo. When you say yes...

100
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,135
But I don't know if I want to
marry Hamish.

101
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,112
Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

102
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,664
You'll soon be twenty, Alice.

103
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,306
That pretty face won't last
forever.

104
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,586
You don't want to end up like
Aunt Imogene.

105
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:59,026
And you don't want to be a
burden on Mother, do you?

106
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,255
No.

107
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,594
So, you'll marry Hamish...

108
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,429
you will be as happy as I am
with Lowell...

109
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,957
and your life will be perfect.

110
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,625
It's already decided.

111
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,262
Alice, dear.

112
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,268
I'll leave you to it.

113
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,129
Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden...

114
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,773
just you and me?

115
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,415
Do you know what I've always
dreaded?

116
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,352
The decline of the aristocracy?

117
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:29,315
Ugly grandchildren.
But you're lovely.

118
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:32,850
You're bound to produce little...
Imbeciles!

119
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,395
The gardeners have planted
white roses...

120
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,693
when I specifically asked
for red.

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,961
You could always paint the
roses red.

122
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,128
What an odd thing to say.

123
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:45,637
You should know that my son has
extremely delicate digestion.

124
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,277
Did you see that?
See what?

125
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,975
It was a rabbit, I think.
Nasty things.

126
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,711
I do enjoy setting the dogs
on them.

127
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:59,881
If you serve Hamish the wrong
foods, he could get a blockage.

128
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,556
Did you see it that time?

129
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,922
See what?
The rabbit.

130
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,585
Don't shout.

131
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:09,927
Now, pay attention. Hamish said
you were easily distracted.

132
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,900
What was I saying?
Hamish has a blockage.

133
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:18,002
I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me.

134
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,712
Aunt Imogene.

135
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:29,807
I think I'm going mad. I keep
seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.

136
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,480
I can't be bothered with your
fancy rabbit now.

137
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,683
I'm waiting for my fiance.

138
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,289
You have a fiance?
Hmm.

139
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,393
There!
Did you see it?

140
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,924
He's a prince.

141
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:50,529
But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

142
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,938
It's tragic, isn't it?

143
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,437
Very.

144
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,684
Lowell?

145
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,556
Alice.
We were just...

146
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,723
Hattie's an old friend.

147
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,752
I can see you're very close.

148
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,830
Look, you won't mention this
to your sister, will you?

149
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,233
I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.

150
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,434
Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.

151
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:27,601
You don't want to ruin her
marriage, do you?

152
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:28,735
Me?

153
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:33,371
But I'm not the one who's
sneaking around behind her back.

154
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,640
There you are.

155
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,093
Alice Kingsleigh...

156
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,694
Hamish.

157
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,459
What is it?

158
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:56,266
You have a caterpillar on
your shoulder.

159
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,265
Ew.

160
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,598
Don't hurt it.

161
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,281
You'll want to wash that finger.

162
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,349
Alice Kingsleigh...

163
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,793
will you be my wife?

164
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,696
Well...

165
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,030
everyone expects me to...

166
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,298
and you're a lord.

167
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:39,073
My face won't last, and I don't
want to end up like...

168
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,782
But this is happening so
quickly. I...

169
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:48,780
I think I...

170
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,757
I think I...

171
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,931
I need a moment.

172
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,536
Hello.

173
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:46,491
It's only a dream.

174
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,634
You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.

175
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,441
You've brought the wrong Alice.

176
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,379
No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.

177
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,595
She's the wrong Alice.

178
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,658
Give her a chance.

179
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,901
Curiouser and curiouser.

180
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,777
I told you she's the right Alice.

181
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:58,308
I am not convinced.

182
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,911
How is that for gratitude?

183
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:03,447
I've been up there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next...

184
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,789
and I was almost eaten by other
animals.

185
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,158
Can you imagine?

186
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:11,996
They go about entirely unclothed,
and they do their shukm in public.

187
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,769
I had to avert my eyes.
Doesn't look anything like herself.

188
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,169
That's because she's the wrong
Alice.

189
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,003
If she was, she might be.
If she isn't, she ain't.

190
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,101
But if she were so, she would be.
But she isn't, nohow.

191
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:26,444
How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?

192
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,474
And who are you, if I might ask?

193
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:31,179
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's
Tweedledum.

194
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,278
Contrary-wise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

195
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,017
We should consult Absolem.

196
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,456
Exactly! Absolem will know
who she is.

197
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:39,983
I'll escort you.
Hey, it's not being your turn.

198
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,188
So unfair.

199
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,026
Hey, leave off!
Let go!

200
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,692
Are they always this way?
Family trait.

201
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,667
You can both escort her.

202
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:58,908
Who is this Absolem?
He's wise. He's absolute.

203
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,676
He's Absolem.

204
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,230
Who are you?

205
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:28,938
Absolem?

206
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:33,370
You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is...

207
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,514
who are you?
Alice.

208
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:39,076
We shall see.

209
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,547
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.

210
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:48,426
Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.

211
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:59,568
The Oraculum, being a calendrical
compendium of Underland.

212
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,913
It's a calendar.
Compendium.

213
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:10,907
It tells of each and every day
since the Beginning.

214
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:15,856
Today is Griblig Day, in the
time of the Red Queen.

215
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:21,128
Show her the Frabjous Day.

216
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:24,755
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the
day you slay the Jabberwocky.

217
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,494
Sorry?
Slay a what?

218
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,300
Oh, yeah. That being you, there,
with the Vorpal sword.

219
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,308
No other swords can kill the
Jabberwocky, nohow.

220
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,936
If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't
dead.

221
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:38,978
That's not me!

222
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,344
I know!

223
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:44,918
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?

224
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,148
Not hardly.

225
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,050
I told you.
Oh, dear.

226
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:54,995
I said so.
I said so.

227
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,655
Contrary-wise, you said she
might be.

228
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,631
No, you said she would be if
she was.

229
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,660
Little impostor. Pretending to
be Alice. She should be ashamed.

230
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:04,671
I was so certain of you.

231
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:07,765
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
the wrong Alice.

232
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,774
Wait, this is my dream.

233
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,674
I'm going to wake up now and
you'll all disappear.

234
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,351
That's odd. Pinching usually
does the trick.

235
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,695
I could stick you, if that
would help.

236
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:31,989
It might, actually. Thank you.
My pleasure.

237
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,693
Ow!

238
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,369
Bandersnatch!

239
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,319
Wait.

240
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:36,255
It's only a dream.
Nothing can hurt me.

241
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,028
What's she doing?

242
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,761
Can't hurt me... can't hurt me.

243
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,069
Run, you great lug!

244
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,776
This way, east to Queast.

245
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:00,371
No, south to Snud.

246
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:01,972
No. No, no.
This way.

247
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,498
Someone has stolen three of
my tarts!

248
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,577
Did you steal them?
No, Your Majesty.

249
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,546
Did you?
No, Your Majesty.

250
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,072
Did you steal them?
No, Your Majesty.

251
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,984
Did you steal my tarts?

252
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,648
No, Your Majesty.

253
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,022
Squimberry juice.

254
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,700
I was so hungry!

255
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,540
I didn't mean, to!
Off with his head!

256
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,429
My family!
Oh, please, please don't!

257
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,629
No! I have little ones to
look after!

258
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,228
Go to his house and collect
the little ones.

259
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,604
I love tadpoles on toast, almost
as much as I love caviar.

260
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,438
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,445
Drink!

262
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,850
Majesty?

263
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:27,761
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave,
where have you been lurking?

264
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,464
Majesty, I have found the
Oraculum.

265
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:40,035
That? Looks so ordinary for
an oracle.

266
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,770
Look here, on the Frabjous Day.

267
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,848
I'd know that tangled mess of
hair, anywhere.

268
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,507
Is it Alice?

269
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,647
I believe it is.

270
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,821
What's she doing with my
darling Jabberwocky?

271
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,121
She appears to be slaying it.

272
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:01,191
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?

273
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:05,995
Not yet, but it will happen
if we don't stop her.

274
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,468
Find Alice, Stayne.
Find her!

275
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:15,238
Find the scent of human girl
and earn your freedom.

276
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,708
For my wife and pups, as well?

277
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,782
Everyone will go home.

278
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:38,188
Dogs will believe anything.

279
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:15,731
It looks like you ran afoul of
something with wicked claws.

280
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,062
And I'm still dreaming.

281
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:20,074
What did that to you?

282
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,907
Banner, or Bander...
The Bandersnatch?

283
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:26,679
Well, I'd better have a look.

284
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,445
What are you doing?

285
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:32,249
It needs to be purified by someone
with evaporating skills...

286
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,484
or it will fester and putrefy.

287
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,327
I'd rather you didn't. I'll be
fine, as soon as I wake up.

288
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,296
At least let me bind it for you.

289
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:48,002
What do you call yourself?
Alice.

290
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:49,934
The Alice?

291
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:53,074
There's been some debate about
that.

292
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:55,912
I never get involved in politics.

293
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,835
You'd best be on your way.

294
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:02,440
What way? All I want to do is
wake up from this dream.

295
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,049
Fine.

296
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:07,245
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter...

297
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,728
but that's the end of it.

298
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:18,630
Coming?

299
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,209
Watch what you're doing!

300
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,741
Hey, watch it!

301
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,681
Okay, okay.
All right.

302
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,191
It's you.

303
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:21,821
No, it's not. McTwisp brought
us the wrong Alice.

304
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,524
It's the wrong Alice!

305
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:25,429
It's absolutely Alice.

306
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,435
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.

307
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,437
I'd know him anywhere.

308
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:35,371
Well, as you can see, we're
still having tea.

309
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,725
And it's all because I was
obliged to kill Time...

310
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,255
waiting for your return.

311
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:42,080
You're terribly late, you know.
Naughty.

312
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:46,245
Well, anyway, Time became quite
offended, and stopped altogether.

313
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,811
Not a tick ever since.

314
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:52,149
Cup.
Time can be funny in dreams.

315
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,160
Yes, yes, of course, but now
you're back, you see..

316
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,128
and we need to get on to the
Frabjous Day.

317
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,131
Frabjous Day!
Frabjous Day!

318
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:01,657
I'm investigating things that
begin with the letter "M."

319
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,904
Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?

320
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,770
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!

321
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,244
What?
Down with the Bloody Big Head...

322
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,770
the Bloody Big Head being the
Red Queen.

323
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,835
Come, come. We simply must
commence with the slaying...

324
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:16,983
and such.

325
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,762
Therefore, it is high time
to forgive and forget...

326
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,856
or forget and forgive, whichever
comes first...

327
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,920
or is, in any case, most
convenient. I'm waiting.

328
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,426
Hey. It's tick-tick... it's
ticking again!

329
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:30,955
All this talk of blood and
slaying has put me off my tea.

330
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,324
Ah.

331
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,332
The entire world is falling
to ruin...

332
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:39,113
and poor Chessur's off his tea.

333
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,607
What happened that day was not
my fault.

334
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,936
Oh, dear.

335
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,610
You ran out on them to save
your own skin...

336
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,685
you guddler's scuttish pilgar
lickering...

337
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:53,880
shukm juggling sluking urpal.

338
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,650
Bar lom muck egg brimni!

339
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,987
Hatter!

340
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,220
Thank you.
Meow.

341
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:01,854
I'm fine.

342
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,586
What's wrong with you, Tarrant?

343
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,631
You used to be the life of the
party.

344
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,459
You used to do the best Futterwacken
in all of Witzend.

345
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,801
Futter what?
Futterwacken!

346
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:11,964
It's a dance.

347
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,837
On the Frabjous Day...

348
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:19,472
when the White Queen once again
wears the crown...

349
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:25,475
on that day, I shall Futterwacken
vigorously.

350
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,820
Oh, no.

351
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,657
Uh-oh.

352
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:35,553
The Knave.

353
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,824
Goodbye.

354
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:39,026
Hide her!

355
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,761
Drink this, quickly.

356
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,729
Quick!
Hide her!

357
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,242
Oh, dear.

358
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:54,406
Aye.

359
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,275
Mind your head.

360
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,526
Let me out!

361
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,905
Well...

362
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,106
if it's not my favorite trio...

363
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,228
of lunatics.

364
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,037
Would you like to join us?

365
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,238
You're all late for tea!

366
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,218
We're looking for the girl
called Alice.

367
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,668
Speaking of the Queen...

368
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,124
here is a little song we used
to sing in her honor.

369
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,187
Twinkle Twinkle little bat...

370
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,393
how I wonder where you're at.

371
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,402
Up a...

372
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:52,600
If you're hiding her, you'll
lose your heads.

373
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,402
Already lost them.

374
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,141
All together now!

375
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,236
Up above the world you fly...

376
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,578
like a tea tray in the sky.

377
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:04,244
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle...

378
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:06,312
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

379
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:08,581
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

380
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,982
Oh!

381
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,659
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!

382
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,694
Would you like some cream?

383
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:29,763
A slice of Battenberg?
Follow the bloodhound.

384
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:32,041
Sugar?
Yes, please.

385
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,114
Oh, that's lovely.
You're all mad.

386
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,147
Thanks very much.

387
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,784
Pass the scones, please.

388
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:46,192
That one there.
Oh! Pardon.

389
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,319
Yes.
Yep, aye.

390
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:49,829
One moment.

391
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,702
There.
Yes.

392
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:01,738
Try this on, for size.

393
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:09,579
Oh.

394
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:14,716
I like it.

395
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:18,418
Good thing the bloodhound is
one of us, or you'd be...

396
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,153
What do they want with me?

397
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:22,219
Wait a minute, best take her
to the White Queen.

398
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:24,992
She'll be safe there.
Spoon...

399
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,101
Your carriage, milady.

400
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,597
The hat?
Of course.

401
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,537
Anyone can go by horse or rail,

402
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:38,671
but the absolute best way to travel
is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?

403
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:42,008
Oh, I love traveling by hat.

404
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:45,246
Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.

405
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,714
What do you mean?
Wait. Gae!

406
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:56,876
'Twas brillig, and the slithy
toves did gyre...

407
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:59,035
and gimble in the wabe...

408
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,868
all mimsy were the borogoves,
and the mome raths outgrabe."

409
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:04,734
Sorry, what was that?

410
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,198
What was what?

411
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,558
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of
flame...

412
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:15,105
jaws that bite and claws that
catch!

413
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:19,585
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch!

414
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:26,717
He took his Vorpal sword in hand.
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

415
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:30,008
He left it dead, and with its
head...

416
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:33,679
he went galumphing back."

417
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,734
It's all about you, you know.

418
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,149
I'm not slaying anything.

419
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:42,471
I don't slay, so put it out of
your mind.

420
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:47,676
Mind.

421
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,821
Wait!
You can't leave me here!

422
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,655
You don't slay.

423
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,323
Do you have any idea what the
Red Queen has done?

424
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,094
You don't slay.

425
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,695
I couldn't, if I wanted to.

426
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:14,634
You're not the same as you
were before.

427
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:20,038
You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.

428
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:22,506
My "muchness"?

429
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:25,484
In there.
Something's missing.

430
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,521
Tell me what Red Queen has done.

431
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:33,016
It's not a pretty story.

432
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:35,219
Tell me anyway.

433
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,638
It was here.

434
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:52,635
I was hatter to the White Queen
at the time.

435
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:57,147
Hightopp clan have always been
employed at court.

436
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:51,095
Hatter?
Hatter!

437
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,665
I'm fine.

438
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:55,864
Are you?

439
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,971
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.

440
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:03,834
What?

441
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:06,479
Oh!
Red Knights.

442
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,474
Go south, to Trotter's Bottom.

443
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:46,077
The White Queen's castle is
just beyond.

444
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:47,814
Hold on tightly.

445
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,890
Down with the bloody Red Queen!

446
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:57,417
You were supposed to lead them
away! The Hatter trusted you!

447
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,585
They have my wife and pups.

448
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,425
What's your name?
Bayard.

449
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,921
Sit!

450
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,294
Would your name be Alice, by
any chance?

451
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,066
Yes, but I'm not the one that
everyone's talking about.

452
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:15,735
The Hatter would not have given
himself up just for any Alice.

453
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,437
Where did they take him?

454
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:20,845
To the Red Queen's castle at
Salazen Grum.

455
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:22,939
We're going to rescue him.

456
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,450
That is not foretold.

457
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:28,251
I don't care. He wouldn't be
there, if it weren't for me.

458
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:30,950
The Frabjous Day is almost
upon us.

459
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:33,619
You must prepare to meet
the Jabberwocky.

460
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,594
From the moment I fell down
that rabbit hole...

461
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:38,462
I've been told what I must do
and who I must be.

462
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:40,617
I've been shrunk, stretched...

463
00:43:40,794 --> 00:43:42,907
scratched and stuffed into
a teapot.

464
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,307
I've been accused of being
Alice and of not being Alice...

465
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:47,145
but this is my dream.

466
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,968
I will decide where it goes
from here.

467
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:50,806
If you diverge from the path...

468
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:52,641
I make the path.

469
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:07,487
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.

470
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:56,070
There's only one way across.

471
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:04,579
Lost my muchness, have I?

472
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:50,157
Bayard!
The hat!

473
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,685
Your Majesty.

474
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,171
So sorry.

475
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:42,971
Splendid shot!

476
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:48,151
Where's my ball?
Page!

477
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:49,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,689
I want to help you.

479
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,324
Well, if it isn't the
wrong Alice.

480
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:05,528
What brings you here?
Mmm?

481
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,233
I've come to rescue the Hatter.

482
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:10,003
You're not rescuing anyone
being the size of a gerbil.

483
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:12,807
Well, do you have any more of that
cake that made me grow, before?

484
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:15,815
Upelkuchen?
Actually, I might have some left.

485
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,917
Not all of it!

486
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:30,693
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!

487
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,326
Page!

488
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:36,033
Oh, dear.

489
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,375
And what is this?

490
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,506
It... it's a "who," Majesty.
This is, um...

491
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:50,074
Um?

492
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,176
From Umbradge.

493
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,415
What happened to your clothes?

494
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:59,687
I outgrew them. I've been
growing an awful lot, lately.

495
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:04,561
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.

496
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:07,897
So I've come to you, hoping you
might understand what it's like.

497
00:48:07,934 --> 00:48:09,458
My dear girl...

498
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:13,097
anyone with a head that large,
is welcome in my court.

499
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,402
Someone find her some clothes!

500
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:18,241
Use the curtains if you must,
but clothe this, enormous girl.

501
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:29,416
I need a pig here!

502
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:38,225
I love a warm pig belly for
my aching feet.

503
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:40,995
Would you like one, Um?
No, thank you.

504
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:42,330
Sit!

505
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:45,966
Sit!

506
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:50,906
Go away.

507
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:57,107
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.

508
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,479
Fat boys!

509
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:04,254
Oh! There they are.
Aren't they adorable?

510
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,853
They have the oddest way of
speaking.

511
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:08,978
Speak, boys.
Amuse us.

512
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:10,925
Go on.

513
00:49:13,734 --> 00:49:14,928
No.

514
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:16,128
Speak!

515
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:20,506
Is that being...
No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.

516
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,337
Contrary-wise, I believe
it's so.

517
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:24,434
No, it ain't so, nohow!

518
00:49:27,814 --> 00:49:30,612
I love my fat boys.
Now, get out.

519
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,651
He did pinch me.
He did pinch me.

520
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:04,079
And who is this lovely creature?

521
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,514
Um, my new favorite.

522
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:10,386
Well, does she have a name?
Um.

523
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:13,654
I believe your name has slipped
the Queen's mind.

524
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:15,752
Her name is Um, idiot!

525
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:19,259
From Umbradge.

526
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:20,924
Any luck with the prisoner?

527
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:22,559
He's stubborn.

528
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:26,734
You're too soft.
Bring him!

529
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,197
We know Alice has returned
to Underland.

530
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:55,224
Do you know where she is?

531
00:50:57,204 --> 00:51:00,970
I've been considering things
that begin with the letter "M."

532
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:04,682
Moron... mutiny...

533
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:08,903
murder... mmmalice.

534
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:11,814
We're looking for an "A" word, now.
Where is Alice?

535
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:16,253
Who, that wee little boy?
I wouldn't know.

536
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:19,483
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?

537
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:22,759
Stop that.

538
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,893
What a regrettably large head
you have.

539
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:29,094
I should very much like to
hat it.

540
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:30,625
Hat it?
Yes.

541
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:33,535
I used to hat the White Queen,
you know.

542
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,438
Wasn't very much to work with,
poor dear.

543
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,272
Her head is so small.

544
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:40,011
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head.

545
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,445
But this...

546
00:51:42,148 --> 00:51:45,917
What I could do with this
monument...

547
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:49,175
this orb...

548
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:53,624
Nay, this magnificently heroic
globe.

549
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:58,959
What could you do?

550
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,631
Unbind him, Stayne.

551
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:05,865
How can he work if his hands
are bound?

552
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:17,373
Well, then, shall it be a bonnet,
or a boater?

553
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:20,480
Or something for the boudoir?

554
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:24,593
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap...

555
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:28,356
coif, snood, barboosh, pugree,
yarmulkecockle hat...

556
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:31,221
porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock,
bicorne, tricorne, bandeau...

557
00:52:31,321 --> 00:52:32,930
bongrace, fan-tail, night cap,
Garibaldi, fez...

558
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,894
Hatter!

559
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:35,492
Fez?

560
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,037
Leave us.

561
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,211
The trees seem sad.

562
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,257
Have you been speaking with them?
Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,384
Perhaps a bit more kindly.

564
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:06,659
Would you all excuse me for
a moment? Thank you.

565
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,878
What news, Bayard?
Alice has returned to Underland.

566
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:24,742
Where is she now?
In Salazen Grum.

567
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:29,379
Forgive me. I allowed her to
divert from her destined path.

568
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:30,601
No, no, no, no.

569
00:53:30,701 --> 00:53:34,855
But that is exactly where she
will find the Vorpal sword.

570
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,625
We have our champion.
Rest now. You've done well.

571
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,416
Have you seen a hat around here?

572
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,563
You must find Alice, Stayne.

573
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:15,659
Without the Jabberwocky...

574
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:19,000
my sister's followers will
surely rise against me.

575
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:23,137
Ugly little sister. Why do
they adore her, and not me?

576
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:25,619
I cannot fathom it.

577
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:30,553
You are far superior, in all
ways.

578
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:31,750
I know.

579
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:34,845
But Mirana can make anyone fall
in love with her.

580
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,082
Men, women...

581
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:43,091
even the furniture.

582
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:46,829
Even the King?

583
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:57,038
I had to do it.
He would have left me.

584
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:01,410
Majesty...

585
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:07,032
is it not better to be feared,
than loved?

586
00:55:08,188 --> 00:55:10,019
Not certain anymore.

587
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:14,988
Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.

588
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:17,128
I have you.

589
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,410
They're wonderful.

590
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:42,550
You must let me try one on.

591
00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:45,523
It is good to be working
at my trade again.

592
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,988
It's just a pity you have to
make them for her.

593
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,862
What is the hatter with me?

594
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,399
Hatter?

595
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,713
Hatter.

596
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:16,954
Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?

597
00:56:17,991 --> 00:56:19,788
I'm frightened, Alice.

598
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:23,187
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.

599
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,226
Have I gone mad?

600
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,270
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.

601
00:56:38,011 --> 00:56:41,811
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

602
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:50,749
Here.

603
00:56:54,194 --> 00:56:56,958
That's better.
You look yourself again.

604
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:01,829
Hat man!
Where are my hats?

605
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,596
I'm not a patient monarch!

606
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:06,196
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal
sword hidden in the castle.

607
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:08,137
The rabbit will help you.

608
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,439
Find it, Alice.
Take it to the White Queen.

609
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:13,411
We'll go to the White Queen
together.

610
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:17,280
Why is it you're always too
small, or too tall?

611
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:31,825
Tweedles.
Alice.

612
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:34,162
How do you do, again?
Where's the rabbit?

613
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:36,168
How is it you're being so
great big?

614
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,397
She ain't great big,
this is how she normal is.

615
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:40,632
I'm certain she's smaller
when we met.

616
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:44,473
No, she drank the pishsalver to
get through the door, recall it?

617
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,602
Oh, yeah.

618
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:47,545
Where's the rabbit?
Over theres.

619
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:59,450
What are you doing here?
I'm rescuing the Hatter.

620
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:00,959
I'm rescuing the Hatter.

621
00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:03,798
He told me that the Vorpal
sword is hidden in the castle.

622
00:58:03,857 --> 00:58:05,183
Help me find it.

623
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:07,732
I don't take orders from big,
clumsy, galumphing...

624
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,892
Shoo!

625
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,634
What is it, McTwisp?
I know where the sword is.

626
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:25,241
The sword's hidden inside.

627
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,650
Be careful, Alice.

628
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,026
I know that smell.

629
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:51,343
I'm not going in there.

630
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:54,779
Look what that thing did to
my arm.

631
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,544
Dear, oh, dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?

632
00:58:58,584 --> 00:59:00,609
It wasn't this bad before.

633
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:19,761
Hatter?
Where are you?

634
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,903
Hatter?

635
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:24,901
Mallymkun.

636
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:28,245
Do you still have the
Bandersnatch eye?

637
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:29,646
Right here.

638
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:32,715
I need it.
Come and get it.

639
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:36,449
Hey!
Give it back!

640
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:50,693
I like you, Um.

641
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:54,767
I like largeness.

642
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,771
Get away from me.

643
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:16,822
I have your eye.

644
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:30,861
No.

645
01:01:33,873 --> 01:01:34,931
Hmm.

646
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:37,271
You look stunning in that hat.

647
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:39,174
Yes.
Next.

648
01:01:43,082 --> 01:01:45,710
Your Majesty has never looked
better.

649
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:47,880
Hmm.
Another.

650
01:01:55,695 --> 01:01:56,753
Oh!

651
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:00,589
I don't wish to alarm you...

652
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,261
but it smells as though you might
have dropped something.

653
01:02:16,516 --> 01:02:19,076
Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.

654
01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:28,125
Stayne!

655
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,772
I suppose this makes us even now.

656
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:07,044
Um forced herself on me.

657
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:10,695
I told her my heart belongs to
you...

658
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:14,429
but she's obsessed with me.

659
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:20,700
Off with her head!

660
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:25,870
Stand back, Mallymkun.

661
01:04:25,911 --> 01:04:27,242
How's this for muchness?

662
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:29,008
No, no! It mustn't be used
for anything...

663
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:34,084
Arrest that girl for unlawful
seduction!

664
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:36,184
Hatter!

665
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,422
Take it to the White Queen.
I'm not leaving without you.

666
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,687
Go!

667
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,847
Run, Alice!

668
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:14,253
Alice?

669
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:16,587
Run!

670
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:23,666
Seize her.

671
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:36,575
Alice.

672
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:40,115
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?

673
01:05:40,352 --> 01:05:43,586
Well, it has been a long time...

674
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,720
and you were such a little tyke,
then.

675
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:50,293
Give me the sword.
Stay back.

676
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,456
The Queen will be so pleased.

677
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:56,298
She will take great pleasure
in taking off your head.

678
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:20,653
Oh, Alice!
Bayard! To Marmoreal.

679
01:06:29,034 --> 01:06:32,162
Majesty, Alice has escaped...

680
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,870
on the Bandersnatch...

681
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:44,009
with the Vorpal sword.

682
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:49,417
How could you let this happen?

683
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:55,989
I may have underestimated her,
but we have her conspirators...

684
01:06:56,395 --> 01:07:00,525
the Hatter and a dormouse.

685
01:07:01,233 --> 01:07:02,564
Off with their heads!

686
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,551
Welcome to Marmoreal.

687
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:25,750
I believe this belongs to you.

688
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:34,359
Mmm.

689
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,739
The Vorpal sword is home again.

690
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:46,110
The armor is complete.

691
01:07:49,448 --> 01:07:52,576
Now all we need is a champion.

692
01:07:54,386 --> 01:07:56,877
You're a little taller than
I thought you'd be.

693
01:07:56,922 --> 01:07:59,288
Blame it on too much upelkuchen.

694
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:00,620
Oh.

695
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,149
Come with me.

696
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,258
Is the March Hare here?

697
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:12,793
You're late for your soup, you
wee besom.

698
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:14,601
You're late for your soup.
Could use some salt.

699
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,801
Come here, you!

700
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:19,637
Give me that here.
Choppy, chop, chop, chop.

701
01:08:19,712 --> 01:08:21,441
Leek and potato. Yes.
That would be...

702
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:26,440
Pishsalver.
Let me think.

703
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:29,577
A pinch of worm fat...

704
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:33,448
urine of the horsefly...

705
01:08:35,494 --> 01:08:37,189
buttered fingers.

706
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:47,537
My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.

707
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:52,370
Tell me, how does she seem
to you?

708
01:08:52,444 --> 01:08:54,139
Perfectly horrid.

709
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:59,808
And her head?
Bulbous.

710
01:09:00,853 --> 01:09:03,981
I think she may have some kind
of growth, in there...

711
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:06,355
something pressing on her brain.

712
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,030
Three coins from a dead man's
pocket...

713
01:09:09,155 --> 01:09:11,939
two teaspoons of wishful thinking.

714
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:15,732
You can't imagine the things
that go on in that place.

715
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:17,166
Oh, yes, I can.

716
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:23,074
But when a champion steps forth
to slay the Jabberwocky...

717
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:25,542
the people will rise against her.

718
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,175
That should do it.

719
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:34,711
Blow.

720
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,762
Feel better?
Much, thank you.

721
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:54,203
There's someone here who would
like to speak with you.

722
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:17,361
Absolem?
Who are you?

723
01:10:21,934 --> 01:10:26,371
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.

724
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:29,864
How do you know?
You said so yourself.

725
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:32,274
I said you were not hardly
Alice...

726
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:33,902
but you're much more her, now.

727
01:10:33,946 --> 01:10:36,881
In fact, you're almost Alice.

728
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,915
Even so,

729
01:10:38,951 --> 01:10:41,886
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky
if my life depended on it.

730
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:43,449
It will.

731
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:47,184
So, I suggest you keep the
Vorpal sword on hand...

732
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:49,989
when the Frabjous Day arrives.

733
01:10:50,062 --> 01:10:51,757
You seem so real.

734
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:55,757
Sometimes I forget that this
is all a dream.

735
01:10:58,437 --> 01:11:00,428
Will you stop doing that?

736
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:22,126
I've always admired that hat.

737
01:11:23,495 --> 01:11:25,258
Hello, Chess.

738
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:28,027
Since you won't be needing it
anymore...

739
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:32,302
would you consider bequeathing
it to me?

740
01:11:32,337 --> 01:11:35,765
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.

741
01:11:35,865 --> 01:11:38,712
I would like to look my best,
you know.

742
01:11:38,812 --> 01:11:40,638
It is a pity about all this.

743
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:43,876
I was looking forward to seeing
you, Futterwacken.

744
01:11:44,616 --> 01:11:46,948
I was rather good at it, was
I not?

745
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:49,977
I really do love that hat.

746
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:54,324
I would wear it to all the
finest occasions.

747
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:04,195
I love a morning execution,
don't you?

748
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:06,863
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:52,279
I'd like to keep it on.
Suit yourself.

750
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:55,453
As long as I can get
at your neck.

751
01:12:57,389 --> 01:12:59,220
I'm right behind you.

752
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,118
Off with his head!

753
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:02,850
I can't watch.

754
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:38,295
Good morning, everyone.

755
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,221
Chess, you dog.

756
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:44,761
Madam...

757
01:13:44,803 --> 01:13:46,464
you are being heinously
bamboozled...

758
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:50,167
by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with.

759
01:13:54,646 --> 01:13:55,738
What is that?

760
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,079
I'm not the only one, Majesty.
Look!

761
01:13:58,116 --> 01:14:00,107
A counterfeit nose.
You should be ashamed.

762
01:14:00,152 --> 01:14:03,713
Me? What about that big belly
you're so proud of?

763
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:10,344
Liars!

764
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:12,176
Cheats!

765
01:14:12,276 --> 01:14:13,974
Falsifiers!

766
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:15,463
Off with their heads!

767
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:23,536
The abused and enslaved in
the Red Queen's court...

768
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:26,601
all of you stand up and fight!

769
01:14:27,246 --> 01:14:29,840
Rise up against the bloody
Red Queen.

770
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:35,084
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!

771
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,718
Release the Jubjub Bird!

772
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:10,116
You're right, Stayne...

773
01:15:10,656 --> 01:15:13,454
it is far better to be feared,
than loved.

774
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:19,496
Come, boys, quickly, quickly!
Come on!

775
01:15:23,335 --> 01:15:24,495
Hatter!

776
01:15:24,536 --> 01:15:27,369
Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on, come on.

777
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:31,822
Prepare the Jabberwocky
for battle.

778
01:15:32,036 --> 01:15:35,449
We're going to visit my little
sister.

779
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:47,017
I had hoped to have a champion,
by now.

780
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:51,927
Why don't you slay the
Jabberwocky yourself?

781
01:15:51,997 --> 01:15:53,692
You must have the power.

782
01:15:53,732 --> 01:15:56,963
It is against my vows to harm
any living creature.

783
01:16:06,278 --> 01:16:07,870
We have company.

784
01:16:17,723 --> 01:16:19,486
Have a look, Bayard.

785
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:23,758
Bielle.

786
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:33,388
I'm so happy to see you.

787
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:34,833
I thought they were going to...
So did I.

788
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:37,920
But they didn't, and now here
I am, still in one piece.

789
01:16:38,055 --> 01:16:40,634
And I'm rather glad about that
now that I'm seeing you again.

790
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:42,441
I would have regretted not
seeing you again...

791
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:45,450
especially now that you're you,
and the proper size.

792
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:47,441
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.

793
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:49,410
It's a right proper Alice size!
Hatter?

794
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:54,185
Size... Fez... I'm fine.
Where's your hat?

795
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:58,793
Mmm.

796
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:02,593
Cheshire.
How's the arm, love?

797
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:04,796
All healed.

798
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:07,498
Goodbye, sweet hat.

799
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:31,186
Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?

800
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:36,123
Let me think about it.

801
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:40,063
You know what tomorrow is,
don't you?

802
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:45,832
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?

803
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:48,740
Wish I'd wake up.

804
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:53,489
Still believe this is a dream,
do you?

805
01:17:53,589 --> 01:17:55,346
Of course.

806
01:17:55,387 --> 01:17:58,015
This has all come from my
own mind.

807
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:03,928
Which would mean that I'm
not real.

808
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:12,160
Afraid so. You're just a figment
of my imagination.

809
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:16,201
I would dream up someone who's
half-mad.

810
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:20,672
Yes, yes. But you would have
to be half-mad to dream me up.

811
01:18:24,316 --> 01:18:25,977
I must be, then.

812
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:33,153
I'll miss you when I wake up.

813
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:52,276
Who will step forth to be champion
for the White Queen?

814
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:55,543
That would be I.

815
01:18:57,182 --> 01:19:02,085
You have very poor evaporating
skills. I should be the one.

816
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,312
I'll do it.

817
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:07,919
No, me.
No, me.

818
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,205
No other slayer, nohow.

819
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:29,713
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.

820
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,350
Alice, you cannot live your
life to please others.

821
01:19:40,959 --> 01:19:43,223
The choice must be yours...

822
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,157
because when you step out to
face that creature...

823
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,725
you will step out alone.

824
01:20:24,803 --> 01:20:27,966
Nothing was ever accomplished
with tears.

825
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:31,272
Absolem?

826
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,442
Why are you upside down?

827
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:37,004
I've come to the end of this
life.

828
01:20:37,882 --> 01:20:41,477
You're going to die?
Transform.

829
01:20:41,519 --> 01:20:45,080
Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.

830
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:48,075
I can't help you, if you don't
even know who you are...

831
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:50,685
stupid girl.
I'm not stupid!

832
01:20:51,463 --> 01:20:53,988
My name is Alice.
I live in London.

833
01:20:54,032 --> 01:20:57,024
I have a mother named Helen,
and a sister named Margaret.

834
01:20:57,068 --> 01:20:59,229
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.

835
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:01,363
He had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world...

836
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,431
and nothing ever stopped him.

837
01:21:03,508 --> 01:21:06,306
I'm his daughter.
I'm Alice Kingsleigh.

838
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:10,076
Alice, at last.

839
01:21:10,749 --> 01:21:12,774
You were just as dim-witted
the first time you were here.

840
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:15,615
You called it "Wonderland,"
as I recall.

841
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,923
Wonderland.

842
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:24,753
What do you call yourself?
Alice.

843
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:26,524
The Alice?

844
01:21:26,564 --> 01:21:29,032
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter...

845
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:30,242
but that's the end of it.

846
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:31,859
She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.

847
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:34,371
Ah, Thackery, not at the table,
please.

848
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:35,600
Have some tea.

849
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:38,199
You're not Absolem.
I'm Absolem, stupid girl.

850
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:41,871
What is this?
I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.

851
01:21:41,913 --> 01:21:44,404
Contrary-wise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

852
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:46,747
You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.

853
01:21:46,785 --> 01:21:48,719
Curiouser and curiouser.

854
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:52,549
It wasn't a dream at all, it
was a memory.

855
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:57,417
This place is real, and so are
you and so is the Hatter.

856
01:21:57,696 --> 01:22:00,130
And the Jabberwocky.

857
01:22:01,032 --> 01:22:04,433
Remember, the Vorpal sword
knows what it wants.

858
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:07,302
All you have to do is hold
on to it.

859
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:15,337
Fairfarren, Alice. Perhaps I
will see you in another life.

860
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:19,861
Hello, Iracebeth.
Hello, Mirana.

861
01:24:23,174 --> 01:24:28,237
On this, the Frabjous Day,
the Queens Red and White...

862
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:32,978
shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf.

863
01:24:34,185 --> 01:24:37,450
Oh, Racie.
We don't have to fight.

864
01:24:39,924 --> 01:24:41,983
I know what you're doing.

865
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:45,423
You think you can blink those
pretty little eyes...

866
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:48,489
and I'll melt, just like Mummy
and Daddy did.

867
01:24:50,568 --> 01:24:51,796
Please.

868
01:24:53,304 --> 01:24:58,332
No! It is my crown!
I am the eldest!

869
01:24:59,043 --> 01:25:00,533
Jabberwocky!

870
01:25:48,026 --> 01:25:49,823
This is impossible.

871
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:52,720
Only if you believe it is.

872
01:25:58,603 --> 01:26:03,631
Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast.

873
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:06,770
That is an excellent practice.

874
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,708
However, just at the moment...

875
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:16,151
you really might want to focus
on the Jabberwocky.

876
01:26:22,393 --> 01:26:24,691
Where's your champion, Sister?

877
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:27,324
Here.

878
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:30,999
Hello, Um.

879
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,211
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.

880
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:55,918
One, there's a potion that can
make you shrink.

881
01:26:59,497 --> 01:27:02,227
Two, and a cake that can make
you grow.

882
01:27:02,767 --> 01:27:05,834
So, my old foe...

883
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:10,088
we meet on the battlefield,
once again.

884
01:27:10,508 --> 01:27:11,907
We've never met.

885
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:14,343
Not you, insignificant bearer.

886
01:27:15,213 --> 01:27:19,741
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.

887
01:27:21,052 --> 01:27:22,952
That's enough chatter.

888
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:32,455
Three, animals can talk.

889
01:27:38,202 --> 01:27:39,669
Four, Alice...

890
01:27:42,073 --> 01:27:43,938
cats can disappear.

891
01:27:46,444 --> 01:27:47,604
Five...

892
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:53,172
there's a place called Wonderland.

893
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,178
Six...

894
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:57,921
I can slay the Jabberwocky.

895
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:26,383
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!

896
01:30:53,164 --> 01:30:54,961
Off with your head!

897
01:31:27,598 --> 01:31:29,623
Kill her!

898
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:32,329
We follow you no more, Bloody
Big Head.

899
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:35,030
How dare you?
Off with his head!

900
01:32:17,048 --> 01:32:21,593
Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes
against Underland are worthy...

901
01:32:21,693 --> 01:32:23,489
of death.

902
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:27,949
However, that is against
my vows...

903
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,694
therefore, you are banished
to the Outlands.

904
01:32:32,163 --> 01:32:36,122
No one is to show you any kindness,
or ever speak a word to you.

905
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:42,003
You will not have a friend in
the world.

906
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:48,078
Majesty, I hope you bear me
no ill will.

907
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:54,344
Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne...

908
01:32:54,418 --> 01:32:56,409
you are to join Iracebeth
in banishment...

909
01:32:56,454 --> 01:32:59,252
from this day, until the end
of Underland.

910
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:04,321
At least we have each other.

911
01:33:17,408 --> 01:33:21,811
Majesty, please! Kill me!
Please!

912
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:24,811
But I do not owe you a kindness.

913
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,818
Take off my head!
He tried to kill me.

914
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:31,117
Majesty! Please! Please!
He tried to kill me!

915
01:33:31,155 --> 01:33:33,123
I offer you my head!
He tried to kill me!

916
01:33:33,157 --> 01:33:36,456
Oh, the Frabjous Day!
Callou! Callay!

917
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,128
What is he doing?
Futterwacken.

918
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:37,551
Blood of the Jabberwocky. You
have our everlasting gratitude.

919
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,482
And for your efforts on our
behalf...

920
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:48,095
Will this take me home?
If that is what you choose.

921
01:35:14,558 --> 01:35:16,150
You could stay.

922
01:35:19,497 --> 01:35:23,433
What an idea.
A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.

923
01:35:29,406 --> 01:35:30,873
But I can't.

924
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:36,337
There are questions I have to
answer, things I have to do.

925
01:35:44,955 --> 01:35:47,355
Be back again before you know it.

926
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,858
You won't remember me.

927
01:35:51,629 --> 01:35:54,359
Of course I will.
How could I forget?

928
01:35:59,169 --> 01:36:03,128
Hatter, why is a raven like
a writing desk?

929
01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:07,706
I haven't the slightest idea.

930
01:36:12,883 --> 01:36:14,646
Fairfarren, Alice.

931
01:37:01,765 --> 01:37:04,791
She left me standing there
without an answer.

932
01:37:04,868 --> 01:37:07,029
A case of nerves, no doubt.

933
01:37:10,007 --> 01:37:12,407
Alice.
Good Lord.

934
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:15,541
Are you all right?
What happened to you?

935
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:18,639
I fell down a hole and hit
my head.

936
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,562
I'm sorry, Hamish.
I can't marry you.

937
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:24,670
You're not the right man for me.

938
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,914
And there's that trouble with
your digestion.

939
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:31,711
I love you, Margaret, but this
is my life.

940
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:34,523
I'll decide what to do with it.

941
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:40,326
You're lucky to have my sister
for your wife, Lowell...

942
01:37:40,404 --> 01:37:44,135
and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

943
01:37:46,644 --> 01:37:49,135
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.

944
01:37:49,213 --> 01:37:52,410
You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.

945
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,948
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

946
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:02,153
Don't worry, Mother...

947
01:38:02,226 --> 01:38:05,195
I'll find something useful to
do with my life.

948
01:38:07,297 --> 01:38:10,789
You two remind me of some
funny boys I met in a dream.

949
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:16,005
You've left me out.
No, I haven't, sir.

950
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,502
You and I have business to
discuss.

951
01:38:19,576 --> 01:38:21,771
Shall we speak in the study?

952
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:30,680
Oh.
And one more thing.

953
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:41,945
My father told me he planned
to expand his trade route...

954
01:38:42,045 --> 01:38:43,939
to Sumatra and Borneo.

955
01:38:43,974 --> 01:38:46,361
But I don't think he was looking
far enough.

956
01:38:46,403 --> 01:38:49,001
Why not go all the way to China?

957
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:52,299
It's vast, the culture is rich...

958
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:54,717
and we have a foothold in Hong
Kong.

959
01:38:54,817 --> 01:38:58,206
To be the first to trade with
China, can you imagine it?

960
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,845
You know, if anybody else had
said that to me...

961
01:39:01,885 --> 01:39:04,820
I'd say, "You've lost your
senses".

962
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,217
But I've seen that look, before.

963
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:11,851
Well, as you're not going to be
my daughter-in-law...

964
01:39:11,895 --> 01:39:15,854
perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.

965
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,400
Hello, Absolem.
