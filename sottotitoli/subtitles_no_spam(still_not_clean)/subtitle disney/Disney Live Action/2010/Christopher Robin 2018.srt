- I'd like them to reconsider...

155

- Tanners union dispute, sir.

- Waiting on fabric, sir.

<i><font color=#FF551>- MATTHEW:</font> Mr. Robin?
- Yes.</i>

162
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:29,058
If we replace the second inner
bevel with beechwood...

163
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,436
we can increase buoyancy by four percent.

164
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:34,689

- And cost?

But, I promised my wife and daughter
I'd take them away this weekend, sir.

Nothing comes from nothing.

But I need your help.

618
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,463
- I've lost all of my friends.
- Perhaps they're back now...

619
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,249
and you can tell them all
about your adventures.

620
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:07,088

- Off you go then.

621

Goodbye, Christopher.

622

Goodbye, Pooh.

623
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:35,858
What're you doing, Pooh?

624
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:40,036
Sometimes when I'm going
somewhere and I wait...

625
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:44,842
- a somewhere comes to me.
- Right. Well...

626
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:48,387
- Good luck with everything.
- I should need good luck.

627

- Right. Well, goodbye.

<font color=#FF551>- POOH:</font> I don't believe so.

- Well, I was hoping you would know.

646

- But you're Christopher Robin.
- Ah, right. Yes.

Well, the thing is to do this systematically.

649
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:29,985
- Oh, follow the simple honey bee.
- No, Pooh.

650
00:47:29,986 --> 00:47:34,327
The key is to head in just one direction to
avoid getting lost. Especially in all this fog.

651
00:47:34,328 --> 00:47:39,432
I always get to where I'm going by walking

00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,912

aren't real. Now, come on.

666
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:31,576
Christopher? What do you do?

667
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:34,620
I'm the Efficiency Manager at a luggage company.

668
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:38,849
- You must have many friends there.
- There's lots of people who rely on me.

669
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,411
- <i>So, yes.</i>
- No, I don't think of them as friends.

670
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:45,256
That makes it harder if I have to let them go.

671
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:50,294
- Where will they go?
- I don't know, Pooh. I... I don't know.

672
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,324
Did you let me go?

673
00:48:58,604 --> 00:49:01,680
I suppose I did.

674
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,076
Come on, Pooh.

675
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:19,039
- Oh. What is that?
- It's a compass, from the war.

676
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,975
I still keep it with me.

677
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:27,557
- May I see the compass?
- Yes, I suppose so.

678
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:30,726
Oh.

679
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:37,661
- Shall we follow this very handy arrow?
- Well, that's a very good idea. No, wait, Pooh.

680
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:42,697
- Keep us headed north. North.
- Oh, north.

681
00:49:42,698 --> 00:49:45,774
Yes, there's an "N" in front of it, for "north".

686
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:01,332
- Let me look.
- You haven't been looking?

687
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:07,338
- Not since I started following these footsteps.
- Pooh, they're our footsteps!

688
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:10,601
Oh, we've just been going around
in a great, big circle.

689
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:13,327
What's the matter with you? All you
had to do was follow the compass!

690
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:16,363
Oh, but it led us to the Heffalumps
and the Woozles.

Woozles, do you hear?

Oh, I should never have trusted you with it!

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

694
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:30,912
I'll put it back in the holder
of important things.

695
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:36,558
Oh, my papers! They're irreplaceable!
I shall never remember all this!

696
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,929
No, Pooh, you're right. You are
a bear of very little brain.

697
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,832
Do you know what'll happen if I
lose one single sheet of this?

698
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,524
- Winslow will eat me for breakfast.
- A Woozle will eat you for breakfast?

699
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:51,682
- Yes, a great big Woozle will gobble me up.
- That doesn't sound like fun.

700
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:53,692
That's the real world for you.

701
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:58,864
Oh, Pooh, there's more to life
than just balloons and honey.

702
00:50:58,865 --> 00:51:01,100
- Are you sure?
- Silly bear.

703
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,227
I don't know why you came back.

It's your fellow Heffalumps, calling you home.

Come on, Eeyore. Let's get
to the bottom of this.

771
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:22,871

we should investigate.

No sign of Owl though, either.

- Looks like a disaster. Why wasn't I invited?

broke off when the house fell out of the tree...

797

a Heffalump and panicked.

- Oh, so glad we're all back together again.

919
01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:08,869
- But where's Pooh?
- Oh, yes, of course, Piglet. Well, Pooh...

920
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:10,620
I lost him.

921
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:11,913
- He's lost him?
<font color=#FF551>- KANGA:</font> Oh, dear.

922
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:15,540
- Where exactly did you lose him?
- Concentrate. Let's all work together, please.

923
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,286
Well, I'll get searching. Tiggers
are the best searchers.

924
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:21,192
You're Christopher Robin. You'll find him.

925
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:26,519
- Somewhere.
- Somewhere. Well, that's it, Roo.

926
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,097
Pooh's waiting for Somewhere to find him.

927
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:32,576

Hello, Pooh.

Hello, Christopher Robin.

934
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:19,147
I'm so sorry, Pooh. I'm so terribly sorry.
I should never have shouted at you.

935
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:25,403
- Well, I am a bear of very little brain.
<font color=#FF551>- CHRISTOPHER:</font> No, Pooh.

936
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:30,075
You are, I think, a bear of very big heart.

<font color=#FF551>POOH:</font> Hmm.

938

You'll be happy to hear that
everyone's safe and sound.

939
01:04:35,573 --> 01:04:39,709
I saved them from a Heffalump
which was, in fact, well, me.

940
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,521
- And Owl's weather vane.
<font color=#FF551>- POOH:</font> I'm sorry I wasn't there.

941
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:50,479
But I am rather glad that I
was here. Waiting for you.

942
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,532
Thank you for waiting for me, Pooh.

943
01:04:54,533 --> 01:05:00,188
It's always a sunny day, when Christopher
Robin comes to play.

<font color=#FF551>CHRISTOPHER:</font> Hmm.

945
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,960
Not so sure about that.

- I'm not who I used to be.
<font color=#FF551>- POOH:</font> Of course you are. You're our friend.

Look at how you saved everybody
today. You are our hero.

948
01:05:18,946 --> 01:05:21,968
Well, I'm not a hero, Pooh.

949
01:05:23,028 --> 01:05:25,513
I'm lost.

950
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:30,151
But I found you. Didn't I?

- Well, yes, of course it's today.

960
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:31,905

I'm meant to be in the office in...

961
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,957

Owl, you've been up all night.

964
01:06:37,236 --> 01:06:39,037
- <i>You should've squawked!
<font color=#FF551>- OWL:</font> Don't you worry.</i>

965
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:45,034
As my old Uncle Orville used to say:
"Worry is the way to concern".

966
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:49,689
- Or is it, "Concern is the way to confusion?"
<i><font color=#FF551>- RABBIT:</font> You're the way to confusion.</i>

967
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,266
We've got all your belongings
all nice and dried out.

968
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:56,012
- Tigger helped me get you all sorted.
- I sure did. <font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font>

969
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,555
- Here you go.
<i><font color=#FF551>- CHRISTOPHER:</font> Oh, thanks.</i>

970
01:06:57,556 --> 01:07:00,216
I could never have forgotten
my case of important things.

971
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,261
I'm sorry I have to go, but I've
already stayed far too long.

972
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:05,480
Oh, Pooh, you should keep this.

973
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:09,100
That way, if you lose someone, you'll
be able to find them again.

974
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:14,005
Thank you, Christopher Robin.
Oh, and you should take this.

975
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:17,609
- For Madeline.
<font color=#FF551>- ROO:</font> What's a Madeline?

976
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:21,387
Is it more important than your
case of important things?

977
01:07:21,388 --> 01:07:27,502
Madeline's my daughter, so, yes, of course.
Absolutely. She means the world to me.

978
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:30,655
Then why isn't she with you?

979
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,941
<i><font color=#FF551>POOH:</font> Well, uh...</i>

980

- Oh...

981
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,403
- the poor dear.
<i><font color=#FF551>- CHRISTOPHER:</font> No, no. She likes...</i>

Well, you better go then.

There... there's a good explanation
for all of this.

1005
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:14,951
I'd love to hear it.

1006
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:18,904
Well, I was, uh... eh...

1007
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:23,501
Well, it's a little complicated. I
suppose I... I can't right now.

1008
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:28,172
I was thinking that Madeline
and I should stay longer.

- I do.

- Are you sure he ever was one?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Well, I'm pretty sure.

He's having a bit of a hard time of it.

Then he should have come and
spent the weekend with us.

- We would've made him feel better.
- It's not always that simple.

He will come back to us, though.

- Boarding school starts soon.

How exactly do I do that?

01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,395
Go explore. I'm sure your father found loads
of things to play with around here when...

1036
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:41,556

by. Not the flippity-flop papers.

Luggage, Mr. Winslow! You employ thousands
of people all across your companies...

- and if you were to give them all paid holidays
- Paid holidays?

But now look.

If we all could afford to go on holiday...

1409
01:33:30,789 --> 01:33:35,145
here... well there would be hundreds
and thousands of ordinary people...

1410
01:33:35,146 --> 01:33:38,666
going to the countryside, to
the lakes, and beaches...

1411
01:33:38,667 --> 01:33:40,799
all with their Winslow Luggage.

1412
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,503
And if we made the prices cheaper then
everybody could afford to buy them.

1413

Oh, great.

1419

01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:14,614
Yesterday, when it was tomorrow
it was too much day for me.

1489
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:18,443
Silly old bear.

1496
01:40:17,888 --> 01:40:21,416

1497
01:40:21,417 --> 01:40:24,977

1508
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:08,980
I think things are changing.

1509
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:11,949
And not for the worse.

1510
