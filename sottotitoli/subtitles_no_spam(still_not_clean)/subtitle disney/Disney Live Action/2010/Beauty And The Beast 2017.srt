Hmm.

709
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:31,757
Oh.

710
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,211
Mama! There's a girl in the castle!

711
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,918
Yes, Chip, we know!

712
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,114
What kind of tea
does she like?

713
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,924
Herbal, oolong...

714
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,255
chamomile...

715
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,433
I'm too excited!

716
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,267
Slow down before
you break your handle.

717
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,768
- Heads up, Mrs. Potts.
- Oh.

- Be calm. Let me do the talking.

721
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,459
You're making her dinner!

722
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,590
Well, we thought you might
appreciate the company.

723
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,839
Master, I just want
to assure you...

724
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,799
that I had no part
in this hopeless plan.

725
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,963
Preparing a dinner, designing
a gown for her, giving her...

726
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,464
a suite in the east wing!

727
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,349
You gave her a bedroom?

728
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,967
No, no, no.
He gave her a bedroom.

729
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,260
This is true.

730
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,291
But if this girl is the one
who can break the spell...

731
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,023
then maybe you could start
by using dinner to charm her.

732
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,355
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

733
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,714
That's the most
ridiculous idea...

734
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,820
I've ever heard.
Charm the prisoner!

735
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,652
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

736
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,776
we become less human.

737
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,199
She's the daughter
of a common thief.

738
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,975
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

739
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,831
Oh, you can't judge people...

740
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,159
by who their father is,
now can you?

741
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,215
You'll join me for dinner.

742
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,674
That's not a request.

743
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,176
Gently, Master.

744
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,799
The girl lost her father...

745
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,675
and her freedom in one day.

746
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,512
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scared to death.

747
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,847
MRS. POTTS: Exactly.

748
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,190
Just a minute.

749
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,735
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

750
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,820
- Kind!
- Charming!

751
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,696
Sweet!

752
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,198
And when she opens the door,

753
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,077
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

754
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,494
Come, come. Show me the smile.

755
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,205
- Oh, <i>mon dieu!</i>
- Oh, no.

756
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,050
Will you join me for dinner?

757
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,346
You've taken me
as your prisoner

758
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,720
and now you want
to have dinner with me?

759
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,555
Are you insane?

760
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,391

- Uh-oh. He's losing it.

Oh, dear!

762
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,776
I told you
to join me for dinner.

763
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,395
And I told you no.

764
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,110
Ooh! What time is it?

765
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,357
What's happening?

766
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,527
I'd starve before
I ever ate with you.

767
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,862
Well, be my guest.

768
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,697
Go ahead and starve.

769
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,200
If she doesn't eat with me...

770
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,706
then she doesn't eat at all.

771

Idiots!

772
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,670
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

773
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,756
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

774
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,423
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

775
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,682

"If she doesn't eat with me,

you violated his orders

stand up to him?

this girl is the one.

if we are to be human again...

and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?
