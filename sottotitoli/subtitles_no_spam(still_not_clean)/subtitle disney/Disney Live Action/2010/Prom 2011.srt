[# Those Dancing Days: "I'll Be Yours"]

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,262
<i>[girl] High school.</i>

3
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,274
<i>It happens to everyone.</i>

4
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,539
<i>And for four years,</i>
<i>it has a way of dividing us.</i>

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,682
<i>Athletes, overachievers,</i>
<i>drama queens, misfits, jokers...</i>

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,244
<i>But then, just before it ends,</i>

7
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,811
<i>when we're almost out the door...</i>

8
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,059
<i>...one night has a way</i>
<i>of bringing us together.</i>

9
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,889
<i>Prom.</i>

10
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,764
<i>[girl] It's the one night</i>
<i>when nobody cares</i>

11
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,902
<i>who wore the varsity jacket</i>
<i>and who got cut from the team.</i>

12
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,639
<i>It's the night when</i>
<i>you might find yourself</i>

13
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,614
<i>singing at the top of your lungs with</i>
<i>people you've never even spoken to.</i>

14
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,618
<i>The night when that cute guy</i>

15
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,450
<i>from your math class</i>
<i>might finally make his move.</i>

16
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,247
<i>Prom's our night,</i>

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,160
<i>and each of us wants it</i>
<i>to be unforgettable.</i>

18
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,464
<i>That's why I've been working</i>
<i>all semester to make it perfect.</i>

19
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,498
<i>For me, and for all the seniors</i>
<i>at Brookside High.</i>

20
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,070
[girl 2] Hey, Nova.

21
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,543
<i>[Nova] We were three weeks away</i>
<i>and everything was going as planned.</i>

22
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,420
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

23
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,017
Has he asked you yet?

24
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,752
[chuckles] It's 8:00 a.m.

25
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,819
He will! [laughs]
You guys are perfect together.

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,527
You're in all the same AP
classes, swim team co-captains,

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,660
you've both been, like, class
everything since kindergarten.

28
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,897
- Trust me, it's going to happen.
- [sighs]

29
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,200
Has he asked you yet?

30
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,438
[whispers indistinctly]

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,340
Well, he will.

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,775
He's never once made a move.

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,372
- Well, he's Brandon. He's shy.
- Mm-hm.

34
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,575
Or, maybe he's just not interested.

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,311
Don't you want him to ask you?

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,011
[chuckles] Yes, I want him to ask me.
It's prom!

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,114
Here he comes.

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,682
[Brandon] Hey, Nova!

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,057
- It's happening.
- [girl] Bye.

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,532
Wow. Beautiful.

41
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,398
Brandon! Thanks.

42
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,132
[Brandon] Posters look great. Nice job.

43
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,003
Yeah.

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,668
I'm gonna do the cafeteria.

45
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,903
Oh.

46
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:13,683
You know, Rachel, I found that prom
dress you were talking about.

47
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,919
Thanks, Nova. We'll be there.

48
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,036
You know, you could go.

49
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,299
No, thank you.

50
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,740
Prom's like
the Olympics of high school.

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,404
You wait four years,
three people have a good time,

52
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,175
and everybody else gets to live
on with shattered dreams.

53
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,208
My stepbrother, folks.
Can you believe he's single?

54
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,779
Come on, Lloyd. Your fear of girls has
gone from cute to clinical.

55
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,117
It's just prom.

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,785
Ask somebody. And be creative.

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,523
This is your last chance to make anyone
remember you even went here.

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,202
Wow. Nova, that looks awesome.

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,407
Thanks. Make sure you and Tyler
aren't too late.

60
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,315
We crown prom king and queen
at 9:35. Just saying.

61
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,488
Hey! My queen!

62
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,549
[boy 1] Hey, Tyler.

63
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,422
- [girl] Hi, Tyler.
- [boy 2] What's up, man?

64
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,119
So, I saw the posters,

65
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,754
and I thought about you.

66
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,458
And about a party bus.

67
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,829
[boy 3] Oh, yeah!

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,664
Hey, Tyler, can we talk?

69
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,831
OK, so you can only listen
to one artist for the rest of your life,

70
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,466
- and Stick Hippo does not exist. Go.
- Oh, man.

71
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,772
No Stick Hippo, the
greatest band of all time?

72
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,177
Jack White. You get three
epic bands, and counting.

73
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,013
[scoffs] Lucas, you blow my mind
every day.

74
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,818
OK, next one. Grunge rock supergroup,
1990-96, no Dave Grohl. Go.

75
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,484
Oh, good one. OK, how 'bout, uh...

76
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,322
[girls laughing]

77
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,720
Look at them.

78
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,355
I want to go to prom.

79
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,128
Well, Megan Brooks went
when she was a sophomore.

80
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,328
So it can totally happen.

81
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,338
It's like they're in a trance.

82
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,270
Yeah.

83
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,935
- [girl] See you later.
- Bye.

84
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,171
- Lucas, you gotta ask her out.
- Dude, you're crazy.

85
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,009
She doesn't want to go out with me.
I've got nothing to offer.

86
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,881
No car, no cool parties, no prom.

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,092
Whoa, check it out.

88
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,200
Prom this year
is gonna be so much fun.

89
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:42,037
Oh, my gosh. I really want to go
with Dakota. That'd be amazing.

90
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,642
[overlapping chatter continues]

91
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,681
[school bell rings]

92
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:15,901
Hey, Rhoda,
I turned 18 last week.

93
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,408
You know what that means, right?

94
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,037
They can try you as an adult?

95
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,570
Rhoda! You break my heart.

96
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,150
It means we can
finally run away together.

97
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,017
You, me, the open road.

98
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:30,953
[scoffs]

99
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,926
So, what are you in for?

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,923
Let me guess.
Trouble at the model UN?

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,230
Prom poster crisis?

102
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,295
Wait, I know.

103
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,068
You're receiving an award
for most awards.

104
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,599
Actually, I'm in trouble this time.

105
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,644
Really?

106
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,771
They caught me riding around
school on my little moped

107
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,975
- because I think I'm such a rebel.
- It's not a moped.

108
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,313
It's a 1972 Norton Commando.

109
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,875
It's adorable.

110
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,946
Jesse Richter? My office, now.

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,154
Nova, I'll have those papers
for you by lunch.

112
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,804
- Richter, Richter, Richter.
- [clears throat]

113
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,200
Let's see.

114
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,972
"Jesse has cut last period

115
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,740
every Monday for four weeks."

116
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,476
- You know what this means?
- I'm consistent?

117
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,882
You do realize you're only
cheating yourself, right?

118
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,113
You know, I had a talk
with myself about that.

119
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,021
- [man] Mm-hm.
- Turns out I'm OK with it.

120
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,759
I don't have time for this.

121
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,555
Today it's cutting class. Last month
it's fighting in the cafeteria?

122
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,862
You don't care about anything.
And you and I both know...

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,967
...you're going nowhere.

124
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,632
The good news is,
the really good news,

125
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,835
in a month and a half,
that's not gonna be my problem

126
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:01,006
'cause I'm going on vacation,
and you are gonna disappear forever.

127
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,480
You wanna do that with
a diploma, that's up to you.

128
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,680
Six weeks, Richter. Six weeks.
Do you think you can handle that?

129
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,314
Yeah. I'll leave this place
in one piece for ya.

130
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:16,795
Because in September,
you're gonna be right back here.

131
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,665
Get to class.

132
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,028
What is this?

133
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,141
[exhales] An earring?

134
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,077
Very good.
Why was it in your car?

135
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:38,139
Wait, I know. I drove half the girls'
soccer team to Papa Gino's last week.

136
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,011
You did?

137
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,385
Yes, OK? Now stop acting crazy.
You know you're my girl.

138
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,584
And you're gonna be the prom queen,
up there looking beautiful.

139
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,385
What is it?

140
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,891
You need to ask me.

141
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,299
I know, OK? Don't worry.
I've got plans.

142
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,733
Here. For the soccer team.

143
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,834
[up-tempo music]

144
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,438
- [whistle blows]
- [boy] I got it! I got it!

145
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,880
- [chattering]
- [boy] Pick it up.

146
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,441
[whistle blowing]

147
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,644
[boy 2] Come on, you guys.

148
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,415
[girls chanting]

149
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,979
[Brandon] I got it. I got...

150
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,719
- OK.
- You guys got it?

151
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,786
- Yep. You guys all right?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,330
[Brandon] Feel like
I'm carrying all the weight.

153
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,628
[boy 3] Me too. I feel like you're
carrying all the weight.

154
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,667
[Brandon] Lower it.

155
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,429
- Careful of the stars.
- [Brandon] Let it down.

156
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,232
[boy 3] Hey, man, relax.

157
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,466
- OK.
- Are we... done?

158
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,240
- What?
- Well...

159
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,976
...that was the last
of our prom decorations.

160
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,614
But we still
have to figure out a floor plan,

161
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,348
come up with a schedule
of who's selling tickets,

162
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,822
get the voting system down
for prom king and queen, and...

163
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,552
But you know what?
I can totally do that stuff later.

164
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,498
So, you guys are... done.

165
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,692
[all cheer] Yay!

166
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,962
In three weeks, "Starry Night"
will be Brookside's best prom ever.

167
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,672
Our theme is "Starry Night"?

168
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,767
[snickers]

169
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,041
Uh... yeah.

170
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,005
Cool.

171
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,113
I can't thank you guys enough
for all your hard work,

172
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,986
but when those couples walk through
the door and see how perfect it is,

173
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,321
it's gonna be so worth it.

gonna take to prom?

My girlfriend. Athena.

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,374
- Athena?
- She's Greek.

182
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,645
Uh-huh. And where does she live?

183
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,884
- Canada.
- [laughs] Oh! So, she's Greek-Canadian?

184
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,687
There's a very vibrant
Greek culture in Canada.

185
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,357
Vibrant.

186
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,194
So, how did Justin take it when
you told him about New York?

187
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,166
I haven't exactly told him yet.

188
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,295
Mei, you have to tell him.

189
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,704
He thinks you're staying here
and going to Michigan with him.

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,903
You got into Parsons.
It's a huge deal.

191
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,343
[Mei] I know, but I haven't
decided if I'm going.

192
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,177
It'll be like breaking up
with him. How can I do that?

193
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,911
Hey, hey, hey!
Prom's looking good.

194
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,078
Guess I better find
a hot girl to go with.

195
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,382
Right.

on the new girl in my math
class in the eighth grade.

204

"R."

206
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,096
It's for the really long time it took me
to get up the nerve to ask her out.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,265
"O" is for the only girl
I've ever called my girlfriend,

and the only one I ever want to.

209

And "M"...is for
University of Michigan, of course.

Because that's our
next chapter together.

there's something that I need to ask.

Oh.

00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,609
We've been working on the prom
committee now for several months,

and, uh, since we're on the committee,

230
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,854
I think it's a good idea for us
to arrive a little early on prom night.

231
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,689
You know, make sure
everything's copacetic.

232
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,062
I suppose that makes sense.

233
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,397

leader because it was his birthday.

249

But my birthday's in July,
which is totally unfair.

Totally.

one day at the end of the school year.

And there are like six of us.
And two of them are girls.

And they made Mike S. line leader first

254
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,994
and his birthday
isn't even until August,

255
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,799

00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,225
Corey and I would have veto power for
all music released into the airwaves.

682
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,327

683

Well, you too, if you wanted.

684
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,169
[chuckles] Yeah, thanks.

685
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,672
So, do you just talk the talk
or can you walk the walk?

686
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,540
Um, do I play?

687
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,182
No. I don't.

688

You wanna learn?

- Um...
- Here.

Put your hand like this.

691

No. OK.

692

That's a "C."

C.

694

[laughs] Yes,
but you have to strum.

There was one guy.

705

But it turns out
he's not exactly available.

706

Oh. Sorry.

707
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,392
It's fine. I'm over it.

708
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,197
It's perfect! She doesn't
have a boyfriend, she told me.

709
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,893
- And she plays guitar.
- Lucas.

710
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,401
I mean, it's just
like you said, right?

711
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,665
- You never listen to what I say.
- She's into me.

712
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,398
Which is why I'm gonna ask her
to study as soon as I see...

- Friday?

715
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,144
Yes, which we've established and
designated as "Stick Hippo T-shirt day."

I guess I forgot.

718

All right. Well, I have an extra,
you know, for emergencies...

719

Oh! Tyler! Great party, bro!

720

Hey, you the man, Luke! [laughs]

721
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,220

723

Mei? You have a very important
decision to make.

724
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,780
What?

725
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:41,615
And I want you to know that
whatever you decide, I support.

726
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,483
What are you talking about?

727
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,785
The limo. Both Mark
and Izzy want white,

728
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:51,261
but I said I thought you and I were more
the classic black types.

729

- I guess...

What's wrong?

[scoffs] It's just...
Do I get any say in this?

732
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,697
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.

733
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,539
How many other things
have you figured out?

734

I mean, who says
I even wanted a limo?

735

All right. Look, we don't have
to decide this right now.

I'm in your Civics class.

00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,346
- Really?
- Uh, you lent me a pencil.

745
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,219
I was like,
"Do you have a pencil?"

746
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,884
And you were like, "Yes."
So, I brought it back...

747
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,793
Uh, here... it is. But wait,
that's not the point.

This might seem out of the
blue, this is out of the blue,

know, and I am looking for a date,

you wanted to go with me.

Are you serious?

752

Well, I know it's
a little last minute,

but I'm really fun, I swear.

754
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,081
- You know, I have references...
- No, it's not that.

755
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:23,211
I have a boyfriend.
Didn't you know that?

756
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,116
Oh. No, I guess not.

knew about us.

I'm Kristen, he's Anton.
We're Kranton.

I mean, how could you
not know about us?

761
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,401
- You'd have to live in a cave.
- I don't.

and the five minutes I'm talking to you

we've been apart in months.

Cool. How about
we meet in the library?

776
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,645
Perfect. I'll be there.

we were gonna study.

I have to pick him up from school.

Why are you telling me this?

and I'm late getting here.

You seem nice.

met sooner, you know?

Yeah.

1028

Isn't it funny how you can go to school
with somebody for so long

1029
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,780
and not even meet them till now?

1030

Uh, I think I'm prom'd out.

I thought you'd never wear
that sweaty symbol of conformity.

1373

I thought about that,
