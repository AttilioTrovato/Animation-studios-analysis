1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,013
[wind howling]

2
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,446
Haw, Togo! Haw! Haw!

3
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,827
Good dog! Good dog!

4
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,631
Leave it!

5
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,296
[barking]

6
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,675
Leave it alone!

7
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,313
[thunder rumbling]

8
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,358
Good dog.

9
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,198
Well done, Togo!

10
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,174
Well done, all!

11
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,629
There'll be full bellies
and warm beds tonight.

12
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,050
[barking]

13
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,049
All right, Togo! Hike!

14
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,786
Whoa!

15
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,961
[man] There's been a diphtheria outbreak.

16
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,043
How long?

17
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,167
- More than a week.
- Constance?

18
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,264
Fine. She's fine.

19
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,383
It's mostly children.

20
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,394
Five have died.

21
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,140
Bless them.

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,930
Twenty more sick here in Nome.

23
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,929
And no telling how many
in the Inuit villages.

24
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,769
They found serum in Fairbanks.

25
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,612
They just don't know how
to get it from there to here.

26
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,649
Anyway, everybody's at Dexter's,
and they're asking for you.

27
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,119
Hike!

28
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,829
[man] What we have in our children
is an epidemic.

29
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,746
And without antitoxin,
it's a death sentence to most,

30
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,174
if not all those infected.

31
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,922
[people murmuring]

32
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,165
The good news is,

33
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,756
they've located antitoxin
at the Fairbanks Railroad Hospital,

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,430
and they're ready
to put it on the next train to Nenana.

35
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,143
A round trip from here to Nenana
is still 600 miles.

36
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,524
They have aeroplanes in Fairbanks,
and we could fly it here.

37
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,693
Did you see those clouds on the horizon
when you came over?

38
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,402
Of course I did,
but maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

39
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,659
Seppala, you were out there.
What do you think?

40
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,993
It's going to be bad.

41
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,913
How bad?

42
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,004
Memorable, I think.

43
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,998
What makes you think?

44
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,577
Well, it looks biblical enough,

45
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,797
and the barometer's falling
in a pretty disturbing way but...

46
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,012
But what?

47
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,626
We came up on caribou this morning.

48
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,548
About 200 yards to our right, he saw them.

49
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,767
My foot was ready on the brake,
and he ignored them and kept running.

50
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,524
That's when I knew this storm was special.

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,153
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

52
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,441
Togo's a caribou chaser of some renown.

53
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,859
I still don't understand.

54
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,374
Never in 12 years
had he not at least turned for them.

55
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,485
When an animal denies his nature

56
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,326
and runs for the barn
because he fears the storm...

57
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,834
man better fear the storm.

58
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,673
I see.

59
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,801
In a storm like this,
how quickly could you get there and back?

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,299
Not "how quickly,"

61
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,381
"if."

62
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,795
[scattered groans]

63
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,223
Then I say aeroplane.

64
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,847
Open cockpit aeroplane?

65
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,137
Water-cooled engines?
Did you call that airfield in Fairbanks?

66
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,555
They're making an assessment.

67
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,733
I'll bet they are.

68
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,483
I seriously don't think
flying's an option.

69
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,818
But, in answer to your question,
"how quick?"

70
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,401
Seppala once ran for me,
all the way to Nenana, in four days.

71
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,992
For factual reference only.

72
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,794
Personally I never cared
for the notion that sled dogs

73
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,618
should be replaced by machines,

74
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,076
but today I'm a champion of progress.

75
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,799
Come on, pup.

76
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,796
[indistinct]

77
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,137
[thunder rumbling]

78
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,107
Seppala, you going by the hospital?

79
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,124
Climb on.

80
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,871
Hike!

81
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,719
[Seppala] Whoa! Whoa!

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,601
Much obliged.

83
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,821
Good luck, doctor.

84
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,488
Towns are, uh,
usually founded by topography...

85
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,037
proximity to roads and rivers.

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,250
Nome was founded by luck.

87
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,711
The gold at Anvil Creek?

88
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,455
You could see it with your naked eye,

89
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,550
pick it up with your fingers
from the sand.

90
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,514
Gold dries up.

91
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,104
Luck dries up.

92
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,189
[dogs whining]

93
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,370
[door closes]

94
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,259
- [children coughing]
- [babies crying]

95
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,811
[nurse speaking indistinctly]

96
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,859
- [crying continues]
- [coughing continues]

97
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,195
[dogs barking]

98
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,167
[barking continues]

99
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,217
[door opens, closes]

100
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,932
Where does he find the energy?

101
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,977
By his reckoning,
he's still ten weeks old.

102
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,232
[Constance chuckles]

103
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,573
So, you'll go?

104
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,871
I just got home.
You're anxious to be rid of me?

105
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,253
Hmm. Could be.

106
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,290
Have reason for me to be gone, do you?

107
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,825
- I have lovers.
- Ah?

108
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,168
Too many to count.

109
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,302
- I have no one but myself to blame.
- [chuckles]

110
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,377
I was warned
not to marry someone so beautiful.

111
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,797
Warned by whom?

112
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,139
Everyone with eyesight.

113
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,229
So, you will go?

114
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,612
I have no such inclination.

115
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,519
Then why are you waxing sled runners?

116
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,488
They need wax.

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,750
[Constance]
Can it even be done in this weather?

118
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,462
Anything can be done.

119
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,625
Well, let them choose
someone else for once.

120
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,511
- The room was full of mushers.
- Right.

121
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,431
But it's always my husband they come for.

122
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,301
Pick someone with more at stake in this.

123
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,187
I stopped at the hospital.
All those children, we know them.

124
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,024
I know.

125
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,065
That little girl that lives next to Mallon
and always runs out to pet the dogs.

126
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,491
Sally, who pets everyone's dogs,
not just yours.

127
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,316
We know those children.
We know their parents.

128
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,197
I understand this.
And tomorrow I'll be ashamed.

129
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,327
But right now, I'm sorry, I'm afraid.

130
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,048
It's not the first storm to hit Alaska.

131
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,418
Don't patronize me.

132
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,014
You're right.

133
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,962
Don't take Togo. Fritz could lead.

134
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,131
I'll cross that bridge when and if.

135
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,800
He's 12 years old.
You said he's too old to go to Elwald,

136
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,959
and that isn't even
a quarter of this distance.

137
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,798
You're upsetting yourself for nothing.

138
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,012
Let's go to sleep.

139
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,728
I must say this before you make a decision
you'll forever regret.

140
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,573
You're more attached to him than you know,
and you're about to run him to his death.

141
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,620
And you're not prepared for what
it's going to do to you, I promise you.

142
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,250
Is that all?

143
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,165
He is, of course, your dog,
and a working dog.

144
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,250
And, were I more pragmatic,
I wouldn't love him, but I do.

145
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,177
And I'm just so heartsick
that these are my last hours with him.

146
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,141
Two things.

147
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:48,097
One: if I were to try for Nenana
in these conditions without him,

148
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,234
these would be your last hours with me.

149
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:56,532
And two: at this hour, nothing's decided.

150
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,320
- [pounding on door]
- [dog barks]

151
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,818
You were saying?

152
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,247
George?

153
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,674
- [wind howling]
- Evening, George.

154
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,961
[chuckles]
It appears your forecast is correct,

155
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,300
if my journey out here is any evidence.

156
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,549
The wind almost stopped me dead
a couple times.

157
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:29,347
Oh, I... I talked with Fairbanks.
There will be no airborne rescue of Nome.

158
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:36,523
So, the time of the dog,
not only continues, it's at hand.

159
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,438
So, you felt the need to come
all the way out here to share this news?

160
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,357
Some things you need to say
to a man's face,

161
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,816
isn't that right, Mr. Mayor?

162
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,199
Yeah.

163
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,289
Coffee or whiskey?

164
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,211
Whiskey. If it's no trouble.

165
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,248
No. No trouble. I'm having both.

166
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,721
We have to be smart about this.

167
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,892
You're going to ride in the sled
when I tell you.

168
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,518
No squirming. No arguments, for once.

169
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,910
Got one more in ya, pup?

170
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,539
[dogs barking]

171
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,044
Almost there.

172
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,539
Good dogs.

173
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,756
I've seen worse.

174
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,848
We could have a picnic.

175
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,860
I'll be back before you know it.

176
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,859
I won't even make the bed.

177
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,581
Hey. Hey.

178
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,457
You bring him back to me, okay?

179
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,712
And you come back to me.

180
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,887
Good boy.

181
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,150
[Seppala] All right, Togo!

182
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,777
Hike!

183
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,130
[church bell tolling]

184
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,406
[man] Come on, Togo!

185
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,082
Come on, Togo!

186
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,962
Come on! There you go.

187
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,708
[Seppala] Hike!

188
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,683
[wind howling]

189
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,704
Here it comes.

You tend to your business,
I'll tend to mine.

195
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,205
How can it not be my business?
No dogs in the bedroom.

196
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,836
He's in such pain.

197
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,093
And in our bedroom.

198
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,345
A runt has more imperfections
than just size, you know.

199
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,425
Nature has its ways of sorting things out.

200
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,017
Oh, should I just drown him
and speed up the process?

201
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm just saying that Alaska
can be particularly cruel to the weak.

202
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,025
I don't need to be reminded.

203
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,279
What does it cost you
to give this life a chance?

204
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,829
What does he bring
to the breed if he survives?

205
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,380
[Constance] The heart of a survivor.

206
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,628
You're too softhearted.

207
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,799
You're too Norwegian.

208
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,349
[pounding]

209
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,315

210
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,446
Get!

211
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,697
Why don't you put him back in the kennel?

212
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,405
Every time I do, he digs his way out.

213
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,747
I'm spending more daylight filling holes
than doing the work I should be doing.

214
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,995
[barking]

215
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,917
I catch you, you'll be sorry.

[sniffing]

217
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,551
It's all your fault.

218
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,017
I thought you were supposed to be
a great trainer of dogs.

219
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,518
He's a devil.

220
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Saint Francis of Assisi
would shoot this dog.

221
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,395
Hey!

222
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,901
- He's fast.
- He's mentally deficient.

223
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,322
He's undersized,
unintelligent, untrainable.

224
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,363
Yeah, but he's fast.

225
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,567
I think you ought to give him
a chance on the sled.

226
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,577
Stop, stop. That is not a sled dog.

227
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,790
Never ever.

228
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,540
Well, you won't know until you try.

229
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,292
I won't know, period.

230
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,584
Victor Anderson wants one of my pups.

231
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,497
Well, I have the dog to give him.

232
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,719
Every year we go through this.

233
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,264
Not like this.

234
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,517
How many times do I have to remind you?

235
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,139
They're not pets. They're not our friends.
They're not our children.

236
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,690
They're animals.

237
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,942
Work animals.

238
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,158
Serves you right.

239
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,133
[Togo whines]

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,179

[chuckles]

246
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,469
Well, shame on you, Victor Anderson.
If you didn't want a dog, why bother us?

247
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,433
He's more trouble than he's worth.

248
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,729
I think I'll go down now.

249
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,483
I would.

Hike up!

Next time I go the wrong way,
you tell me to go to hell.

[woman singing in foreign language]

291
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,834
Her name, Atiqtalik,

292
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,948
means "polar bear mother."

293
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,674
Your dog is her cub now.

She can fix.

298
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,977
"Don't worry, young one...

soon it'll be warm again."

300
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,828
When I finish,
you'll start serving life in prison.

301
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,867
All because I married a Belgian.

302
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,094
Belgium is a soft country.

303
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,964
Norway, on the other hand,
is a harsh country.

304
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:57,335
In Brussels,
you'd sleep in a feathered bed

305
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,931
and have salmon roe for breakfast.

306
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,644
In Storfjord, your days would be numbered.

Lesson number one: never marry a Belgian.

309
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,316
They're sentimental.

310
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,229
And you end up doing days of hard work

311
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,448
for a problem that a bullet
solves in seconds.

312
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:22,704
Lesson number two: for you, Satan,
or whatever your name is...

313
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,750
try digging out now.

Go! Get!

00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,716
Since when did you start worrying about
keeping people out of the tack room?

350
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,425
This isn't for keeping people out.

351
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,190
You're taking him out of the kennel
and putting him in here?

352
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,690
The kennel won't hold him.

353

- Apparently your dog...
- Not my dog.

354

no matter how many knees
I put to his chest.

357
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,985
Your dog,
who violates the rules of the pack

358
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,537
and upsets the hierarchy
I've worked years to establish.

359

Your cur,
who rewards your kind nature with anarchy.

360
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,134
This is for keeping him in.

361
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,141
Was that a piece of our house?

It'll cost you your life.

The ice is unpredictable now.

We'll make it. Listen to me,

We will not die in that dog's company.

Now, run, my pups. Run!

Max, get this out to the Associated Press.

428
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,230

With lives in the balance,

a heroic race runs through conditions
so terrible we can scarcely imagine.

439
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:18,197
The question on everyone's lips is not
"can they get there and back in time?"

440
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,208
but "can they get there and back at all?"

441

Well done, pups. Well done!

You like to bet on my little dog.

451

There are advantages
to being at this roadhouse on race days.

452
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:36,832
Most dogs, when they reach Shaktoolik,
have worry in their eyes.

This one, never.

454

and fight polar bear.

Whoa!

460
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,342
When I told my father
I was leaving for Alaska,

461
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:36,045
he laughed at me.
He thought it was a joke.

462
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,851
Only an idiot would be foolish enough

to give up an apprenticeship in Norway
to be unemployed in America.

When I said the word "gold,"
he slapped me.

465
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,153
And he promised me
that the only gold I would find in Alaska

466
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:53,993
was what I'd brought in my own teeth.

467

I've dug so many holes in this country.

469
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:06,747
The law of averages would say that,
at least, I'd find some gold but...

no.

If this is the hardest decision
we ever have to make,

[Seppala] He's an escape artist, though,
as I told you before.

480
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,588
Oh. Don't worry about that.
I want him to be an inside dog.

481
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,965
Well, inside might not...

482
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,101
Last winter I had wolves at the door.

483
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:04,848
They would jump up at the window
and stare at me.

484
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:09,268
Trust me. There were no wolves
where I was raised in Ireland.

485
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:13,732
But with this lad by my side,
no wolf would dare enter.

00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,301
It's fitting.

546
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:36,929
[Seppala chuckles]

547
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,561
Honey! Come here, please?

548
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:54,438
Come. Step around him, he won't move.

549
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,736
- I have things to do.
- Over here. Next to me.

550
00:53:58,697 --> 00:53:59,697
Please.

551
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,920
Okay, now, call him.
Ask him to come into the bedroom.

552
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:12,793
Do it.

553
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,167
Togo, come.

554
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:16,837
Again.

555
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:20,013
- [scoffs] This isn't fair.
- Of course it is. Again, more demanding.

556
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:24,506
Togo, you come in this room!

557
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:26,977
My husband is trying to prove
a point of some kind.

558
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,443
No dogs in the bedroom.

559
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:33,816
Good boy, Togo. Good boy.

560
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:36,647
Outstanding!

561
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:38,736
Good dog.

562
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,486
[man] I don't care what the governor says,
he's wrong.

563
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,083
Irrespective of how you feel, Jafet...

564
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,579
Well, Mrs. Seppala.

565
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,660
Any musher would be lucky
to survive 30 miles in this weather.

566
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,327
Seppala's the only one
who can survive a longer run!

567
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,336
What's this nonsense about a relay?

568
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,550
Uh, now, Constance, this is a good thing.

569
00:54:56,629 --> 00:54:58,049
- Is this it?
- It is.

570
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,341
Fourteen teams stationed
at these roadhouses

571
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,215
between Nenana and Shaktoolik.

572
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,392
Even as we speak,
they're running short legs

573
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,471
passing the serum
from one sled to the next.

574
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:10,556
And on our end, two teams will go out
to these roadhouses and wait for Seppala.

575
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:14,055
We'll need another sled
for the relay on our end.

576
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:15,937
Is it possible you can
put together a team for us?

577
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,034
Of course.

578
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,488
Do you think your man, Gunnar,
would drive them?

579
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:19,988
- Of course.
- Good.

580
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,610
The governor came up with this when?

581
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:23,406
Twelve hours after Seppala departed.

582
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:27,537
Leave it to a politician to change
the rules after the game's begun.

583
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,999
No. This is a good thing.

584
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,540
Seppala won't have to go as far.

585
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:34,173
- But he has no idea there's a relay.
- Exactly.

586
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,290
Just... Please.

587
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,296
Now, by best estimate,

588
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:44,142
the relay should be at the roadhouse
in Shaktoolik tomorrow.

589
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,259
Now the governor's people
have worked this all out.

590
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,516
And by all accounts, when Seppala arrives
at Shaktoolik tomorrow,

591
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,429
the serum will be there waiting for him.

592
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,888
[Constance] He's in Shaktoolik now.

593
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,900
- Or past it.
- What? No. No, that's not possible.

594
00:55:56,981 --> 00:56:00,321
I know my husband, if there's ice
on Norton Sound, he's crossed it.

595
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:02,702
In this storm?
Surely he's not going to try and cross...

596
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:03,859
Of course he would.

597
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,656
Going around the Sound
is 90 miles, crossing it is 20.

598
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:08,992
He saves a day each way.

599
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,537
George, if there's ice on the Sound,
he's crossed it.

600
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:14,873
And if they don't meet at the roadhouse...

601
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,208
Then they'll just hook up on the trail.

602
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:21,214
There are 1,000 ways a driver
can miss another on the trail.

603
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:23,217
A thousand ways in good weather.

604
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:26,012
- You know this.
- I do.

605
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,474
So, if my husband doesn't magically run
into your relay team,

606
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:30,596
the one he is not even looking for,

607
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,392
he and his dogs will drive on for Nenana.

608
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:35,725
And your relay driver,
when he realizes he's missed them,

609
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,232
he will set out on his own.

610
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:38,653
But he wouldn't do that, would he?

611
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,072
- Who is it? Who's the driver?
- Henry Ivanoff.

612
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:43,031
Well, Henry is tough and brave,

613
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:46,161
and he's not going to sit in front
of a warm fire while children die.

614
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,659
I promise you that. He'll set out.

615
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,405
Well, can he make it?

616
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:55,962
I won't speculate on the life of a musher.

617
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,585
Can he?

618
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,048
My guess is
we don't find Henry until the spring.

619
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,600
Not him, not his dogs,
not the serum, until the thaw.

620
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:10,512
[Mayor] But, uh...

621
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:12,137
Four days ago, in this very room,

622
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:15,563
we concluded only one man and one dog
could make that run.

623
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,019
And nothing has changed but the weather.

624
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,226
It's worse.

625
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,438
[George] All those children... lost.

626
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,619
Pray they meet.

627
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:55,055
[Henry] Gee! Gee!

628
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,560
Gee! Gee! Round.

629
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,244
Hike! Gee! Gee!

630
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,549
Leave it. Leave it!

631
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,261
Haw! Haw!

632
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:31,176
Leave it!

633
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:34,314
Haw!

634
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,160
[barks]

635
00:58:58,246 --> 00:59:00,746
[dogs barking]

636
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,007
No, no, no, no, no.

637
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:12,052
Sepp, no!

638
00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:13,802
Don't!

639
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,220
Sepp! Sepp!

640
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,309
I have the serum!

641
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:24,686
No! I have the serum.

642
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:26,857
Sepp!

643
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:29,066
Sepp!

644
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,320
No!

645
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,921
[dogs barking in distance]

646
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:37,682
[Henry] Bill Shannon took the first leg.
Ran through the night.

647
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,973
Fifty below, easy.

648
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,734
He arrived in Tolovana
with his face black from frostbite.

649
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,151
He passed on to Ed Kallands.

650
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,981
They had to pour hot water on his hands
'cause they were frozen to the sled.

651
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,199
Then went Tommy Patsy.

652
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:57,317
Then Jackscrew.

653
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,699
But none of us are as tough as you, Sepp.

654
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,877
- Sepp?
- Yeah, what?

655
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:11,211
You okay?

656
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:15,427
Of course. Never better.

657
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,024
What about him?

658
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:23,138
What about him?

659
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,269
Please take this the right way, okay?

660
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:31,229
That, right there,
is the best dog I've ever known...

661
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,236
but what I'm looking at is a spent animal.

662
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:40,123
He is.
This storm just about broke all my pups.

663
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:44,698
I wouldn't be a true friend
if I didn't speak my mind and...

664
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:47,539
[sighs]

665
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,923
Leave him here. I'll take good care of him
till the weather breaks.

666
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:54,094
He's my lead!

667
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,757
Now do yourself a favor
and tend to your own.

668
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,484
Sure, Sepp.

669
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,106
I'm sorry.

670
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,780
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

671
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:19,492
Yeah, don't give it a second thought.

672
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:22,492
No, that was shameful of me.

673
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,948
Especially since what you said
was out of kindness.

674
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,456
Whatever happens tomorrow,

675
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,591
fortune or fault,
is mine and mine to reconcile.

676
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:36,126
But I thank you, Henry,
for thinking of the dog.

677
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:39,678
Not many do.

678
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:48,144
[doctor] "To sleep, to sleep."

679
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,984
The long bright day is done.

680
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,520
And darkness rises
from the fall of the sun.

681
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:58,487
To sleep, to sleep.

682
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:02,906
Whate'er thy joys,
they vanish with the day.

683
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:08,204
Whate'er thy griefs,
in sleep they fade away.

684
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,424
To sleep, to sleep.

685
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:16,548
Sleep mournful heart
and let the past be past.

686
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:19,262
Sleep, happy soul.

687
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:22,796
All life will sleep at last.

688
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:25,846
To sleep.

689
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:28,765
"To sleep."

690
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,649
[man] Still time for me to place a bet?

691
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,571
[Seppala] Thanks for your hospitality.

692
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:37,939
Looks like I was wrong.

693
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:41,696
You weren't wrong.
The die is cast. We'll make it.

694
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,369
[barking]

695
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,785
All right, Togo! Hike!

696
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,047
He's going across the Sound again.

697
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,585
[Henry] Seppala, no!

698
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,471
He knows what his dogs have left.

699
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,019
For him, it's the Sound or nothing.

700
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:28,202
[dogs barking]

701
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,887
[barking]

702
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,388
Hike!

703
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:05,237
Gee! Gee!

704
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:09,367
[ice cracking]

705
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,339
Haw! Haw!

706
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:24,167
Good puppies!

707
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:26,678
Good dogs!

708
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:29,505
Good dog! Go puppies!

709
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,180
Go!

710
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:33,925
Hold up, Togo!

711
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:37,563
Good dog.

712
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,022
Run!

713
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:43,275
Run!

714
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,203
On straight.

715
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,454
Run, puppies!

716
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,089
[cheering]

717
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,513
- Come on! Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

718
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,636
Twenty more dollars on Leonhard Seppala.

719
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,925
Twenty dollars on those itty-bitty dogs.

720
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:17,887
Scotty Allan,
the greatest musher of all time,

721
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,017
left the last roadhouse in the lead.

722
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,225
Friend, this race is over.

723
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:23,194
[men laughing]

724
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:36,962
You see that?

725
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:39,288
That's the best dog team
in the world, right there.

726
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,915
- Hike! Hike!
- [Seppala] They know who they are,

727
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:45,013
time for us to find out who we are.

728
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:50,635
Go! Come on, puppies!

729
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,219
Haw! Haw!

730
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:58,234
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

731
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,729
Hike! Good dog!

732
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:09,355
Come on, dogs! Come on, dogs!

733
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:12,816
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

734
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:17,947
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

735
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,038
[Scotty] Hike, doggy!

736
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,504
[Seppala] Whoo-hoo!

737
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:28,966
Wait a minute.

738
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:30,379
That's not Scotty.

739
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:33,966
Who is that?

740
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:38,814
That, my friends, is Leonhard Seppala
and his itty-bitty dogs.

741
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:42,152
[man laughs] Whoo!

742
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,863
[crowd cheering]

743
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,951
Whoa!

744
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,043
[cheering continues]

745
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,960
Congratulations, Sepp.

746
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,507
Togo. Hi.

747
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,934
Well done. You did it. [chuckles]

748
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:15,762
Good boy.

749
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:22,348
[hammering]

750
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,148
Did you ever think we'd have
such a thing on our wall?

751
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,657
[chuckles] I never thought we'd have
$5,000 in prize money.

752
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,700
Prize money you can't hang on a wall.

753
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:40,754
Actually, you can if you have enough pins.

754
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,460
All thanks to this troublemaker.

755
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:49,047
The only one
who never underestimated you, was you.

756
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:52,339
- [Constance clears throat]
- [stammers] And my genius wife.

757
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,974
My beautiful, genius wife.

758
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,221
[dogs barking]

759
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,457
Haw!

760
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,710
Haw!

761
01:09:41,806 --> 01:09:43,806
[rumbling]

762
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,019
Hike up!

763
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:25,516
Hike up!

764
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,518
Up! Up! Up!

765
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:01,301
Run!

766
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:11,475
Hike up!

01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,799
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

768
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:40,882
Togo! Hike up! Go!

769
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:49,975
Good dog!

770
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,019
Good dog!

771
01:11:54,564 --> 01:11:55,944
Run puppies!

772
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:06,992
We made it.

773
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:11,414
We made it!

774
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,586
Whoa! Whoa!

775
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:22,219
[barks]

776
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:12,643
No matter what happens, forgive me.

777
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,191
Hike up, Togo! Hike!

778
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,700
[whines]

779
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,621
Hike up! Hike up!

780
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:38,544
Pull up, Togo!

781
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:40,631
Pull!

782
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:42,841
Pull!

783
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:45,216
No, Fritz. Wait! Wait!

784
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:52,644
[barking]

785
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:58,062
Yes!

786
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,573
Yes! Hike!

787
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:12,242
[screams]

788
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,843

[grunts]

790
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,521
Good boy, Togo! Good dog.

791
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,574
Good dogs, all!

792
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,485
Get up there, puppies.

793
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,381
You know, I can do that.

794
01:15:01,918 --> 01:15:04,048
I'll do it. Drink that.

795
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:28,485
Why?

796
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:33,832
[speaking foreign language]

797
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:42,328
The pine stings her eyes.

798
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:54,304
[Constance]
Thank you for doing this, Gunnar.

799
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:55,717
[Gunnar] Anything I can do to help.

800
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:58,309
My greatest worry is that
he'd be within miles and...

801
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:00,231
No such thing is going to happen.

802
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:04,150
Sepp is the best musher I know.
Nothing will stop him from getting home.

803
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:06,440
If you'll outfit the sled,
I'll start pulling dogs.

804
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:08,194
No, no, Mrs. Seppala. I can do both.

805
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:09,436
You should sleep.

806
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:11,197
I've had my fill of time in the house.

807
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,819
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer to fetch dogs.

808
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:17,908
Sure. And who do you think
I should have in lead?

809
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:21,414
Fox is the best dog left.
Paired with Balto.

810
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:23,535
They won't win any races,

811
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,785
but they'll plow through snow
and run home for dinner.

812
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:38,347
Thank you.

813
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:45,401
[barking]

814
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:48,148
Hike up!

815
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:50,569
Good dogs.

816
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,327
Pass the word
there's chores waiting for him.

817
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,203
Gladly.

818
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,841
Fox, Balto. Hike!

819
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:26,478
Come with me.

820
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:28,305
[Seppala] I haven't the time.

821
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,074
Come.

822
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,440
I need to go.

823
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:41,951
Last night I was worried about you.

824
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:46,247
Thought you'd bit off
more than you could chew.

825
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,206
Then I saw that.

826
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,167
And asked myself...

827
01:17:53,256 --> 01:17:56,756
"Why should Amituk worry about any man...

828
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:00,756
who cheats death like this?"

829
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:19,445
Now, you're gonna ride in the sled.

830
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,330
Even if it's just for 20 miles.

831
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,125
Come now, for once ride in the sled.

832
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:34,672
Stay.

833
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:47,976
[grunts]

834
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:59,071
Hike!

[grunts]

836
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:45,044
Whoa!

837
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:07,216
Togo! I'm sorry. I can't help you.

838
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:09,016
I can't see.

839
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,726
We need to get to the next roadhouse.

840
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:14,437
Take us to Big Joe. I know you can.

841
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:17,194
I know you can.

842
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,238
Good dog. Good dog.

843
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:22,738
Hike up!

01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:56,557
[dog whimpers]

845
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:47,572
Oh, no.

[groans]

847
01:21:58,835 --> 01:21:59,955
Togo?

848
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,175
Togo?

849
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:18,153
We can't stop. We must keep going.

850
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:23,775
Do you understand? We stop, we die.

851
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:29,989
Listen to me, if you stop, you die.

852
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:38,665
[creaking]

853
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,745
- [man] Seppala?
- Oh!

854
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:45,301
- Seppala, is that you?
- Oh, God.

855
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,092
Joe, we're here.

856
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,465
Oh, God.

857
01:22:48,551 --> 01:22:50,391
The serum's in the sled.

858
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,194
You go inside.
I'll get the dogs in the barn.

859
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,808
Thank you. But not him.

860
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,776
You're magnificent.

861
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:15,701
Magnificent. Magnificent.

862
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:18,456
Seppala! Inside.

863
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:02,917
Now, Leonhard, your race is over.

864
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:04,922
Just have a drink with me.

865
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:14,513
This one, this one here.

866
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,390
All those miles in this storm,
12 years old.

867
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:21,307
That's just incredible.

868
01:24:21,394 --> 01:24:22,404
[man] Wish me luck.

869
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:48,591
[grunting]

870
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,139
[man] Charlie, you made it.

871
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,061
- Here.
- [man] Is this the serum?

872
01:24:58,139 --> 01:24:59,929
- Warm this.
- Aye.

873
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,726
- Good luck, Gunnar.
- Thanks.

874
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,650
My dogs, my dogs, they're... I need help.

875
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,398
There is a sled coming to town.

881
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:17,755
Sir, I need your name,
for the record, sir.

882
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:19,635
Gunnar Kaasen.

883
01:26:20,263 --> 01:26:23,023
"Gunnar Kaasen." Excellent.

884
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:26,189
Now, the lead dog. What's its name?

885
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:27,899
One's called Fox.

886
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,229
"Fox"?

887
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:32,654
People will think it's a real fox.
The other one, what's its name?

888
01:26:33,401 --> 01:26:34,531
Balto.

889
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,111
"Balto." Yeah. Perfect.

890
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:40,372
Hey! Get that dog's photo there.

891
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:44,200
That's Balto. Champion savior of Nome.

894
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,220
[Joe]
You ought to stay another week, at least.

895
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:39,469
[Seppala] Look at this.

896
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:43,511
I know, I just wish
you would allow yourself more...

897
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:45,556
You've been a fine host, Joe.

898
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,890
You treated me and my dogs like family.

899
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,016
Thank you.

900
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:55,646
He up to it?

901
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:02,573
We'll make it.

[dogs barking]

903
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,026
There's a dog in our bedroom.

904
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,860
Yes, there is.

905
01:29:26,991 --> 01:29:28,371
[Constance] There's a dog on our bed.

906
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:32,209
Yes. There is.

907
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:12,908
You should've woke me.

908
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:16,077
You had him to yourself long enough.

909
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:18,882
Then again,
to hear the newspapers tell it,

910
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,880
you never left the house.
It was all Balto and Gunnar.

911
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:23,053
We have company.

912
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:28,547
[dogs barking]

913
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,805
If you like pears, these'll put
a smile on your face, I think.

914
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:39,186
Thank you, Eileen. Come in.

915
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:43,815
Ah, bacon.
It's the best I ever made right here.

916
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,362
- Thank you, Bill.
- [Bill chuckles]

917
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,030
Hey, Sepp!

918
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:49,866
Really, this is too much.

919
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:52,038
Oh, it's not nearly enough.

920
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:56,655
[Constance] Good morning, Dan.

921
01:30:56,998 --> 01:30:57,998
[grunts]

922
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,753
Morning, Constance.

923
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:00,884
Sepp.

924
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:06,633
So, I had some furs laying around
and I stuffed them with straw.

925
01:31:06,716 --> 01:31:09,716
You know, something for between him
and the cold floor.

926
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,720
Hey, Togo.

927
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:13,215
I made something for you.

928
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:16,938
Well, go on. Give it a try.

929
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,114
Go on.

930
01:31:32,242 --> 01:31:34,702
Thank you, Dan.
Have a seat. I'll bring you some coffee.

931
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:38,672
Uh, no. No, I mean, I'd love to,

932
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:42,668
but I have my own dogs to attend,

933
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:44,632
so thank you.

934
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:48,257
Sepp.

935
01:31:52,762 --> 01:31:53,762
[Mayor] Morning, Dan.

936
01:31:54,597 --> 01:31:56,427
- Knock-knock.
- Hello, Mayor. Come in.

937
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,100
That all right, then?

938
01:32:00,186 --> 01:32:01,686
Sepp, thank you so much.

939
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,646
[woman 1] We appreciate
everything you've done for us.

940
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,194
[woman 2] Ever so grateful, Mr. Seppala.

941
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:08,737
- [woman 3] Thank you so much.
- [Constance] Thank you.

942
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:21,038
[knocking on door]

943
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:22,464
[Constance groans]

944
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,673
No, it's too much.

945
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:41,558
Hi, Sally. Hello, Dev.
Won't you please come in?

946
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:50,105
- [Seppala] For me?
- [Sally] Mm-hmm.

947
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:56,868
[Sally] It's Togo.

948
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:58,365
Thank you.

949
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:02,079
Father carved it, but I painted it.

950
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:05,592
Well, it's a brilliant likeness, Sally.
Thank you.

951
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:15,005
[whispers] He likes his ears.

952
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:21,140
Another man would be enjoying all this
but not a private man like yourself.

953
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,476
Am I right?

954
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:24,774
[Constance whispering]
Do you think he stayed warm outside?

955
01:33:24,854 --> 01:33:27,774
I wouldn't have come myself
if not for her insistence.

956
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:30,527
- But she wanted to see him...
- [Constance whispering indistinctly]

957
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:36,825
And I want to be with her at every moment.

958
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:37,908
[Constance] Around the side.

959
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:40,622
- Top?
- [Constance] The top.

960
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:44,624
It's strange. You know, I...
I see her and yet...

961
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:49,052
I don't know how to describe it,
it's unworldly.

962
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:50,761
Does that make sense?

963
01:33:52,173 --> 01:33:56,553
Kinda like every moment I'm with her
seems impossible yet...

964
01:33:58,054 --> 01:33:59,144
yet there she is.

965
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:06,311
[Sally] Mr. Seppala...

966
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:08,984
is Togo going to die?

967
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:18,196
[Constance] Leonhard. Leonhard.

968
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:24,659
Um, excuse me.
I have cake for you both so please stay.

969
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,248
- Okay.
- Please.

970
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:30,803
Leonhard, come back inside and apologize.

971
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:32,209
They're guests in our home.

972
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:34,167
Apologize for me.

973
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:36,797
She meant no ill by it.
She's just a child.

974
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:38,795
I know. She spoke the truth.

975
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:40,927
No, don't say that. He's on the mend.

976
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:43,984
It's not winter lameness.
He doesn't have a bad paw.

977
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:46,849
You know. You've seen it before.

978
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:51,648
Well, could another dog have lead?

979
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:53,153
We'll never know.

980
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:56,074
Well, I think you should consider a world
where Dev has no child

981
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,494
and I have no husband.

982
01:34:57,572 --> 01:35:00,952
Everything you ever tried to warn me about
has come true.

983
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,250
I have run him to death.

984
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:07,961
I have.

985
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,085
And I'm not at all prepared.

986
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:27,101
[sniffs]

987
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,780
[barking]

988
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:49,330
[whimpering]

989
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:23,779
[whines]

990
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:33,287
Be safe.

991
01:36:51,644 --> 01:36:53,564
[Togo whining]

992
01:36:58,151 --> 01:36:59,691
[Seppala inhales]

993
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:00,898
I have to go.

994
01:37:02,655 --> 01:37:03,865
I have to go to work.

995
01:37:06,326 --> 01:37:07,406
Forgive me.

996
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:16,922
[whining]

997
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:28,644
Togo. Togo! Hey. Come.

998
01:37:29,307 --> 01:37:31,727
[dogs barking]

999
01:37:42,153 --> 01:37:43,993
- Togo! Hey! Come.
- [barking]

1000
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,372
Come now.
Togo, come now. Come.

1001
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,910
Togo! Come. Calm down.

1002
01:37:51,287 --> 01:37:52,287
Hike up!

1003
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Quiet!

1004
01:37:58,545 --> 01:37:59,745
[barking stops]

1005
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:03,427
[Togo barking]

1006
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:15,148
Okay. Hike!

1007
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:18,774
[barking continues]

1008
01:38:22,652 --> 01:38:26,112
[whining]

1009
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:31,409
[barking continues]

1010
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:42,628
Togo, you want some bacon?

1011
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:46,681
Good boy. Tog...

1012
01:38:48,553 --> 01:38:51,063
No! No, no, no, no.
No! Togo! Hey!

1013
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:52,769
Hey! Togo!

1014
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:57,265
Togo! Togo, come!

1015
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:20,786
Togo!

1016
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:24,051
Togo!

1017
01:39:35,892 --> 01:39:36,892
Togo!

1018
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,359
Whoa!

1019
01:40:25,191 --> 01:40:26,361
[sighs]

1020
01:40:41,082 --> 01:40:44,042
[Seppala] It was foolish of me
to think Togo would ever be denied.

1021
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:49,129
I always thought he lived for the sled.

1022
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:54,893
When all along, what he lived for was me.

1023
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:02,769
We resumed the trail.

1024
01:41:02,854 --> 01:41:05,694
We discovered a walk was as good as a run.

1025
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:14,236
As always, Constance was right.

1026
01:41:14,991 --> 01:41:17,451
Togo had the heart of a survivor.

1027
01:41:18,578 --> 01:41:21,038
Not the storm of the century,

1028
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:23,582
nor a harrowing serum run could stop him.

1029
01:41:26,878 --> 01:41:29,508
He lived out his golden years
with a new job...

1030
01:41:31,132 --> 01:41:32,432
father.

1031
01:41:33,468 --> 01:41:35,468
[puppies barking]

1032
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,850
For two years he sired pups.

1033
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:43,935
[growling]

1034
01:41:45,522 --> 01:41:48,442
While the lower 48 celebrated Balto,

1035
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:53,660
mushers from all over the world
elbowed to get one of Togo's line.

1036
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:56,871
Kennels from Fairbanks to Maine

1037
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:00,160
bred what came to be known
as Seppala Siberians.

1038
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:05,287
A breed valued for their intelligence,
stamina, courage,

1039
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:10,205
but most of all, their good nature
and uncommon bond with humans.

1040
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:22,274
He left us on a Thursday in December.

1041
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:31,230
Constance and I continued
working with dogs

1042
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:34,237
because if you're around them
long enough...

1043
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,320
Whoa!

1044
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:36,985
They tend to get under your skin.

1045
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:41,748
And if you're lucky enough
to have known a great one,

1046
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,120
they never really leave.

1047
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:48,629
They stay with you as long as you live.

1048
01:42:50,003 --> 01:42:51,763
Harnessed to your heart,

1049
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,548
giving their all...

1050
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:00,888
Hike!

1051
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:05,267
Always.
