1
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,304
Vishal Kapoor has
just now retired hurt

2
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,370
The ball has hit him hard
at a sensitive spot.

3
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,349
Since then two batsman have been
declared out in three overs.

4
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,215
Now the last batsman
is taking his place.

5
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,278
Will Kapoor be able to recover
and win this match for KKR?

6
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,188
KKR requires
only 10 runs to win the match.

7
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,727
And the last over begins now.

8
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,161
You cannot go inside.

9
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,663
All of you just stand here, and watch.

10
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,228
It's paining.

11
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,459
I will not be able to play.

12
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,096
Relax, Kapoor.

13
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,574
Mayekar, why are you
stalking me like a witch?

14
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,167
Hold on to his back.

15
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,217
Mili, we need to confirm
the Sambhalgarh case today.

16
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,377
Will you go?
- Where? What about me?

17
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,013
Don't be such a sissy, Kapoor?

18
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,283
You're absolutely fine now.

19
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,088
Look, this is the third
time I cancelled my honeymoon.

20
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,526
I've been married for 6 months.

21
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,190
My wife will leave me.

22
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,388
The |PL's over now..

23
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,435
..and there's no guy
in your life either.

24
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,265
Please go, please.

25
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,771
Don't take advantage of
my situation, Mayekar.

26
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,803
And what about my patients?

27
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,040
Is the pain any better?
- No.

28
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,739
Wait. Hold on to his back.

29
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,146
I'll handle all your patients,
I'll look after them.

30
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,247
I swear.

31
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,547
He's done for.

32
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,079
What are you doing Mili?

33
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,191
The pain has gone.

34
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,250
Now go,
blast them out of the ground.

35
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,391
Be careful.

36
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,488
Go for it.

37
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,498
Come on, come on!

38
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,702
You still use strange methods.

39
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,471
And you keep them at bay.

40
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,164
Only when required.

41
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,766
That's exactly why you're a
perfect fit for that king.

42
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,737
Please, please, please go.
- Okay, done.

43
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,714
I am saving your marriage.

44
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,680
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,048
And Kapoor hits a Six!

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,546
He has won the match.

47
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,189
Patience, Yuvraj.

48
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,050
Suraj Maan Singh won't
sell his palace so easily.

49
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,185
We've been trying for three months.

50
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,159
He refuses to meet.

51
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,062
As your lawyer in this case,
and in this deal..

52
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,799
“My advice is that your trip
to Mumbai is a waste of time.

53
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,211
Take my advice,
return to Sambhalpur.

54
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,313
We'll bring him to you.

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,082
Thank you very much,
Mr. Malhotra, for your advice.

56
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,742
You've been making me
wait for three months.

57
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,052
But I feel there's
no point in waiting.

58
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,545
It's clear that our views..

59
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,113
..on this case are
completely different.

60
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,157
Maybe our paths should
be separate as well.

61
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,588
Excuse me, Yuvraj.
- Ah, Karishma.

62
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,062
Your seafs been confirmed..

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,190
..with King Suraj Maan Singh.
- Oh, wonderful.

64
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,561
Thank you so much.

65
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,734
Yuvraj, what are you doing?

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,163
Mr. Malhotra, what are
you still doing here?

67
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,144
Don't think, move ahead.

68
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,306
Excuse me.
- Yes, mom.

69
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,642
You couldn't meet up with
Suraj Maan Singh, could you?

70
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,777
He won't agree so easily.

71
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,190
By the way, interesting news.

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,182
<i>Dr. Shaw; has arranged".</i>

73
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,092
..a new Physiotherapist
for your dad.

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,658
Have you told dad?

75
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,029
I haven't told him yet.

76
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,033
But he's going to have to do it.

77
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,604
Okay, I will be back by tomorrow.

78
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,439
Okay, son. See you tomorrow.

79
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,101
All the best.

80
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,111
I apologize, your highness.

81
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,152
Do it propefW-

82
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,560
I apologize, your highness.
I'll do it right now.

83
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,466
Your highness.
- Ramsevak.

84
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,370
Jaidev can't handle
the chores in here.

85
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,668
From tomorrow he will
clean the cars outside.

86
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,505
Okay.

87
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:39,739
Your highness!

88
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,483
Hello, Shekhar.

89
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,678
Had a good day?

90
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,692
Well, I had it as good
as others, I suppose.

91
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,784
Yuvraj isn't coming today.

92
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,185
His plate..

93
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,523
And Divya's late again.

94
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,124
If she isn't here in three minutes.

95
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,669
..you can remove her plate.

96
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,302
Divya! Hair!

97
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,711
Sorry, Mom.

98
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,653
Hello, Dad.
- Hello, clear.

99
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,632
Discipline is not
a bad thing, Divya.

100
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,756
<i>Yuvra1 Vikram Singh Remote.</i>

101
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,949
Sir.

102
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,457
I suppose it's not a coincidence..

103
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,624
..that you're sitting here.

104
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,160
No, sir.

105
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,034
So you believe, that.

106
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:17,165
...I will sell my 600
year old ancestral palace..

107
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,104
..in this 50 minutes flight.

108
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:25,513
That you'll trap me
here and get your deal.

109
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,146
You're stuck somewhere else, sir.

110
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,689
Our offer is saving you.

111
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,458
Look, sir.
We don't need to talk here..

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,397
..if you confirm our
meeting for next week.

113
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,559
Excuse me, sir.

114
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,334
Black coffee for him,
with 1 spoon sugar.

115
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,598
And black tea without sugar for me.

116
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,703
Sure, sir.

117
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,780
By the way Shekhar,
Dr. Shetty called.

118
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,481
Your new physiotherapist,
Dr. Chakravany's arriving day after.

119
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,347
What's the score, Ramsevak?

120
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,991
40? 42?

121
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,554
I've no clue, your highness.

122
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,662
I know, Shekhar,
no one has stayed that long.

123
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,398
Maybe she won't either.

124
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,367
But for once, if you just try..

125
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,430
...then maybe we could..
- I never called..

126
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,439
..or drove anyone away.

127
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,542
And what's the point
in getting well?

128
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,408
No one listens to me anyway.

129
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,979
Coffee for me.

130
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,548
What did you say her name was?

131
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,387
Dr. Chakravany.

132
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,050
Dr. Mrinalini Chakravany.

133
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,122
She's a sports physiotherapist.

134
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,418
She works with the IPL teams.

135
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,587
She's from Delhi.

136
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,499
I hope she's from South Delhi.

137
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,538
Lord, you know everything.

138
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,505
No need to be formal with You.

139
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,634
All I want is Mili to find a guy..

140
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,677
..then I'll setup a
tent in her wedding..

141
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,078
...and throw a thank you party.

142
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,378
And if he's from
Sambhalgarws royal family“.

143
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,577
..then that's even better.

144
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,045
So Lord,
don't ever pay any heed to her.

145
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,053
Especially her last line.

146
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,423
You keep quite. Stan eating.

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,227
Ashrafi, you're too good!

148
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,692
The chicken's too good.

149
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,635
Should we do September then?

150
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,333
Plan for that?

151
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,130
September sounds fine.

152
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,538
Your planners are
arriving next week.

153
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,338
Rathore?

154
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,672
You're in Mumbai
and you didn't call.

155
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,112
But, how can anyone
compete with you?

156
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,375
Nausher.

157
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,179
Nausher Bandookwala.

158
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,150
He's been with me
since the 5th grade.

159
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,322
Nausher, this is my fiancé Kiara.
- Congratulations.

160
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,187
And my sympathies, Kiara.

161
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,420
You're marrying a business machine.

162
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,323
Bandook!
- Rathore's a failure.

163
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,327
Just grab hold of him and marry him.

164
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,291
Otherwise, he'll be a
spinster like my father.

165
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,459
No, seriously.

166
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,705
I am my father's only mistake.
- You're right.

167
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,333
But seriously Rathore,
what will you do if she runs away?

168
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,739
I mean...you have your business.

169
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:14,042
But alone and lonely at
75...that's a tough life.

170
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,384
My, God. You're so beautiful.

171
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,155
You're really pretty.
She's so beautiful.

172
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,391
Beautiful. Beautiful.

173
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,393
Catch you guys, soon.

174
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,723
<i>Remote, ca“ me.</i>

175
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,328
Call your old friends.
- Okay.

176
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,132
He's sweet.

177
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,429
That he is.

178
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,371
Where were we?

179
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,368
Wedding in September.

180
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,671
Mr. Sharma's son
has become an actor.

181
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,041
Manju, please don't start this again.
- Why not?

182
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,380
I mean...this isn't natural.

183
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,581
It's been two years,
forget about a husband..

184
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,314
..you don't even have a boyfriend!

185
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,085
You are famous now.

186
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,125
You fixed Dhoni's injury in the
middle of the match..

187
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,559
..and helped him win.

188
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,563
You work for the IPL.

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,700
Granted Dhoni, Sehwag, etc. are
elderly and married.

190
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,663
But you cou|d've been in the news
with some young player at least.

191
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,506
Manju, keep your
one-track mind to yourself.

192
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,573
Seriously, Manju.
You're just too much.

193
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,701
She's happy, isn't she?

194
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,406
You see, Mili scares off the boys.

195
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,014
And they run away.

196
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,477
Maybe you like girls.

197
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,581
Oh please! Shut you mouth.

198
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,345
Like girl, huh!

199
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,080
This time...if not an Indian
cricketer, then Indian royalty!

200
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,748
And if you don't like any of them..

201
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,323
...then you can marry
some boring doctor of CA.

202
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,691
I won't attend that marriage.

203
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,425
Manju, he's as old as dad.

204
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,634
And you know...l am not
interested in boys right now.

205
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,326
And no one stays.

206
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,130
Mili, after meeting Shaina..

207
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,140
...I felt like I met my soul mate.

208
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,375
And there's nothing
common between us.

209
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,748
Forget it, Mili.

210
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,153
You can never control your mouth.

211
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,749
And you will never change.

212
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,124
Mili, don't you understand
the meaning of being formal?

213
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,587
Keep your feet down.

214
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,687
Isn't this formal?

215
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,428
It's not my fault.

216
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,431
You shouldn't take
old breakups to head...

217
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,004
And in any case,
those idiots weren't good for you.

218
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,301
It was just bad luck, dear.

219
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,106
Fate changes in even] <i>2</i> years.

220
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,577
And you just came
out of a bad phase.

221
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,451
So you can add <i>2</i> years
for even] silly boyfriend.

222
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,320
Now it's only going
to be good luck, dear.

223
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,481
Manju, you're just too much?

224
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,412
Just listen to me Manju..

225
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,710
..this King is old and married.

226
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,084
And I don't want to get married.
I am fine single.

227
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,653
Now say hi to Sumati.

228
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,680
Hi.

229
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,355
Are you happy now?

230
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,258
Did you get the recipe
for the pickles?

231
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,092
No Manju, I am riding in a Ferrari.

232
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,335
Like I said,
there's a transport strike.

233
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,297
I took the wrong flight.

234
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,667
..and arrived a day earlier.

235
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,564
That's why..

236
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,565
Oh!

237
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,505
Oh my God!

238
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,445
Oh...

239
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,453
Manju will go crazy.

240
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,294
I'll have to take a picture.

241
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,531
I no longer have the charisma,
nor do you.

242
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,706
Even you're growing
old in my company.

243
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,633
Absolutely wrong.

244
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,711
A man grows old in
his mind, not his body.

245
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,511
Oh! flowers!

246
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,081
And you are?

247
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,740
Dr. Mili Chakravany.

248
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,518
Ahh, Dr. Chakravany.

249
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:21,691
The 40th physiotherapist.
- May I?

250
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,618
What on earth are you doing?

251
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,685
Get away from my feet.

252
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,996
<i>30"‘!-</i>

253
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,599
Take her to Ramsevak.

254
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,624
Come, madam.
- Good day.

255
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,769
Please take a seat,
her highness will be here shortly.

256
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,181
Cool.

257
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,728
WOW!

258
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,310
Hi, Dr. Mili Chakravany.

259
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,711
Ramsevak!

260
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,411
Careful.

261
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,477
Let go. Leave it.

262
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,583
Thank you.

263
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,356
Oh, God.

264
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,760
Oh God, it's so heavy.

265
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,761
How on earth did anyone wear this?

266
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,760
It's been in our
family for 400 years.

267
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,369
That old.

268
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,573
Don't you have
junk-sellers in Sambhalgarh?

269
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,605
Bad joke.

270
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,174
How beautiful.

271
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,741
Are those real pearls?

272
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,638
Of course they are real pearls.

273
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,742
Ramsevak, please show
Dr. Chakravany her room.

274
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,488
She must be tired.
- I am..

275
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,013
Dinner is at 8.

276
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,114
See you there.

277
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,691
Aunty.

278
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,660
You can call me your highness.

279
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,359
Your highness, your heels
are too high for your age.

280
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,993
You can wear slippers at home.

281
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,037
Even oﬂhotic slippers
might be good for you.

282
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,106
Otherwise you can suffer
from plantar fasciitis.

283
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,972
Ramsevak. Excuse me please.

284
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,045
See you.

285
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,348
'Great start Mili .'

286
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,325
Thank you, Ramsevak.

287
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,594
I request to take your leave, madam.

288
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,158
Just Mili.

289
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,061
I request to take your leave, madam.

290
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,769
Cool.

291
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,780
Awesome.

292
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,048
I request.

293
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,402
<i>30"‘!-</i>

294
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,532
Sorry, I am late.

295
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,703
Hi, Ramsevak.
Hi, Queen. Hi, King.

296
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,037
Thank you.

297
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,083
Hi, I am Mili.
- Divya.

298
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,607
Nice to meet you.

299
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,593
<i>'Oh no!'</i>

300
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,470
Sorry!

301
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,743
Chicken. Thanks.

302
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,052
Sorry!

303
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,459
You people are quite formal.

304
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,121
We Punjabis are quite cool,
you know.

305
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:24,132
I mean there's no place for
formality on the dining table.

306
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,663
I thought you're Bengali?

307
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,635
No, I am a Punjabi.

308
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,801
Actually. . .Nlanju's a Punjabi. .

309
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,575
..and we've all taken
after her, even dad.

310
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,641
Manju is your sister?

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,811
No, Manju is my mother.

312
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,057
It's my mother!

313
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,128
I'll keep it in my pocket.

314
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,135
So do you have a boyfriend?

315
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,078
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

316
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,577
Are you serious?

317
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,150
When I was your age, I had two.

318
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,146
But I was a bit confused.

319
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,216
Divya is preparing for Oxford.

320
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:26,119
And, Dr. Chakravany,
we don't talk while eating.

321
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,131
<i>30"‘!-</i>

322
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,795
Actually, I thought you all
must be so busy the whole day..

323
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,199
..that, dinner must be the
only time you get to talk.

324
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,364
So I thought even l..

325
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,171
Dr. Chakravany.

326
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,106
Ramsevak, please tell
her the rest of the rules.

327
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,612
Chicken's a bit undercooked.

328
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:55,424
How will the patient get better
in this atmosphere?

329
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,324
But something needs to be done.

330
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,032
Chocolate!

331
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,085
Load shedding here too?

332
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,129
'A thief in my room.'

333
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,765
Thief!

334
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,442
'Good looking thief!'

335
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,678
'How do I hit her?'

336
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,247
Who are you?
- Who are you?

337
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,456
I am from Delhi.

338
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,356
If you try to flirt with me,
I'll teach you a lesson.

339
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,520
This is my room and keep that down.

340
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,493
'This is my. .'

341
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,288
Oh..

342
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,330
This isn't my room.

343
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,333
But who are you?

344
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,204
<i>Vikram Singh Remote.</i>

345
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,277
King Shekhar Singh's son.

346
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,342
Oh, prince.

347
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,271
You're a prince?

348
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,406
Who are you?
- Mili.

349
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,281
Mili Chakravany.
Dr. Mili Chakravany.

350
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:39,221
I am the physiotherapist...
of, King Shekhar Singh Rathore.

351
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,289
Ahh...the doctor.

352
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,029
Your room's the other one.

353
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,526
You don't look like a prince at all.

354
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,363
'Shut up Mili, shut up!
Why do you talk so much.'

355
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:55,094
Why? Should it be seen on my face.

356
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,498
Flirting with a girl who is asleep..

357
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,167
..those aren't the
manners of a prince.

358
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,311
And getting in
someone's bed at midnight.

359
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,108
..and kicking him, that's
more like a doctor, isn't it?

360
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,977
Revenge!

361
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,314
Well, that's okay. Scores settled.

362
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,021
Oh, girlfriend.

363
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,351
Doctor, its midnight
and I want to sleep.

364
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,187
Please, go.

365
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,429
She's pretty.

366
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,496
'Snob.'

367
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,265
So what do I call you?

368
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,563
Prince. Junior majesty, Viku.

369
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,004
Viku is nice.

370
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,231
Doctor.
- Yes.

371
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,208
Can you go to your room, please?

372
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,743
Good night prince Viku.
- Good night.

373
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,084
Chocolate!
- Doctor!

374
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,617
'Definitely a snob.'

375
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,418
'Trouble.'

376
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:00,036
This is good.
There's sensation in your legs.

377
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,695
Come on, let's exercise now.

378
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,997
That's all for the day.

379
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,541
I am not interested in exercising.

380
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,339
Sambhalgarh is a beautiful place.

381
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,674
So take a look around..

382
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,736
..and go back home after a few days.

383
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,082
Delhi isn't a bad place
either for sightseeing.

384
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,446
And if I wanted to have fun..

385
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,508
...I would've never come to
this curfew-stricken place.

386
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,054
Come on! Let's exercise.

387
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,249
I never do anything against my will.

388
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,423
'Even the King is a snob.'

389
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,062
Ramsevak, please call his will..

390
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,120
..because he never does anything
that goes against his will.

391
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,425
Ramsevak.

392
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,696
Excuse me, please.

393
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:34,496
Thank you.

394
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,301
'Doesn't he want to get better?'

395
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,309
'Majesty's will'

396
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,039
Do as you please,
I'll leave too.

397
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,678
What do I do?

398
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,068
Looks better now.

399
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,108
Three hour session in one hour.

400
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,303
It's alright, Mili.

401
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,410
These kings were always lazy.

402
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,312
Don't give up.

403
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,353
Maybe he'll get interested
after seeing your interest.

404
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,604
Listen to me, Gautam.
I love you.

405
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,536
L...l can change for you
completely, Gautam.

406
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,438
Divya, he's not worth it.

407
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,668
He's really not worth it.

408
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,734
If that silly Gautam loves you“.

409
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,412
..then let him change himself.

410
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,614
Give me the phone!

411
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,475
I'll talk to him.

412
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,550
Everything will be cleared now.

413
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,584
Give me the phone!

414
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,675
Give me the phone!

415
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,592
"Love is a Game."

416
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,529
“Gautam: No, no. l..

417
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:12,058
Oh...so you want to act?

418
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,568
But please don't tell anyone.

419
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,140
I have to focus only on my studies.

420
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,206
But you can do both.
- Mother will never understand.

421
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,570
Then talk to Vikram?

422
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,544
Vikram's always busy.

423
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,478
If it doesn't concern his business..

424
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,607
..then he doesn't have time for it.

425
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,711
Shall I rehearse
this scene with you?

426
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,215
I have a lot of free time.

427
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,034
<i>Remove, mark my word.</i>

428
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,198
Kiara will leave you and come to me.

429
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,431
Of course, we can't invite you
to the wedding.

430
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,033
But we'll send you the pictures.

431
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,236
Rathore, hello?
- What?

432
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,643
Nothing.

433
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,572
It's dad's new physiotherapist.

434
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,979
New physiotherapist?

435
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,141
Checking her out!
Even I want to.

436
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,082
This girl is trouble.

437
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,211
Doctor!

438
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,656
Hold on, Viku, almost done.

439
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,285
It's best you don't do
these things in these clothes.

440
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:45,457
Why?

441
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,623
You don't have any
dearth of free time.

442
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,198
You can do it during day.

443
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,698
I have free time because
the patient isn't willing.

444
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,605
Don't be sad.

445
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,007
And what do you care?

446
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,006
If they don't value you,
then come back.

447
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,778
Just ignore these kings.

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,741
They act so high and mighty.

449
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,743
Everyone is strange in this family.

450
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,709
They never talk to each other.

451
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,717
And her highness!

452
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,687
Every time she sees me it's as though
she wants to take a bite at me.

453
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,784
Hold on.

454
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,719
Ask that prince
to talk to his father?

455
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,289
He's their only son.

456
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,624
He'll explain his father.

457
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,392
Manju, he's a big bore.

458
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,126
<i>Prince Vikram Singh Remote.</i>

459
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,572
Careful, doctor.
- Yes.

460
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,042
I just need one book...

461
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,712
Sorry!

462
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,761
After the 1st World War,
the plane was given to him.

463
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,696
I really don't
understand how they managed.

464
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,296
..to get it into a room this..

465
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,469
What are you doing?

466
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,739
You can't sit on that.

467
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,774
Sorry. It was for my Facebook.

468
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,617
Dr. Chakravany,
your first session..

469
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,451
..is from 10 to 1, right?
- Yes.

470
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,022
I suggest you focus on that.

471
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,459
Visiting time for
tourists is from 5 to 7.

472
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,791
You can join them.
- Right, aunty.

473
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,693
I mean.. your highness.

474
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,102
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

475
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,032
Shekhar uncle doesn't
want to exercise.

476
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,107
I feel he doesn't want to get well.

477
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,404
Doctor. Please.

478
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,443
Either you can help
Shekhar or you can't.

479
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,777
If you can't help him..

480
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,144
..then your tickets
to go back will be arranged.

481
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,113
Now, please excuse me.

482
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,228
Come in.

483
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,262
Hi, Viku.

484
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,359
Sorry!

485
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,606
Trouble is here.

486
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,778
Sorry!

487
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,079
Are you checking me out?

488
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,648
That's fine. There must not
be much to look at around here.

489
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,786
I couldn't stop myself.

490
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,789
You may?

491
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:38,398
Look, Viku, there's still
sensation in your dad's legs.

492
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,102
This is a big thing.

493
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,497
There is a lot of
scope for improvement.

494
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,231
'There is scope of
improvement here also'

495
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,107
I don't think anyone has
motivated him to exercise.

496
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,436
And he doesn't want to get
better himself, you know.

497
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,805
And everyone here is
busy with either business..

498
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,572
..or rules and regulations.

499
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,242
'Please hurry up I've to go.'

500
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,809
You can't just wash your hands off..

501
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,077
..from your responsibility
by calling a doctor from Delhi.

502
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,723
You have to be
slightly involved, partner.

503
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,717
Doctor...

504
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,556
'I don't know why
I keep calling that.'

505
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,289
you won't understand
our lifestyle.

506
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,692
And anyway,
why would he listen to me?

507
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,767
You are the doctor.

508
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,996
But you're his son.

509
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,767
When Manju drifts
a little offtrack..

510
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,009
“Only I can bring her back.

511
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,268
Take advantage
of being his only son.

512
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,470
Use your power.

513
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,009
Look, if you are
incapable of handling this..

514
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,450
..then you may please leave.
I'll arrange for someone else.

515
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,382
I wonder what the
problem with everyone here is?

516
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,021
Whenever I tn/ to talk to someone.

517
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,113
..they all wriggle
their way out of it.

518
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,692
That's why 40 doctors
have left before.

519
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,458
And as for me,
I've treated Sehwag and Kapoor.

520
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,032
When I feel that I can't handle it,
then I'll leave.

521
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,133
Sorry!

522
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,670
I don't think I can have
any influence on him..

523
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,112
...but, I will still try.. Alright?

524
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,475
Really?

525
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,180
Thanks, Viku.

526
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,134
Doctor!

527
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,198
Ramsevak, what's going on?

528
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,566
It's a small little party.

529
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,368
Prem Singh's son got
admitted to an MBA program.

530
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,574
Party!

531
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:30,645
Take a seat.

532
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,642
Move aside.

533
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,474
This is my glass, okay!

534
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,586
What's his son's name?

535
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,621
Krishna.

536
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,622
To Krishna!

537
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,159
Krishna!

538
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,098
One more.

539
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,640
This is how you party!

540
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:25,177
Ramu uncle,
I am going back to Delhi.

541
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,721
So soon?

542
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,084
My father was right.

543
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,996
Never spend more than
15 minutes with your patient.

544
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,065
They don't respect you.

545
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,569
Come, tell me your problem.

546
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,372
Take your prescription,
pay your fee and go.

547
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,034
They're treating me like
a live-in son-in-law here.

548
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,680
Shekhar uncle is a good man,
you know.

549
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,016
Had he come to my home..

550
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,075
..| would've cured him in 10 days.

551
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,011
Have you seen the ambience here?

552
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:04,121
Forget him..
no one can get better here.

553
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,723
His Majesty is filled with regret.

554
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,733
What?

555
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:18,168
He lost his elder
son in that accident.

556
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,505
<i>Amber.</i>

557
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,513
He was just 20 years old.

558
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,017
His Majesty had gifted
him a sports car.

559
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:34,989
Both father and son
went out for a drive.

560
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,085
Ambar was driving too fast.

561
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,755
He didn't survive the accident.

562
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,032
His Majesty was in coma for
6 months after the accident.

563
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,075
Her highness handled everything.

564
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,543
Since then she changed drastically.

565
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,314
Everyone was so happy.

566
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,051
The King and Queen would play polo.

567
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,662
Party every daY-

568
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,024
Everything is ruined, Mili.

569
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,308
Good morning, Papa.

570
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,504
Oh!

571
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,514
Son, where did the
sun rise from today?

572
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,117
May I come in?
- Of course.

573
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,036
How are you?

574
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,744
Fine. Absolutely fine.

575
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,142
Good, thank you.

576
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,152
I see.

577
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,295
Is your cigar stock okay?

578
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,161
It's okay.

579
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,469
Good.

580
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,370
Papa!

581
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:46,221
Your doctor,
Dr. Mili Chakravany.

582
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,625
She was saying that.

583
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:53,822
..you aren't focusing
on your exercise.

584
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:58,224
I see. So now she's got to you.

585
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:03,162
I think it's time to drive her away.

586
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,163
Yes.

587
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,734
No!

588
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,310
If you don't want
to exercise, then..

589
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,713
..it's quite alright,
it's your wish.

590
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,120
There's no point in trying, is it?

591
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:23,649
Right.

592
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,392
I'll take your leave,
I have a meeting.

593
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:27,486
Of course.

594
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,425
Go. Wish you all the best.

595
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,488
Nice catching up with you.

596
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,231
He is here.

597
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:44,611
Dr. Chakravany, I guess it's
time to drive you out of here.

598
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,445
I was thinking the same thing.
- What?

599
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,485
Together we should drive
Dr. Chakravany out of here.

600
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,516
What?

601
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,453
She's completely useless.

602
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,557
Now I am just Mili.

603
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,058
And I was wondering,
now that I am here..

604
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,526
...I should enjoy the
royal life for a few days.

605
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,331
A common man doesn't
get such opportunities.

606
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,525
Right, Ramu uncle?

607
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,436
Teach me something about wine!

608
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:12,568
You really won't make me exercise?

609
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,574
Not at all.

610
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:16,571
What if Nirmala finds out?

611
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,647
Other than you and me,
only Ramu uncle knows about it.

612
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:25,248
Yes, Ramu uncle is our old butler.

613
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,480
Right, Ramu . .uncle?

614
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,424
Master.

615
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,787
Cheers.

616
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,525
Divya is so cute.

617
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,571
What's this!

618
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,342
What are you doing to the Queen?

619
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,603
There was a time..

620
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,478
...when I was an expert
in “sticking my leg“.

621
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,491
The famous "tang adana"

622
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,496
This is my favorite
photo of you two.

623
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,665
Taken by that American, right?

624
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,601
He should be thankful...

625
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:22,611
..that he wasn't killed
after taking this photo.

626
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,444
I was so angry.

627
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,483
And your father,
he was laughing like crazy.

628
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,080
Later he bought it.

629
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,645
Framed it and presented it
to me on our anniversary.

630
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,484
Well, at least this
way we could capture..

631
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,027
..your famous "tang adana" moment.

632
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,589
That time is gone,
and so are my legs.

633
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,269
That's no problem.

634
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,272
We'll bring that time back.

635
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,342
What's this?

636
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,771
Tennis.

637
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,137
Press A and serve.

638
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,748
What!

639
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:02,707
Serve!

640
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,683
Point!

641
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,651
Point!

642
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,156
Iwin.

643
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,586
Point!

644
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,627
Point!

645
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,725
Ready!

646
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,662
Turn!

647
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,275
Bravo tiger!

648
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,593
Bravo tiger!

649
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,608
Rinsing your mouth with wine!

650
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,710
I'm seeing this for the first time.

651
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:15,053
Now I understand where
dad's wine collection is going.

652
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,982
You scared me.

653
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:20,018
And Shekhar uncle gifted
this to me personally.

654
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,724
Actually, it's a bribe..

655
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:24,461
..so I don't make him exercise.

656
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,092
Come, sit down.

657
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,999
Feel at home.

658
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,632
'The snob is looking handsome.'

659
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,710
Drink this.

660
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,119
Cheers!

661
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:52,626
Doctor.

662
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:53,661
Mili.

663
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:55,755
Mili.

664
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,330
I saw dad happy after a long time.

665
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,635
Prince, just wait and
watch what happens next.

666
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,648
'VVhat now?'
- 'VVhat now?'

667
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,608
So...how's your fiancé?

668
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,684
Kiara, right?

669
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,020
She is fine.

670
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,994
Can I ask you something?

671
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,291
Were you a frog
before you kissed Kiara..

672
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,355
...Ol" are YOU one now?

673
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,197
Think. Think.

674
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,464
You have kissed Kiara, right?

675
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:49,017
And...your boyfriend?

676
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,345
No. I am completely off men.

677
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,252
They can't handle my
spontaneous personality.

678
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,391
They say "Don't do this,
don't do that"..

679
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,620
"Don't dress like that"..
- Don't sit like that.

680
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,956
Yeah . Sorry!

681
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,661
Anyway,
all that sobbing and crying“.

682
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,336
...heart-breaking after 'The End'.

683
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,701
Can't handle it.

684
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:17,638
So... are you going to party
in the kitchen again today?

685
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,971
You saw?

686
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,016
Why didn't you come inside then?

687
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,711
It was really fun.

688
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:30,657
Oh! 'VVe Kings don't
party with our subjects.'

689
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,162
Something like that.

690
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,490
It's the opposite, actually.

691
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:38,464
It troubles them, and..

692
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,436
..we don't have time for all this.

693
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,431
That's what Divya
was saying as well.

694
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,065
S he's very sweet.

695
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:48,439
Does she want to go to Oxford..

696
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,705
..or is it because of your mother?

697
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,739
Mother's decisions for
Divya are absolutely right.

698
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,477
And what about what Divya's wants?

699
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,483
Someone should ask
her what she wants.

700
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,316
Mili, this is the Rathore family.

701
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,280
Discipline is everything .

702
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,125
Divya is a Rathore as well..

703
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,989
..and she will do
what's right for her.

704
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,396
And someone else will
decide what's right for her.!

705
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,258
May God bless you with some sense.

706
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,694
You know, you should..

707
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,394
I had to Skype Manju.

708
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,401
Okay, bye!

709
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,479
Mili.

710
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,750
I want to run away from home.

711
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,313
What?

712
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,019
You will pass your exams, cheer up!

713
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:38,751
I know how, let's get you
an interesting hair color.

714
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,762
Actually no,
her highness will kill me.

715
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,394
We can at least change
your nail polish.

716
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,990
Black or purple?

717
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,093
It's not that. I want to act.

718
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,004
This time won't come back.

719
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,532
True.

720
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,010
But running away!

721
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,511
Study.

722
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,207
I am going to send this doctor back.

723
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,076
Is she even a doctor?

724
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,018
She's always jumping
around or chatting.

725
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:07,679
She keeps talking to Divya.

726
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,151
Doesn't let her study.

727
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,154
Always interferes in everything.

728
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,028
But dad looks really happy.

729
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,133
That's exactly why I
haven't sent her back yet.

730
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,068
What are you doing?

731
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,034
What are you doing?

732
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:23,038
Are you ready for the ride of your life?
- Oh my, God!

733
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,099
Move away! Move away!

734
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,337
So fast.

735
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:48,986
He'll fall.

736
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,999
Like Formula 1...

737
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,032
I really had fun today.

738
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,168
Life can still be fun,
Shekhar uncle..

739
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:07,079
..but you just don't allow yourself.

740
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:15,522
Shekhar uncle,
I know what happened 10 years ago.

741
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,224
It's not your fault.

742
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,760
Ambar... It was destiny.

743
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,358
It wasn't your fault.

744
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,268
You're still holding
on to that incident.

745
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,261
Let it go.

746
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:32,301
Otherwise moving ahead
will be really difficult.

747
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:55,128
Dr. Chakravany, we have never
mentioned that incident.

748
00:50:55,219 --> 00:51:00,100
..for 10 years, so what
made you bring it up?

749
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,105
He's my patient, your highness.

750
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,040
Half his problem is his guilt.

751
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:11,235
If he can face it, then there's
a lot of scope for improvement.

752
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,146
Maybe...he can walk again.

753
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,086
No need to give Shekhar
false expectations, doctor.

754
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,749
We left no stone
unturned in his care.

755
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:23,752
And we never will.

756
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,152
I am his doctor, your highness.

757
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,224
I cannot lose hope of
him getting better again.

758
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,133
You're not convinced,
I understand.

759
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,263
But as long as I am here,
I'll do the best I can.

760
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:45,806
<i>Ca“ Dr. sham.</i>

761
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,204
Mom!
- Give me the phone!

762
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,618
Calm, Mili. Calm down.

763
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:01,624
Ram Sevak.

764
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,192
Why would I call
if it wasn't urgent?

765
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,637
He's out of town.

766
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,206
When is he coming back?

767
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:13,733
Shekhar uncle, wait.

768
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,135
<i>Three weeks“!</i>

769
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:16,768
Oh, come on.

770
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,009
Mili. Mili.

771
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,241
Move, Ramu uncle,
I want to talk to my patient.

772
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,548
You can't run, so
you'll have to listen to me.

773
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,179
Maybe I am just another
doctor for you..

774
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,223
..but for me, my
patients are not just my job.

775
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,219
If you're stubborn, then so am I.

776
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,262
What does this mean that you
don't want to get well?

777
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,289
If you don't want to get well,
then why call me?

778
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,026
Look... you have another son,
and a daughter.

779
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,230
At least try for their sake.

780
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:48,243
I understand that the Queen is
not an easy woman to live with.

781
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,538
But what else can the poor woman do?

782
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,738
She has to handle everything“.

783
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,639
..and you're having an
affair with this chair.

784
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,610
You're living with a 10 year
old stow, your Majesty!

785
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,716
As long as I am here,
I'll wait for you until 11 o'clock.

786
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,223
Final?

787
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,283
Now you may 9°-

788
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,231
She is right, dad.

789
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,200
If brother Ambar was alive..

790
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,505
..he too would've
said the same thing.

791
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,130
I think I said too much!

792
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,562
No, no, you did the right thing.

793
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,092
These people never
talk to each other.

794
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,299
Anyway, forget it.

795
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,566
What's done is done.

796
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:54,269
So, tell me..what's happening?
- You tell me!

797
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,305
How's junior Rathore?

798
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,369
He is a royal bore.

799
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,209
Actually...he's a little sweet too.

800
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,279
I called him a frog.

801
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,580
He'll have a change of head,
note it.

802
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,284
Manju, you have a one-track mind.

803
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,284
Have fun, bye.
- Bye.

804
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,574
The horse moves two and half steps.

805
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,344
Check...

806
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,415
...and mate.

807
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,353
Yes!

808
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,189
67...

809
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,364
68...

810
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,256
69...

811
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,235
Enough!
- Nonsense.

812
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,669
You've been doing 120
for the last two days.

813
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,364
You'll have to do 150 today.

814
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,372
Good morning, papa.

815
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,339
Good morning

816
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:34,341
Hi, Viku.

817
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,342
Look, my son's here.

818
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,401
Let me go now.

819
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,345
Viku, you can use his eyes,
ears, nose anything.

820
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:42,213
..but his legs won't stop.

821
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,417
Dad, I am off to
meet Suraj Maan Singh.

822
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,383
Surajgarh Palace.

823
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,321
Do me a favor, take her along.

824
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:53,393
But your exercise
will be left incomplete.

825
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,727
I'll complete it with Ramsevak.
- Promise?

826
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,391
Absolutely.

827
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,025
I'll go change.

828
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,464
But, dad,
I am going for a meeting.

829
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,475
Take her along, son.

830
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,509
You can do your work..

831
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,739
..and she'll take a
look around Surajgarh.

832
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:15,583
And these old legs
will get a day's rest.

833
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,417
Take care. Have fun.

834
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,388
Ramsevak, bring my wine.

835
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,084
It's a day off.

836
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,491
So, Viku, why are we
meeting Suraj Maan Singh?

837
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,396
Not we, I am meeting him.

838
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:33,696
'VVhy did I get her!'

839
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,464
That's what I said.

840
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,470
Fine, why are you
meeting Suraj Maan Singh?

841
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,266
'Patience Vikram'.

842
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:43,774
Because I want to buy Surajgarh..

843
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,445
..and he doesn't want to sell.

844
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,743
Why will he sell it? It's his call.

845
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:49,346
'Put your feet down.'

846
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,484
Because he can't afford it.

847
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,520
And I will build a hotel there.

848
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,517
Only if he sells it?

849
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,421
Would you...wou|d you please
put your feet down?

850
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,456
Sorry!

851
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:05,632
Ucrazy !u

852
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,194
'Snob!'

853
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,600
Doctor, please control
yourself a little.

854
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,213
Call me Dr. control, Viku.

855
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,118
Damn missed.

856
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,425
Now this will be
one high powered meeting.

857
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,153
Your Highness.

858
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,125
Welcome, Prince.

859
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,729
This is Dr. Mili,
dad's physiotherapist.

860
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,494
And he's Suraj Maan Singh.
- Hi.

861
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,467
Your house is really beautiful.

862
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:51,172
My family's been looking
after it for 600 years.

863
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,279
Prince, come shoot.

864
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:58,009
Or has business
turned you into a sutler.

865
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,250
Pull!

866
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,724
Veeru!

867
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,001
Doctor.

868
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:21,441
Would you like to shoot too?
- No, she's against violence.

869
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:24,068
Of course. I love 'Sho|ay'.

870
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:25,371
Oh, God!

871
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,549
on my»

872
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:30,608
May I...

873
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,742
Thanks.

874
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,518
Put the gun butt on your shoulder.
- Okay.

875
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,586
Hands over there.

876
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,555
Pull!

877
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,470
Thanks, Veeru.

878
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:52,763
That's so cool.

879
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,599
Is something going
on between you two?

880
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,268
No.
- No. No.

881
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,202
At least there's nothing on my end.

882
00:58:58,302 --> 00:58:59,679
I don't know about him.

883
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,583
Doctor. You're very beautiful.

884
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:05,986
Thank you.

885
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,620
Come, I'll show you Surajgarh.

886
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:10,284
Sure.
- Shall we finish the meeting first?

887
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,554
Prince...what would you choose..

888
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:17,121
..between a beautiful
doctor and a business deal?

889
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,594
I will wait.

890
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,166
Does this Prince trouble you?

891
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,565
He is a snob, but he is not so bad.

892
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,645
I heard, once there were
300 queens living here.

893
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:32,572
Not Queens, their keeps.

894
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,315
That King is very intelligent.

895
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,584
So he is.

896
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,054
He called me for a meeting,
but avoided it altogether.

897
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,658
He said I am very beautiful.

898
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:58,232
And if you begin to like me,
then I shouldn't reciprocate.

00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,005
'She is beautiful indeed'

900
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,009
But please, don't get
restless worrying about it.

901
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,113
'Snob'

902
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,014
Can I ask you something?

903
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,749
You could be a little sensitive,
he's selling his home.

904
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,284
It's not easy.

905
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,057
I know. But he dug his own grave.

906
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,695
People make mistakes,
haven't you ever made one?

907
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,192
'She..'

908
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,497
I try not to.

909
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,261
'S nob S ingh Rathore'

910
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,806
Why are we stopping here?

911
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:36,044
Come, I'll treat you to
the best tea in this area.

912
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,702
Cool.

913

'Beautiful eyelashes'

919
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,073
What now?

920
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,067
You can be normal,
and you're quite popular as well.

921
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,577
Here you go.

922
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,677
Thank you.

923
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,027
I have a meeting in Sambhalgarh.

924
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,656
It'll take half hour.

925
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,095
So you can take a look
around in the market.

926
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:31,792
Good idea!

927
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,400
I want to buy earrings for Manju.

928
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,731
And...the silver here is
very famous, isn't it?

929
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,073
Right.

930
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,782
See you in half an hour, okay!

931

Actually,
Mister I will be back later.

935
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,461
She is not picking up.

936
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,005
'Maybe I should give a try'

937
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,672
Mister, where's Ganga Theatre?

938
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,005
Straight ahead.

939
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,683
Thank you!

940
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,570
Welcome, Madam. Welcome!

941
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,330
Madam, Hollywood's come to India.

942
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:45,498
Careful!

943
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,333
Come.

944
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:48,801
Come.

945
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,739
Hi!

I have a friend who..
- Madam.

948
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,282
Yes. - Will you shift a
little to the right, please?

949
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,545
Okay?

950
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,983
Serve her a cold drink,
she must be thirsty.

951
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:06,992
Give it.

952
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,997
I have a friend,
she's a good actor.

953
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,128
Thank you!
- Welcome!

954
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,030
Drink it.

955
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:22,438
Actually, even I like acting.

956
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,079
But my friend..
- Madam, in a while.

957
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,110
First close your eyes.

958
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:31,042
And take deep breathes.

959
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,238
I am in a meeting.
- Viku!

960
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,076
Mili, I am busy.

961
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,611
You're always busy.

962
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,550
Are you drunk?

963
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,182
This girl isn't coming to the point.

964
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,423
Hey...the girl's been kidnapped.

965
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:14,593
What?

966
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,130
Are you deaf?

967
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,025
She's been kidnapped.

968
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,393
What do you want?

969
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,098
Viku!!

970
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,142
One million.

971
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,036
Okay.

972
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,181
Yeah!

973
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,116
I am texting you the address.

974
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:39,646
Be there.

975
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:43,147
And yes, if you inform the police..

976
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,254
..then you know the consequences.

977
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,486
Yes!

978
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,231
Please tell Mr. Nakamoro I have to go.

979

01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,181
Congratulations.
- Why?

983
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:13,184
You're the first hostage
of our kidnapping business.

984
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,322
Really?
- Yes.

985
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:21,226
When I got my first patient,
I was happy too.

986
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,443
Half an hour was all I said.

987
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,412
She's really so much trouble.

988
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,789
"O sweet heart."

989
01:05:57,087 --> 01:06:00,091
Someone shut her up,
she is driving us crazy.

990
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,169
“L forgot what comes next.“

991
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,501
"O sweet head..."

992
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,140
Keep quiet!

993
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,272
Here's your money.

994
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,405
Return my guest to me.

995
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,275
Prince!

996
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,343
Dharam Singh?

997
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,278
You?

998
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,548
Greetings, Prince. Greetings.

999
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,350
You've kidnapped our guest,
Dharam Singh.

1000
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,454
Are you out of your mind?

1001
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,720
Pardon me, Prince.

1002
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,020
We didn't know she's your guest.

1003
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,995
I thought she's a tourist.

1004
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:32,260
Bring her here quickly.

1005
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,630
Do you want to get me killed?
- Yes, yes.

1006
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,758
We didn't do anything.

1007
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,470
We didn't do anything, I swear.
- Viku!

1008
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,732
Bring her.
- Hi!

1009
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,304
Now get out of here.

1010
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,172
I don't want to see any of
you in Sambhalgarh again.

1011
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:47,137
Viku, you're so heroic.

1012
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,272
What a rescue.

1013
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,683
I feel sick. I need to breathe.

1014
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:02,194
I don't understand how you
got yourself kidnapped.

1015
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,232
..in just half an hour?

1016
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,600
WE!

1017
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,466
You and who?

1018
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,233
Is there anyone else?

1019
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,174
I... permission...

1020
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,650
How could you be so stupid?

1021
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,383
Sorry, there was an audition.

1022
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,290
Never mind.

1023
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:39,257
But, Viku, you saved me.

1024
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:47,270
Mili, you are drunk.

1025
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:50,831
Hi, Manju, what's up?

1026
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,022
Petrol is up, I am up,
your father's up.

1027
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,693
K's down, idiot's still sleeping.

1028
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,695
You say?
- Nothing!

1029
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,271
I am just getting ready for work.

1030
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:59,999
And your Prince Vikram?

1031
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:00,803
How's he?

1032
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,940
Will you be a princess?

1033
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:02,974
Forget Vikram!

1034
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,306
You're just interested in him.

1035
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,807
I just grew up doing silly stuff.

1036
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,639
If you had straightened me up then..

1037
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,013
..| might've settled down by now..

1038
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,380
..mothering <i>2</i> or 3 kids.

1039
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,709
What did you do now?

1040
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,152
I kissed the frog!

1041
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,721
Oh no, you kissed that bore?

1042
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:19,652
But he's engaged.

1043
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,658
Oh, that's terrible!

1044
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,230
You shou|d've told me
earlier that he is engaged.

1045
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:25,424
What now?

1046
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:26,763
I don't know.

1047
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:28,996
Mili. - Manju,
I can't think straight right now.

1048
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,197
Okay, bye. Bye.
- Mili.

1049
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,865
Oh, God!

1050
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,672
Manju.

1051
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,149
What do I do now?
- Hold on! Hold on!

1052
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,411
Breathe. Deep breaths.

1053
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,952
Are you calm now?

1054
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:54,455
Look, talk to him
clearly and end this story.

1055
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:55,761
That's the best.

1056
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,196
Good idea!

1057
01:10:58,688 --> 01:10:59,792
Good...good idea!

1058
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,702
Good idea, Manju.
I love you.

1059
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,711
Vikram, I wanted to talk to you.

1060
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,008
I think...

1061
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,684
Vikram your papers...

1062
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,752
Hi, your highness.

1063
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:22,818
It's such a pleasant day,
isn't it?

1064
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,762
I'll take Shekhar uncle
out for exercising.

1065
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,134
Vikram!
- Yes.

1066
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,163
Thank you.

1067
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:42,142

01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,129
'Vikram forget about last night'

1082
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,228
‘What happened last night.

1083
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,998
'VVhat do I say?'

1084
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:45,866
Listen.

1085
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,405
Yesterday...
- Yesterday?

1086
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:53,812
'Eyes'

1087
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,015
'Don't stare at the legs'

1088
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:03,856
What happened yesterday between us..

1089
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:06,759
Oh, yesterday.

1090
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,324
Don't think about it.

1091
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,730
These things happen.

1092
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:14,724
'Idiot!'

1093
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,267
Not with me, with people...

1094
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,900
Generally in life.

1095
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,674
'VVhat is she saying?'

1096
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,136
Right?

1097
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,975
So maybe we should forget it.

1098
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:30,079
Obviously, you don't need to ask.

1099
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,014
You were just.

1100
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,781
.. completely drunk.

1101
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:39,952
Absolutely drunk.

1102
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,788
'Please kiss me Vikram.'

1103
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:44,124
'I want to kiss you.'

1104
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:50,838
We were wrong?

1105
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,272
Yes.

1106
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:57,408
And, so what even if we were right.

1107
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:58,977
I mean...

1108
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:03,015
Nothing's possible between us,
I mean..

1109
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,810
'VVhy can't be there anything?'

1110
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:06,676
..you know..

1111
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,316
Yeah!

1112
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,292
You and I are very different people.

1113
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,093
'And I am going to marry Kiara.'

1114
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:16,996
Yes.

1115
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,995
And I won't change myself for anyone.

1116
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:24,964
Right. I think that's
the right thing to do.

1117
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,707
'Good, you said it.. now get out.'

1118
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:29,740
So...

1119
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,311
<i>'Don't go.'</i>
- <i>'Stop me'</i>

1120
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,878
I am...glad we had this conversation“.

1121
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,940
..and it's over.

1122
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,117
'Can I hold you?'
- 'Please.. don't.'

1123
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:47,926
Okay. 8077'!'-.

1124
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,353
Friends, high-five!

1125
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:52,893
High-five!

1126
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,164
Cool. Goodnight.

1127
01:14:59,062 --> 01:14:59,972
'This is for the best'

1128
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,007
Goodnight.

1129
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:02,910
'This is best.'

1130
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:09,010
Thanks. Goodnight.

1131
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:10,249
Goodnight.

1132
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:33,830
High-five.

1133
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:39,079
Why are you troubling me
so early in the morning?

1134
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,103
If you can't sleep..

1135
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,188
We're going to exercise here today.

1136
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,323
'In an effort to
be away from your son'

1137
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,354
It's been so many years
since I last came here.

1138
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,021
WOW!

1139
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,100
'NO, NO, NO, NO!'

1140
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:04,036
Oh! Vikram!

1141
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,067
Vikram, didn't you sleep last night.

1142
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,808
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

1143
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,272
'VVhy is he here?'

1144
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:19,652
Good to see you up here.
- Mi|i's idea.

1145
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,752
I had completely forgotten
how beautiful it is up here.

1146
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,159
I am going to Mumbai today.
- I see.

1147
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,252
'Vvhy?
- 'To be away from you, Mili.'

1148
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,630
Don't work so hard,
you'll become boring.

1149
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:40,071
Bye, dad.

1150
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,734
Bye, Vikram.

1151
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,344
Bye, Mili.

1152
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,116
Let's exercise.

1153
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:18,244
You kissed the girl,
not her mother.

1154
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,180
It's not funny.

1155
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:23,306
I am not being funny.

1156
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,247
A boy and girl meet.

1157
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,015
They develop an attraction.

1158
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,180
They kiss.

1159
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,313
It happens with everyone.

1160
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,015
It happened with you too,
that's it.

1161
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,220
She says the same thing.

1162
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,193
She's a smart girl.

1163
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:40,994
Is she hot?

1164
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,197
She's hot.

1165
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,169
What will I tell Kiara?

1166
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,397
What do you want to tell Kiara?

1167
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,204
Rathore, I hope you
aren't feeling guilty?

1168
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,246
Maybe.

1169
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,343
I've invited her home tomorrow.

1170
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,013
You invited Kiara?

1171
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,175
You invited Kiara home?

1172
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,311
Are you mad?

1173
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,719
Do you know anything about girls?

1174
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,324
Okay.

1175
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,628
In the last 36 hours, you
saved Mili from the kidnappers.

1176
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:09,354
Fine.

1177
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,130
You kissed her in your
inebriated state.

1178
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,097
Okay.

1179
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:13,225
Later, you gave
high-fives to each other..

1180
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,200
..and now you two are best friends.

1181
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:16,732
Fine.

1182
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,167
But now...you've inviting Kiara..

1183
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,138
..in the same house where Mili is.

1184
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,641
That is too much.

1185
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,274
It's cruelty against women.

1186
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,145
If you want to talk to Kiara,
then do it in her home.

1187
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:29,242
And don't tell her anything
about your 'Mili Adventure'.

1188
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:31,277
Nothing.

1189
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,754
Little more. Little more up.

1190
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,284
Amazing.

1191
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,155
I'll call everyone.
- No, no, no.

1192
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,383
Let's give them a surprise.
- Okay.

1193
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,994
Let's do little more.
- That's the spirit.

1194
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,928
Wait.

1195
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,399
You think I'll be able to do
anything until the wedding?

1196
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,860
Whose wedding?

1197
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:51,403
Vikram's marriage, with Kiara.

1198
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:58,304
Didn't anyone tell you
the wedding is in December!

1199
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:54,000
Hi, Vikram.
- Hi.

1200
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,327
Congratulations!

1201
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:57,802
F0 r?

1202
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:01,371
I heard you're getting
married in December.

1203
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,115
You two look really good together.

1204
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:41,764
Running away?

1205
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:42,875
I don't know.

1206
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,773
Of course, you should
do what your head says.

1207
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,443
But have you tried speaking to Vikram?

1208
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:51,751
Brother Vikram, he's just like mother.

1209
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:53,921
Although he looks modern..

1210
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:55,952
..but his thoughts are outdated.

1211
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:02,929
Okay, Manju, nice speaking to you.

1212
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:04,157
It felt really nice.

1213
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,257
Yes, yes.
- Bye!

1214
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,233
Mili, have you lost your mind?

1215
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,066
I'm peeling oranges in my bedroom.

1216
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,128
..and you're introducing me
to royalty.

1217
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:16,274
Why don't you call?
- Yes, Manju, we couldn't talk.

1218
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,778
But I am busy with Shekhar uncle.

1219
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,235
He wants to be able to walk until..

1220
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:22,043
..Vikram's wedding in December.

1221
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,243
I see. So his marriage has
also been fixed. Wow!

1222
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:27,353
When his wife comes home..

1223
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,320
..you can help her exercise as well.

1224
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,984
Have you planned to be
on their wedding welcome committee?

1225
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,418
Hi, Mili.

1226
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,328
Hi, Vikram!

1227
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:42,961
Where's dad?

1228
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:45,335
He's gone downstairs,
I am talking to my mom.

1229
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,339
Manju, Vikram.

1230
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:47,833
Vikram, Manju.

1231
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,277
Hello, ma'am.

1232
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,007
<i>Vikram Singh Remote.</i>

1233
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,775
Hello. Nice to meet you too.

1234
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:03,255
I have to go look for dad,
so...hope to see you soon.

1235
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,255
Bye.

1236
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:12,360
Bye, Mili.
- Bye, Vikram.

1237
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,397
You love him!
- No, I don't.

1238
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,105
Okay, bye. I have to go.

1239
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:23,703
Sir.

1240
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,143
Prince.
- Sir.

1241
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:27,679
Tomorrow at 5 pm.

1242
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:29,748
Yes, sir.

1243
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,781
And yes, bring Dr. Mili along.

1244
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,786
I've got a stiff neck.

1245
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,680
Don't come without her.

1246
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,681
Sir?

1247
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:48,226
Hi, Vikram.

1248
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:49,726
Hello, Mili.

1249
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,195
Yes, Viku.

1250
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,365
Your fan club is growing.
- What?

1251
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,202
I mean Suraj Maan Singh's called
me for a meeting in the morning.

1252
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:01,212
And he's insisted that
you come along too..

1253
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,644
..as he's got a stiff neck.

1254
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:06,718
Oh...are you feeling jealous?

1255
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,653
I don't have those
old age problems.

1256
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:12,686
So, do you have one of
those youngsteﬁs problems?

1257
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,654
Like deceptive appearances..

1258
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,391
Thanks.

1259
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,360
Tomorrow morning at 11am.

1260
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:35,414
Is Suraj Maan Singh selling his house?

1261
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:38,049
Yes.

1262
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,021
I don't want to see him like this.

1263
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,723
That's how business is done.

1264
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,225
It's not like with you doctors.

1265
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,390
Noble, selfless.

1266
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,993
Who said doctors are selfless?

1267
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:54,827
The only difference is,
we only benefit..

1268
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,665
..when our patients benefit.

1269
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:15,687
I don't know whether
it was a good idea..

1270
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,190
..to come here and surprise Mili.

1271
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,385
At someone e|se's home. Manju!

1272
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,951
She's our daughter.

1273
01:25:23,152 --> 01:25:24,790
We can surprise her
whenever we want.

1274
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,296
And we aren't here to
cause them any inconvenience.

1275
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:29,391
We're staying at a hotel,
and also paying for it.

1276
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:30,830
We're not staying with them.

1277
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,238
This girl I tell you...

1278
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,831
I've tried calling her
15 times, but..

1279
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:37,810
...I wonder where she's
disappeared to without her phone.

1280
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,109
This must be an antique.

1281
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:45,649
Hello.

1282
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,779
I am Nirmala Devi Rathore.

1283
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:50,680
Are you Dr. Chakravany's parents?
- Yes.

1284
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:53,053
I am Pratik, Mi|i's father.

1285
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:56,720
And she's Manju, her mother.
- Hello.

1286
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:58,187
Take a seat.

1287
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:03,168
<i>30"‘!-</i>

1288
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,236
Actually, we came here
to surprise Mili.

1289
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:11,043
But we were shocked instead.
The girl's missing!

1290
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,839
You've maintained
the house quite well.

1291
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,748
Thank you.

1292
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,016
But Mi|i..

1293
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,347
Dr. Chakravany isn't missing.

1294
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:22,845
She's gone to meet
King Suraj Maan Singh..

1295
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,857
..with my son Vikram.

1296
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:26,655
What?

1297
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:28,829
He sprained his neck.

1298
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:30,796
They will be back by evening.

1299
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,688
Is it far?

1300
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,792
About 300 kilometers.

1301
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:40,767
I hope...this time she is travelling
in a car, not like the last time.

1302
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,809
She is travelling by car.

1303
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:45,839
Vikram's gone with her.

1304
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:52,114
Well, actually you're so sweet,
I didn't mean anything.

1305
01:26:52,808 --> 01:26:53,809
Just like that.

1306
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:57,724
Excuse me.

1307
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,224
That's an antique,
if you don't mind.

1308
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,325
By the way, Mili was saying..

1309
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,664
..that you have to follow a lot of
rules and regulations here.

1310
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,706
Does your husband agree?

1311
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,679
Hello, hello, hello.

1312
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:25,877
Manju, we've already met.

1313
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,684
Hello.

1314
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,184
You're looking really smart in this coat.
- I see.

1315
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:33,293
You must be Pratik?

1316
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:34,753
Hello!

1317
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:37,163
She's my daughter Divya.

1318
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:38,721
Hello.
- Hello.

1319
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,795
Sit, sit, sit.

1320
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:45,771
No one has ever been able to
force me to do anything.

1321
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:48,398
But your daughter is stubborn.

1322
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,774
I've never seen a doctor like her.

1323
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:54,279
She is scolding me to better health.

1324
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:02,848
Greetings Sir!

1325
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:04,851
Come, Prince.

1326
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,889
Hello, Dr. Mili.
- Good afternoon.

1327
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,595
Do you still have a stiff neck?

1328
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:15,829
It wasn't there since this morning.
- That's Good.

1329
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,768
So the Prince is adamant on
separating me from my palace.

1330
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:23,933
He brought you along.

1331
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:26,946
Sir, I tried hard that
this doesn't happen.

1332
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,809
But people never listen to me.

1333
01:28:31,707 --> 01:28:32,811
Sir!

1334
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,785
Yes, Prince.

1335
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:37,822
On to business.

1336
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,824
Take a look.
- May I take your leave.

1337
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:44,857
Be nice.

1338
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:51,870
Sir..

1339
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:56,136
Sir, there's an idea in my mind.

1340
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:58,141
Don't try to haggle anymore.

1341
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,873
I've made up my mind, because..

1342
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,778
..you've accepted my
terms and conditions.

1343
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,282
And that is that.

1344
01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:07,780
Sir, I was thinking.

1345
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,084
...let's run Surajgarh in partnership.

1346
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,893
Your residence wing will stay
dedicated to you.

1347
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,396
We'll build a hotel in
the rest of the area.

1348
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:20,297
You won't have to sell your property.

1349
01:29:21,223 --> 01:29:23,829
In fact, your contribution to
the business will be your palace..

1350
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,896
..and ours will be our finance.

1351
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:29,805
Vikram...

1352
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,171
Sir, I feel if you stay here..

1353
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:36,442
..it will add to the
heritage value of the place.

1354
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:39,018
You'll also be on
the board of directors.

1355
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,089
Like I said, your
privacy will be guaranteed.

1356
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,792
I wasn't wrong.

1357
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:55,962
Your game is really unique.

1358
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:01,907
Lets shake hands.

1359
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,034
<i>Farmer.</i>

1360
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:12,982
Let's celebrate!

1361
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,053
Radheshyam!

1362
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:15,914
Champagne!

1363
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:19,024
No, no, no..abso|ute|y not.

1364
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:23,018
You're our guests today.
- So sweet.

1365
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:25,058
Thank you.

1366
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:28,961
Excuse me.

1367
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:30,764
I'll make the arrangements.

1368
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:33,095
Sit, sit, sit, be comfortable.

1369
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:34,867
Have some biscuits.

1370
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:42,776
Young man,
you will stay here tonight.

1371
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:47,252
Radheshyam has prepared
the royal suite for you.

1372
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,055
No, no, we should go home.

1373
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,325
Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

1374
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,154
You have to stay here tonight.

1375
01:30:59,388 --> 01:31:01,163
That's my order.

1376
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,727
Viku, he's right.

1377
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:06,928
I don't want to die young.

1378
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,039
I am too hot.

1379
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,710
Please come.

1380
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,012
Careful.

1381
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:28,918
Hey..

1382
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:56,383
What happened?

1383
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:05,297
You're making me have
strange thoughts, Viku.

1384
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:10,258
'Me too.

1385
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:12,832
Alone all night, with him?

1386
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,032
No, no, no.

1387
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:16,167
What are you saying, Manju?
- Nothing.

1388
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:17,801
Go to sleep.

1389
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:20,008
Even/thing's wrong.

1390
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:22,341
What if she got emotional?

1391
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:26,314
What's the point staying guard,
when the dog ate the flour.

1392
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,210
You can't trust boys.

1393
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:31,689
They will kiss first
and later say sorry.

1394
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,089
Best friends.

1395
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:34,955
Oh, God!

1396
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:39,226
No, Manju.
It's time to talk openly.

1397
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:41,893
Come on, Manju.

1398
01:32:42,124 --> 01:32:43,330
Buck up.

1399
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,761
'Should we sleep together
on the same bed'

1400
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:16,299
'Nothing will happen!'

1401
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:18,966
'That's a lie'

1402
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:23,037
I'll sleep there.

1403
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,338
Safe.

1404
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:26,871
'Oh no.'
- 'Oh no.'

1405
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,948
Good night, Mili.

1406
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:39,314
Good night, Viku.

1407
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:52,000
Mrs. Chakravany,
what happened?

1408
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:53,037
In the middle of the night.

1409
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:55,267
My days and nights
have become the same..

1410
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,707
..since this has happened.

1411
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:58,938
Look, I'll straight come
to the point.

1412
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,446
What can be done about
this Kiara character?

1413
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:03,682
Sorry, what?

1414
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:07,218
Your son Vikram loves
my daughter Mili.

1415
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:10,213
He's told you about
the kissing, right?

1416
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:13,384
But Vikram's engaged. Right?

1417
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:16,387
He didn't tell you.

1418
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:20,155
Your son Vikram kissed
my daughter Mili.

1419
01:34:20,622 --> 01:34:23,068
Since he kissed her,
that means he loves her.

1420
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:24,795
But he's engaged.

1421
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,338
And my daughter Mili
is stuck in the middle.

1422
01:34:27,696 --> 01:34:30,176
So you will have to talk
to him, isn't it?

1423
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,744
Please, please, Mrs. Chakravany.

1424
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:35,976
I don't know anything about it.

1425
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:37,345
When they come back tomorrow.

1426
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,043
...all your misconceptions
will be cleared.

1427
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:42,054
For me, my 8 hours
of sleep is very important.

1428
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,056
For now, get some rest, please.

1429
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:45,090
What?

1430
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:47,658
Goodnight, Mrs. Chakravany.

1431
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:53,422
Goodnight?

1432
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,068
They are all the same.

1433
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:00,139
Royal madhouse!

1434
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:20,383
What happened? Can't sleep?
- No.

1435
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,725
I can't either.

1436
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,351
Something looks
different here, doesn't it?

1437
01:36:04,626 --> 01:36:05,798
What happened?

1438
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:08,634
I'm getting strange
thoughts again, Viku.

1439
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,604
What are you, Mili?

1440
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,973
You say whateveﬁs on your mind.

1441
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,145
No filter.

1442
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:18,979
Why hesitate in speaking the truth?

1443
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:28,718
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you speak what's on your mind.

1444
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,797
You should keep some
things concealed in your heart

1445
01:36:32,654 --> 01:36:33,655
Yes.

1446
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:39,702
So that...when we're
old we have some regrets.

1447
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:45,809
“L wish I had said that,
or done that“

1448
01:36:49,838 --> 01:36:51,681
I am not like that.

1449
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,714
I say whateveﬁs on my mind.

1450
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:04,891
It's quite cold tonight.

1451
01:37:05,086 --> 01:37:06,690
Here, take this.

1452
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:23,715
Vikram!

1453
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,653
I am in love with you.

1454
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,759
Mili, please..

1455
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:46,865
Vikram!

1456
01:38:47,155 --> 01:38:49,863
Sorry, Vikram is here.
I'll call you later.

1457
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:50,895
Mother.

1458
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,869
Vikram!
- Hello.

1459
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:54,270
Vikram, Divya isn't at home.

1460
01:38:54,329 --> 01:38:55,933
It's what I was afraid of.

1461
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:57,842
She ran away.

1462
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,411
Look at this letter.

1463
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:01,874
She's written that
she'll be back in a few days.

1464
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,813
Look at her handwriting.

1465
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,416
She still erases her
mistakes with her spit.

1466
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:08,847
Where has Divya gone?
She hasn't written anything.

1467
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,882
Don't worn].

1468
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,157
Mi|i's handwriting was bad as well.

1469
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:16,896
Yes, but she never ran away.

1470
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:19,921
And it's possible that.

1471
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:22,866
..Divya couldn't find
an eraser in a hum].

1472
01:39:22,924 --> 01:39:23,959
So she...

1473
01:39:24,025 --> 01:39:26,301
Vikram, is it the 27th today?
- Yes. It is.

1474
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,361
Why?

1475
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,366
There's a Bollywood
Star Reality Show..

1476
01:39:30,966 --> 01:39:32,445
..which is being
held in Jaipur today.

1477
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:36,039
So, what has a Bollywood
show got to do with Divya?

1478
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:38,777
Divya wants to be an actress.

1479
01:39:40,342 --> 01:39:41,980
I'll find out.

1480
01:39:42,944 --> 01:39:45,015
Dr. Chakravany, since you had..

1481
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:48,252
...such heart-to-heart
discussions with Divya..

1482
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:50,353
..then she might
have told you that.

1483
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,994
..we don't want her to do this?

1484
01:39:53,755 --> 01:39:56,736
Didn't you think it was your
responsibility to tell us?

1485
01:39:56,925 --> 01:39:58,063
Or to warn her?

1486
01:39:58,359 --> 01:39:59,702
She's just a kid.

1487
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:01,202
Or it doesn't make
a difference to you?

1488
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:03,707
Your highness, that's not it.

1489
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:05,004
Divya wanted to go herself.

1490
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,741
So that's why you took
this decision for my daughter.

1491
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,042
Don't forget, Doctor.

1492
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:12,978
You're here for Shekhar's treatment.

1493
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,017
Not for Divya's career counseling.

1494
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:18,055
Don't.
- Excuse me. Don't say that.

1495
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,023
Even she is low on tolerance.

1496
01:40:20,315 --> 01:40:23,262
But still she stayed put
for your husband's treatment.

1497
01:40:23,418 --> 01:40:24,920
Hold on, Manju.

1498
01:40:25,086 --> 01:40:28,090
Your highness, please try
to understand Divya's situation..

1499
01:40:28,123 --> 01:40:31,036
Doctor Chakravany,
this is beyond your understanding.

1500
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:34,003
..so please don't even tn].
- Excuse me, madam.

1501
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:35,969
Actually, even we are pan Rajputs.

1502
01:40:36,064 --> 01:40:38,738
He's a Bengali and I am a Punjabi.

1503
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,939
But we have Rajput
blood in our veins.

1504
01:40:41,002 --> 01:40:43,004
I am not talking to you.

1505
01:40:43,438 --> 01:40:45,884
Dr. Chakravany, your thoughts.

1506
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:48,352
“Your interference
in other's lives..

1507
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:51,349
Have you ever thought about
its outcome?

1508
01:40:51,913 --> 01:40:55,451
You encouraged a 17
year old kid to run away.

1509
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:57,353
How irresponsible.

1510
01:40:57,452 --> 01:40:59,363
But, your highness, I did no such thing..
- Enough.

1511
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,421
Let's go, Mili.

1512
01:41:00,755 --> 01:41:02,757
There is no need
to explain her anything.

1513
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:03,699
Come on.

1514
01:41:03,825 --> 01:41:06,169
It's because of your over-discipline.
Are you happy now?

1515
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:07,763
Happy-
- Wait, Manju.

1516
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:08,705
Mother.

1517
01:41:08,763 --> 01:41:09,673
What happened?

1518
01:41:10,298 --> 01:41:11,743
I've informed the Jaipur office.

1519
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:14,244
They're checking whether Divya's
name is on the list or not. - Okay.

1520
01:41:14,669 --> 01:41:15,841
And I've informed the
commissioner of Jaipur.

1521
01:41:15,937 --> 01:41:17,780
He's posted his men at
the venue and stations.

1522
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:19,374
They will let us know.

1523
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:22,013
Son..
- Vikram!

1524
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:24,746
Divya is 17 year old.

1525
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:26,090
She's a grown up now.

1526
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,921
Dr. Chakravany, please.

1527
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:32,729
Don't give us anymore
advice on my daughter.

1528
01:41:32,787 --> 01:41:33,424
Enough!

1529
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:34,428
Enough!

1530
01:41:35,123 --> 01:41:36,966
How much more humiliation
are we going to endure?

1531
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:38,092
Oh yes.

1532
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,972
She believes that you and
Dr. Chakravany love each other.

1533
01:41:43,064 --> 01:41:44,008
Manju?

1534
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,011
Thank God.
I don't believe in such nonsense.

1535
01:41:47,168 --> 01:41:48,044
Nonsense?

1536
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,944
Hello. It's a fact.

1537
01:41:51,005 --> 01:41:54,009
Look, there's guilt
in your son's eyes.

1538
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:55,348
Pardon me, madam.

1539
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,751
We're better than this.

1540
01:41:56,811 --> 01:41:59,018
At least our children
don't hide anything from us.

1541
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:00,951
Nor do they run away.

1542
01:42:04,919 --> 01:42:05,920
Excuse me.

1543
01:42:06,988 --> 01:42:07,796
Hold on, Manju.

1544
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:08,890
Hello.

1545
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:14,998
See. . .everyone's left.

1546
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:17,909
Vikram.

1547
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:21,870
Yes.

1548
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:24,875
Thank you, Mr. Mishra.

1549
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,847
Please keep us informed.

1550
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:33,851
Vikram.
- Not now, Mili.

1551
01:42:34,415 --> 01:42:35,723
Vikram, Divya's fine.

1552
01:42:35,783 --> 01:42:38,730
Believe me, she's just acting out..
- She's just 17 years old, Mili.

1553
01:42:40,288 --> 01:42:41,858
Vikram, even you were 17..

1554
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:43,902
...when you handled
everything with her highness.

1555
01:42:44,058 --> 01:42:45,264
I was the same age..

1556
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:47,067
..when I went away from home
to study.

1557
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,004
If she wants to do
something on her own at this age..

1558
01:42:49,063 --> 01:42:50,007
..then what's the problem.

1559
01:42:50,064 --> 01:42:53,011
The problem is that this
doesn't happen in this family.

1560
01:42:55,103 --> 01:42:56,980
Why am I even explaining
this to you?

1561
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,044
You won't understand.

1562
01:42:59,707 --> 01:43:01,983
I don't understand what
kind of a brother are you..

1563
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:04,121
..who couldn't win his
younger sister's confidence.

1564
01:43:05,046 --> 01:43:06,024
If you had supported her.

1565
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,991
..then she might
have never run away.

1566
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,899
That's what you won't
understand, Mili.

1567
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,665
You do as you please.

1568
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:18,969
You don't care about.

1569
01:43:19,027 --> 01:43:21,906
..how it does or
doesn't affect others.

1570
01:43:23,064 --> 01:43:24,941
That's exactly what
you did last night.

1571
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,971
But here, we think about each
other before doing anything.

1572
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:33,051
That's not fair...

1573
01:43:34,275 --> 01:43:36,016
Yes, I do what I want.

1574
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:39,020
But I do it only when the other
person wants the same thing..

1575
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:41,251
..and can't do it.

1576
01:43:42,951 --> 01:43:44,988
What difference does it make, Mili?

1577
01:43:47,088 --> 01:43:47,964
Why don't you understand.

1578
01:43:48,056 --> 01:43:50,002
..there's a big
difference between you and me.

1579
01:43:51,859 --> 01:43:54,965
We'll spend all our lives
erasing this difference.

1580
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,006
We should have something
common between us to be happy.

1581
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:01,870
But there's nothing common
between you and me, Mili.

1582
01:44:07,642 --> 01:44:08,882
I agree.

1583
01:44:42,143 --> 01:44:43,121
Mom!

1584
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:46,014
DiVya!

1585
01:44:46,147 --> 01:44:49,060
Oh, thank God. Are you fine?

1586
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:55,030
How could you do this, Divya?

1587
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:58,036
How dare you?

1588
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:02,037
What is this?

1589
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,140
What did you do to your hair?

1590
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:07,109
Mother, sister Mi|i..

1591
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:08,804
"Sister" Mi|i..?

1592
01:45:09,237 --> 01:45:10,238
Of course.

1593
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:13,084
Of course.

1594
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,086
"Sister" Mili.

1595
01:45:15,743 --> 01:45:18,121
I am sure that
audacious girl encouraged you..

1596
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:19,214
..to take such a disgusting step.

1597
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,189
Running away from home..

1598
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,129
..and this preposterous hairdo.

1599
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:28,731
We||...your "sister" Mi|i's gone.

1600
01:45:28,956 --> 01:45:32,062
You won't do such
a thing again, okay?

1601
01:45:32,126 --> 01:45:34,299
But, mom..
- Enough of this audaciousness.

1602
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:37,305
I need a crocin.

1603
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:39,343
Mom, I am not being rude.

1604
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:42,078
Sister Mili wasn't wrong.

1605
01:45:42,136 --> 01:45:45,174
Sister Mili wasn't wrong.

1606
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:46,149
I see.

1607
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,950
Is this why she told you
to run away from home?

1608
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,147
Don't blame Mi|i..

1609
01:45:50,244 --> 01:45:53,123
..she didn't tell me to run away.

1610
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,161
I came back because of her.

1611
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:00,961
It was my plan to run away.

1612
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,125
I was planning for a year.

1613
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:05,166
But she said if I run away
from home..

1614
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:06,898
..then I'll accept my defeat.

1615
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:09,038
And we're Rajputs.

1616
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:10,107
We don't run away.

1617
01:46:11,632 --> 01:46:13,077
We face our problems.

1618
01:46:13,234 --> 01:46:16,078
Like you did when
dad met with an accident.

1619
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:19,809
I didn't understand it then.

1620
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:24,083
But I understood this when
I was sitting alone at the station.

1621
01:46:24,612 --> 01:46:26,114
That's why I came back.

1622
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:29,085
And I will go only
when you let me go.

1623
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:33,126
I am very tired.

1624
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,167
Just.

1625
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:39,034
Go to your room!

1626
01:46:39,927 --> 01:46:41,235
Dinner at 8...

1627
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,404
Hello.

1628
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:04,274
Good morning, Kiara.

1629
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:06,980
Mili dear.

1630
01:49:18,119 --> 01:49:19,996
Excuse me, please.

1631
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:23,731
Vikram! Listen!

1632
01:49:33,134 --> 01:49:35,205
Ramsevak, it's been so long..

1633
01:49:35,269 --> 01:49:37,875
..since I didn't stick my
foot in anyone's business.

1634
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,217
It's been very long,
your highness.

1635
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:46,248
Well, let's practice.

1636
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:53,996
Greetings, your highness.

1637
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:58,066
Yes, Ramsevak.

1638
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:02,040
The master has called you.

1639
01:50:02,796 --> 01:50:03,900
Now?

1640
01:50:04,632 --> 01:50:06,009
Is he fine?

1641
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,011
What is it, Shekhar?

1642
01:50:15,209 --> 01:50:16,882
Do you need something?

1643
01:50:17,745 --> 01:50:20,919
Nirmala, pick up that folder.

1644
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:21,991
Yeah!

1645
01:50:23,684 --> 01:50:25,925
Shekhar, what are you doing?

1646
01:50:27,388 --> 01:50:28,958
Oh my, God!

1647
01:50:30,424 --> 01:50:31,926
Your leg...

1648
01:50:32,393 --> 01:50:33,770
Why didn't you tell me?

1649
01:50:33,828 --> 01:50:35,830
I was waiting for the right time.

1650
01:50:35,896 --> 01:50:37,170
Shekhar..

1651
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:39,004
I want to tell you something else.

1652
01:50:40,434 --> 01:50:42,038
I saw Divya run away...

1653
01:50:42,236 --> 01:50:44,273
...but I didn't tell anyone.

1654
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:48,279
How could you?
- I thought Diyva is our daughter.

1655
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:49,945
She will handle it.

1656
01:50:51,212 --> 01:50:52,850
And I was right.

1657
01:50:53,914 --> 01:50:55,825
How could you...

1658
01:51:01,255 --> 01:51:04,065
It's been 10 years since
the accident, Nirmala.

1659
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:07,806
For 10 years I stayed
glued to this chair..

1660
01:51:07,862 --> 01:51:09,864
..and time left me behind.

1661
01:51:10,064 --> 01:51:13,944
Everyone stopped
laughing in this house.

1662
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:16,241
How could we laugh?

1663
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:20,779
You were stuck in this chair..

1664
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,954
..me with my responsibilities,
and our kids..

1665
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:26,323
..matured before their age.

1666
01:51:26,647 --> 01:51:28,957
Exactly, our kids have grown up.

1667
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:31,861
You raised them alone.

1668
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:34,032
And expanded this business..

1669
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:35,963
...and kept the honor
of this palace intact.

1670
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:38,802
You did all this.

1671
01:51:39,894 --> 01:51:41,896
Now Vikram will handle it.

1672
01:51:42,329 --> 01:51:44,866
Himself and this business.

1673
01:51:47,234 --> 01:51:48,178
Let it go.

1674
01:51:48,669 --> 01:51:49,841
Let it go, Nirmala.

1675
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:51,711
It's so easy to say, Shekhar.

1676
01:51:51,939 --> 01:51:52,974
Let it go.

1677
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:56,922
Nirmala,
this family has lost one son.

1678
01:51:57,912 --> 01:51:59,892
That void can never be filled..

1679
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,926
..but we have two more kids.

1680
01:52:02,349 --> 01:52:04,886
Why are we distancing
ourselves from them?

1681
01:52:05,786 --> 01:52:08,892
That's exactly what Mili
was trying to explain us.

1682
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:12,898
How long will it take us
to understand such a small thing?

1683
01:52:20,968 --> 01:52:21,946
Oh my, God!

1684
01:52:23,971 --> 01:52:26,781
I want my life back.

1685
01:52:26,941 --> 01:52:29,217
I want my Nirmala back.

1686
01:52:29,276 --> 01:52:30,914
My, God. Shekhar.

1687
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:37,824
Careful. Careful.

1688
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:40,657
Mili.

1689
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:43,794
You turned out to
be better than master..

1690
01:52:43,824 --> 01:52:45,064
...in 'sticking your Leg'.

1691
01:52:50,865 --> 01:52:51,866
More tea?

1692
01:52:51,999 --> 01:52:53,000
Did you have tea?

1693
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,101
Yes!

1694
01:53:00,407 --> 01:53:02,717
It seems he didn't sleep all night.

1695
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:10,827
Vikram, where did you
go without informing us?

1696
01:53:11,318 --> 01:53:14,231
Dad, mom, I have to..

1697
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:20,966
Tell you something.

1698
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:26,310
These days everyone's talking
in a dramatic way in our house.

1699
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:27,304
But it's good.

1700
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:28,903
I am not complaining.

1701
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:31,047
Go ahead.

1702
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:37,686
Yesterday. . .l . .

1703
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:44,260
L...went to see Kiara
at her house, and..

1704
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,002
<i>So Vikram Singh Remove".</i>

1705
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,037
..you're here to break
off our engagement?

1706
01:53:55,128 --> 01:53:56,732
I am sorry.

1707
01:53:58,932 --> 01:54:03,039
Kiara, I feel guilty for
putting you in this situation.

1708
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,844
But I feel if I don't do it now..

1709
01:54:05,973 --> 01:54:08,112
...I'll only be hurting
everyone later.

1710
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:13,150
And everything else
doesn't matter as much as..

1711
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,953
Vikram, it's okay.

1712
01:54:20,253 --> 01:54:23,666
But...this girl and you..

1713
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:26,037
I can't understand.

1714
01:54:27,928 --> 01:54:29,999
I can't understand either.

1715
01:54:31,699 --> 01:54:33,303
But since she left..

1716
01:54:34,134 --> 01:54:37,081
..there's nothing else
I can understand.

1717
01:54:39,173 --> 01:54:41,050
Don't worn] about me.

1718
01:54:41,942 --> 01:54:44,081
I'll be okay.
I'll get over it.

1719
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:48,087
And who knows...

1720
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:51,159
..maybe fate has some
adventure in-store for me too.

1721
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:59,092
Kiara and I aren't getting married.

1722
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:05,976
I want to marry someone else.

1723
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:09,112
If she agrees.

1724
01:55:12,172 --> 01:55:15,745
I know she's trouble.

1725
01:55:16,176 --> 01:55:18,087
She does everything wrong.

1726
01:55:18,145 --> 01:55:20,182
She doesn't fit in, but..

1727
01:55:22,716 --> 01:55:26,163
..even her wrong actions
seem right to me.

1728
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,162
I need her. We need her.

1729
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:37,105
Why are you telling that to us?

1730
01:55:38,165 --> 01:55:41,703
Vikram, if you marry her.

1731
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:46,814
Then she'll always embarrass
us with her actions.

1732
01:55:50,177 --> 01:55:52,714
Or maybe we'll all learn to laugh.

1733
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:59,228
There's a ticket
to Delhi in your room.

1734
01:56:00,087 --> 01:56:02,089
You'll get a car at the airport

1735
01:56:02,656 --> 01:56:07,036
And Vikram, please clean up
before you go, please.

1736
01:56:08,896 --> 01:56:11,035
Go for it, son.

1737
01:56:11,865 --> 01:56:14,368
Your dad is sticking
his foot in things again.

1738
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:19,141
Now if you move, you might
be able to catch the plane.

1739
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,096
Manju, stop it.

1740
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:34,696
You're putting
Asharffs job in danger.

1741
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:36,195
I've become too hotheaded.

1742
01:56:36,256 --> 01:56:37,257
I'm just cooling it down.

1743
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:39,861
Otherwise my head will explode.

1744
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:42,232
Then don't forget
to blow a whistle first.

1745
01:56:42,929 --> 01:56:43,907
Be quiet.

1746
01:56:44,098 --> 01:56:45,372
You didn't say a word out there.

1747
01:56:45,799 --> 01:56:47,176
You kept sitting quietly.

1748
01:56:47,301 --> 01:56:49,110
And you're having fun now.

1749
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:00,849
Hi, is this
Dr. Mili Chakravany's house?

1750
01:57:01,214 --> 01:57:03,057
You must be Kabir.

1751
01:57:04,151 --> 01:57:05,596
<i>Vikram Singh Remote.</i>

1752
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:08,725
May I. . .come in?

1753
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:15,201
Sir...it's important
for me to meet Mili.

1754
01:57:16,096 --> 01:57:18,633
What is this?

1755
01:57:19,133 --> 01:57:20,237
You and who?

1756
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:21,870
Split personalities.

1757
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:24,276
He's trying to prove
as if he walked here.

1758
01:57:24,605 --> 01:57:26,141
Did we invite you?

1759
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:28,151
Mili won't meet you.
- Manju.

1760
01:57:30,844 --> 01:57:33,222
You will have to tell us
what you need from Mili.

1761
01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:36,884
Sir, please if you trust me at all..
- Trust!

1762
01:57:37,117 --> 01:57:39,188
We don't trust you at all.

1763
01:57:40,687 --> 01:57:42,223
Always showing off.

1764
01:57:45,092 --> 01:57:46,093
Mi|i..

1765
01:57:46,926 --> 01:57:48,872
Mili isn't here.

1766
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:52,201
Then where is she?
- We won't tell you.

1767
01:57:54,134 --> 01:57:56,136
After returning from Sambha|garh..

1768
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:58,674
...Mili was very disturbed.

1769
01:57:59,106 --> 01:58:03,020
So...she needed some help.

1770
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:04,152
Therapy-

1771
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:07,851
Sir, I need to meet her right now.

1772
01:58:08,148 --> 01:58:09,149
Please, sir.

1773
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:23,866
Dude, I'm telling you again.

1774
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:25,040
Take my advice.

1775
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,169
Mili has lost her mind.
Let's avoid it!

1776
01:58:33,006 --> 01:58:34,952
Which doctor is treating her?

1777
01:58:38,712 --> 01:58:41,158
You wait here, I'll get the tickets.

1778
01:58:46,987 --> 01:58:48,330
So this is her therapy?!

1779
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:37,109
Oh no!

1780
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:38,741
Mili.

1781
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:56,323
Mili!

1782
01:59:57,024 --> 01:59:58,298
Vikram!

1783
02:00:26,753 --> 02:00:29,256
Mili, listen to me.
- I don't want to talk to you.

1784
02:00:29,856 --> 02:00:31,927
Mili, listen..

1785
02:00:32,359 --> 02:00:34,339
Kiara and l..
-Speak up,

1786
02:00:34,695 --> 02:00:36,800
Mili, l..

1787
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:38,304
<i>'.</i>

1788
02:00:38,832 --> 02:00:39,936
I mean..

1789
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:42,944
There's nothing common between us.

1790
02:00:45,138 --> 02:00:46,412
Mili!

1791
02:00:49,843 --> 02:00:51,254
I love you!

1792
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,083
Oh..

1793
02:01:01,688 --> 02:01:02,962
He's dead!

1794
02:01:07,995 --> 02:01:13,343
When we're old and
my limbs don't work..

1795
02:01:16,002 --> 02:01:18,676
...I'll need a doctor like you.

1796
02:01:35,889 --> 02:01:38,961
Polish off my wine collection.

1797
02:01:41,161 --> 02:01:43,437
We'll have to win over
many more Suraj Maan Singh's.

1798
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:48,712
And who will chatter
at the dining table?

1799
02:01:49,769 --> 02:01:51,771
Who will mom say "disgusting" to?

1800
02:01:52,105 --> 02:01:53,413
If you leave?

1801
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:55,845
So please...

1802
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:56,976
Mili...

1803
02:01:58,779 --> 02:02:00,053
...marn/ me!

1804
02:02:02,015 --> 02:02:02,993
That's my sister.

1805
02:02:03,016 --> 02:02:04,086
Viku.

1806
02:02:11,825 --> 02:02:13,031
Viku, l..

1807
02:02:17,998 --> 02:02:19,136
Not like this.

1808
02:02:21,835 --> 02:02:23,678
We will need to ask Manju.

1809
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:40,722
I guess he's style's been
totally ruined.

1810
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:45,761
Did you talk to her?

1811
02:02:46,025 --> 02:02:47,402
What now?

1812
02:02:51,131 --> 02:02:52,735
Now I've to talk to you.

1813
02:02:53,066 --> 02:02:54,170
Talk to me?

1814
02:02:54,301 --> 02:02:56,781
Why? Haven't you
talked to me enough?

1815
02:02:57,371 --> 02:02:59,749
Please prepare for Mi|i's wedding.

1816
02:03:00,173 --> 02:03:01,049
With me.

1817
02:03:01,174 --> 02:03:02,676
Whichever date Mili chooses.

1818
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:06,120
And that...Kia...Kai..

1819
02:03:06,246 --> 02:03:08,351
What's her name?
- Kiara.

1820
02:03:09,182 --> 02:03:10,684
We aren't engaged anymore.

1821
02:03:11,985 --> 02:03:13,828
For the first time I spoke my mind.

1822
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,929
That's my daughter Mi|i's style.

1823
02:03:15,989 --> 02:03:16,933
Not yours.

1824
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:19,195
And why should we
say yes for the wedding?

1825
02:03:19,259 --> 02:03:20,067
He's crazy.

1826
02:03:20,126 --> 02:03:21,366
We...we..

1827
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,672
Who we?

1828
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:23,969
You and your army?

1829
02:03:24,064 --> 02:03:26,237
And secondly.
- Oh, stop it, Manju.

1830
02:03:28,001 --> 02:03:30,140
I love your daughter.

1831
02:03:31,304 --> 02:03:33,682
I'm politely asking for
her hand in marriage, so say yes.

1832
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,751
Otherwise I'll elope with her.

1833
02:03:35,809 --> 02:03:37,186
And once I do that.

1834
02:03:37,277 --> 02:03:40,884
..you won't be able to get connect with
her on Skype, Facebook or Facetime.

1835
02:03:40,947 --> 02:03:43,689
When she gets sweet,
chubby and pregnant.

1836
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:44,888
..but I still won't
let you meet her.

1837
02:03:44,951 --> 02:03:46,658
We'll have 3 or 4 cute kids as well.

1838
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,960
But I won't let them
meet their grandma.

1839
02:03:48,188 --> 02:03:50,099
I won't upload their photos either.

1840
02:03:55,662 --> 02:03:56,732
So now?

1841
02:03:57,764 --> 02:04:00,677
Is it a yes...or
do I elope with her?

1842
02:04:22,722 --> 02:04:24,201
Did you hear what he's saying?

1843
02:04:24,324 --> 02:04:26,361
Are you saying yes,
or do I run away?

1844
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:30,740
Say it.

1845
02:04:30,931 --> 02:04:32,774
This is not fair.

1846
02:04:32,933 --> 02:04:34,776
Everyone's making me
look like the villain.

1847
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:36,380
I am not the villain here.

1848
02:04:36,703 --> 02:04:38,148
I am the bride's mother.

1849
02:04:39,773 --> 02:04:42,777
So, Manju, is it a yes or no?

1850
02:04:43,176 --> 02:04:45,213
Say yes.

1851
02:04:45,745 --> 02:04:47,782
Say yes, Manju.

1852
02:04:49,182 --> 02:04:50,752
Ok then...fine.

1853
02:04:51,084 --> 02:04:53,155
I say yes.

1854
02:04:53,386 --> 02:04:55,730
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1855
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,238
Where were we?

1856
02:05:02,362 --> 02:05:03,670
Bore.
