1
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,205
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

2
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,082
- Everyone okay?
- Sorry!

3
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,001
Let's go from where we left off.

4
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,546
That morning was the first time
I ever saw her.

5
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,592
But before we talk about her,
I have to tell you something about me.

6
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,844
And I'm sorry I have to tell you,
but I do.

7
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,347
When I was a kid, my dad died.

8
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,809
I know it's sad, but it's true,
and it happened.

9
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,854
And it's something
you need to know about me.

10
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,524
But here's the good news.
When he was alive, he was the best.

11
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,985
He was funny and silly and...

12
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,989
He had this amazing porcupine tie
he used to wear all the time.

13
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,951
And when he died,
my mom let me wear it to his funeral.

14
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,497
And after that,
I wore it pretty much every day.

15
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,876
Fighting dinosaurs? Tie.

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,754
Eating Sugar Pops? Tie.

17
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,422
Oh, man, those were so good.

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,426
Here I am playing the trumpet,
wearing the tie.

19
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,223
And on moving day? You guessed it. Tie.

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
We were moving to Mica, Arizona.

21
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:29,107
My mom said she got a good job there
and that it was quiet and far away.

22
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,820
She said we could start fresh.
Just the two of us.

23
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,213
But guess what?

24
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,882
Mica was quieter
than I ever could've imagined.

25
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,884
Nothing ever happened here.

26
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,886
Like, zero things.

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,849
It was a town that felt like
something was missing.

28
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,433
And they wanted to win.

29
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,644
They just couldn't.

30
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,733
There were no trophies,
no celebrations, no stories.

31
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,237
Because it had been that way for so long,
it just felt normal.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,449
And as the new kid, that meant I became
the center of attention real fast.

33
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,876
And not in a good way.

34
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,090
And right then, I knew.

35
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,385
If I wanted to survive,
it was better to lay low.

36
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,016
I was gonna have to be
just like everybody else.

37
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,146
Leo?

38
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,195
No one would see me.

39
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,323
No one would hear me.

40
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,534
I was gonna disappear.

41
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,498
And then, on my ninth birthday...

42
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,183
And every birthday after that...

43
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,185
Boom! Another tie.

44
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,271
And another. And another.

45
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,440
Look at these boxes. They're amazing.

46
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,691
Hey, it's a trumpet!

47
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,486
I had no idea who they were from.

48
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,242
But whoever it was, they made sure
that for one moment, every year,

49
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,994
I couldn't forget who I was.

50
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,505
Happy birthday, kid.

51
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,465
- Thank you.
- Be safe.

52
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,596
And that brings us back
to where we started.

53
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:12,646
Back to my 16th birthday.
Back to the first time I saw her.

54
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,732
Back to when there were
more questions than answers.

55
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,694
And I didn't know what I didn't know.

56
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,237
Leo! Did you see her?

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,655
Maybe.

58
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,115
Trust me, you'd know.

59
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,159
- Oh, um, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

60
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,054
Wait, weren't you
at band practice this morning?

61
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,205
Yes, Leo.
You finally found me out.

62
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,958
I watch you practice band.
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,418
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,794
Did you guys see her yet?

65
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,962
Happy birthday.

66
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,174
- Are you guys messing with me?
- What are you talking about?

67
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,384
See you later.

68
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,305
Okay. I think I've told you enough
about me and Mica,

69
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,557
and my secret porcupine ties.

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,225
So now, we can get back to her.

71
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,271
And back to when something
was finally about to happen.

72
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,232
Kevin. Come on.

73
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,068
It's fascinating.

74
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,986
Don't you think it's fascinating?

75
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,696
No.

76
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,907
Imagine being popular
for doing absolutely nothing.

77
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,909
They're popular because they're beautiful.

78
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,553
Yeah, Tess, that's not something you do.

79
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,621
The burritos different?
Something tastes different.

80
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,958
Maybe she'll do Hot Seat
and you can interview her about nothing.

81
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,125
Uh, yes.

82
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,853
When're you guys gonna
let me be on the show?

83
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,587
When someone cares about anything you do.

84
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,299
Or even better idea,
let's put the new girl on Hot Seat.

85
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,969
- Uh, why?
- She'd be the perfect guest.

86
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,429
- What's her name anyway?
- Stargirl.

87
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,141
My name is Stargirl.

88
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:23,277
Happy birthday to you

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,781
Happy birthday to you

90
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:33,704
Happy birthday, dear Leo

91
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,333
Happy birthday to you

92
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,092
- Great job. That was amazing.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,927
Um, how'd she know your name?

94
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,721
How did she know it's your birthday?

95
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,936
This is Hot Seat,

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,899
where even if you can't pay the bills,
the heat is always on.

97
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,735
Wow.

98
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,570
That is terrible.

99
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,615
Also, you should say
the name of the show at the end.

100
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,533
So, like, "Something,
something, something,

101
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:15,162
"something better than your dumb thing...
And this is Hot Seat."

102
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,581
Do we need new sound effects?

103
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,084
Yes. New season, new material, new guests.

104
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,212
Ooh, Stargirl?

105
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,172
- How about something like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

106
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,216
If somebody
doesn't answer a question...

107
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,885
You're burned.

108
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,930
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, let's keep that one.

109
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,059
You should ask her. She likes you.

110
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,310
She doesn't.

111
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,231
She sang a song to you in the cafeteria,
in front of everyone.

112
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,733
Oh, I got one. Give me.

113
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,445
Okay, ready?

114
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,532
Ask Stargirl to do Hot Seat?

115
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,200
Give me the mic.

116
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,536
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mr. Robineau.

117
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,913
Junior year. Gonna be great.

118
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,332
How was your summers?

119
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,095
I actually took a speech and debate class.

120
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,503
Hate to jinx it,
but I'm gonna win regionals this year.

121
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,797
Third time's a charm. What about you, Leo?

122
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,884
I worked at Archie's Dino-tastic
Summer Camp. Again.

123
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:14,096
Oh, well, that sounds dino-tastic.

124
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,435
Hey, so Leo's new girlfriend
is gonna be on the show.

125
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,646
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Yet.

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,940
She's not his girlfriend yet.

127
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,195
You got the Geo Metro. Nice, kid.

128
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,251
Just promise me you won't be
one of those guys

129
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,848
who stops hanging out with his
friends once he has a girlfriend.

130
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,749
- Kevin.
- Promise?

131
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,126
She doesn't like me.

132
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,919
But she does.

133
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,297
Dude, it was just my birthday.

134
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,345
I'm gonna go to F.

135
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,555
C and then down, and then F.

136
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:43,227
And then, like...
I don't know, I just, like, move these.

137
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,646
Give me love Give me love

138
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,730
Okay.

139
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,819
And then one down.

140
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,616
Give me peace on...

141
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,411
So, Alan Ferko,
you play bass drum in marching band.

142
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,664
Yes.

143
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,883
You're burned!

144
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,014
Okay.
Comments and questions time,

145
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,349
where we take comments...

146
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,642
Camera one, go to audience.

147
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,646
Anyone else?

148
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,440
Anyone else?

149
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,360
Literally, anyone else.

150
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,446
Okay. Go ahead, Benny.

151
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,073
So, as a member of the marching band,

152
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,285
do you get, like, free concessions,
like from the concession stand?

153
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,372
Well, not free, no.
But we do get a discount.

154
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:46,999
How much discount?

155
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,402
- You don't have to answer.
- 20%.

156
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,436
But the rule on Hot Seat is
to answer every question.

157
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,461
Yes, Benny.

158
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,048
As I know you know,
that is literally the point of Hot Seat.

159
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,466
And he answered the question.

160
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,635
- But I didn't hear him.
- 20%.

161
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,555
Okay? It's a 20% discount.

162
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,891
So, could you get me that discount?

163
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,475
I go to every football game.

164
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,560
Ask Stargirl.

165
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,769
Family and friends deal?

166
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,104
Yeah, I can. So,

167
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,648
you can just go to the concession stand
anytime or...

168
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,954
Okay, everybody ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.

169
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,041
We have Mud Frog spirit.
Come on now, let's...

170
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,673
You've been working on
that same problem for 20 minutes.

171
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,427
It's hard.

172
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:13,353
You sure there isn't, um,
something you wanna talk about?

173
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,273
I'm fine.

174
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,901
Sure, yeah. Well, you know,

175
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:25,157
if there is anything
you wanna talk about,

176
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,867
- I'll just...
- Okay.

177
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,244
Be sitting here across from you,

178
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,246
- enjoying my dinner.
- Okay.

179
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,873
All right.

180
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,466
And so,
as a result of this unfortunate situation,

181
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:48,055
we'll no longer be offering Sloppy Joes
in the cafeteria on Wednesdays.

182
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,642
And lastly, I would like to remind you all

183
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,812
that this Friday is the first
football game of the season.

184
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,606
Maybe this year, we'll win one.

185
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,860
Okay. That is everything.

186
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,529
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,364
Principal Sutters, I think you...

188
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,784
Oh! Students, one last thing.

189
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:14,790
You can now sign up
for this year's speech competition.

190
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,710
The winner, assuming anyone
can beat Mr. Singh's streak...

191
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:19,878
Yeah, Kevin!

192
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:25,801
Will go to Tucson to compete
in the regional competition.

193
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:30,347
So, if you're interested, please see
Mr. Robineau for more information.

194
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,143
All right, Mud Frogs.
Let's look alive!

195
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:39,189
Blue 42! Blue 42! Set, hut!

196
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,357
Hut, hut!

197
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,944
Come on, let's go!

198
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,864
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Frank, he's open.

199
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,951
Shake it off, ref!

200
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,954
Ref, who you talkin' to?

201
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:58,041
And that's half-time
with the Mud Frogs trailing 17-nothing.

202
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,420
Mud Frog fans, don't forget to visit
the concession stand,

203
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,047
and remember,
tonight is two-for-one Mud...

204
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,705
That's right!

205
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,873
Is that...

206
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:38,999
That's Stargirl.

207
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,426
When some loud braggart
tries to put me down

208
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,221
And say his school is great

209
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,767
I tell him right away
Now what's the matter, buddy

210
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,813
Ain't ya heard of my school?
It's number one in the state

211
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,904
So be true to your school now

212
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,033
Just like you would to your girl or guy

213
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,537
Be true to your school now

214
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,374
And let your colors fly

215
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,919
Be true to your school

216
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,881
I got a letterman's sweater
with a letter in front

217
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,217
I got for football and track

218
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,095
I'm proud to wear it now
when I cruise around

219
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,182
The other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

220
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,519
So be true to your school now

221
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,231
Just like you would to your girl or guy

222
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,234
Be true to your school now

223
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,612
Let your colors fly

224
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,867
Be true to your school

225
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,911
On Friday, we'll be jacked up
on the football game

226
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,623
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now

227
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,418
My girl will be workin'
on her pom-poms now

228
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,962
And she'll be yellin' tonight

229
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,424
So be true to your school now

230
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,219
Just like you would to your girl or guy

231
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,972
Be true to your school now

232
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,475
Let your colors fly

233
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,397
Be true to your school

234
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,485
Go, Mud Frogs!

235
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,238
Yeah! Let's go, boys!

236
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,489
Yeah!

237
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,121
Let's go, Mud Frogs!

238
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:47,169
Let's go, Mud Frogs! Let's go, Mud Frogs!

239
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,421
- That was...
- Let's go, Mud Frogs!

240
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:51,798
Um, that was...

241
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,842
Thanks, Leo.

242
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,893
- Yes!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

243
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,521
Go!

244
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,111
And that's a Mud Frog touchdown!

245
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,574
Touchdown! Mud Frogs!
What a return to start the second half!

246
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,785
And the Mud Frogs are on the board!

247
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,600
So, Archie, I wanted to ask you something.

248
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,979
I wondered why you were here
on a Saturday.

249
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,608
So, um, there's this...

250
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,488
There's this new girl at school.

251
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:01,326
- Oh. So, you've met her.
- You know her?

252
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,328
Come on.

253
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,708
She's been homeschooled
by her mom until now.

254
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,126
How do you know her?

255
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,296
She came here to camp for a few years.

256
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,672
How come I never met her?

257
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,467
God. Different hours
'cause of the homeschool thing?

258
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,344
Well, why'd she stop?

259
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,722
New interests.

260
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,309
I never met someone more invested
in learning everything about everything.

261
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,812
She still comes by to visit
every once in a while.

262
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,690
Um, you said her mom. What about her dad?

263
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,319
She's being raised by a solo superhero,
much like your mom.

264
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,989
Anna. She does costumes for the theater.

265
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,284
Ah. They travel a lot.

266
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,912
Argh.

267
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,969
You like Stargirl.

268
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,305
I don't really know her.

269
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,725
But you're thinking maybe if you did,
you might.

270
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,896
She's just so... different.

271
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,523
Talk to her.

272
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,947
There she is.
You're officially our good luck charm.

273
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,282
We're gonna win the next one.
I could feel it.

274
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,995
Hey, Stargirl, I wanna ask you something.

275
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,207
So, last night...

276
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,379
- Did you ask her?
- What?

277
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,630
About Hot Seat.

278
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,965
Oh, uh...

279
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,842
No.

280
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,762
Well, you better ask her
before she gets too popular for you.

281
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,674
Oh.

282
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:37,482
When you started to follow me
into the desert that day after school,

283
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,069
why did you turn around and go back?

284
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,363
Um...

285
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,200
I... I don't remember.

286
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,461
Were you afraid?

287
00:22:58,754 --> 00:22:59,755
No.

288
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,633
Did you wanna ask me something?

289
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,177
Yes.

290
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,473
My friend Kevin and I
have this show, Hot Seat.

291
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,893
And we were wondering if you

292
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:18,774
might wanna be a guest on the show.
On Hot Seat.

293
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,694
I don't think so. Um...

294
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,615
But thank you for the invitation.

295
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,169
Are you getting acquainted
with my friend, Cinnamon?

296
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,589
Sort of.

297
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,093
- Are you afraid of rats?
- Sort of.

298
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,852
Do you hear that, Cinnamon? He's a little
bit afraid of you.

299
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:59,189
Tickle Cinnamon behind the ears.
Go ahead. Don't... Don't be shy.

300
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,320
That's pretty soft.

301
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,989
Stargirl, dinner!

302
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,744
Well, Leo, I have to go in for dinner.

303
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,039
Say good night, Cinnamon.

304
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,960
- Good night, Cinnamon.
- I was talking to Cinnamon.

305
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,976
See you tomorrow, Leo.

306
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,188
Okay. Good night.

307
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,773
Good night, Cinnamon.

308
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,110
Later.

309
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,376
- Hey, where were you?
- Uh, sorry, I lost track of time.

310
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,715
Dinner's on the stove.
You can heat it up or I can.

311
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,217
Thanks, Mom. I'm not hungry.

312
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:44,294
See the people walkin' down the street
fall in line just watchin' all their feet

313
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:49,091
They don't know where they wanna go
but they're walkin' in time

314
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,553
'Cause they got the beat
They got the beat

315
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:57,724
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

316
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:06,692
See the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool

317
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:11,780
Hangin' out till quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line

318
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:14,908
They got the beat
They got the beat

319
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:19,204
Kids got the beat, yeah
Kids got the beat

320
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:28,005
We got the beat
Jumpin', get down

321
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,466
Round and round and round
'Cause we got the beat

322
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,973
We got the beat, we've got the beat
Yeah, we got it!

323
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,018
- We got the beat
- We got the beat

324
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,438
- We got the beat
- We got the beat

325
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,940
We got the beat We got the beat

326
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,861
- We got the beat
- We got the beat

327
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,585
Let's go, Mud Frogs!

328
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,004
With five seconds
left on the clock and trailing by four,

329
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:13,300
the Mud Frogs have the ball on their own
35 with time for one last play.

330
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,844
Let's hear it for the Mud Frogs, fans!

331
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,726
You got this!

332
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,687
Go, Zack! You got this!

333
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,314
Go, go, go, go, go!

334
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,650
Come on!

335
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:34,988
- Yes! That's what I'm...
- Yes!

336
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,157
A Mud Frog touchdown! The Mud Frogs win!

337
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,534
The Mud Frogs win!

338
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:41,453
Zack James with the 65-yard run
for the score.

339
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:46,583
Can you believe it? The Mud Frogs win!

340
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:01,640
Until that night,

341
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,977
I had always thought
mud frogs were an odd choice for a mascot.

342
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:10,315
You see, mud frogs spend
most of their time sleeping.

343
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,822
They sleep at the bottom of dry ponds
in the desert, buried in mud for months.

344
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,491
They do this
when there's no food or water.

345
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:24,913
And then, one day, the rain comes.

346
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:30,002
And just like that, they're awake.

347
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,846
We were the Mud Frogs.

348
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,682
And we always had been.

349
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,352
We were just waiting for it to rain.

350
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,490
Did you ask her? About Hot Seat?

351
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,659
Oh, uh...

352
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:05,495
Yeah, no, I asked her last week.
She said she doesn't wanna do it.

353
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,789
You asked her last week
and you never told me?

354
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,124
There was a lot going on.

355
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,250
Did you really ask her?

356
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,587
When she said no, what did you say?
Did you tell her how important it is?

357
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,470
- Tell her about the throne of flames?
- Do you guys wanna sit with us?

358
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,675
- Oh, um...
- Do you think we can all fit?

359
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,261
Benny has, like, nine trays of food.

360
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,327
It's funny you came over here.
We were just talking about you.

361
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,891
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were.

362
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,351
- Yeah, they were.
- You were?

363
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,811
Uh, no. You know Kevin.
He's just always joking.

364
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,355
I am?

365
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:33,315
Okay.

366
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,944
I'm excited for the speech competition.
I signed up, too.

367
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,070
I'm aware.

368
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,323
Yeah, I'm sure of it.
These burritos are super different.

369
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,708
I don't know
how to make plans with you.

370
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,211
You don't have a phone.

371
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,921
You wanna make plans with me?

372
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,131
Yeah. I do.

373
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,134
I work at Archie's in the summer.

374
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:04,596
He's kind of like my uncle.
I went there as a kid, too.

375
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,014
I know you did.

376
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,558
Did he tell you?

377
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,226
I saw your picture on the wall.

378
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,770
Oh. Right.

379
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:17,943
- Um, he said it was just you and your mom?
- Yeah.

380
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,780
I think he told me
'cause it's just me and my mom, too.

381
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,912
It's a big part of why
I wanted to go to school.

382
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:33,417
It's just been the two of us for so long,

383
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,753
And she can be so...

384
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:40,966
Yeah. It can be like that
with my mom, too.

385
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,552
We travel a lot.

386
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,054
She does costumes for plays,

387
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,639
and she's always talking about

388
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,267
how she wants to sell the house
and live on the road,

389
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,853
but I told her I wanted to go
to a real school.

390
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,024
Am I talking too much?

391
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,026
- No.
- Sometimes, I talk too much and...

392
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,238
No. No, sometimes I'm...
I'm quiet, but I'm just thinking.

393
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,533
- What are you thinking?
- That I like talking to you.

394
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,620
I like talking to you, too.

395
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:15,918
I'm not usually good with, um, this.

396
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:22,966
Scream, Leo.

397
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,803
- Why would I do that?
- Why wouldn't you?

398
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:27,971
'Cause I'm not crazy.

399
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,602
Don't you want the universe to hear you?

400
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,064
I don't have anything to say.

401
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,453
Um...

402
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:54,081
I don't think I have that in me.

403
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:03,590
You know, in Iceland, they have
officially designated enchanted places.

404
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,802
Like... Wouldn't that just be great?

405
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:12,182
If you were walking along
and suddenly there's a sign declaring,

406
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:17,855
"Enchanted Site.
US Department of the Interior."

407
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,567
They should put one at your house.

408
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,368
Take off your shoes.

409
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,787
What?

410
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:36,707
We're here.

411
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,298
Close your eyes.

412
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,350
Have you ever done nothing, Leo?

413
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,313
My mom thinks I do it all the time.

414
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,358
No, like... Like really nothing.

415
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:09,364
Is there a trick to doing nothing?

416
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:14,494
There's no trick.
You'll find your own way.

417
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,416
What's your way?

418
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,961
Sometimes,

419
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,757
I imagine a giant pink eraser.

420
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,802
I start at my toes,

421
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,806
till everything from my neck down is gone.

422
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,521
And then comes the hard part. My senses.

423
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:45,067
My nose, my ears, my eyes, my mouth.

424
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,239
If I've done a good job at the end,

425
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,993
there's just nothing.

426
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:02,626
And then I see and I hear,

427
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,589
but not with my eyes and ears,
'cause they're gone obviously.

428
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,510
Now that I'm nothing,

429
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,431
there's no difference between me
and everything else.

430
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,852
I'm a stone.

431
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:23,564
I'm a paper cup.

432
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,236
I'm rain.

433
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,165
Did you...

434
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:45,711
I don't know. I'm nothing.

435
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,863
Who you are on social media

436
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,866
is an extension of who you are
in real life.

437
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:21,580
Space and privacy are just as important
on there as they are out here.

438
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,834
So, in conclusion, and remember,
I speak from experience,

439
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,961
do not let your mom follow you.

440
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:34,301
Because after all,
it's not social you-dia or social us-dia.

441
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:37,804
It's social me-dia. Thank you.

442
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,640
Yeah, Kevin!

443
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:47,564
Thank you, Kevin. And next up,
we have Stargirl Caraway.

444
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,066
Yes.

445
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,654
Thank you so much.

446
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,657
Did you know that rats
actually like to hang out with other rats?

447
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,537
I hope it's you.

448
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,173
And the winner of this year's
Mica High Speech Competition,

449
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:16,051
who will go to Tucson
to compete in regionals,

450
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,846
is Stargirl Caraway.

451
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,307
Yes!

452
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,229
Thank you.

453
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:33,068
And thank all of you for attending.
Wish us luck in Tucson.

454
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,278
Go, Mud Frogs.

455
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,870
She keeps winning
and she's not even trying.

456
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,206
She beat Kevin in speech,
and he's won two years in a row.

457
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,126
- Somehow she's better.
- Okay.

458
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,170
We've won four football games this year.

459
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,589
Before this, we never even won one.

460
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,673
And I think...

461
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,134
Well, no, I know it's her.

462
00:36:58,594 --> 00:36:59,595
What do you mean?

463
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,473
Is she... No, it's stupid.

464
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,227
Is she magic?

465
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,397
Depends on how you define "magic."

466
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,734
She started doing stuff
and we started winning.

467
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:14,860
Doing stuff?

468
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:18,363
- She made it rain the other night.
- Excuse me?

469
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:22,326
- It's stupid.
- No, you're just not making sense.

470
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:28,498
Since she got here,

471
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,669
things have been different.
But good different.

472
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,421
Some people are just like that.

473
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,798
So is she or isn't she?

474
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,054
You're gonna have to figure that out
for yourself.

475
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,225
Is that coffee?

476
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:47,893
I... I don't drink coffee.

477
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,905
So what's your deal with that bike?

478
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,282
The kid it belongs to
got it for his birthday,

479
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,243
but then got into an accident.

480
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:09,331
He's been in the hospital for a few weeks,
but he's better now and coming home.

481
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,376
Wait, are you talking about
Hillary Kimble's brother?

482
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,964
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No.

483
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,841
How do you know that's his bike?

484
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,343
I have my ways.

485
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,847
So why was it at the thrift store?

486
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,599
I don't know.

487
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,353
His family was probably so busy
with everything going on,

488
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,105
they didn't even think about it.

489
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:37,776
But this way, when he's ready
to get back on, it'll be waiting.

490
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:41,196
Does she know you're coming?

491
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,865
No.

492
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,952
- So you're just gonna leave it there?
- What else would I do?

493
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,204
I don't know, knock? Leave a note?

494
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,083
That's not why I did it.

495
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,630
At first I thought it was my mom,
you know?

496
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,090
But I know it was you.

497
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,468
The ties. It was you.

498
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,599
The ties I get every year for my birthday.
I never knew who it was from, but...

499
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,934
I have no idea what you're talking about,
Leo Borlock.

500
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:32,664
- Hi, Mom. I have a friend with me.
- Oh, that's so...

501
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,210
exciting.

502
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,463
Never brought anyone to the house before.

503
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,758
- I'm Anna. What's your name?
- Leo.

504
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,593
Leo.

505
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,724
Uh, okay. Uh, we're gonna go hang out now.

506
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,935
Well, I'll be here.

507
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,313
Oh, if you need anything, anything at all,
just ask and I'll get it right away.

508
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,066
Sure, Mom. Thanks.

509
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,652
Nice to meet you.

510
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,965
Where's all your...

511
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:27,594
- Glitter and ribbons and magic tricks?
- Yeah.

512
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:29,096
In my office.

513
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,474
You have an office? Where?

514
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:33,600
It's a secret.

515
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,533
Oh, man.

516
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,203
This was my dad's favorite.

517
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,914
He'd drive me to school, going to work,

518
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:59,042
and we'd sing Just What I Needed
at the top of our lungs.

519
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,169
You sing?

520
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,588
I used to.

521
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,844
It's kind of funny
that it was our song, 'cause...

522
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,097
I mean, it's clearly not
about a dad and his kid.

523
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:18,145
But it's cool that a song can be
about whoever you want it to be about.

524
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,898
It doesn't matter what the words say.

525
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:38,957
What's this?

526
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,210
Big Star.

527
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:42,878
Ha...

528
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:46,048
No, really, um... That's...
That's the name of the band.

529
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:52,513
I don't, um...
I don't have a record player.

530
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,891
I'll just...

531
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:02,147
- Right. Yeah. Um, track number four.
- What?

532
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,650
Track number four, it's, um...

533
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,778
It's a song about
who the words say it's about.

534
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,084
Won't you let me
walk you home from school?

535
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:13,302
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?

536
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:20,642
Maybe Friday I can

537
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,480
Get tickets for the dance

538
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:33,113
And I'll take you

539
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,034
Ooh, ooh, ooh

540
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:44,625
Won't you tell your dad
"Get off my back"?

541
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:55,552
Tell him what we said
about "Paint It Black"

542
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:01,642
Rock and roll is here to stay

543
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:05,521
Come inside where it's okay

544
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:13,320
And I'll shake you

545
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,115
Ooh, ooh, ooh

546
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:48,689
Won't you tell me what you're thinkin' of?

547
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:58,657
Would you be an outlaw for my love?

548
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:04,663
If it's so, well, let me know

549
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:09,251
If it's no, well, I can go

550
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:16,341
I won't make you

551
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,845
Ooh, ooh, ooh

552
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:42,242
Welcome, fans,
to Leonard Jones Community Field

553
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:45,329
for tonight's championship game
between the defending champs,

554
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:49,958
the Rio Canyon Jaguars and their
All-American quarterback, Ron Kovac.

555
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:53,921
And appearing in the championship game
for the first time in school history,

556
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,633
the Mica Mud Frogs, led by
their up-star quarterback, Zack James.

557
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:01,428
Tonight's conditions
are partly cloudy skies...

558
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,725
So, Mr. Robineau told me
that I get to take a guest to Tucson.

559
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,521
Do you wanna come with me?

560
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:11,855
What about your mom?

561
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,234
I'd rather go with you, Leo.

562
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:21,198
It'll be awesome, seeing you
doing your speech in front of people.

563
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,243
I mean, it's amazing to me
that you can even do that.

564
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,746
You get up in front of all these people
and play the trumpet.

565
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,248
That's different.

566
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,708
I mean, that's all of us.
No one's looking at me.

567
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:34,878
Besides, being with you is...

568
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,339
What?

569
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:40,884
Being with you is, like,

570
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:44,221
the most anyone has ever looked at me
in my entire life.

571
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:05,033
When some loud braggart
tries to put me down

572
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:09,538
And say his school is great
I tell him right away

573
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:13,625
Now what's the matter, buddy
Ain't ya heard of my school?

574
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,461
It's number one in the state

575
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:19,339
Hey, hey! Take it away!
Get that ball and play!

576
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:25,095
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy

577
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,640
Be true to your school now

578
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:32,186
Let your colors fly

579
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:35,856
Be true to your school

580
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,774
I got a letterman's sweater

581
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,403
With a letter in front
I got for football and track

582
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:44,072
I'm proud to wear it now
when I cruise around

583
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:47,993
The other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

584
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:51,538
So be true to your school now

585
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:55,125
Just like you would to your girl or guy

586
00:47:55,209 --> 00:48:01,632
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly

587
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,050
Be true to your school

588
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:06,470
Do it again, do it again!
We fight! We fight!

589
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,440
Whoo!

590
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:25,239
On Friday, we'll be jacked up
on the football game

591
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,699
And I'll be ready to fight

592
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,576
We're gonna smash 'em now

593
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,120
My girls will be workin'
on their pom-poms now

594
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,331
And they'll be yellin' tonight

595
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:37,709
So be true to your school now

596
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:41,129
Just like you would to your girl or guy

597
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:44,716
Be true to your school now

598
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,053
Let your colors fly

599
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,472
Be true to your school

600
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:54,351
Be true to your school now

601
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:58,313
Just like you would to your girl or guy

602
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:01,149
Be true to your school now

603
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,611
Let your colors fly

604
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:09,533
Be true to your school!

605
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,170
And another first down
for the Mud Frogs

606
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,589
gives them a first and goal
from the Jaguar four.

607
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,388
Come on, Mud Frogs!

608
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,640
Yeah!

609
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,142
Mud Frog touchdown.

610
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:37,352
Beautiful pass
from quarterback Zack James.

611
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:39,354
With under six minutes
in the third quarter...

612
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:40,981
That's mine. That's right, baby.

613
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,400
The Mud Frogs take the lead.

614
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:45,986
Yes!

615
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:54,912
And the extra point is good.

616
00:49:57,164 --> 00:50:00,250
And Ron Kovac continues this drive.

617
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,128
He's got a first and goal
from the Mud Frog seven.

618
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,298
Close on him, close on him.

619
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:07,883
And hut!

620
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:19,728
And that's a Jaguar
touchdown. Oh, what a pretty reverse.

621
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,272
Ron Kovac firing on all cylinders here...

622
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,446
And that's another third down
conversion for Kovac,

623
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,949
setting up the Jaguars
with a first and goal.

624
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,702
But with 1:12 left on the clock
and still trailing by four,

625
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:38,622
these Jaguars are gonna need
a touchdown to win.

626
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,333
So the Mud Frogs miracle season
comes down to this.

627
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,418
- Kovac! Kovac! Kovac!
- Can they stop Ron Kovac?

628
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:44,920
Hit 'em hard, Mud Frogs!

629
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:48,715
Defense! Defense! Defense!

630
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,892
And a vicious hit
stops Kovac for no game.

631
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:07,526
And there's an injury timeout
on the field. Injury timeout.

632
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,618
- He's not getting up.
- I don't think he's up.

633
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:22,666
Where's Stargirl...

634
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,919
What's going on? What...
What is she doing right now?

635
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,887
Wait, what is she doing?
Why is she helping him?

636
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,513
Yeah, she shouldn't.

637
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,814
Stargirl, where you going?

638
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:51,570
She can't leave. We need her.
She can't just leave.

639
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:33,487
Hey. I wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

640
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,571
Thank you.

641
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,077
We lost.

642
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,828
In case you were wondering.

643
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,667
Kovac's gonna be okay.

644
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,544
In case you were wondering.

645
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,804
After you left,
the whole team kinda just fell apart.

646
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,807
You... You're our good luck charm
and you left.

647
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,018
They're all angry. They're just angry.

648
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,611
I just want to understand.

649
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,948
Why did you go with him?

650
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,367
When he got hurt,

651
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,537
everyone was cheering

652
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,330
and then no one moved.

653
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,416
That's what you do at a game.

654
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:30,294
But it's... It's weird, isn't it?

655
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:33,881
Someone gets hurt

656
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:37,217
and everyone's
just standing, watching. I...

657
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,803
I don't know.

658
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:43,015
I just... I couldn't.

659
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:51,690
I don't know what's gonna happen.

660
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:57,946
But you're sad right now and...

661
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,283
And I don't want you to be.

662
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:05,704
I've been listening to the, um...

663
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,000
I wanted to...

664
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:20,093
Won't ya let me walk you home from school?

665
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:30,521
Won't ya let me meet you at the pool?

666
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:37,861
Maybe Friday I can

667
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:42,074
Get tickets for the dance

668
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:50,457
And I'll take you

669
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:02,594
Won't you tell your dad
"Get off my back"?

670
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:13,313
Tell him what we said
about "Paint It Black"

671
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:19,152
Rock and roll is here to stay

672
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:23,532
Come inside where it's okay

673
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:31,206
And I'll shake you

674
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,085
Ooh, ooh, ooh

675
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,843
Won't you tell me
what you're thinkin' of?

676
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:52,686
Would you be an outlaw for my love?

677
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,275
If it's so, well, let me know

678
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:02,529
If it's no, well, I can go

679
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:10,162
I won't make you

680
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:14,333
Ooh, ooh, ooh

681
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:45,656
Hi.

682
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,998
This is what I wanted for you.

683
00:56:55,082 --> 00:57:00,212
But now that it's happening,
it's strange.

684
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,131
Um, I kind of just wanna go to bed.

685
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,550
What's her name?

686
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,055
I'm trying here.

687
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,557
No, it's not you. It...

688
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,601
It's her name.

689
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:15,686
Huh?

690
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:17,813
Stargirl.

691
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:19,314
Excuse me?

692
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,942
It's... Her name is Stargirl.

693
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,740
Oh!

694
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,493
Leo. Shoot. Leo!

695
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,129
What was she thinking?

696
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,380
Stargirl has some nerve.

697
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:44,631
Why's Stargirl here?

698
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:46,592
Who does she think she is?

699
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,387
I can't believe she showed up today.

700
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,347
What is she doing here? Go home!

701
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,057
I could explain.

702
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,186
And I think they'd understand.

703
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,689
I... I don't know if it's a good idea.

704
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,275
They just want someone to blame.

705
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:08,405
Just ask him. Please?

706
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:27,216
You guys didn't tell me
you were coming here.

707
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,721
We've been coming here for weeks
without you.

708
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:34,973
You've been busy.

709
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:47,736
Where's your homework?

710
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:51,240
- Oh, I didn't bring it.
- Okay, so what do you want?

711
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:52,574
I just wanted to see you guys.

712
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,511
Now that Stargirl's been shunned,
you want us back?

713
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:55,994
- Kevin!
- It's not like that.

714
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:58,247
- It's not?
- I have a girlfriend. It happens.

715
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,207
- Not to us, it doesn't.
- It did to me.

716
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,709
It's really different
and I'm trying to figure it out.

717
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,678
And I promised
I wouldn't be one of those guys.

718
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:17,599
I'm sorry.

719
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:29,528
Well,
you never actually promised.

720
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,701
So, really, it's kind of your fault.

721
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:40,372
Want a slice?

722
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:42,624
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

723
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,724
So, um, she wants to do Hot Seat.

724
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,518
What?

725
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:04,479
Do you think that's a good idea?
They're all really mad.

726
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:07,858
How else is she gonna get everyone
to hear what she has to say? It's perfect.

727
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,194
I can totally see it. A 60 Minutes-style

728
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,738
mea culpa interview, an in-depth exposé,

729
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,072
why she did it.

730
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:18,076
- Are you cool with it, though?
- Why wouldn't I be?

731
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,995
Well, 'cause of the speech competition.

732
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,706
Guys, who cares about
the speech competition? This is huge.

733
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:25,167
Uh, also, we need promo.
Posters, school paper...

734
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,090
It'll be great.
The whole school's gonna watch.

735
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,130
- Tess, when can we book the studio?
- Frankie still has it until Tuesday.

736
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:31,715
Greetings, Mica High.

737
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:35,385
And thank you for coming out
to this very special episode of Hot Seat.

738
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,931
Today, our guest is Mica High's very own

739
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,809
speech champ and controversial
good luck charm herself, Stargirl Caraway.

740
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,230
The hope is we'll get some answers
as to why Stargirl

741
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:49,525
made the fateful decision
to betray her own school.

742
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,154
Today, we'll be turning up the heat
on Hot Seat.

743
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:09,253
So, before we get into more recent events,
let's start at the beginning.

744
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,922
- Is your name really Stargirl?
- Yes.

745
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,591
- So you were born Stargirl Caraway?
- Oh, no.

746
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,511
Come on,
you know you can't lie on Hot Seat.

747
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:22,474
I'm not lying. My name really is Stargirl.
It's just not the name I was born with.

748
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:26,019
Okay. What name were you born with?

749
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,691
Susan.

750
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:33,944
So then why Stargirl?

751
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:37,322
We're made from the dust of dead stars.

752
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:40,158
Okay, let's turn up the heat.

753
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,286
Um...

754
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,371
What brought you to Mica High
in the first place?

755
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:47,249
- I understand you were homeschooled?
- I was.

756
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,252
Um... I...

757
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:51,837
Camera two, go in close on Stargirl.

758
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,798
Yes?

759
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,594
I just wanted to make some friends.

760
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:02,306
- You have a weird way of showing it.
- Come on. You know how this show works.

761
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,433
Save your comments and questions
for later.

762
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:07,269
Uh, okay, so I understand that you

763
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:10,022
came on here today because
you wanted to set the record straight

764
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,608
about what happened at Friday's big game.

765
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:16,361
Tell us. Why'd you do it?

766
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,115
He was hurt and he was alone.

767
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:22,743
- He was on the other team.
- And he was killing us.

768
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:24,369
- Guys, seriously?
- He needed help.

769
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,288
There's coaches and medics for that.

770
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,081
He didn't wanna let go of my hand.

771
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:30,751
What makes you think
you know what everybody wants?

772
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:33,879
I... I don't think I...

773
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,548
You're right. You don't think.

774
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:43,388
Everybody else seems to be able to,
but then you're not like everybody else.

775
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:49,728
You do all these nice things for people
that are really just selfish.

776
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,565
Like the bike you left my brother.

777
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,361
I went to the thrift store
and asked them who bought it

778
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:01,156
and when they started to describe you,
I knew who they meant.

779
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:06,245
Did you even know why the bike was there?

780
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:12,125
Did it ever occur to you to find out?

781
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,255
I think that's all the time we have...

782
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:17,923
Go on, Hillary.

783
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,801
My mom didn't think
he was ready for a bike,

784
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,427
but my dad insisted.

785
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:24,471
After the accident,

786
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:28,517
my dad took it to the thrift store hoping
someone could at least use it, right?

787
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,147
Then it shows up on our doorstep.

788
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:40,737
Did you know my brother got so badly hurt
that he'll never ride a bike again?

789
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,950
My parents didn't know
who would do something like that.

790
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,954
So I went to the thrift store,

791
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:54,585
and, yeah, here we are.

792
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:04,261
Okay, everyone.
It's time to go home.

793
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:18,150
It got really hot.

794
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,830
Stargirl, please wait.
We can fix this.

795
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:34,541
There has to be a way to fix this.

796
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,168
Some things just take time.

797
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:40,047
Or maybe you don't have to do
all the things that you do.

798
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:42,174
What do you mean?

799
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:47,012
You could just hang out.
Like, when it's just us.

800
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,431
So you can go back to blending in.

801
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,558
- This isn't about me!
- It's not?

802
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:54,311
You were the one
that said you wanted to make friends!

803
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,771
- I do!
- Then listen to them!

804
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:00,234
Why can't you just be

805
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,070
more like everybody else?

806
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,449
Is that what you want?

807
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:09,409
I don't know.

808
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:12,079
But I think you'd be happy.

809
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,623
I think we could be happy.

810
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,543
Stargirl.

811
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:21,839
Stargirl, come on, I'll drive you home.

812
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:23,215
I'd rather walk.

813
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,426
It's getting dark.

814
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:28,554
I know.

815
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,329
Stargirl?

816
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,189
Do you still wanna go with me later?

817
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,483
- To Tucson?
- Yeah.

818
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,278
Yeah. Of course, I do, Susan.

819
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,543
Did you change your speech?

820
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:24,294
What?

821
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,839
Oh, uh...

822
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:27,923
Yeah.

823
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,341
What's the topic?

824
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:33,846
Um, whether or not the government
should be involved in Internet censorship.

825
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:36,431
Interesting choice.

826
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,267
Well, what happened to...

827
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,726
It was too weird.

828
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:57,638
We often ask ourselves

829
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,933
how much involvement
the government should have in our affairs.

830
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,983
Especially how it pertains
to how we obtain information.

831
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:04,663
I don't know why I was giving that speech.

832
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,460
I don't know
why I do a lot of things lately.

833
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:15,257
I bet you find that, too, right?

834
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:19,678
And it's because we don't think,
we just do.

835
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:24,516
We don't take a step back and process.

836
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,187
Everything's so instant these days.

837
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,771
How can we?

838
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,317
Dinner in minutes.

839
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,069
A thousand photographs in one burst.

840
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:39,781
You have to "like" something this second.

841
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:44,328
You have to know
how you feel about everything.

842
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:49,458
You can't be unsure
or confused or change your mind.

843
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:54,880
There's no time to figure out who you are.

844
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:57,257
You have to know right now.

845
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,387
Have you ever seen a flower grow?

846
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:09,853
I mean, of course not.
It's nearly impossible

847
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:12,940
to wait for anything that takes that long.

848
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:19,571
But, if you did, it would change you.

849
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:22,658
It would slow you down.

850
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:27,204
It would remind you
that real things take time.

851
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,417
And it's magic, too, isn't it?

852
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:37,881
I mean, so are 1,000 photographs
in one burst,

853
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:43,387
but a flower.

854
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:50,394
You plant a seed in the ground

855
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:54,690
and a whole world develops
and stretches out and opens up.

856
01:11:55,649 --> 01:12:00,487
It's easy to get confused
when we're moving so fast.

857
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:05,993
And to think we're doing the right thing

858
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:10,455
when really we're not.

859
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,084
But if we're lucky,

860
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,254
we could find a balance.

861
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:21,925
We could take a step back.
We could take a breath.

862
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:34,521
Next time you see a flower sticking up
out of the ground or in a vase,

863
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:40,861
just remember
that part of what makes it beautiful

864
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,615
is how long it took to grow.

865
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:16,146
Well done, Miss Caraway. Well done indeed.

866
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,707
Guys, don't forget,
chapters six and seven for tomorrow.

867
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,501
You never know what might be coming up!

868
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:09,116
We'll make an announcement
tomorrow morning.

869
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:15,247
Hey.

870
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,711
I'm really proud of you.

871
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,307
I'm sorry.

872
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:36,894
For what?

873
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:42,274
Well, I mean,
maybe it was silly, but I...

874
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:47,446
I guess I thought maybe some of them
would be happy you won.

875
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:50,782
People aren't happy because they win.

876
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:54,286
They win 'cause they're happy.

877
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,000
Susan, I...

878
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:03,378
Were you even listening?

879
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:04,713
- To what?
- My speech.

880
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:06,465
Of course.

881
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:07,633
That was Stargirl.

882
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:10,469
I'm Stargirl.

883
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:13,555
Susan didn't win that trophy. I did.

884
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:16,725
But you were talking about balance and...

885
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:21,063
I know that you think
that this would make it easier,

886
01:15:23,232 --> 01:15:26,568
but I can't just be somebody else.

887
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,779
But you're Susan. You are.
That's your name.

888
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:32,074
You're off the hook for the dance,
by the way.

889
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:35,661
You can't go with someone
who doesn't exist.

890
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,273
- Hey.
- Hey!

891
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:06,483
I didn't see you at school.

892
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:10,362
Uh, yeah, I was in and out pretty quickly.

893
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:13,824
It's cool she won.

894
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:17,160
You don't really think that.

895
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:20,706
I do. For real.

896
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,917
Well, then you are the only one.

897
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:30,883
So, uh, I was, um...

898
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:34,511
I was thinking about the first day we met.

899
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:38,015
I got to school, late, of course.

900
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:43,312
And the playground was completely empty
except for this kid lying in the middle.

901
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:47,608
I thought you were dead.

902
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,076
I don't know.

903
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,205
Maybe that's all she was doing.

904
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,668
Maybe she was just helping someone
get back up.

905
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:21,099
I know we haven't talked since the, um...

906
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,937
I'm sorry about the show.

907
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,021
Are you kidding me?

908
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:29,566
I'm a legend.
It's all anyone's talking about.

909
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:33,362
That's probably the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

910
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,492
- Good night, Kevin.
- Later.

911
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,100
This came for you.

912
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,273
Is it from her?

913
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:11,859
Stargirl?

914
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:22,202
Oh, man.

915
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:25,831
The Cars.

916
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:05,579
Were you ever afraid
of what people thought of you

917
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,457
when you were my age?

918
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,628
Like, to the point where
you did things you wish you didn't do?

919
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:15,088
You just describing a teenager?

920
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:24,681
Your dad

921
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:31,146
was one of the only people I ever knew
who was always completely himself.

922
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:38,028
Do you still, um...

923
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,198
Do you still miss him?

924
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:46,745
Every day.

925
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,458
I mean, not all day, every day,

926
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:53,919
but definitely every day.

927
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:57,673
I don't ever wanna stop missing him.

928
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,008
I don't either.

929
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:06,557
When we moved here after he died,

930
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:11,979
it was the first time
I really had to think about who I was.

931
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:19,027
Your dad was such a big personality
and he just...

932
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,655
He took up so much

933
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:25,325
space.

934
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:33,709
And even though it was painful,

935
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,837
I finally had to figure out
who I wanted to be.

936
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:39,214
Did you?

937
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,552
Well, I know more now than I did then.

938
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,389
I mean, of course,
I just wanna tell you everything.

939
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:51,518
I wanna give you all the answers,
but those are my answers.

940
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:59,902
Figuring out who we are is probably
the one thing no one else can do for us.

941
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:17,419
I think I still have some
of your dad's old records in the garage.

942
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:20,297
Should we go look?

943
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:53,121
Everybody's always obsessin'

944
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:55,749
'Bout what everybody thinks about them

945
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,752
But I don't wanna be like them, no

946
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:02,297
I just wanna dance, dance

947
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:04,675
Don't wanna think about nothin'

948
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:08,220
Just keep the stereo pumpin' and dance

949
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:11,723
I just wanna dance, dance

950
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,684
Don't wanna think about nothin'

951
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:17,271
Just put on somethin'
that's bumpin' and dance

952
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:25,487
With my eyes wide open

953
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:30,033
I can escape

954
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:33,620
Whoa oh oh

955
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:36,164
I'm wakin' up

956
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:41,420
I'm wakin' up while I'm sleepin'

957
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:51,180
I'm wakin' up, I'm wakin' up
while I'm sleepin'

958
01:22:58,478 --> 01:22:59,479
Hi.

959
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:02,065
Nice tie.

960
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:06,570
Um, you look... You look, um...

961
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:10,782
- Thanks, Leo.
- You're welcome, Stargirl.

962
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:16,580
Are you ready for your surprise?

963
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,832
I have no idea.

964
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,220
We have a special request
for this next song

965
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:35,682
and a special guest
to sing it with us, Leo Borlock!

966
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,729
- What?
- Leo?

967
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,151
You got this.

968
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:01,250
Leo's gonna sing?

969
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,468
I don't know what song you're doing.

970
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:15,055
Yeah, you do. You know, The Cars.

971
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:16,932
By the way, killer tie, man.

972
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,784
Sorry. Sorry.

973
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:04,396
I don't mind you comin' here

974
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,815
And wastin' all my time

975
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,154
'Cause when you're standin', oh, so near

976
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:14,323
I kinda lose my mind

977
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,995
It's not the perfume that you wear

978
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:23,832
It's not the ribbons in your hair

979
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:27,377
And I don't mind you comin' here

980
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:30,547
And wastin' all my time

981
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:48,982
I don't mind you hangin' out

982
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:53,529
And talkin' in your sleep

983
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:57,199
It doesn't matter where you've been

984
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:00,827
As long as it was deep, yeah

985
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,040
You always knew to wear it well

986
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,876
And you look so fancy, I can tell

987
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,673
And I don't mind you hangin' out

988
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:16,468
And talking in your sleep

989
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:21,682
I guess you're just what I needed

990
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:26,186
I needed someone to feed

991
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,938
I guess you're just what I needed

992
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:30,065
Just what I needed

993
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,443
I needed someone to bleed

994
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:34,695
Yeah!

995
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,149
I never said I was sorry.

996
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,363
I'm really sorry.

997
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:15,606
And just like that, she was gone.

998
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,110
Her mom sold the house.

999
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:25,490
I imagine they were on the road somewhere.

1000
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:30,996
But even though she was gone,

1001
01:29:32,706 --> 01:29:34,166
she was everywhere.

1002
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:25,592
But I still didn't know.

1003
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:28,679
Was it real?

1004
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:31,306
Or was it something else?

1005
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:37,437
Dinosaurs can kind of do a number
on your brain, can't they?

1006
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:42,150
- What?
- They seem magical,

1007
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,695
these enormous beasts,

1008
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:48,866
roaming some mystical place.

1009
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,829
But they were real.

1010
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,166
And they were here.

1011
01:31:08,302 --> 01:31:09,511
Look at this bone.

1012
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,639
Now there is nothing more real than that.

1013
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:16,643
But that doesn't make it any less magical.

1014
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:21,398
You think things have to be real or magic,

1015
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:26,361
but the best things are both.

1016
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:32,242
She asked me to show you something.

1017
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:53,889
And there, in her office,

1018
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:58,143
I finally saw her.

1019
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:05,776
All her glitter and ribbons

1020
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:07,110
and magic tricks.

1021
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:19,414
Information found just like anyone else.

1022
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,209
Only nobody else did find it.

1023
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:26,421
'Cause nobody else cared to.

1024
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:43,063
Who cares about strangers' birthdays?

1025
01:32:45,274 --> 01:32:47,359
Or stories about other people?

1026
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:57,327
Who would take the time
for someone they don't even know?

1027
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:04,042
And the time to learn and grow when
they realize they did something wrong?

1028
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:15,971
And even though I couldn't find her,

1029
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:18,432
she still found a way,

1030
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:20,058
every now and then,

1031
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,394
to find me.

1032
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:33,071
For a while,
she was all anyone could talk about.

1033
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,117
Where did she go? Why did she leave?

1034
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:40,245
And why was she here in the first place?

1035
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:44,791
Did it all happen for a reason?

1036
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:50,797
Or was it just one of those things?

1037
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:01,517
It got to the point
where people started to wonder

1038
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,561
if she'd been a ghost or an alien.

1039
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:10,108
Or maybe out of boredom,

1040
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:12,110
we just made her up.

1041
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:18,825
As the years went by,
the stories got more elaborate.

1042
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:21,745
She played every instrument
in the marching band.

1043
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,585
She could make flowers
appear out of thin air.

1044
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:33,423
She knew what you were thinking
before you did.

1045
01:34:35,676 --> 01:34:39,638
One time, I even heard she could fly.

1046
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:46,353
Later, when those of us
who were there got together,

1047
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:47,855
we would laugh about it.

1048
01:34:50,357 --> 01:34:54,862
Laugh at how ridiculous they were,
at how some kids would believe anything.

1049
01:34:58,448 --> 01:35:01,785
But as the memories became stories,

1050
01:35:01,869 --> 01:35:03,829
and the stories became memories,

1051
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:06,790
even we began to wonder.

1052
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:22,514
She was just a girl, wasn't she?

1053
01:35:35,027 --> 01:35:37,029
A girl just like anyone else.

1054
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:49,041
It was silly to even talk about it.

1055
01:35:52,628 --> 01:35:56,715
After all, nothing ever happened here.

1056
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,105
Nothing at all.

1057
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:31,458
Give me love Give me love

1058
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:36,922
Give me peace on earth
Give me light

1059
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:42,344
Give me life
Keep me free from birth

1060
01:36:42,427 --> 01:36:45,764
Give me hope, help me cope

1061
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:52,563
With this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you

1062
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:57,276
With heart and soul

1063
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:14,543
Oh, my Lord please

1064
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:25,637
Take hold of my hand

1065
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:30,142
And I might understand you

1066
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:33,187
Won't you please Oh, won't you

1067
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:36,523
Gimme love Give me love

1068
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:41,445
Give me peace on earth
Give me light

1069
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:46,241
Give me life
Keep me free from birth

1070
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:49,328
Give me hope Help me cope

1071
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:55,667
With this heavy load
Tryin' to touch you, tryin' to reach you

1072
01:37:55,751 --> 01:38:00,672
With my heart and soul

1073
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:17,272
Oh, my Lord please

1074
01:38:23,237 --> 01:38:28,367
Take hold of my hand

1075
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:32,996
And I might understand you

1076
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,042
Won't you please Oh, won't you?

1077
01:38:55,936 --> 01:39:01,900
Don't say maybe Just await me

1078
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:05,153
We can stay here

1079
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:11,118
For as long as we want

1080
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:14,830
Make forever last a while

1081
01:39:20,043 --> 01:39:23,505
Leave the light on

1082
01:39:23,589 --> 01:39:26,550
After the song

1083
01:39:26,633 --> 01:39:32,514
Leaves and goes to a far off ocean

1084
01:39:32,598 --> 01:39:39,104
Lay here with me

1085
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:48,655
And I'll catch you

1086
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:55,579
Falling into me Falling into you

1087
01:39:55,662 --> 01:40:01,418
Letting go of all the things
I thought were true

1088
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:07,633
Falling into me
as I'm falling into you

1089
01:40:07,716 --> 01:40:14,097
It seems so clear
that I don't know what to do

1090
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,691
I speak too much
You stay closed off

1091
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,694
But I can see

1092
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:33,033
Your thoughts in the stardust

1093
01:40:33,909 --> 01:40:37,454
Shining back at me

1094
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:46,380
As I catch you

1095
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:53,595
Falling into me Falling into you

1096
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:59,643
Letting go of all the things
I thought were true

1097
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:05,649
Falling into me as I'm falling into you

1098
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:11,071
It seems so clear
that I don't know what to do

1099
01:41:41,226 --> 01:41:47,357
One day I'll be old and ugly

1100
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:53,447
Will you still be thinking of me?

1101
01:41:53,530 --> 01:42:00,204
If we were as brave as we are now

1102
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:10,172
And I'll catch you

1103
01:42:10,255 --> 01:42:16,220
Thinking of me as I'm thinking of you

1104
01:42:16,303 --> 01:42:21,683
Letting go of all the things
I thought were true

1105
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:28,232
As you're falling into me
I'm falling into you

1106
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:34,238
It seems so clear
that I don't know what to do

1107
01:42:57,511 --> 01:42:59,513
That's it.
