1
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:54,105
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,172
there was a girl called Ella.

3
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,306
And she saw the world
not always as it was,

4
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,140
but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.

5
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,173
Ah, my darling!

6
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:14,174
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
To her mother and father, she was a princess.

7
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:18,040
True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,

8
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:21,507
but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,374
whose borders were the house 
and meadow on the forest's edge

10
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:28,208
where her people
had lived for generations.

11
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,541
With Mr. Goose...

12
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:36,841
and all their animal family.

13
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:39,675
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?

14
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,709
Let the little ones
have their share.

15
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:44,942
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

16
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,542
Oh, Gus-Gus,

17
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:48,875
you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

18
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,643
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

19
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:53,309
And you mustn't eat
Mr. Goose's food.

20
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:54,776
Isn't that right, Mummy?

21
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,142
Do you still believe
that they understand you?

22
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,077
Don't they, Mother?

23
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,077
Oh, yes.

24
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,976
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us

25
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,544
if we only have
the ear for it.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,110
That's how we learn
to look after them.

27
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:09,844
Who looks after us?

28
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,143
Fairy godmothers, of course.

29
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:13,877
And do you believe in them?

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,344
I believe in everything.

31
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:17,677
Then I believe
in everything, too.

32
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,011
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Her father was a merchant

33
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:23,712
who went abroad

34
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:27,345
and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.

35
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,512
Ella!

36
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:32,478
Where are my girls,
my beautiful girls?

37
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:35,912
Where are my darlings?

38
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,978
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Ella missed
him terribly when he was away.

39
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:42,446
But she knew
he would always return.

40
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,546
ELLA'S FATHER:
There she is!

41
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,546
Papa, welcome home!

42
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,479
ELLA'S FATHER:
How are you?

43
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:47,679
You've grown!

44
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:49,480
Haven't you, now?

45
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,647
MAN: There you go, sir.

46
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,647
What was that?

47
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,046
Oh, this?

48
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,213
I found it hanging on a tree.

49
00:02:57,246 --> 00:03:00,914
I think
there may be something inside.

50
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,581
Oh, it's so pretty.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,381
In French,
that is  un papillon.

52
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,516
Ouch. Ouch.

53
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,382
You're standing on my feet.

54
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,149
Shall we?

55
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:32,116
Look, Mummy!
I'm dancing!

56
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,050
Whee!

57
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,650
Little  papillon.

58
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,317
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
All was just as it should be.

59
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,718
They knew themselves to be the most 
happy of families to live as they did

60
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,617
and to love each other so.

61
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,217
♪ When I am king
dilly, dilly

62
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,617
♪ You shall be queen

63
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,385
♪ Lavender's green
dilly, dilly

64
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,218
♪ Lavender's blue

65
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,885
♪ You must love me
dilly, dilly

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,419
♪ For I love you ♪

67
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,720
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  But sorrow
can come to any kingdom,

68
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,520
no matter how happy.

69
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,087
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
And so it came to Ella's home.

70
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,153
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:43,554
ELLA'S FATHER:
Thank you, Doctor.

72
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,021
This must have been
very difficult for you.

73
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,388
Come.

74
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,322
Ella.

75
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:08,655
ELLA'S MOTHER:
Ella, my darling.

76
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,556
I want to tell you a secret.

77
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,322
A great secret
that will see you through

78
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:16,923
all the trials
that life can offer.

79
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,489
You must always
remember this.

80
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,923
Have courage and be kind.

81
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,657
You have more kindness
in your little finger

82
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,690
than most people possess
in their whole body.

83
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:36,924
And it has power,
more than you know.

84
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,790
And magic.

85
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,790
ELLA: Magic?

86
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:41,657
Truly.

87
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,992
Have courage and be kind,
my darling.

88
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,925
Will you promise me?

89
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,359
I promise.

90
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:53,192
ELLA'S MOTHER: Good.

91
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,058
Good.

92
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,392
And...

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,225
I must go very soon, my love.

94
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,592
Please forgive me.

95
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,427
Of course
I forgive you.

96
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,393
ELLA'S MOTHER:
I love you.

97
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,227
ELLA'S FATHER:
I love you, my darling.

98
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,328
ELLA'S MOTHER:
I love you.

99
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:44,696
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Time passed,
and pain turned to memory.

100
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,496
In her heart,
Ella stayed the same.

101
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,796
For she remembered
her promise to her mother.

102
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,264
Have courage, and be kind.

103
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,230
Father, however,
was much changed.

104
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:17,230
But he hoped
for better times.

105
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,731
"And thence home,

106
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:25,630
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

107
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,231
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

108
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,031
"I know him not."

109
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,998
Thus ends Mr. Pepys
for today.

110
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,498
I do love a happy ending,
don't you?

111
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,432
They're quite
my favorite sort.

112
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,932
As well they should be.

113
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,399
Ella...

114
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:48,000
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps...

115
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,933
to begin a new chapter.

116
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,499
Indeed, Father?

117
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,733
You'll recall that some
time ago, in my travels,

118
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,799
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

119
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes.

120
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,900
The Master of
the Mercer's Guild, is he not?

121
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,734
Was.

122
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,101
The poor man
has died, alas.

123
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,434
His widow,

124
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:11,234
an honorable woman,

125
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,568
finds herself alone,

126
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,568
though still in the
prime of her life.

127
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,435
You're worried
about telling me.

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,935
But you mustn't be.

129
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,469
Not if it will lead
to your happiness.

130
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:27,536
Yes.

131
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:29,602
Happiness.

132
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:36,202
Do you think I may be
allowed one last chance,

133
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,936
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?

134
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,536
Of course I do, Father.

135
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:48,303
She'll merely be
your stepmother.

136
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:51,104
And you'll have two lovely
sisters to keep you company.

137
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,404
Have courage, be kind.

138
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:15,405
ELLA'S FATHER:
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

139
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:16,904
ANASTASIA:
She's skinny as a broomstick!

140
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,405
DRISELLA:
And that stringy hair!

141
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,572
You're very nice.

142
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,405
ELLA: Welcome.
I'm so happy to meet you.

143
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,505
You have
such pretty hair.

144
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,206
Thank you.

145
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,206
You should
have it styled.

146
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,239
Oh.
I'm sure you're right.

147
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,672
Would you like
a tour of the house?

148
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,672
What did she say?

149
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,740
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

150
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,006
She's proud of it, I think.

151
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,006
Do they keep animals inside?

152
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:41,174
STEPMOTHER: How charming.
How perfectly charming.

153
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,441
Lucifer.

154
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:46,873
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Her stepmother-to-be

155
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:50,073
was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.

156
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:53,674
And she, too, had known grief.

157
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:56,008
But she wore it
wonderfully well.

158
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:29,176
You did not say your
daughter was so beautiful.

159
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,377
Oh, she takes after her...

160
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,444
Her mother.

161
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:37,310
Just so.

162
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,343
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?

163
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,577
DRISELLA: She's lying.
That's just good manners.

164
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,910
ANASTASIA:
Shut up.

165
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,977
DRISELLA:
How long has your family lived here?

166
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,744
Over 200 years.

167
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,644
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?

168
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,378
STEPMOTHER:
Anastasia, hush.

169
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,545
They'll think
you are in earnest.

170
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:56,878
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella's stepmother,

171
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,011
high-spirited lady
that she was,

172
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:02,512
set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.

173
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,212
STEPMOTHER:
Oh, you are awful, Baron.

174
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,113
BARON:
Ah, fortune favors me again.

175
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,079
ELLA: Well, look who's
having a party of their own.

176
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:27,247
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda,
greedy Gus-Gus.

177
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,114
Uh-oh.

178
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:34,047
Just what...

179
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,481
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

180
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,715
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.

181
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:45,614
Go on, now.
You've plenty of cat food to keep you happy.

182
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,549
We ladies must help
one another.

183
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:56,049
You're missing the party.

184
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,216
Oh, I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

185
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:01,582
And I'm leaving
first thing, El.

186
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,416
No. But you're...

187
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,450
You're hardly back
from the last trip.

188
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,416
Do you have to go?

189
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:10,583
It's just a few months,
my darling.

190
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,750
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?

191
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:17,150
You know, your sisters...

192
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:19,550
uh, stepsisters,
have asked for

193
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,950
parasols and lace.

194
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,117
What will you have?

195
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:29,617
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.

196
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,385
That's a curious request.

197
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,051
Well, you'll have
to take it with you

198
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,917
on your way...

199
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,151
and think of me
when you look at it.

200
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:43,385
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

201
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,119
And that's
what I really want.

202
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,686
For you to come back.

203
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,519
No matter what.

204
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:56,686
ELLA'S FATHER: I will.

205
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:03,387
Ella, while I'm away,

206
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,653
I want you to be good
to your stepmother

207
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,554
and stepsisters,
even though they may be...

208
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,387
trying at times.

209
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,254
I promise.

210
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,254
Thank you.

211
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,454
I always leave
a part of me behind, Ella.

212
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,588
Remember that.

213
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:24,621
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

214
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,388
She's the very heart
of this place.

215
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,255
And that's why we must
cherish this house,

216
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,688
always, for her.

217
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:37,556
I miss her.

218
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,522
Do you?

219
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,689
Very much.

220
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,757
ANASTASIA: Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!

221
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,190
DRISELLA:
And my parasol!

222
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:04,391
For my complexion!

223
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,890
That means skin,
if you don't know!

224
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,924
ELLA: Bye!

225
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:13,657
ELLA'S FATHER:
Bye, Ella!

226
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,758
ELLA:
I love you!

227
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,458
ELLA'S FATHER:
I love you, too!

228
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,192
ELLA: Bye!

229
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:44,360
STEPMOTHER:
Ella, dear.

230
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,561
Now, now.
Mustn't blub.

231
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:58,894
Yes, Stepmother.

232
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,527
Oh, you needn't
call me that.

233
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:04,261
"Madam" will do.

234
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,894
DRISELLA: There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

235
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,228
Well, then make
yourself smaller!

236
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:09,728
Anastasia and Drisella

237
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,161
have always shared a room.

238
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,295
Such dear,
affectionate girls.

239
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,262
ANASTASIA: Or...
Or better yet, disappear entirely!

240
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,728
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

241
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:21,396
Sometimes I could scratch
your eyes out!

242
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,095
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

243
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:29,429
Oh, well, my bedroom's
the biggest besides
yours and Father's.

244
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,296
Perhaps they'd like
to share it.

245
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,163
What a wonderful idea.

246
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:36,130
What a good girl you are.

247
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:38,530
I can stay in the...

248
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,630
The attic.

249
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:41,464
Quite so.

250
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,330
The attic?

251
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:47,231
Yes.

252
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:51,364
Oh, only temporarily, while I have 
all the other rooms redecorated.

253
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:53,197
The attic's
so nice and airy

254
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,865
and you'll be away from
all of our fuss and bother.

255
00:15:56,898 --> 00:16:01,965
You'd be even more cozy if you kept 
all this bric-a-brac up there with you.

256
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,431
Keep you amused.

257
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,967
Well...

258
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,102
no one shall disturb me here.

259
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,136
Oh, hello, Gus-Gus.

260
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:08,635
Oh...

261
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:12,869
Oh.

262
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:16,870
Go on, Gus-Gus,
you can do it.

263
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:20,137
So this is where
you take refuge.

264
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:24,070
Me too, it would seem.

265
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:26,371
Right.

266
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:28,936
Who's going to help me?

267
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,103
Simpleton.

268
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,704
That is the last straw.

269
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,738
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.

270
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,372
How very pleasant.

271
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:39,637
No cats...

272
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,472
and no stepsisters.

273
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:46,605
We have a halfwit
for a sister.

274
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:47,838
I've got two.

275
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,738
I heard that.

276
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,505
Who is she
talking to?

277
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,505
She's mad.

with Ella's stepsisters.

294
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:42,509

FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella's great comfort

308
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:08,081
were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.

309
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:10,514
The weeks away
lengthened to months,

310
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:13,615
but every day would bring his thoughts
 from some distant part.

MAN: Miss Ella,
it's the mail coach!

313
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,315
ELLA: Farmer John?

314
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:23,249
FARMER JOHN: Miss Ella.

315
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:25,049
It's your father, miss.

316
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:28,082
He took ill on the road.

317
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:32,116
He's passed on, miss.

318
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,050
He's gone.

319
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:40,150
To the end,
he spoke only of you, miss.

320
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,583
And your mother.

321
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:45,484
I was to give you this.

322
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,083
ANASTASIA:
But what about my lace?

323
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,683
DRISELLA: My parasol?

324
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:54,084
Can't you see?
None of that matters.

325
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,318
We're ruined.

326
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:00,917
How will we live?

327
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,318
Thank you.

328
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:14,619
It must have been
very difficult for you.

329
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,455
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
How indeed to live.

330
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:07,722
Economies had to be taken.

331
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:10,589
Ella's stepmother dismissed
the household.

332
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,090
Her stepmother
and stepsisters

333
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:31,591
ever misused her.

334
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:34,758
And by and by
they considered Ella

335
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:38,391
less a sister than a servant.

336
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,457
And so Ella was left
to do all the work.

337
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:50,625
This was a good thing,
for it distracted her from her grief.

338
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:52,425
At least that was what
her stepmother said.

339
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:58,725
And she and her two daughters
were more than happy

340
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:02,159
to provide Ella with lots
and lots of distraction.

341
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:14,926
In their defense, they did share 
with her the very food they ate,

342
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,494
or rather,
the scraps from their table.

343
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,727
She had little
in the way of friends.

344
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,093
Well, her friends
were very little.

345
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,727
There you are.

346
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,427
Have dinner with me,
won't you?

347
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:34,860
But those friends
she had, she treated with an open heart

348
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,328
and an open hand.

349
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,162
Your table.

350
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,630
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Sometimes,
by the end of the day,

351
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:08,096
the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,

352
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:10,963
so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth

353
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:12,430
to keep warm.

354
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,798
I thought breakfast
was ready.

355
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,198
It is, madam.

356
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,632
I'm only mending the fire.

357
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:40,198
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?

358
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:41,465
As you wish.

359
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,499
Ella, what's that
on your face?

360
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,133
Madam?

361
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:51,733
It's ash from
the fireplace.

362
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,966
Do clean yourself up.

363
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,633
You'll get cinders
in our tea.

364
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,133
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

365
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,433
ANASTASIA: I couldn't
bear to look so dirty.

366
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,200
Oh, Dirty Ella.

367
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,467
Cinder-ella!

368
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,033
That's what we'll call you.

369
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,066
STEPMOTHER: Oh, girls,

370
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,400
you're too clever.

371
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,234
Who's this for?

372
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:17,235
Is there someone
we've forgotten?

373
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,535
It's my place.

374
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,234
It seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast,

375
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:25,067
serve it and
still sit with us.

376
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,935
Wouldn't you prefer
to eat when all the work is done, Ella?

377
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,002
Or should I say,
"Cinderella"?

378
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:31,735
Hmm?

379
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:18,871
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Cinderella.

380
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,606
Names have power,
like magic spells.

381
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:25,238
And of a sudden,
it seemed to her

382
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,205
that her stepmother
and stepsisters

383
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:29,139
had indeed transformed her

384
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,305
into merely a creature
of ash

385
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,472
and toil.

386
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:57,107
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

387
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:12,608
Run!

388
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,609
Quickly, my friend,
or they'll catch you!

389
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,143
Go!

390
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:19,642
Whoa! Easy!

391
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:25,909
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Perhaps it was just 
as well that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.

392
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:28,276
For had she not run
to the forest,

393
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:30,443
she might never have met
the prince.

394
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:35,210
CINDERELLA: Easy! Easy!
Whoa! Whoa!

395
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,910
Easy, boy!

396
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:38,077
Come on, boy, slow down!

397
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:41,243
PRINCE: Miss!

398
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,744
Miss! Are you all right?

399
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,577
Hold on!

400
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,111
CINDERELLA:
I'm all right, thank you!

401
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,211
That's fine.

402
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,211
Whoa!

403
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,378
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

404
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,511
Whoa.

405
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,511
Whoa.

406
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,311
Are you all right?

407
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,311
I'm all right,

408
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,345
but you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.

409
00:27:58,845 --> 00:27:59,912
Who?

410
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,545
The stag.

411
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:02,812
What's he
ever done to you

412
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:04,711
that you should
chase him about?

413
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:08,379
I must confess I've
never met him before.

414
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,145
He is a friend of yours?

415
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,813
An acquaintance.

416
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,179
We met just now.

417
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:15,946
I looked into his eyes,

418
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:18,546
and he looked into mine,

419
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:21,113
and I just felt he had
a great deal left to do with his life.

420
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,413
That's all.

421
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,514
Miss, what do they call you?

422
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,747
Never mind what they call me.

423
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,313
PRINCE: You shouldn't be this
deep in the forest alone.

424
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:33,614
I'm not alone.
I'm with you, Mister...

425
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,480
What do they call you?

426
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:38,647
You don't know who I am?

427
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,648
That is...

428
00:28:40,746 --> 00:28:42,047
They call me Kit.

429
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,314
Well, my father does

430
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,581
when he's in a good mood.

431
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:47,281
And...

432
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:49,781
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

433
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:51,148
At the palace.

434
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:53,648
My father's
teaching me his trade.

435
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:54,648
You're an apprentice?

436
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:56,416
Of a sort.

437
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:58,649
That's very fine.

438
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,482
Do they treat you well?

439
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,516
Better than I deserve,
most likely.

440
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:04,183
And you?

441
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,316
They treat me
as well as they're able.

442
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,683
I'm sorry.

443
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,350
It's not your doing.

444
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,517
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

445
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:20,483
It's not so very bad.

446
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:22,583
Others have it worse,
I'm sure.

447
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:24,184
We must...

448
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,618
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?

449
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,818
Yes.

450
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:33,351
You're right.

451
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,085
That's exactly how I feel.

452
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:43,752
Please don't
let them hurt him.

453
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:47,218
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

454
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,685
Just because it's what's done
 doesn't mean it's what should be done.

455
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:51,619
Right again.

456
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,186
Then,

457
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:57,319
you'll leave him alone,
won't you?

458
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:01,319
I will.

459
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:05,620
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

460
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:07,986
CAPTAIN: Ah.

461
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,487
There you are, Your High...

462
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,387
It's Kit! Kit!

463
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,287
Kit! I'm Kit.
I'm on my way.

464
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,720
Well,
we'd better get a move on,

465
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,187
Mr. Kit.

466
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:20,254
As I said.

467
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,087
On my way.

468
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,189
I hope to see
you again, miss.

469
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,289
And I, you.

470
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:25,392
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.

471
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,292
She wasn't a
"pretty girl."

472
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,925
Well, she was a pretty girl,

473
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,325
but there was
so much more to her.

474
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:32,592
How much more?
You've only met her once.

475
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,325
How could you know
anything about her?

476
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:36,459
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.

477
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:38,226
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

478
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,425
You would have
loved her anyway.

479
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,492
KING: I would
never have seen her,

480
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,792
because it wouldn't
have been appropriate.

481
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:46,159
And my father would have told me
what I'm telling you

482
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,293
and I would have listened.

483
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:48,426
No, you wouldn't.

484
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:48,426
Yes, I would.

485
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,460
No, you wouldn't.

486
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,460
I would.

487
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:50,193
You wouldn't.

488
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:50,193
You're right.

489
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,094
Well, how is he?

490
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,161
Your Majesty...

491
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,961
KING: Never mind.

492
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:08,294
If it takes that long to work out
 a way to say it, I already know.

493
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:13,362
Father...

494
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,262
Way of all flesh, boy.

495
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:20,662
Come.

496
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:21,662
We shall be late.

497
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,229
And punctuality is the...

498
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:29,296
BOTH:
...politeness of princes.

499
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:31,262
ROYAL CRIER:
His Majesty, the King!

500
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,329
GRAND DUKE: I'm sure your father spoke
 to you of your behavior in the forest.

501
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:35,062
Is it any business
of yours, Grand Duke?

502
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,996
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

503
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:40,063
It will not do to
let the stag go free.

504
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:42,930
Just because it's what's done 
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

505
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,464
Or something like that.

506
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,297
MAN: Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,

507
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,996
patiently awaits.

508
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:49,730
KING: Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

509
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:51,931
We must attract
a suitable bride,

510
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:54,664
even if he won't listen
to a word I say.

511
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:56,964
MR. PHINEUS: I shall endeavor to
please, Your Majesty.

512
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,131
But I can't work miracles.

513
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:01,164
A splendid canvas,
Master Phineus.

514
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,431
MR. PHINEUS: Thank you.

515
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,164
As if he knows
anything about art.

516
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:05,331
PRINCE:
So, these portraits

517
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:07,131
will really be sent abroad?

518
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:10,731
To induce the high and mighty to attend
this ball you insist upon.

519
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:12,798
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.

520
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:15,332
At which you will
choose a bride.

521
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:16,898
Ah, fascinating.

522
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:21,165
If I must marry, could I not wed,
 say, a good, honest country girl?

523
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:24,799
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

524
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,133
How will she make
the kingdom stronger?

525
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,833
We are a small kingdom amongst 
great states, Your Royal Highness.

526
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,033
And it's a dangerous world.

527
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:35,433
Listen, boy.

528
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,767
MAN: Taking you up,
Master Phineus.

529
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,767
MR. PHINEUS: Good.

530
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,634
I want to see you
and the kingdom safe.

531
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,534
All right, Father,

532
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:46,201
on one condition.

533
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,734
Let the invitations
go to everyone, not just the nobility.

534
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,935
The wars have brought
sorrow on us all.

535
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,235
What do you think?

536
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,068
Would that please the people?

537
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,435
It's beyond my wit,
Your Majesty.

538
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:02,135
But I wouldn't mind
a bit of a jolly.

539
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,602
I think we might have
made a bargain.

540
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:09,069
A ball for the people,

541
00:34:09,102 --> 00:34:11,102
and a princess
for the prince.

542
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,669
Sounds like a step
in the right direction, if you ask...

543
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,969
We didn't ask you.

544
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,570
MR. PHINEUS: I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

545
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:19,470
Down, please, Samson.

546
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:22,336
Haven't even got a cushion.

547
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,937
Right, down, down.
Not that... Oi!

548
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,803
I'm on the ground.

549
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:29,837
I am literally on the ground.
Sorry.

550
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,970
Actually this is a
very good angle for you.

551
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,604
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

552
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,838
WOMAN:
You don't look well, miss.

553
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:51,038
Not at all.

554
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,439
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

555
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,572
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

556
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,939
to cherish the place
we were so happy.

557
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:02,606
They loved our house...

558
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:07,172
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

559
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,673
It's my home.

560
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:12,473
Hear ye! Hear ye!

561
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,006
Quiet!

562
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,506
"Know,

563
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,507
"on this day,
two weeks hence,

564
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,173
"there shall be held,
at the palace,

565
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,474
"a Royal Ball.

566
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:27,007
"At said ball,

567
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,341
"in accordance
with ancient custom,

568
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:33,774
"the prince shall choose
a bride.

569
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,174
"Furthermore,

570
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:38,641
"at the behest
of the prince,

571
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:42,908
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,

572
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,376
"be she noble or commoner...

573
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:49,175
"is invited to attend.

574
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:55,676
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."

575
00:35:57,942 --> 00:35:59,676
CINDERELLA:
Excuse me, madam.

576
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,976
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella was enormously excited

577
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,676
to see Kit, the apprentice.

578
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:07,510
And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued

579
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,276
by the notion
of meeting the prince.

580
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:13,410
DRISELLA: I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

581
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:16,010
ANASTASIA: This is the
most hugest news!

582
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,544
Calm yourselves.

583
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,910
Now listen to me.

584
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:22,444
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.

585
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:24,644
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared

586
00:36:24,677 --> 00:36:26,344
when we came to
this backwater!

587
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:28,411
I, a princess?

588
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:29,511
ANASTASIA:
Or rather, I,

589
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,379
a princess?

590
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:34,145
Having delivered your news,

591
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:36,278
why are you still here?

592
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,245
You must return
to town right away

593
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:40,712
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns.

594
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:42,446
Three?

595
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,379
That's very
thoughtful of you.

596
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:47,579
What do you mean?

597
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:49,079
CINDERELLA:
To think of me.

598
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,745
Think of you?

599
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:53,012
DRISELLA: Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.

600
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,346
Poor, slow,
little Cinders.

601
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,313
How embarrassing.

602
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,180
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

603
00:36:58,212 --> 00:37:00,480
Oh, no.
I only want to see my friend.

604
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,047
Let me be very clear.

605
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,113
One gown for Anastasia,

606
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:07,681
one for Drisella,

607
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,848
and one for me!

608
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,347
She doesn't know
what that means.

609
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,814
Good.
Right.

610
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:22,848
That's settled then.

611
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:24,582
Now go!

612
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:27,181
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

613
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:30,482
You must get there first before 
the seamstress is drowning in work!

614
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,015
Tell me what
she said, Drisella.

615
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:33,549
I speak French,
not Italian!

616
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,517
CAPTAIN: Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

617
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,817
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,417
You've been off
since the hunt.

619
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,183
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

620
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:00,750
But there are
plenty of girls.

621
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:03,517
But her spirit,
her goodness...

622
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,684
You don't suppose she has a sister,
do you?

623
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:06,284
I don't know.

624
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,017
I don't know
anything about her.

625
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,351
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

626
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,184
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?

627
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:15,485
Captain.

628
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:16,651
It was for the benefit
of the people.

629
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:17,785
Of course.

630
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:19,018
How shallow of me.

631
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,685
And if she comes,
then what?

632
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:22,785
Then you will tell
her you're a prince.

633
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,985
And a prince may
take whichever bride he wishes.

634
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:25,985
Ha!

635
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:25,985
Ha?

636
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:27,352
Yes, "ha."

637
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,752
You know my father
and the Grand Duke

638
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:30,919
will only have me
marry a princess.

639
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:34,119
Well, if this girl from
the forest is as charming as you say,

640
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,220
they may change
their minds.

641
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:41,253
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
The day of the ball arrived

642
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,186
and the entire kingdom

643
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:46,020
held its breath
in anticipation.

644
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:47,620
ANASTASIA:  You want
me to be your queen?

645
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:50,120
Who? Me?

646
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,321
Tighter.

647
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:53,455
Tighter!

648
00:38:54,454 --> 00:38:55,221
Tighter.

649
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,688
That's it!

650
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,120
A vision, sister.

651
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:00,855
Likewise.

652
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,788
ANASTASIA: We must compete
for the prince's hand.

653
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:05,355
But let it not mean we harbor 
dark thoughts against each other.

654
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,921
DRISELLA:
Of course not, dear sister.

655
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:11,422
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you before
we leave for the ball.

656
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:14,288
Oh, nor I of pushing you
from a moving carriage on the way there.

657
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:18,355
Or I of dashing your brains out on the
palace steps as we arrive.

658
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:20,356
We are sisters, after all.

659
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:23,189
And blood is so much
thicker than water.

660
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:25,189
We shall let
the prince decide.

661
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:26,823
What will he be like,
I wonder?

662
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:30,590
What does it matter
what he's like?

663
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:33,857
He's rich beyond reason.

664
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,790
Wouldn't you like to know a bit about him
before you marry him?

665
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:39,357
Certainly not.
It might change my mind.

666
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,023
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

667
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,658
Have you, moon-face?

668
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,324
I have, once.

669
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:48,024
To a gentleman.

670
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:50,024
Some menial, no doubt.

671
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,524
Some 'prentice.

672
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,158
He was an apprentice, yes.

673
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,425
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

674
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,258
The sooner you learn that,
the better.

675
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,992
ANASTASIA:
The first dance, milady?

676
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:02,125
Prince Charming,
you're so naughty!

677
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,925
I want to try it.

678
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,925
No, I'm wearing it.

679
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:11,992
BOTH: No! No!

680
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:17,359
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Not for the first time,

681
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:21,093
Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,

682
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:25,127
who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.

683
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,993
DRISELLA: My prince!

684
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:28,193
ANASTASIA: He will love me!

685
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,227
DRISELLA:
But I will be his queen!

686
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  If her
stepmother would not have

687
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,494
a fourth dress made,

688
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:39,361
it seemed to Ella that
there was no reason why

689
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:41,562
she would not try
to run it up herself.

690
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,862
And besides,
she did have a little help.

691
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:08,696
My dear girls.

692
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:12,296
To see you like this...

693
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:16,463
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.

694
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:21,030
And to think I have
two horses in the race!

695
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:24,864
I daresay no one
in the kingdom will
outshine my daughters.

696
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:29,798
STEPMOTHER:
Cinderella?

697
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:32,164
It cost you nothing.

698
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,364
It was my mother's
old dress, you see.

699
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:35,798
And I took it up myself.

700
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:36,998
DRISELLA: Ooh-la.

701
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,531
Cinderella
at the ball!

702
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,698
No one wants
a servant for a bride.

703
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,265
STEPMOTHER:
After all I've done...

704
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:43,665
I don't want
to ruin anything.

705
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,432
I don't even want
to meet the prince.

706
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:48,432
Oh, and you won't, because there's no
question of your going.

707
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,699
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

708
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:53,199
by order of the king.

709
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:56,433
It is the king
I am thinking of.

710
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,832
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

711
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:01,633
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

712
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,733
Rags?

713
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:04,834
This was my mother's.

714
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:09,867
Oh, I'm...
sorry to have to tell you...

715
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,601
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

716
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:16,367
This thing is
so old-fashioned

717
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,701
it's practically
falling to pieces.

718
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,367
The shoulder's frayed.

719
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,168
It's falling to bits.

720
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,168
DRISELLA: And this!

721
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,968
It's a ridiculous,
old-fashioned joke!

722
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:30,768
How could you?

723
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,635
STEPMOTHER:
How could I otherwise?

724
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:36,502
I will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you.

725
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:37,802
It would ruin
their prospects

726
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,668
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.

727
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:43,669
Because that
is what you are.

728
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:45,870
And that is what
you will always be.

729
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:48,102
Now mark my words!

730
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:50,703
You shall not
go to the ball!

731
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,369
MAN: Go on, get going!

732
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:23,405
I'm sorry, Mother.

733
00:43:26,372 --> 00:43:27,573
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:31,706
I said I'd have courage,
but I don't.

735
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,139
Not anymore.

736
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:36,239
I don't believe anymore.

737
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,140
Excuse me.

738
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,840
Can you help me, miss?

739
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:03,408
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

740
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,174
Yes.

741
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,708
Yes, yes, yes.

742
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:09,309
I think I can find
something for you.

743
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:19,208
Why are you crying?

744
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:20,576
Oh, it's nothing.

745
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:26,309
Nothing?

746
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:27,542
Nothing.

747
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:29,742
What is a bowl of milk?
Nothing.

748
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:33,343
But kindness
makes it everything.

749
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,244
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
 but you really haven't got long, Ella.

750
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,411
How do you know me?

751
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:52,611
Who are you?

752
00:44:52,644 --> 00:44:54,344
Who am I?

753
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:55,811
I should think you'd
have worked that one out.

754
00:44:58,177 --> 00:44:59,978
I'm your hairy dogfather.

755
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:01,545
I mean, fairy godmother!

756
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:04,412
You can't be.

757
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:06,311
Why not?

758
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:09,045
They don't exist.

759
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:11,378
They're just made up
for children.

760
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:13,712
Didn't your own mother
believe in them?

761
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:14,579
Don't say no,
because I heard her.

762
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:17,112
You heard her?

763
00:45:17,145 --> 00:45:18,945
Oh, fiddle-faddle,
fiddle-faddle.

764
00:45:18,978 --> 00:45:20,813
Right!
First things first.

765
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:24,180
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.

766
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:40,680
Mmm.

767
00:45:41,747 --> 00:45:42,481
That's better.

768
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:46,448
Now, where was I?

769
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:47,715
CINDERELLA:
How did you...

770
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:49,981
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Oh, yes. Let's see.

771
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:53,415
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

772
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:55,348
Um...

773
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:57,149
CINDERELLA:
Oh, that trough?

774
00:45:57,915 --> 00:45:59,149
Doesn't really say "coach."

775
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:02,882
No, no, I'm liking
fruit and veg.

776
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:04,182
Do you grow watermelons?

777
00:46:04,215 --> 00:46:05,349
No.

778
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:06,549
Cantaloupe?

779
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:07,716
I don't even know
what that is.

780
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:08,883
Artichoke?

781
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,215
Kumquat?

782
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:11,250
Beef tomato?

783
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:14,116
We do have pumpkins.

784
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,150
Ah.

785
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,316
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Pumpkins?

786
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,817
This will be a first for me.

787
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:20,684
Always interesting.

788
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:23,617
I don't usually
work with squashes.

789
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,417
Too mushy.

790
00:46:27,816 --> 00:46:29,050
Let me see.
Oh, that'll do.

791
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,318
Yes.
Knife?

792
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,217
There you are.

793
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,217
Thank you, darling.

794
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,284
Hello, my strangely
orange vegetable friend.

795
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:38,251
A quick snip for you.

796
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,351
Ah, lovely!

797
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,885
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!

798
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:43,152
Look out, mices!

799
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:47,385
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Oh, well. Never mind.

800
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:48,652
Let's do it here.

801
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:50,051
Do what here?

802
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,385
Turn the pumpkin
into a carriage.

803
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,019
You're making me
nervous, actually.

804
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:56,419
Shall I shut my eyes?

805
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:56,419
It might be better.

806
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,353
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.

807
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,353
Ah.

808
00:47:05,386 --> 00:47:06,986
Well, something's
definitely happening.

809
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:09,152
You see, the trick is...

810
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:10,520
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.
Hmm.

811
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:15,320
CINDERELLA:
I just thought, if it...

812
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:16,887
If it does get much bigger...

813
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,820
Yes?

814
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:19,753
Hang on.

815
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,988
Is that what
you meant to do?

816
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:27,854
Do you think that's
what I meant to do?

817
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,255
Run! Run, darling!

818
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,155
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Take cover!

819
00:47:57,023 --> 00:47:59,556
There!
One carriage.

820
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,190
You really are
my fairy godmother.

821
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:05,023
Of course.

822
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:06,524
I don't go about transforming pumpkins
for just anybody.

823
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:09,824
Now, where are those mice?

824
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:11,657
Mice?

825
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:11,657
Yes.

826
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,057
Mice, mice, mice.

827
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,191
There they are.

828
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,891
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

829
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:29,291
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Four white chargers.

830
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,325
CINDERELLA: Gus-Gus,
how fine you look!

831
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:33,158
But how did you...

832
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:34,858
Now, where are we?

833
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:38,092
Got carriage, horses...
Uh, footmen!

834
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:39,759
Footmen?

835
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:42,893
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

836
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:44,259
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

837
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:49,659
Hello!

838
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,160
You called?

839
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,627
Now, I need that coachman.

840
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,060
Coachman?

841
00:49:02,093 --> 00:49:03,560
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."

842
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,595
I can't drive.
I'm a goose.

843
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,895
Now, shoo!

844
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:19,262
Everyone into place,
no time to be lost!

845
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:21,262
Come on!

846
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:24,562
Fairy Godmother!

847
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:26,562
Yes, what?

848
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:29,228
My dress.

849
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:31,162
I can't go
in this dress.

850
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:32,729
Can you mend it?

851
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:32,729
Mend it?

852
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,229
No, no. I'll turn it
into something new.

853
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,296
Oh, no, please don't.

854
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:38,096
This was my mother's.

855
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,563
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

856
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:46,230
It's almost like
taking her with me.

857
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,430
I understand.

858
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:52,897
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

859
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,531
Wouldn't mind
a nice blue?

860
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:55,598
No.

861
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,966
There.

862
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:41,066
It's beautiful.

863
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,400
She'd love it.

864
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:45,901
Now, come on.
Off you go. Quick!

865
00:50:45,934 --> 00:50:47,168
You'll be late!

866
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,700
MR. GOOSE:
I'm very new at this!

867
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:52,701
Oh, boy.

868
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,401
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Stop that blooming coach!

869
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,435
MR. GOOSE:
Whoa!

870
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,269
Thank you.

871
00:51:05,068 --> 00:51:05,835
Just a moment!

872
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,235
Are those the best you have?

873
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,968
It's all right.
No one will see them.

874
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:14,068
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

875
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:16,168
Take them off.
Really quite hideous.

876
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,236
Let's have something
new for a change.

877
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:19,237
I'm rather good at shoes.

878
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:30,704
But...

879
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:34,037
They're made of glass?

880
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,870
Yes.

881
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,237
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.

882
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,704
Ella, you really
must go now.

883
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:41,904
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

884
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:43,404
What is it?

885
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:44,738
My stepmother
and the girls?

886
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,237
Don't worry.

887
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,538
I'll make sure they
don't recognize you.

888
00:51:49,837 --> 00:51:51,372
Now, off you go.

889
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:53,339
For you shall
go to the ball.

890
00:51:56,605 --> 00:51:59,138
MR. LIZARD: Ah, in you get.
Oh, so lovely.

891
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:00,272
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Oh, do stop wittering on.

892
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:06,139
Ella!

893
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:07,572
I almost forgot.

894
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:10,906
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.

895
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:13,373
With the last echo
of the last bell,

896
00:52:13,406 --> 00:52:15,139
at the last stroke
of midnight,

897
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:17,406
the spell will be broken

898
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:19,440
and all will return
to what it was before.

899
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:21,240
Midnight?

900
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:22,840
Midnight.

901
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,441
That's more
than enough time.

902
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:27,073
Off you go then.

903
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:27,073
Thank you.

904
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:28,174
Thank you.

905
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:31,274
Goosey, go!

906
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,108
CINDERELLA: Goodbye!

907
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:32,178
MAN: Chandeliers, aloft!

908
00:53:45,712 --> 00:53:47,846
ROYAL CRIER:
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

909
00:53:50,946 --> 00:53:53,879
Princess Shahrzad
of the Seljuqs.

910
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:55,846
WOMAN:
Your Highness!

911
00:53:57,613 --> 00:54:00,280
ROYAL CRIER:
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

912
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:04,447
Princess Imani of Shona!

913
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,448
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

914
00:54:16,614 --> 00:54:18,448
Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.

915
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:25,215
The Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.

916
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:26,248
I'm Drisella.

917
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:27,681
And I'm Anastasia.

918
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:28,814
People will want to know.

919
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:28,814
I'm the clever one.

920
00:54:28,847 --> 00:54:30,649
I'm very beautiful.

921
00:54:30,682 --> 00:54:34,181
The very clever
Miss Drisella,

922
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:37,116
and the very
beautiful Anastasia.

923
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,416
Do come on!

924
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,450
ROYAL CRIER:
The Lord Veneering.

925
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,550
KING:
Who are you looking for?

926
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:52,251
No one.

927
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,317
It's that girl in
the forest, isn't it?

928
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,917
That's why you were
so generous with the invitations.

929
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,651
Father, it was
for the people.

930
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:02,751
I know you love
the people, Kit.

931
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:07,817
But I also know that
your head's been turned.

932
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,584
But you've only met
her once, in the forest.

933
00:55:11,617 --> 00:55:14,151
And you would have me marry
someone I met once, tonight.

934
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:15,918
A princess.

935
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:18,251
It's a princess or nothing.

936
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:25,386
DOORMAN: Hold the doors!
One more coming in.

937
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,920
May I present
Her Royal Highness,

938
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:42,620
the Princess Chelina
of Zaragosa.

939
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,520
You are as handsome
as your picture.

940
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:54,654
And your little kingdom
is enchanting.

941
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:58,188
I hope the princess will not
find our "little kingdom" too confining.

942
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:05,188
Miss Ella.

943
00:56:05,854 --> 00:56:07,221
Thank you.

944
00:56:20,288 --> 00:56:21,456
I'm frightened,
Mr. Lizard.

945
00:56:24,122 --> 00:56:27,589
I'm only a girl,
not a princess.

946
00:56:27,622 --> 00:56:30,290
And I'm only a lizard,
not a footman.

947
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,357
Enjoy it while it lasts.

948
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:01,392
ROYAL CRIER: Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,

949
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:04,225
My Lords, ladies
and gentlemen,

950
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:08,926
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

951
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:13,492
the prince shall now
choose his partner for the first dance.

952
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:17,026
Let our ball commence!

953
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:51,361
Excuse me.

954
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:53,495
GRAND DUKE: A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

955
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:54,762
I don't know
what happened.

956
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:01,267
Mr. Kit.

957
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:05,233
It's you,

958
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:07,467
isn't it?

959
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:09,867
Just so.

960
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:13,634
Your Highness...

961
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,334
If I may...

962
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:18,601
that is...

963
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,601
it would give me
the greatest pleasure,

964
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:27,768
if you would do me the honor of
 letting me lead you through this...

965
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:28,801
the first...

966
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:33,902
Dance?

967
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:35,935
Yes, dance.

968
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,736
That's it.

969
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,437
They're all looking at you.

970
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:06,371
Believe me,
they're all looking at you.

971
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:17,575
Who is she?

972
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:18,775
I have no idea.

973
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:23,745
ANASTASIA:
Who's that, Mama?

974
01:02:23,778 --> 01:02:26,212
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.

975
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:27,613
That's a lovely dress
she's got on.

976
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,613
And how pretty she is.

977
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,613
Concentrate!

978
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,113
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
 Now, get out there!

979
01:02:32,146 --> 01:02:33,780
But no one's
asked us to dance.

980
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:34,947
STEPMOTHER:
Gentlemen.

981
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:34,947
MAN: Oh!

982
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,247
May I present my daughters,

983
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,247
Anastasia, Drisella.

984
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,247
MAN:  Mademoiselle.

985
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,213
STEPMOTHER:
Off you go!

986
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:54,148
Smile.

987
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:03,215
Come with me.

988
01:03:03,248 --> 01:03:04,882
STEPMOTHER:
Over there. Smile.

989
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:11,650
So, you're the prince!

990
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:16,382
Not "the prince," exactly.

991
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:17,516
There are plenty of princes
in the world.

992
01:03:17,549 --> 01:03:18,483
I'm only a prince.

993
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:21,950
But your name's
not really Kit.

994
01:03:21,983 --> 01:03:24,116
Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,

995
01:03:24,149 --> 01:03:26,550
when he's especially
un-peeved at me.

996
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:29,183
But you're no apprentice.

997
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:30,617
I am.
An apprentice monarch.

998
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,817
Still learning my trade.

999
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:34,617
Oh, gosh!

1000
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,617
PRINCE:
Look, please forgive me.

1001
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,551
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.

1002
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:41,017
I mistook you for a good,
honest country girl,

1003
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,217
and now I see you didn't want to
overawe a plain soldier.

1004
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,885
Little chance of that.

1005
01:03:45,918 --> 01:03:47,318
No more surprises?

1006
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:50,885
No more surprises.

1007
01:03:53,118 --> 01:03:55,052
Is that you?

1008
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:56,619
I hate myself in paintings.
Don't you?

1009
01:03:57,884 --> 01:03:59,619
No one's ever painted
my portrait.

1010
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:01,920
No?
Well, they should.

1011
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:06,719
GRAND DUKE:
Who is she?

1012
01:04:06,752 --> 01:04:07,919
ROYAL CRIER:
She gave no name, Your Grace.

1013
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:09,219
You didn't ask?

1014
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:10,619
I was out of breath,
Your Grace,

1015
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:13,453
on account of introducing
Princess Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

1016
01:04:13,486 --> 01:04:15,253
Shut up, will you?

1017
01:04:13,486 --> 01:04:15,253
"Shut up." Absolutely.

1018
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,453
MAN:
I don't believe this!

1019
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:24,921
No! Not her!

1020
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,721
CINDERELLA: Won't they
miss you at the ball?

1021
01:04:33,054 --> 01:04:34,955
Maybe.

1022
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:36,555
But let's not
go back just yet.

1023
01:04:40,388 --> 01:04:41,656
What's wrong?

1024
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:48,122
When I go back, they will try to 
pair me off with a lady of their choosing.

1025
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:50,455
I'm expected to marry
for advantage.

1026
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,422
Oh.
Well, whose advantage?

1027
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,189
That is a good question.

1028
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:59,456
Well, surely you have
a right to your own heart.

1029
01:04:59,489 --> 01:05:01,890
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

1030
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:05,490
He's a wise ruler
and a loving father.

1031
01:05:06,422 --> 01:05:09,223
Well, perhaps he'll
change his mind.

1032
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:16,424
I fear he hasn't
much time to do so.

1033
01:05:18,156 --> 01:05:19,658
Poor Kit.

1034
01:05:22,157 --> 01:05:24,724
CAPTAIN: People are saying
she's a princess.

1035
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:27,124
Our prince seems
quite taken with her.

1036
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:29,391
She went
straight for him.

1037
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:31,625
You have to appreciate
her efficiency.

1038
01:05:31,658 --> 01:05:35,159
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.

1039
01:05:37,158 --> 01:05:40,725
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.

1040
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:42,660
But...

1041
01:05:44,225 --> 01:05:45,426
Oh.

1042
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:47,292
Forgive me, Your Grace.

1043
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:50,459
I did not mean to intrude.

1044
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:53,459
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

1045
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,294
Your secret
is safe with me.

1046
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,328
I've never shown
this place to anyone.

1047
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:19,395
A secret garden.

1048
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,329
I love it!

1049
01:06:31,995 --> 01:06:32,763
Please.

1050
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:35,262
No, I shouldn't.

1051
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,596
You should.

1052
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:37,862
I shouldn't.

1053
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:37,862
You should.

1054
01:06:37,895 --> 01:06:38,963
I shouldn't.

1055
01:06:37,895 --> 01:06:38,963
You should.

1056
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,163
I will.

1057
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,097
May I?

1058
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,297
Please.

1059
01:07:07,664 --> 01:07:08,831
Oh!

1060
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:21,165
It's made of glass.

1061
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:23,332
And why not?

1062
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:25,132
Allow me.

1063
01:07:25,165 --> 01:07:26,799
Thank you.

1064
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:39,333
There.

1065
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,167
There.

1066
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:49,267
Won't you tell me
who you really are?

1067
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,601
If I do, I think everything
might be different.

1068
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:55,235
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

1069
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,767
My name is...

1070
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:05,034
I have to leave.

1071
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:07,268
It's hard to explain.

1072
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:10,236
Lizards and pumpkins,
and things.

1073
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:14,336
Wait!

1074
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:18,069
Where are you going?

1075
01:08:18,102 --> 01:08:20,402
You've been awfully nice.

1076
01:08:20,435 --> 01:08:22,202
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1077
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:23,269
Every second!

1078
01:08:32,503 --> 01:08:34,904
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1079
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,105
Excuse me.

1080
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:57,838
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1081
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,472
MAN: My goodness!

1082
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,573
My prince!

1083
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:06,439
DRISELLA:
You've got the wrong one!

1084
01:09:06,472 --> 01:09:07,773
You've got the wrong one!

1085
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:10,073
MAN 1:
He needs her name!

1086
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:11,305
MAN 2:
I know he needs her name.

1087
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:13,039
Her name, you ninny.
Get her name!

1088
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:14,606
Ooh, that really hurt!

1089
01:09:15,506 --> 01:09:16,872
Oh, Your Majesty.

1090
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:18,073
Young lady.

1091
01:09:18,106 --> 01:09:19,306
I am so sorry.

1092
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,873
Oh, think nothing
of it, my dear.

1093
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:25,473
I wanted to say,
Your Majesty,

1094
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,907
your son Kit is the most lovely
person I ever met.

1095
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,307
So good and brave.

1096
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,341
I hope you know
how much he loves you.

1097
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:34,775
Excuse me!

1098
01:09:47,608 --> 01:09:48,642
Mmm.

1099
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:55,509
PRINCE:
Wait!

1100
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:02,409
Wait!

1101
01:10:02,442 --> 01:10:03,976
Where are you going?

1102
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:04,643
CINDERELLA:
Hurry, hurry!

1103
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,176
Eh? Ah!

1104
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:08,944
PRINCE:
Come back!

1105
01:10:11,309 --> 01:10:12,244
CINDERELLA:
Hurry!

1106
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:16,577
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

1107
01:10:18,843 --> 01:10:19,910
Wait!

1108
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,678
MR. GOOSE:
Watch out!

1109
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,911
Captain, my horse.

1110
01:10:32,944 --> 01:10:34,411
GRAND DUKE: No!

1111
01:10:34,444 --> 01:10:37,111
This may be some intrigue to lure you
from the palace.

1112
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:38,745
Your father
needs you here.

1113
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:41,478
Captain!

1114
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:43,079
I was having
a fine old time.

1115
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:45,179
You had to go and
choose that one, didn't you?

1116
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:48,580
Yes, I did.

1117
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:16,147
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1118
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,348
Come on!

1119
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:21,381
MR. GOOSE: Hee-ya!

1120
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:22,815
CINDERELLA:
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1121
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:23,981
MR. GOOSE: Oh!

1122
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:28,348
Oh, my goodness!

1123
01:11:38,015 --> 01:11:39,983
GRAND DUKE: You there!
Stop in the name of the king!

1124
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:43,183
Such bad timing.

1125
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:48,550
GRAND DUKE: Halt there!

1126
01:11:48,582 --> 01:11:49,517
MR. LIZARD: I know what to do!

1127
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:51,049
Yes!

1128
01:11:51,082 --> 01:11:52,250
Oh, yes!

1129
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:54,517
GRAND DUKE:
Get this thing open!

1130
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,050
Oh, dear!

1131
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:01,917
Ah!

1132
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:12,785
No, no, no.

1133
01:13:26,822 --> 01:13:27,923
Oh, I'm sorry.

1134
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:31,690
You'll find it's
very comfortable.

1135
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,290
Oh...

1136
01:13:57,357 --> 01:13:58,858
STEPMOTHER:
Do shut up!

1137
01:14:01,357 --> 01:14:02,891
ANASTASIA:
Cinderella!

1138
01:14:02,924 --> 01:14:05,426
DRISELLA: Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.

1139
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:08,125
Cinderella!

1140
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:10,158
Wake up, lazy bones!

1141
01:14:10,191 --> 01:14:12,158
Tea and a plate
of biscuits.

1142
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:13,659
CINDERELLA:
Welcome back!

1143
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:15,959
ANASTASIA:
You look cheerful!

1144
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:15,959
DRISELLA: And wet!

1145
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:18,093
Oh, uh, I took a walk
in the rain to cheer myself up.

1146
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:19,159
Typical.

1147
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:20,926
Tea.

1148
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:22,993
DRISELLA: We did not communicate
through mere words.

1149
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,493
Our souls met.

1150
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:27,259
ANASTASIA: Precisely.
My soul and the prince's soul.

1151
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:28,627
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.

1152
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,293
You didn't see
him dance with me.

1153
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:31,493
Dance with you?

1154
01:14:31,526 --> 01:14:33,994
He didn't even speak to you.

1155
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:36,327
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1156
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,994
The mystery princess.

1157
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:39,428
Mystery princess?

1158
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:42,094
My, what a charming notion.

1159
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:43,828
STEPMOTHER:
Oh, she was no princess.

1160
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:46,061
She was a preening interloper who made
a spectacle of herself.

1161
01:14:46,094 --> 01:14:47,195
Oh?

1162
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:50,494
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

1163
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,061
unaccompanied, if you will,

1164
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:55,595
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1165
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,562
ANASTASIA: And he actually
danced with the ugly thing.

1166
01:14:57,595 --> 01:14:58,829
Yes?

1167
01:14:57,595 --> 01:14:58,829
DRISELLA: Yes.

1168
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:00,195
It was pity.

1169
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:03,328
He was too polite to send her packing in
front of everyone, you see.

1170
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:07,062
But not wanting to expose us 
to the presumptuous wench any further,

1171
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:08,596
he took her apart.

1172
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:08,596
ANASTASIA:
And told her off.

1173
01:15:08,628 --> 01:15:10,329
But she refused to leave

1174
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:13,796
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

1175
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:15,997
I pity the prince.
Such bad taste.

1176
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,563
They belong
with each other.

1177
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,163
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1178
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:21,796
The ball was a mere diversion.

1179
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:23,197
The prince is not free
to marry for love.

1180
01:15:24,497 --> 01:15:27,364
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

1181
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:30,397
The Grand Duke
told me himself.

1182
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:32,197
DRISELLA: It's so very unfair.

1183
01:15:32,697 --> 01:15:34,764
Yes.

1184
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:36,831
The way of the world.

1185
01:15:40,964 --> 01:15:42,765
Oh, hello again.

1186
01:15:55,032 --> 01:15:56,499
Thank you for your help.

1187
01:15:57,365 --> 01:15:58,966
It really was like a dream.

1188
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,533
Better than a dream.

1189
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:19,934
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella couldn't wait to write down

1190
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:22,167
all that had happened,

1191
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,900
so that she might remember
every single bit of it

1192
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:28,501
just as if she were telling
her mother and father

1193
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:32,335
about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.

1194
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:39,502
Above all, the prince.

1195
01:17:03,169 --> 01:17:04,537
Oh, you've come.

1196
01:17:05,369 --> 01:17:06,370
Good.

1197
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,670
Oh, Father.

1198
01:17:10,803 --> 01:17:11,937
Don't go.

1199
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,538
I must.

1200
01:17:15,837 --> 01:17:17,638
You needn't be alone.

1201
01:17:18,504 --> 01:17:20,804
Take a bride.

1202
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,705
The Princess Chelina.

1203
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:26,505
What if I commanded
you to do so?

1204
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:31,505
I love and respect you,
but I will not.

1205
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:38,272
I believe that we
need not look outside of our borders

1206
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:40,273
for strength or guidance.

1207
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:44,272
What we need
is right before us.

1208
01:17:44,305 --> 01:17:49,273
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.

1209
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:53,840
Just so.

1210
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:58,840
You've become your own man.

1211
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:00,541
Good.

1212
01:18:03,306 --> 01:18:06,407
And perhaps,
in the little time left to me,

1213
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,808
I can become
the father you deserve.

1214
01:18:12,874 --> 01:18:15,508
You must not
marry for advantage.

1215
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:20,375
You must marry for love.

1216
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,443
Find that girl.

1217
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:29,009
Find her.

1218
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:31,476
The one they're
all talking about.

1219
01:18:31,509 --> 01:18:32,909
The forgetful one

1220
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,242
who loses her shoes.

1221
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,242
...loses her shoes.

1222
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:43,377
Oh, be cheerful, boy.

1223
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:47,977
Thank you, Father.

1224
01:18:48,777 --> 01:18:50,544
Thank you, Kit.

1225
01:18:55,543 --> 01:18:57,378
I love you, son.

1226
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,811
I love you, Father.

1227
01:19:34,713 --> 01:19:37,313
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Once the time
for mourning had passed,

1228
01:19:37,346 --> 01:19:39,847
a proclamation was sent out.

1229
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,514
ROYAL CRIER:
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1230
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:46,347
Hear ye!

1231
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,848
Know that our new king

1232
01:19:53,881 --> 01:19:57,215
hereby declares
his love for...

1233
01:19:59,614 --> 01:20:02,215
the mysterious princess...

1234
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,348
as wore...

1235
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:08,016
glass slippers to the ball.

1236
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:13,182
And requests that
she present herself at the palace,

1237
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:16,949
whereupon,
if she be willing,

1238
01:20:18,015 --> 01:20:22,983
he will forthwith marry her...

1239
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:27,483
...with all due ceremony.

1240
01:21:04,185 --> 01:21:05,553
Are you looking for this?

1241
01:21:07,052 --> 01:21:09,786
There must be quite
a story to go with it.

1242
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:10,953
Won't you tell me?

1243
01:21:11,552 --> 01:21:12,553
No?

1244
01:21:13,386 --> 01:21:15,086
All right then.

1245
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:17,287
I shall tell you a story.

1246
01:21:18,453 --> 01:21:20,453
Once upon a time,

1247
01:21:20,486 --> 01:21:23,353
there was a beautiful
young girl

1248
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,854
who married for love.

1249
01:21:25,887 --> 01:21:28,920
And she had
two loving daughters.

1250
01:21:28,953 --> 01:21:30,987
All was well...

1251
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,755
but, one day, her husband,

1252
01:21:34,788 --> 01:21:37,288
the light of her life, died.

1253
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,921
The next time,

1254
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:43,088
she married for the sake
of her daughters.

1255
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:47,255
But that man, too,
was taken from her.

1256
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:51,989
And she was doomed to look every day
upon his beloved child.

1257
01:21:54,555 --> 01:21:56,023
She had hoped to marry off

1258
01:21:56,056 --> 01:22:00,822
one of her beautiful,
stupid daughters to
the prince.

1259
01:22:00,855 --> 01:22:04,290
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.

1260
01:22:05,022 --> 01:22:06,690
And so...

1261
01:22:06,723 --> 01:22:10,390
I lived unhappily ever after.

1262
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:15,358
My story would appear
to be ended.

1263
01:22:16,157 --> 01:22:18,724
Now, tell me yours.

1264
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:20,824
Did you steal it?

1265
01:22:22,023 --> 01:22:22,825
No.

1266
01:22:23,724 --> 01:22:24,991
It was given to me.

1267
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,190
Given to you?

1268
01:22:26,223 --> 01:22:28,357
Given to you.
Nothing is ever given.

1269
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,191
For everything,
we must pay and pay.

1270
01:22:30,224 --> 01:22:31,492
That's not true.

1271
01:22:32,724 --> 01:22:35,924
Kindness is free.
Love is free.

1272
01:22:35,957 --> 01:22:38,659
Love is not free.

1273
01:22:38,692 --> 01:22:42,458
Now, here is
how you will pay me,

1274
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:46,259
if you are to have
what you desire.

1275
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:50,626
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,

1276
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:53,192
if you lay claim
to the prince's heart.

1277
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:55,660
But with a respectable
gentlewoman to put you forward,

1278
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:56,960
you will not be ignored.

1279
01:22:57,993 --> 01:22:59,260
When you are married,

1280
01:22:59,293 --> 01:23:03,127
you will make me the head
of the royal household.

1281
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,193
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.

1282
01:23:06,226 --> 01:23:08,960
And I shall manage that boy.

1283
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,394
But he's not a boy.

1284
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,293
And who are you?

1285
01:23:14,326 --> 01:23:16,494
How would you
rule a kingdom?

1286
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:18,694
Best to leave it to me.

1287
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,828
That way we all get
what we want.

1288
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:23,295
No.

1289
01:23:27,361 --> 01:23:28,629
No?

1290
01:23:29,895 --> 01:23:31,928
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

1291
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:33,962
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom...

1292
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:37,129
no matter what becomes of me.

1293
01:23:37,162 --> 01:23:40,296
Well, that is a mistake.

1294
01:23:41,629 --> 01:23:42,929
No!

1295
01:23:42,962 --> 01:23:43,963
Why?

1296
01:23:45,696 --> 01:23:47,830
Why are you so cruel?

1297
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,696
I don't understand it.

1298
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:52,996
I've tried to be kind to you.

1299
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:54,330
You? Kind to me?

1300
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:55,930
Yes.

1301
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:58,196
And though no one
deserves to be treated

1302
01:23:58,229 --> 01:23:59,697
as you have treated me.

1303
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:01,897
Why do you do it?

1304
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,864
Why?

1305
01:24:04,897 --> 01:24:06,930
Why?

1306
01:24:06,963 --> 01:24:11,831
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

1307
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:13,298
And I...

1308
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:19,298
CINDERELLA: No!

1309
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:20,399
No!

1310
01:24:25,998 --> 01:24:27,966
GRAND DUKE:
May I ask where you got this?

1311
01:24:27,999 --> 01:24:30,233
From a ragged
servant girl in my household.

1312
01:24:31,732 --> 01:24:34,400
The mystery princess
is a commoner.

1313
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:39,567
You could imagine when I discovered
 her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1314
01:24:40,733 --> 01:24:42,366
You told no one else?

1315
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,700
Not even my own daughters.

1316
01:24:45,733 --> 01:24:48,833
No one need ever
know the truth.

1317
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:53,100
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

1318
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:56,200
And I should like
to keep it that way.

1319
01:24:56,233 --> 01:24:57,635
Are you threatening me?

1320
01:24:58,233 --> 01:24:59,401
Yes.

1321
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:07,801
So what do you want?

1322
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:12,001
I should like
to be a countess.

1323
01:25:12,034 --> 01:25:15,502
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.

1324
01:25:16,968 --> 01:25:17,802
Done.

1325
01:25:20,902 --> 01:25:22,036
And the girl?

1326
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:23,336
Oh.

1327
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,403
Do with her
what you will.

1328
01:25:26,536 --> 01:25:27,737
She's nothing to me.

1329
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:32,203
Where?

1330
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:32,203
Abandoned on the
side of the road.

1331
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:33,436
And have you
found her?

1332
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:33,436
The girl?

1333
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:35,437
No, she's disappeared.

1334
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,703
There must be some
reason she vanished.

1335
01:25:37,736 --> 01:25:39,370
Perhaps she has been
prevented from speaking.

1336
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:40,537
CAPTAIN:
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1337
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,837
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.

1338
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,971
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

1339
01:25:47,004 --> 01:25:50,637
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

1340
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,371
They want to face the
future with certainty!

1341
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:54,338
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.

1342
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:56,204
I am king.

1343
01:25:56,237 --> 01:25:58,872
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

1344
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:00,605
even if she does
not want to be found.

1345
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:02,438
I have to see her again.

1346
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:04,872
But if she's not found...

1347
01:26:04,905 --> 01:26:08,406
then for the good of the kingdom, 
you must marry the Princess Chelina.

1348
01:26:09,572 --> 01:26:10,573
For the good of the kingdom.

1349
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:24,839
Very well, agreed.

1350
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:25,973
CAPTAIN:
But Your Highness...

1351
01:26:31,807 --> 01:26:33,674
But you will
spare no effort.

1352
01:26:33,707 --> 01:26:35,374
Your Majesty, of course.

1353
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:36,408
You have my word.

1354
01:26:57,008 --> 01:26:57,743
MAN: Next.

1355
01:27:03,675 --> 01:27:06,010
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  The slipper traveled 
the length and breadth of the kingdom,

1356
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,776
visiting every maiden
both high and low,

1357
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:11,809
and every sort in between.

1358
01:27:12,342 --> 01:27:13,777
Oh, Lord!

1359
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:14,943
GRAND DUKE:
You first, madam.

1360
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:17,643
Well, I'll give it a go.

1361
01:27:17,676 --> 01:27:19,677
Right. I say.
Where do you want me?

1362
01:27:20,243 --> 01:27:21,476
Oh!

1363
01:27:21,509 --> 01:27:23,810
Up! Up I go.

1364
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:25,611
Oh, careful,
my foot's a bit swollen.

1365
01:27:25,644 --> 01:27:26,477
I've been...

1366
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,011
It's the yeast.

1367
01:27:32,044 --> 01:27:34,511
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  The Grand
Duke was true to his word.

1368
01:27:34,544 --> 01:27:38,011
He spared no effort to
demonstrate to the prince

1369
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:41,045
that the mystery princess
was not to be found.

1370
01:27:41,078 --> 01:27:42,345
WOMAN: It fits!

1371
01:27:42,378 --> 01:27:44,378
It doesn't fit you.

1372
01:27:42,378 --> 01:27:44,378
It does fit!

1373
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:45,612
It doesn't fit.

1374
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:45,612
WOMAN: It's mine!

1375
01:27:45,645 --> 01:27:47,845
I am the mystery princess!

1376
01:27:45,645 --> 01:27:47,845
Give back the shoe.

1377
01:27:47,878 --> 01:27:49,046
Take the shoe
away from her!

1378
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:50,212
Don't take the shoe
away from me, please, please!

1379
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:51,313
Please, it's my shoe!

1380
01:27:52,545 --> 01:27:53,712
MAN:
Make way for the slipper!

1381
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:04,446
Can I try the other foot?

1382
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:05,580
I don't think so.

1383
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:09,514
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
But whatever they tried,

1384
01:28:09,547 --> 01:28:12,946
the magical slipper refused to fit 
even the most eligible of maidens.

1385
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:15,414
MAN: We found the mystery
princess for ya!

1386
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,382
What's wrong, Captain?

1387
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,715
We haven't found the girl.

1388
01:28:30,748 --> 01:28:32,548
I'm disappointed
for our king.

1389
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:34,815
Oh, come on, now!
Don't lose heart.

1390
01:28:34,848 --> 01:28:37,149
There's one more house.

1391
01:28:37,182 --> 01:28:39,449
We must leave
no stone unturned.

1392
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:42,482

1395
01:28:48,816 --> 01:28:50,549
Let them in!

01:31:10,092 --> 01:31:11,192
Let's be off, Captain.

1437
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:12,259
CAPTAIN: Just a moment.

1438
01:31:15,925 --> 01:31:17,325
CAPTAIN: Madam,

1439
01:31:17,358 --> 01:31:19,926
there is no other maiden
in your house?

1440
01:31:22,325 --> 01:31:23,593
None.

1441
01:31:25,093 --> 01:31:26,760
Then has your cat
learned to sing?

1442
01:31:34,426 --> 01:31:37,393
There's been enough play-acting today,
Captain. Let's be off.

1443
01:31:37,426 --> 01:31:39,694
But she's lying, Your Grace.

1444
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,027
GRAND DUKE: Nonsense!
I trust the lady. We're leaving.

1445
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:42,927
Grand Duke!

1446
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,161
Your Majesty.

1447
01:31:51,194 --> 01:31:53,862
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

1448
01:31:54,928 --> 01:31:56,828
Your Majesty,
I did not know...

1449
01:31:56,861 --> 01:31:58,895
Captain, would you be
so kind as to investigate?

1450
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:02,029
It would be my pleasure,
Your Majesty.

There! You see?

01:32:12,895 --> 01:32:15,029
I told you it was
no one of any importance.

1455
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:16,497
We'll see about that.

1456
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:19,530
Miss.

1457
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:26,363
You are requested and required 
to present yourself to your king.

1458
01:32:26,396 --> 01:32:28,563
I forbid you to do this!

1459
01:32:28,596 --> 01:32:30,498
CAPTAIN: And I forbid you
to forbid her!

1460
01:32:31,696 --> 01:32:32,997
Who are you to stop
an officer of the king?

1461
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,264
Are you an empress?

1462
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:36,765
A saint?

1463
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,731
A deity?

1464
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,765
I am her mother.

1465
01:32:46,565 --> 01:32:48,332
You have never been...

1466
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:52,499
and you never
will be my mother.

1467
01:32:56,932 --> 01:32:58,366
Come now, miss.

1468
01:33:03,532 --> 01:33:06,266
Just remember who
you are, you wretch!

1469
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:22,634
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Would who she was,

1470
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:25,567
who she really was, be enough?

1471
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,634
There was no magic
to help her this time.

1472
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:32,134
This is perhaps the greatest
risk that any of us will take.

1473
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:35,402
To be seen as we truly are.

1474
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:40,435
ELLA'S MOTHER:
Have courage, and be kind.

1475
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:22,038
Who are you?

1476
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,772
I am Cinderella.

1477
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:30,405
Your Majesty...

1478
01:34:32,904 --> 01:34:34,439
I'm no princess.

1479
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:37,739
I have no carriage,

1480
01:34:39,038 --> 01:34:40,439
no parents,

1481
01:34:41,438 --> 01:34:43,006
and no dowry.

1482
01:34:44,839 --> 01:34:47,406
I do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit.

1483
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:48,773
But...

1484
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:52,373
if it does...

1485
01:34:54,339 --> 01:34:56,540
will you take me as I am?

1486
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:00,907
An honest country girl
who loves you.

1487
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,674
Of course I will.

1488
01:35:04,273 --> 01:35:07,507
But only if you will
take me as I am.

1489
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,274
An apprentice still
learning his trade.

1490
01:35:11,607 --> 01:35:12,441
Please.

1491
01:35:58,343 --> 01:35:59,577
DRISELLA: Cinderella!

1492
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:00,611
ANASTASIA: Ella!

1493
01:36:01,844 --> 01:36:05,244
My dear sister!
I'm sorry.

1494
01:36:05,277 --> 01:36:06,844
So very sorry.

1495
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:24,613
Shall we?

1496
01:37:05,547 --> 01:37:06,782
I forgive you.

1497
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:17,882
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Forgiven or not,

1498
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:20,916
Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters

1499
01:37:20,949 --> 01:37:23,049
would soon leave
with the Grand Duke,

1500
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:25,717
and never set foot
in the kingdom again.

1501
01:37:34,716 --> 01:37:36,583
CINDERELLA: They would
have loved each other.

1502
01:37:36,616 --> 01:37:39,050
PRINCE: We must have
a portrait of you painted.

1503
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:41,684
Oh, no. I do hate
myself in paintings.

1504
01:37:41,717 --> 01:37:44,084
Be kind.

1505
01:37:44,117 --> 01:37:45,884
And have courage.

1506
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:47,418
And all will be well.

1507
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:56,585
Are you ready?

1508
01:37:56,618 --> 01:37:58,886
For anything,
so long as it's with you.

1509
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:11,553
My queen.

1510
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,353
My King.

1511
01:38:25,886 --> 01:38:29,587
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  And so Kit
and Ella were married,

1512
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,420
and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,

1513
01:38:32,453 --> 01:38:34,054
that they were counted to be

1514
01:38:34,087 --> 01:38:39,254
the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.

1515
01:38:39,287 --> 01:38:43,388
And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,

1516
01:38:43,421 --> 01:38:45,755
but as it could be,

1517
01:38:45,788 --> 01:38:48,755
if only you believe
in courage...

1518
01:38:48,788 --> 01:38:51,922
and kindness
and occasionally...

1519
01:38:51,955 --> 01:38:55,722
just a little bit of magic.
