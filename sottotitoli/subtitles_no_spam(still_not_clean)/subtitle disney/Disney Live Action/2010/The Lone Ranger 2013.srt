1
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,452
Step right up.

2
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,454
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:19,539
and come with us to yesteryear.

4
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,417
Witness the Wild West as it really was.

5
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,836
The greatest show on Earth.

6
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,382
Fun and educational for you, young sir.

7
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,178
Step right up to another time

8
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,681
of mighty beasts
and hard-hearted outlaws.

9
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:58,096
Kemosabe?

10
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,601
Who? Me?

11
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:10,108
You bring horses?

12
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:13,236
I think you made a mistake, mister.

13
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,743
Mistake?

14
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,423
Make trade.

15
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,320
Trade.

16
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,763
Who did you think I was, anyway?

17
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,062
Never take off mask.

18
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,359
Why not?

19
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,625
You sure about this?

20
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,043
Mmm.

21
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,630
Dead man strike fear
into heart of his enemy.

22
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:01,553
All right.

23
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's do this.

24
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,816
Easy!

25
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:22,491
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,076
my colleague and I
will be making a withdrawal.

27
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,037
I understand this bank is insured, so...

28
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,249
...nobody move.

29
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,378
What's with the mask?

30
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,798
See? I told you. I feel ridiculous.

31
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,934
I guess I didn't make myself clear!

32
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,435
This is a damn bank robbery!

33
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,231
Wait a minute.

34
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,358
You're saying you're Tonto?

35
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,442
The Tonto?

36
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,779
There is another?

37
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,949
But the Lone Ranger
and Tonto were good guys.

38
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,076
I mean, they didn't rob banks.

39
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,956
Did they?

40
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,126
Come a time, kemosabe...

41
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,927
...when good man must wear mask.

42
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Run that next rail!

43
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,153
More rocks! They need
more rocks right there!

44
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,826
Rail down!

45
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,666
Shake a leg, chums!

46
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,312
My friends and citizens of Colby,

47
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,440
I've asked you here today
so you can see at firsthand

48
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,317
what I believe to be the single most

49
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,028
important enterprise under God.

50
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:26,823
The unification of
this great country of ours

51
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,908
by iron rail.

52
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,702
Hear, hear!

53
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,626
To the Comanche,

54
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,086
I say you have nothing to fear.

55
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,380
As long as there is peace between us

56
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,758
all land treaties shall be honoured.

57
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,346
But to the outlaw,
those who prey upon the weak,

58
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,599
make no mistake, law and order

59
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:54,976
has come to the Wild West.

60
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,312
Which is why I am bringing

61
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,565
notorious outlaw and Indian-killer,

62
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,861
Butch Cavendish here
to Colby to hang for his crimes.

63
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:10,033
The future is bright,
ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,661
and it's just around the bend.

65
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,138
Ride 'em out! Come on!

66
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:36,810
Whoa, girl!

67
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,079
Run a man all the way to state line,

68
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,039
put him on a train
and ship him right back.

69
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:59,999
Don't make no sense.

70
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,836
Guess they run out of
hanging rope in Oklahoma.

71
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:05,505
Mr Cole wants to make an example.

72
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,842
Word is, Cavendish is
looking for payback with you, Dan.

73
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,260
Reckon so.

74
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,929
They say Butch Cavendish
ate a Red-Legger's heart

75
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,639
in the Missouri wars.

76
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,307
Swallowed it whole.

77
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:18,309
I heard it was the eyes.

78
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,187
Man told me he ate part of his own foot

79
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,189
just to win a bet.

80
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,775
Hell, he did.

81
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,277
MARTINI Which is it, Dan?

82
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't see how it makes a difference.

83
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,030
What's the matter with him?

84
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,952
It's not Cavendish he's worried about.

85
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,481
Like Daniel
entering the lion's den,

86
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,149
we shall stare down the beast.

87
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,275
Amen!

88
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,527
And purge
this Godless land

89
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,280
of the poisons of sin and licentiousness.

90
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,782
Hallelujah!

91
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:17,118
Dear God, grant us
thy mercy and wise judgment.

92
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:18,620
- Amen!
- Amen.

93
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,247
Thy equanimity
and singleness of purpose,

94
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,417
so we might prove
thy stalwart and worthy servants

95
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,003
in our war against sin. Amen!

96
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,505
Amen.

97
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:29,839
Catch.

98
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,060
Baby, baby, baby.

99
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,021
Care to pray with us?

100
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,981
We're Presbyterian.

101
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:51,528
I'm much obliged, ma'am,
but this, here, is my bible.

102
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:58,284
Shall we gather at the river

103
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:03,081
Where bright angel feet have trod

104
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:07,293
With its crystal tide forever...

105
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,145
It's almost hanging time, Butch.

106
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,774
Do you hear what I said, boy?

107
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,619
I'm gonna enjoy watching them
wipe that look off your face.

108
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,127
It's broke, lnjun. Can't you see that?

109
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,023
Very pretty.

110
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,821
For you.

111
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,198
Oh. No, I couldn't.

112
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,992
For you!

113
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,123
She's right.

114
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,167
It matches your eyes.

115
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:35,381
I didn't think
you'd make it out, Mrs Reid.

116
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,925
Well, I just wanted
to see what all the fuss was about.

117
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,887
And, um,
what do you think of our endeavour?

118
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,349
Looks to me like
just a lot of men digging in the desert.

119
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,977
Danny, one day soon,

120
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,188
you'll be able
to get on a train right here in Colby,

121
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,023
travel all the way to San Francisco

122
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,942
eating New York oysters packed in ice.

123
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,110
Then you can sail to China.

124
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,613
Come back around
the other way if you want.

125
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,365
That true, Mama?

126
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,408
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

127
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,327
Here, let me show you.

128
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,871
You see that?

129
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,873
Now you try.

130
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,878
Oh, I expect on a lawman's salary,
quite a lot falls on you.

131
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,591
We do just fine.

132
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:19,759
Thank you.

133
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,637
Oh, I mean no disrespect.

134
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:25,223
They don't make men
like your husband any more.

135
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,475
In fact, I envy him.

136
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,935
A fine family.

137
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,813
A son to carry on his name.

138
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,734
I just hate to see a bird in a cage.

139
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,122
Well...

140
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,999
That is right about on time.

141
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,457
Shh!

142
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,506
Piss break, boss.

143
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,990
Grace our spirits will deliver

144
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,119
And provide a robe and crown...

145
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,443
Afternoon, ladies.

146
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,821
There's no need for violence, my son.

147
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,551
Fifteen hours,
I watched you feed that bird.

148
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,471
Gets on a man's nerves.

149
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,728
I do not fear what comes next.

150
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,814
Nothing comes next.

151
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,321
Nice suit.

152
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,787
Time has finally come, Windigo.

153
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,003
Do I know you, lnjun?

154
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:25,755
You know me.

155
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,342
You know me by the screams

156
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,427
of my ancestors in the desert wind.

157
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,847
As you will know their cries of joy

158
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:38,809
when I remove your evil seed
from the face of Earth.

159
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,481
That won't be necessary.

160
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,565
As District Attorney,

161
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,150
I'll see to it that this man is prosecuted

162
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,902
to the full extent of the law.

163
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,912
What kind of a lawman
don't carry his own gun?

164
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,747
Believe me, where this train's headed,

165
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,249
there's no place for men who do.

166
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,292
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

167
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:06,837
The future.

168
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,050
Know something,
Counsellor?

169
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,219
Maybe you're right.

170
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,430
A lawyer and a crazy lnjun.

171
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,016
Bet you two got a lot to talk about.

172
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,270
Best make it quick.

173
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:40,121
Shall we gather at the river

174
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,455
...the river

175
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,916
I can't get it off.

176
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,710
No...

177
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:47,503
Play on, boys.

178
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,008
Sing it to me!

179
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,722
Should be slowing down by now.

180
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:08,566
Anyway, I'm sure we'll be
at the station any minute.

181
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,532
Get the horses! Come on!

182
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:21,871
Jesus, we ought to go.

183
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,678
That's reinforced Bethlehem steel.

184
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,097
Any attempts at escape is futile.

185
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:51,984
That's great!

186
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,819
Good job.

187
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,864
And for coming to the aid
of a federal prosecutor,

188
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,283
I can be sure to put in
a good word with the judge.

189
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,765
Come on, boys!
Put your backs into it.

190
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,309
The rail road waits for no man!

191
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,647
That's the end of the line.

192
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,107
We jump.

193
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,067
What about the passengers?

194
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,193
They jump.

195
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,571
There are children on board.

196
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,864
All jump.

197
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,951
Have you no decency?

198
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,244
Windigo getting away!

199
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,287
No, you're not going anywhere.

200
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,057
Going somewhere?

201
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,017
- Yes.
- No.

202
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,936
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

203
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,604
- No, we are not. No.
- Yes. Yes.

204
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,356
Shut up!

205
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,151
Yes.

206
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,247
Ugh.

207
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:51,854
Thank you.

208
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,983
Do-si-doe.

209
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:58,986
Why don't you put that thing down,

210
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,863
and we'll settle this like men?

211
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,698
Although, I warn you.

212
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,034
I boxed in law school.

213
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,334
Huh?

214
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,765
Great warrior.

215
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,850
Yeah, that's my brother.

216
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,195
Nice suit.

217
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,197
We have to stop the train.

218
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,281
No time!

219
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,449
Must to jump!

220
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,244
I'm not leaving
these passengers!

221
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,454
Then help me unhook the cars!

222
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,710
Come On!

223
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,298
It's jammed! Give me a hand.

224
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,009
You hold.

225
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,136
Whoa!

226
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,357
John.

227
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,518
What the...

228
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,248
Ugh.

229
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,717
Hey, hold it right there.

230
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,223
I'm afraid I have to take you in.

231
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,522
Do you hear me?

232
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,273
You speak English, don't you?

233
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,196
Halt!

234
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,409
By the authority granted to me

235
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,536
by the state of Texas,

236
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,414
I'm hereby arresting you.

237
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,545
You all right there, little brother?

238
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,713
Fine.

239
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,339
Just taking this man into custody.

240
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,341
Uh-huh.

241
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,889
He was on that train for a reason, Dan.

242
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,641
Probably.

243
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,184
What's your crime, boy?

244
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,396
Indian.

245
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,191
And a man, in the eyes of the law.

246
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,359
Now, throw me your cuffs.

247
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,322
Whatever you say, little brother.

248
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,909
it's nothing personal.

249
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,209
Dan?

250
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:28,922
John.

251
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,092
They said there was an accident

252
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,094
and someone fell off the train.

253
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,680
Actually, it was me.

254
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:38,724
Dan's fine.

255
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,186
Saved the day. Same as usual.

256
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,563
Oh, my God, your face.

257
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,106
Um...

258
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:49,693
Come here.

259
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,118
God, it's good to see you.

260
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,871
What's it been, nine years?

261
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,540
Eight, since you stopped writing.

262
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,586
We were just kids back then.

263
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,218
Well, he takes good care of you, I see.

264
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,389
Yeah. In his way.

265
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,310
He spends most his time

266
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,646
in Indian territory these days.

267
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,648
Indian territory?

268
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,817
Doesn't sound like Dan.

269
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,318
Doing what?

270
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,653
Well, whatever it is,

271
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,404
he doesn't talk to me about it.

272
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,199
So...

273
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,034
Have you got a place to stay?

274
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,160
I...

275
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,703
No. Not as yet.

276
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,164
Well, you should stay
with us at Willow Creek.

277
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,711
I don't know.

278
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,924
Oh, God, look at you.

279
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,926
City boy.

280
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,764
Why would you ever want
to come back here?

281
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,601
It's my home.

282
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:12,985
Who are you?

283
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,488
Danny, this is your Uncle John.

284
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,284
Why, you look
just like your dad did

285
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,535
when he was your age.

286
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,245
They're going out again.

287
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,536
He deserves a trial, Dan.

288
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,623
Two Rangers are dead.
Didn't get no trial.

289
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,708
Well, I'm coming with you.

290
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,960
The law looks a lot different
on the ground, little brother.

291
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,837
Well, it doesn't include vengeance,

292
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,088
no matter where you're standing.

293
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,757
For "Wherever men unite into society,

294
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,467
"they must quit the laws
of nature and assume..."

295
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,594
"And assume the laws of men,

296
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,722
"so that society as a whole
may prosper."

297
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,351
That's John Locke's
Treatises of Government.

298
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,020
Never thought to hear
the likes of it in Colby.

299
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,356
Mr Cole, my brother John.

300
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,732
New county prosecutor.

301
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,444
Latham Cole? It's an honour, sir.

302
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,029
I read about you during the war.

303
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,531
John, here,
is an educated man like yourself.

304
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,617
Well, let's try not to
hold that against him.

305
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,161
You going after Cavendish?

306
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,330
Collins, here, picked up a trail.

307
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,666
- Used to track for our father.
- Can he ride?

308
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,837
Well enough.

309
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,090
Yeah, well, you see to it.

310
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,133
Railroad promised
these people a hanging.

311
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,301
I didn't know the rail road

312
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,053
was in the business
of keeping promises.

313
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,721
A simple task.

314
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,724
Collect the prisoner,
deliver him to his execution.

315
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,143
If you're not up to that, Mr Reid,

316
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,854
I'll find someone who is.

317
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,198
Maybe you should think
about staying in town for a few days.

318
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,283
Comanche are restless.

319
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,576
They're always restless,

320
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,036
but they keep to their side of the river,

321
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,705
and I keep to mine.

322
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,249
Besides, fences won't
put themselves up.

323
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,584
It's my job.

324
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,878
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

325
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,588
I am happy.

326
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,591
I'm happy with the life
you provide. I just...

327
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,348
Is that new?

328
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,604
Matches your eyes.

329
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,026
All right.

330
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,237
Now, I expect you
to be bagging squirrels

331
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,447
by the time I get back.

332
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,969
Like old times, huh?

333
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,223
Thank you.

334
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,315
All right, Mr Prosecutor.

335
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,943
Let's see how your due process
fares on the trail.

336
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,954
It's Dad's.

337
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,167
I hereby deputise you a Texas Ranger.

338
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,173
But I can't help you with them clothes.

339
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,223
Indians call that your spirit horse.

340
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,977
Come to take you to the other side.

341
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,729
You can't scare me
with your ghost stories any more, Dan.

342
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,984
Since when did you start
wearing Indian jewellery, anyway?

343
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,652
Since my kid brother became a lawyer.

344
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:06,736
Yeah?

345
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,865
World needs lawyers
same as it does Rangers.

346
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,576
I reckon so. It's a nice hat, by the way.

347
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,452
They didn't have a bigger one?

348
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,123
He missed you.

349
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,583
Could have fooled me.

350
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,843
You smell like a distillery already.

351
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,136
Steadies the hand.

352
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,056
You even sleep last night?

353
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,224
You know me, Johnny.

354
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,228
Never been one
to resist a little Western hospitality.

355
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,358
"Red's." Hmm.

356
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,068
What's this? Like, dancing?

357
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,362
Yeah.

358
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,448
Dancing.

359
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,636
Could go by the flats.

360
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,680
Lose a day. Maybe a day and a half.

361
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,058
What is it?

362
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:19,643
No cover.

363
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,271
What do you figure, Dan?

364
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,149
Figure Collins should go take a look.

365
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,526
If he can stay in the saddle.

366
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,285
John. Come here.

367
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,127
No, I don't believe in them.
You know that.

368
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,507
Butch Cavendish don't care
one way or the other.

369
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,970
I'll take my chances.

370
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,266
You stay close.

371
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,351
Come on.

372
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,447
Where the hell's Collins?

373
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:01,536
Ambush!

374
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,496
I can't see him!

375
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,956
I got no shot!

376
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,417
Ride! Ride!

377
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,122
Dan!

378
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,958
Ride! Ride out!

379
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:08,269
Your hand! John, give me your hand!

380
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,854
- No. No!

381
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,567
No, Dan! Dan!

382
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,486
No! No, no...

383
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,865
You shouldn't have come back, John.

384
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:21,991
No, it's okay. It's okay.

385
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,535
I messed up.

386
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,080
No, no. You're okay, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

387
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,835
She always loved you.

388
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,423
Take care of her for me.

389
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,468
No, you're coming with me.
Come on! Come on!

390
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:57,444
Come on!

391
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,069
It's been
a long time, Ranger.

392
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,740
You've looked better.

393
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:48,161
I heard them boys in Tulsa
took a real shine to you.

394
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,500
All heart, ain't you?

395
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:06,095
A year you took from me
in that sweatbox.

396
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,604
You take something from me,

397
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,398
be damn sure

398
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,029
I'm gonna take something from you.

399
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,915
Oh, yes!

400
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:18,001
Deal dies with you, old friend.

401
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,018
That's not right.

402
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,228
It can't be right.

403
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,107
They're dead? All dead?

404
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,609
Even Dan?

405
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:28,863
Dan very dead.

406
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,949
But he's the Lone Ranger.

407
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,787
Would have been much easier, I agree.

408
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,208
How did you get out of jail, anyway?

409
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,584
Hmm?

410
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,269
And would you stop feeding that bird?

411
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,771
It's not alive, you know.

412
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,028
Awaiting spirit to return.

413
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,781
Not same thing.

414
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,594
Hmm.

415
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:55,092
Greetings, noble spirit horse.

416
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:05,061
No, no! No, no, please.
You make mistake.

417
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,524
Half-wit.

418
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:11,651
Wet brain.

419
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,402
You come.

420
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:14,654
Come, come.

421
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,076
Him

422
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,495
great warrior.

423
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,416
Spirit horse

424
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:30,253
you have travelled far.

425
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,547
Obviously very fatigued.

426
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:34,257
I understand.

427
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:36,968
You come. Come, come.

428
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,344
Come, come.

429
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,140
Him strong brother.

430
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,101
Want him, bring him back.

431
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,029
John! Give me your hand!

432
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:51,292
Rebecca.

433
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:56,339
John!

434
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,200
If you are going to
sneak up on an Indian,

435
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,453
best to do it downwind.

436
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:54,165
Why are you talking to that horse?

437
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:57,418
My grandfather spoke
of a time when animals could speak.

438
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:01,338
When you get them alone, some still do.

439
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:05,634
But I cannot decide
whether this horse is stupid,

440
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:08,637
or pretending to be stupid.

441
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:11,515
Tricky.

442
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:14,477
Why am I covered in dirt?

443
00:48:16,145 --> 00:48:17,605
Because I buried you.

444
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:22,651
Then why am I alive?

445
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:29,158
Horse says you are Spirit Walker.

446
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:32,036
A man who has been to the other side,

447
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,537
and returned.

448
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:34,955
A man

449
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,501
who cannot be killed in battle.

450
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,424
Horse definitely stupid.

451
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:49,804
Are those my boots?

452
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:07,029
He cut out his heart.

453
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,991
What kind of a man
does something like that?

454
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,410
Not a man.

455
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,038
An evil spirit

456
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,999
born in the empty spaces of the desert.

457
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,836
With a hunger

458
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,548
that cannot be satisfied.

459
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,181
And the power
to throw nature out of balance.

460
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:41,230
My people call this spirit "windigo."

461
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,567
I am Tonto of the Comanche,

462
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:47,152
last of the windigo hunters.

463
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:49,488
So, what do you want with me?

464
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:52,116
A vision told me a great warrior

465
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:54,952
and Spirit Walker
would help me on my quest.

466
00:49:56,412 --> 00:49:58,622
I would have preferred someone else.

467
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:00,499
Your brother, perhaps.

468
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,751
He would have been good.

469
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:06,630
But who am I to question
the great father, hmm?

470
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:10,426
All I know is a man killed my brother,

471
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,845
and I'll see him hang for it.

472
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:23,147
Then you will need this.

473
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,068
A bullet?

474
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:29,695
Mmm.

475
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,364
A silver bullet?

476
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:34,366
Silver made him what he is.

477
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,703
And so it will return him to the earth.

478
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,082
Right.

479
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,251
You know what?

480
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,171
I would like to thank you

481
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,632
for everything that you've done for me.

482
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,844
But I should get back.

483
00:50:57,973 --> 00:51:01,018
I, too,
seek the windigo Butch Cavendish.

484
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:02,686
Good.

485
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,438
I was prisoner on the train

486
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,357
the way a coyote stalks buffalo.

487
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,944
After hunting 26 years I had my prey

488
00:51:10,027 --> 00:51:11,278
until you interfere.

489
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:16,867
Actually, I think I saved your life.

490
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:19,787
So, we're even.

491
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:22,539
Ow!

492
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:25,167
What the hell was that for?

493
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:28,212
Bird angry.

494
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,636
Yeah. You know what?

495
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,471
I can't help you.

496
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:39,223
Or your bird.

497
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,516
Where do you go?

498
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:42,893
Into town, to form a posse.

499
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,812
I would not do that, kemosabe.

500
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,021
Yeah?

501
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:49,274
There was a gun
waiting for Cavendish on the train.

502
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:53,237
Eight men rode into canyon.

503
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,782
I dig seven graves.

504
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,871
Collins.

505
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:10,087
He's known us since we were kids.

506
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:13,173
You find traitor,

507
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:18,178
you find the man who killed your brother.

508
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,308
That's my brother's vest.

509
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:30,149
Eyes, cut by the bullets that killed him.

510
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:32,901
From the great beyond,

511
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:35,070
he will protect you

512
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:37,865
and the ones you love.

513
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,869
You want me to wear a mask?

514
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,913
The men you seek
think you are dead, kemosabe.

515
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,001
Better to stay that way.

516
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:01,138
All right, but if we ride together,

517
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,766
it's to bring these men to justice
in a court of law.

518
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:06,060
Is that understood?

519
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,746
Justice

520
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,540
is what I seek, kemosabe.

521
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:34,755
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:37,382
into the Hall of Human Deformities.

523
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:40,552
Fun and educational for you, sir.

524
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:50,395
...trampling out the vintage

525
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:53,440
Where the grapes of wrath are stored...

526
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:57,194
God has forsaken all you sinners,

527
00:53:57,277 --> 00:54:00,572
and now the armies of hell are upon us.

528
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:03,492
Heathen. Heathen!

529
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:07,454
Heathen in our midst!

530
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,289
Heathen!

531
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:13,877
I'm looking for a man.

532
00:54:15,212 --> 00:54:16,296
I bet.

533
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:18,590
Got money?

534
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:19,925
Of course.

535
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:26,640
Where did you get that?

536
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:27,724
Make trade.

537
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:30,686
With a dead man?

538
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,563
Hard bargain.

539
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:55,210
So...

540
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,297
Are all these women professionals?

541
00:54:58,547 --> 00:55:00,966
Sickness of greed is strong.

542
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,385
What about her?

543
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:06,722
Oh, yes. Her, too.

544
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,059
So how do you know all this?

545
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:13,479
A vision said it would be so.

546
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:14,646
Hmm.

547
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,064
Hi, Tonto.

548
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,702
Couple of freaks here to see you.

549
00:55:28,785 --> 00:55:30,204
Mmm-hmm. Thank you, Homer.

550
00:55:30,287 --> 00:55:31,747
Just let me do the talking.

551
00:55:33,749 --> 00:55:34,750
Ma'am.

552
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,836
What's with the mask?

553
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:41,256
Second thought, don't answer that.

554
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,425
No, one thing you learn in my business.

555
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:46,261
Killers, preachers,
war heroes, railroaders...

556
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:47,846
Every man has his thing.

557
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:51,850
Railroaders?
Are you referring to Mr Cole?

558
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,853
Oh, no, not Mr Cole. No.

559
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:57,314
By all reports, Mr Cole is, uh...

560
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,107
Well, he is no longer guided

561
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,567
by the same imperatives as other men.

562
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,363
Mr Cole gelding.

563
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,156
Come to think of it, there was talk

564
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,200
of an incident during the war.

565
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:09,368
Let go of me!

566
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,453
I won't let you go!

567
00:56:13,622 --> 00:56:14,790
Whoa!

568
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,044
No free rides, gentlemen!

569
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,801
Scrimshaw.

570
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:27,219
Ivory.

571
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:28,971
- I want to touch.
- Uh-uh!

572
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:31,139
Not if you favour your hand.

573
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:35,227
We're looking for a man named Collins.

574
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,646
He's a tracker, speaks Indian.

575
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,356
Never heard of him.

576
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:41,441
I see.

577
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:43,652
Well...

578
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,280
Coming in here,
we did happen to notice a number

579
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:48,615
of fairly serious health code violations.

580
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:49,700
Hmm.

581
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,703
It is a house of sin.

582
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:54,538
Yes, well, one with evidence

583
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,540
of livestock on the premises,

584
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:58,750
inadequately marked fire escapes,

585
00:56:58,834 --> 00:57:01,253
and a fairly sinister-looking
jar of pickles on the bar.

586
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:02,462
Hmm. Pickles?

587
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:04,214
Unrefrigerated.

588
00:57:04,423 --> 00:57:06,133
I'd hate to have to shut you down.

589
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,509
You want to shut down the rail road?

590
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:08,760
- Yes.
- No.

591
00:57:08,844 --> 00:57:10,429
- Yes.
- Well, then you have a problem,

592
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:11,763
because there ain't no rail road

593
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,765
without girls like mine
doing the heavy lifting.

594
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:16,268
Homer, help these morons find the door.

595
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,148
Windigo getting away.

596
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:22,649
What the hell is he talking about?

597
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,818
Nothing. It's an Indian thing.

598
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,071
Man who has taste for human flesh.

599
00:57:31,783 --> 00:57:33,368
Butch Cavendish.

600
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:36,663
That's right.

601
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:42,711
Well, why didn't you just say so?

602
00:57:43,295 --> 00:57:45,630
Collins was in about
a week ago with a lawman.

603
00:57:45,714 --> 00:57:47,716
Ranger like you, as a matter of fact.

604
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:49,885
Said his name was, uh, Reid.

605
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:51,845
Dan Reid?

606
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:53,805
Had themselves
a hell of an argument.

607
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:54,890
What about?

608
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:56,183
Something
they found in the desert.

609
00:57:56,642 --> 00:57:58,060
Paid me with this.

610
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:03,148
Do not touch rock!

611
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:05,942
Rock cursed.

612
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,256
lnjun's right. Worthless around here.

613
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:29,841
But get it to San Francisco,

614
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,260
they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.

615
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,763
Maybe I'll be on the first train west.

616
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:36,515
Retire.

617
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:40,477
Do you have cat?

618
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,561
I did.

619
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,355
I thought he'd be an improvement

620
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:44,773
on the last man in my life,

621
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:45,857
but maybe it's me.

622
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:47,984
Red, we got trouble.

623
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:56,535
What are you doing?

624
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:58,829
Comanche gesture of respect.

625
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,956
Taste another man's drink.

626
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,290
Oh. Right.

627
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:04,418
- Thank you.
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to

628
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:05,794
bring our little visit to a close.

629
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:08,630
Some of my clientele don't take kindly
to an Indian on the premises.

630
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:12,884
He has as much right
to be here as anyone else.

631
00:59:12,968 --> 00:59:15,262
Not since the Comanche
violated the treaty.

632
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:17,472
- Treaty?
- You didn't hear?

633
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,683
They've been raiding settlements
up and down the river.

634
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:22,644
My God. Rebecca.

635
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,481
Fear of cat.

636
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:28,984
Better go out the back.

637
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:32,821
How do I thank you?

638
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,908
Just make that animal pay
for what he took from me.

639
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:42,581
Hey!

640
00:59:50,005 --> 00:59:52,674
Nature is indeed out of balance.

641
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:05,645
Come. Must to go.

642
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:08,023
Must to go, drunken beast!

643
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,860
'Tis judgment day, harlot!

644
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:13,111
Oh.

645
01:00:13,195 --> 01:00:14,529
May I help you?

646
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:15,780
Where are they?

647
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:18,116
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

648
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:21,036
Ma'am, I believe I've located your...

649
01:00:23,205 --> 01:00:24,372
...cat.

650
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:27,083
Ma'am.

651
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,960
Get him!

652
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:30,921
There's the redskin!

653
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:52,692
Where you runnin', lnjun?

654
01:00:53,026 --> 01:00:55,237
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

655
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,280
Blood has been spilled, kemosabe.

656
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:00,909
And soon, rivers run red.

657
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:09,626
Oh, God...

658
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:15,590
Let's call it a night, Joe.

659
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:17,509
Yes, ma'am.

660
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:32,774
Come on, Danny.

661
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:31,791
Get yourselves inside!

662
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,251
Danny, come on.

663
01:02:34,419 --> 01:02:35,462
Pilar, get the shutters.

664
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,089
Pilar, fire!

665
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:08,096
Indian savages.

666
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:11,099
Was not Indian.

667
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:13,852
The hell it wasn't.

668
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:17,564
Indians make trade.

669
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,360
Leave him alone.

670
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:25,405
I said leave him alone!

671
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:29,576
Indian is like coyote.

672
01:04:29,743 --> 01:04:32,162
He kill and leave nothing to waste.

673
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:34,622
Tell me, kemosabe,

674
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:37,876
what does the white man kill for?

675
01:04:53,183 --> 01:04:55,310
This one's nice, ain't it?

676
01:04:58,229 --> 01:04:59,898
I love me some aquamarine.

677
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:07,405
Not an Indian.

678
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,991
This ain't what it looks like, mister.

679
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:12,243
I just like them pretty things.

680
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:14,913
Rebecca and Danny. Where are they?

681
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:19,834
You tell me where they are, or I'll let
the Indian do what he wants to you.

682
01:05:21,336 --> 01:05:23,463
What does he want to do?

683
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,474
What the hell is going on?

684
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:36,434
There's a Ranger.

685
01:05:36,518 --> 01:05:37,769
What are you talking about?

686
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:40,021
He got some lunatic Indian with him.

687
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:42,690
He was gonna violate me
with a duck foot.

688
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,950
You shoot anything that comes out.

689
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:03,545
Go for horse, kemosabe.

690
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:06,089
I cover you.

691
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,093
Why don't I cover you?

692
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:11,886
You have been to the other side.

693
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,180
Spirit Walker cannot be killed.

694
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,060
All right.

695
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,813
But we take them alive.

696
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:26,109
Texas Ranger!

697
01:06:26,526 --> 01:06:28,945
Put down your weapons
and step out with your hands up!

698
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:36,202
It's dark!

699
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:39,080
Spirit Walker.

700
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:42,083
See! What did I tell you?

701
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,751
Go around back.

702
01:06:47,589 --> 01:06:49,299
What's with the mask?

703
01:07:22,457 --> 01:07:23,625
What is it?

704
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,592
So, the horse,

705
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:34,802
it can fly?

706
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:37,847
Don't be stupid.

707
01:07:52,612 --> 01:07:53,988
Hold it right there.

708
01:07:57,367 --> 01:07:58,493
Rebecca and Danny,

709
01:07:59,077 --> 01:08:00,370
where are they?

710
01:08:00,662 --> 01:08:02,956
Comanche don't take no prisoners.

711
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:04,499
Just the scalps.

712
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:06,918
Isn't that right, boy?

713
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:15,176
I will take the Spaniard.

714
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,347
I haven't fired a gun
in nine years.

715
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:24,352
Might want to keep that
to yourself, kemosabe.

716
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:42,912
Great shot!

717
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:45,206
That was supposed
to be a warning shot.

718
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:47,583
In that case, not so good.

719
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:55,425
What?

720
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:58,219
Nothing.

721
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:22,910
That was my brother's.

722
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,705
Comanche.

723
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:28,124
Very sacred.

724
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:34,464
How am I supposed
to find Rebecca and Danny now?

725
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:38,092
Tracks lead north,
toward Indian country.

726
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:41,596
That's 400 square miles
of rock and desert.

727
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,805
Even an Indian can't track through that.

728
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,725
We follow horse, kemosabe.

729
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,314
"Kemosa..." Why do you
keep calling me that?

730
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:52,690
What's that mean?

731
01:09:56,444 --> 01:09:57,695
"Wrong brother."

732
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,199
Right.

733
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:15,046
My husband will kill you for this.

734
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:18,007
That'd be a trick.

735
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:23,387
Last time I saw your husband,

736
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,640
he was drowning in his own blood.

737
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:30,728
We got company.

738
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:32,021
Hold up!

739
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,148
It's Frank.

740
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:45,410
Where's Barret and Jesus?

741
01:10:47,703 --> 01:10:49,080
He killed them.

742
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:50,540
Straight draw.

743
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:54,001
Fired one bullet
and they didn't stand a chance.

744
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,379
You better start talking straight, Frank.

745
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:57,880
Now, who killed them?

746
01:10:59,966 --> 01:11:02,051
It was a Ranger, Butch.

747
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:04,637
A lone Ranger.

748
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:10,601
Rangers are dead.

749
01:11:13,938 --> 01:11:15,106
The ghost of Dan Reid.

750
01:11:15,231 --> 01:11:16,440
Frank!

751
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:17,859
He coming for you.

752
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,195
You shouldn't have done what you did.

753
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:22,864
- Shut up!

754
01:11:23,865 --> 01:11:25,533
Let him come!

755
01:11:26,242 --> 01:11:28,035
I killed him once.

756
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:31,539
I won't have to answer for it
when I kill him again.

757
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:33,291
Scared, aren't you?

758
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:39,422
You should be.

759
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:47,972
Hey, Collins.

760
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:52,810
Do you know
what the Indians call this place?

761
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,105
"The Valley of Tears."

762
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:10,286
Please don't do this. Please, don't...

763
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:15,917
Mmm!

764
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:19,921
That's far enough.

765
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:27,094
Don't look at me.

766
01:12:27,595 --> 01:12:29,096
He loved you.

767
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:32,475
I said, don't look at me.

768
01:12:44,195 --> 01:12:45,863
Run.

769
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:48,658
Please, run.

770
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:54,038
Danny, come on.

771
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,626
Mama?

772
01:13:15,351 --> 01:13:16,894
Why would Cavendish
make it look

773
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:19,480
like the Comanche violated the treaty?

774
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:20,648
It has something to do

775
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:21,816
with what my brother found in the desert.

776
01:13:22,608 --> 01:13:24,610
Perhaps he want to make it look

777
01:13:24,694 --> 01:13:26,946
like Comanche violate treaty.

778
01:13:27,822 --> 01:13:30,324
That's very helpful, thank you.

779
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:31,826
Whoa.

780
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:33,953
What is it?

781
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:04,025
Horse dead.

782
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:07,028
I can see that. Now what?

783
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:13,701
We're lost, aren't we?

784
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:15,745
I knew it.

785
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:17,913
Just follow the horse.
That was your idea?

786
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,541
But you can't talk
to a dead horse, now, can you?

787
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,710
You know what? Let me try.

788
01:14:24,045 --> 01:14:27,256
Hello. If you could
just point us in the right direction,

789
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:28,883
we'll take it from here.

790
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,259
What's that?

791
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:31,886
Nothing!

792
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:39,143
That's just fantastic, isn't it?
Cavendish is out there somewhere,

793
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:40,936
doing God-knows-what
to Rebecca and Danny,

794
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,647
and I'm gonna die
here in the desert with you

795
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,231
and that ridiculous bird!

796
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,029
The woman, Rebecca,

797
01:14:50,196 --> 01:14:52,406
you will fill her with child, no?

798
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:53,574
What?

799
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:54,742
No!

800
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:56,369
That's my brother's wife.

801
01:14:57,078 --> 01:14:58,913
When you were on the other side,

802
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:01,582
you spoke of her in your vision.

803
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:06,212
Well, lack of oxygen
can cause the brain to hallucinate.

804
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,630
Everyone knows that.

805
01:15:07,755 --> 01:15:08,756
Yes,

806
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:13,260
but you did not speak of her
as the wife of your brother.

807
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,556
Well, she's his widow now.

808
01:15:17,932 --> 01:15:20,309
So, it is better that
she live the rest of her life alone?

809
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,645
Yes. No.

810
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:26,607
Look, it just isn't done.
You wouldn't understand.

811
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,984
Because I am a savage?

812
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,960
Would you stop?

813
01:15:46,127 --> 01:15:47,211
You can't track.

814
01:15:47,294 --> 01:15:50,172
If you could, we wouldn't be
out here in the first place!

815
01:15:55,845 --> 01:15:56,846
What is that?

816
01:15:57,638 --> 01:15:58,639
Track!

817
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:02,309
That's impossible.

818
01:16:07,982 --> 01:16:09,650
Train track.

819
01:16:14,155 --> 01:16:16,198
You are lost, aren't you?

820
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,951
Train tracks?

821
01:16:19,118 --> 01:16:21,162
I thought you were in Indian territory.

822
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:23,956
Yes.

823
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,069
Let the Comanche make no mistake.

824
01:16:54,153 --> 01:16:57,364
We will not be dissuaded from our task.

825
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,033
From here on,

826
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,785
all treaties with the Indian Nation

827
01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:03,537
are null and void.

828
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:06,165
We will be in Promontory Summit

829
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:07,374
ahead of schedule,

830
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,919
three days from today!

831
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:13,422
Now, go ahead. Put that in your paper.

832
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:17,176
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

833
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:19,720
Sir?

834
01:17:21,055 --> 01:17:22,389
It arrived last night.

835
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:25,935
I had to dip into petty cash.

836
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:27,937
Put it somewhere safe.

837
01:17:28,437 --> 01:17:30,189
Where would that be?

838
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:32,566
Use your imagination.

839
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:44,245
I understand you have
an Indian problem.

840
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:47,289
Right on time.

841
01:18:06,934 --> 01:18:08,561
I thought you said I couldn't get shot.

842
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:11,230
No.

843
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,440
I said you could not be killed.

844
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:14,650
Oh.

845
01:18:17,653 --> 01:18:18,779
Apache?

846
01:18:18,988 --> 01:18:20,197
Comanche.

847
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:21,365
Well, that's good, right?

848
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:23,951
Not so much.

849
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:27,538
What are they doing?

850
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:29,290
Death dance.

851
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:31,500
They are preparing for war
with the white man.

852
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,835
War?

853
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:35,170
Wait.

854
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,631
Is that thing sterile?

855
01:18:37,715 --> 01:18:40,009
Yes. I make urine on it.

856
01:18:40,175 --> 01:18:41,343
What?

857
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:45,222
War?

858
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:47,641
But the Comanche didn't
attack the settlements!

859
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,894
White man does not know this.

860
01:18:51,562 --> 01:18:52,938
But you're going to tell them.

861
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:55,983
I mean, you did tell them, right?

862
01:19:10,414 --> 01:19:11,916
My name's John Reid,

863
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:14,168
and I know that you didn't
raid those settlements.

864
01:19:14,335 --> 01:19:16,420
If you let me go, I can prove it.

865
01:19:16,837 --> 01:19:20,341
There doesn't have to
be a war, understand?

866
01:19:22,343 --> 01:19:25,095
No. Of course you don't.

867
01:19:31,852 --> 01:19:33,020
Mmm!

868
01:19:33,896 --> 01:19:36,440
Good. Good.

869
01:19:37,024 --> 01:19:40,069
Me, Spirit Walker

870
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:41,945
from great beyond.

871
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:46,575
The hunter of wendingo

872
01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:49,036
and the other things.

873
01:19:49,745 --> 01:19:51,455
Sunstroke?

874
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:55,250
Or his mind is poisoned with whiskey.

875
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:04,760
Comanche gesture of respect?

876
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:07,638
What's with the mask?

877
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,016
What?

878
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,643
Tonto told you these things?

879
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:14,770
That's right.

880
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:17,064
And he told you to wear the mask?

881
01:20:24,446 --> 01:20:25,489
That's funny?

882
01:20:25,656 --> 01:20:26,740
Very funny.

883
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:27,908
Tonto's a Comanche.

884
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:29,827
He's one of you.

885
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:32,955
No more.

886
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:39,086
What do you mean?

887
01:20:41,088 --> 01:20:43,590
His mind is broken.

888
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,929
He is a band apart.

889
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:56,937
Many moons ago,

890
01:20:57,271 --> 01:21:01,442
a boy found two white men
in the desert.

891
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:13,996
He brought them to
his village to be healed.

892
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:27,718
When they found silver in the river,

893
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:31,180
they asked the boy where it came from.

894
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:54,369
In exchange for a cheap pocket watch

895
01:21:54,495 --> 01:21:56,163
from Sears Roebuck,

896
01:21:56,330 --> 01:22:00,667
the boy showed them
where the river begins,

897
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,590
where they found more silver

898
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:09,718
than any white man had ever seen.

899
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:15,057
They took what they could carry,

900
01:22:15,724 --> 01:22:19,019
but they wanted to
keep the place a secret,

901
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:21,563
so they could one day return.

902
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:09,695
The boy could not live
with what he had done,

903
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:12,948
so he decided the men were possessed

904
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:15,576
by evil spirits in the silver.

905
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:22,749
He called it "windigo,"

906
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:26,253
like the ghost stories
we tell our children.

907
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:36,430
And he made a vow.

908
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:39,099
When he found these two men,

909
01:23:39,266 --> 01:23:40,601
he would drain their blood

910
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:43,437
into the soil of his ancestors,

911
01:23:46,106 --> 01:23:49,443
so he could return to the tribe.

912
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:55,073
But he is too late.

913
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,577
There is no more tribe to return to.

914
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,455
Our time has passed.

915
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:05,792
They call it "progress."

916
01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:13,050
You're John Reid, brother of Dan.

917
01:24:14,468 --> 01:24:15,552
Yes.

918
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:19,306
By this totem, your brother swore

919
01:24:19,431 --> 01:24:20,557
if we kept the peace,

920
01:24:20,641 --> 01:24:22,893
he would protect our land.

921
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,896
Now the Cavalry cut down our children.

922
01:24:26,063 --> 01:24:29,733
Like all white men, your brother lied.

923
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,569
No. No, Dan was murdered.

924
01:24:32,736 --> 01:24:35,364
And if you let me go,
I'll keep his promise.

925
01:24:38,617 --> 01:24:39,993
So, we have a deal?

926
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:45,290
Not so much.

927
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:51,004
My name come up?

928
01:24:57,469 --> 01:24:59,513
Please, this is a mistake.

929
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,682
There doesn't need to be a war.

930
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:03,183
It makes no difference.

931
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,478
We are already ghosts.

932
01:25:16,613 --> 01:25:17,739
Shh! Shh!

933
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:22,703
Cavalry.

934
01:25:23,245 --> 01:25:24,871
Let us bring the pure sceptre

935
01:25:24,955 --> 01:25:27,416
of Almighty God
to the heathens!

936
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:31,628
Oh, thank God! Civilisation.

937
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:33,964
We'll just explain the entire situation,

938
01:25:34,131 --> 01:25:36,675
and we'll get this whole
misunderstanding cleared up.

939
01:25:36,842 --> 01:25:38,510
The United States Army.

940
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:40,470
Finally someone
who will listen to reason.

941
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:52,774
Help! Over here!

942
01:25:53,692 --> 01:25:55,027
Wait!

943
01:25:58,363 --> 01:26:00,115
Perhaps they didn't see us.

944
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:01,533
Oh, no.

945
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,952
They will be back any minute now.

946
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:08,915
Could be worse.

947
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,084
Worse?

948
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:13,295
How could this be worse?

949
01:26:13,462 --> 01:26:15,380
Could develop an itch

950
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:19,634
on your nose.

951
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:27,142
I'm not talking to you any more.

952
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:35,817
What is that?

953
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:38,111
You hear it, too?

954
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,947
I was hoping it was in my head.

955
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,498
This is worse.

956
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:52,626
Hmm.

957
01:26:55,462 --> 01:26:57,964
Nature is most definitely...

958
01:26:58,757 --> 01:26:59,758
- Out of balance.
- Mmm.

959
01:27:10,977 --> 01:27:11,978
Hello again.

960
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:15,774
Any chance you could...

961
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,663
Atta boy! Yes! Thank you.

962
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:31,456
Uh...

963
01:27:37,212 --> 01:27:38,213
Ah!

964
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:41,508
Here we go, okay, go!

965
01:27:49,057 --> 01:27:50,350
Thank you.

966
01:27:53,019 --> 01:27:55,230
Going, kemosabe?

967
01:27:55,355 --> 01:27:56,523
Uh-huh.

968
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,483
To find Rebecca and Danny?

969
01:27:58,567 --> 01:27:59,651
Yup.

970
01:27:59,818 --> 01:28:01,695
- To capture Cavendish?
- That's right.

971
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,196
Hmm.

972
01:28:03,405 --> 01:28:05,157
Where the river begins?

973
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:06,533
Exactly.

974
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,913
It is a good day to die.

975
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,040
Yeah, well,

976
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:15,584
same to you.

977
01:28:16,084 --> 01:28:17,252
Come on.

978
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,476
"Where the river begins."

979
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,729
You know where that is, don't you?

980
01:28:45,864 --> 01:28:48,408
Where the river begins.

981
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:04,090
Oh!

982
01:29:04,216 --> 01:29:07,385
Sorry, Butch. it was a accident. I'm...

983
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:09,012
I didn't mean it.

984
01:29:12,349 --> 01:29:14,684
What the hell is that damn noise?

985
01:29:17,854 --> 01:29:20,690
Sorry, Butch.
They say they won't go inside no more.

986
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:22,943
Indian spirits or some damn thing.

987
01:29:23,068 --> 01:29:25,111
They say they causing the cave-ins.

988
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:28,073
He the one doing the talking?

989
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,574
That's right.

990
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:34,162
Anybody else want to negotiate?

991
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:35,247
You?

992
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:39,709
They don't even speak English, Butch.

993
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:41,670
I think they understood.

994
01:29:42,337 --> 01:29:44,965
Now go show them
there's nothing to be afraid of.

995
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:50,011
Do I have to ask twice?

996
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:53,348
I've been thinking.

997
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:58,311
Why don't we just take
what we can carry

998
01:29:58,478 --> 01:29:59,938
and get out of here?

999
01:30:01,398 --> 01:30:04,317
I mean, hell, we already rich.

1000
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:06,236
Right?

1001
01:30:08,363 --> 01:30:09,781
Scraps?

1002
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:11,950
Yeah.

1003
01:30:12,784 --> 01:30:14,828
You think I waited 20 years

1004
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:17,539
for scraps?

1005
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,166
I'm taking all of it!

1006
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:21,376
Every damn piece!

1007
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:22,627
I'm sorry!

1008
01:30:22,794 --> 01:30:26,047
Now, get in there
before I put a hole in you!

1009
01:30:27,549 --> 01:30:28,675
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1010
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:30,468
Get in there.

1011
01:30:58,121 --> 01:30:59,414
Frank?

1012
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:03,626
Ray,

1013
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:05,962
Skinny,

1014
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:08,089
90 get him.

1015
01:31:08,757 --> 01:31:09,758
Frank?

1016
01:32:24,499 --> 01:32:26,501
It can't be.

1017
01:32:29,295 --> 01:32:31,631
The Rangers are dead.

1018
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,641
Where are they?

1019
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,853
You're dead.

1020
01:32:49,357 --> 01:32:51,359
Rebecca and Danny.

1021
01:32:51,526 --> 01:32:53,862
If you hurt them, I swear
to God, I'll make you pay.

1022
01:32:56,156 --> 01:32:58,658
...to the full extent of the law.

1023
01:32:59,284 --> 01:33:01,119
I'll be damned.

1024
01:33:01,286 --> 01:33:03,955
Lawyer and a crazy lnjun.

1025
01:33:05,707 --> 01:33:06,833
Tell me.

1026
01:33:13,882 --> 01:33:15,508
Had a nice smell on her.

1027
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:17,510
Didn't she?

1028
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:32,525
See?

1029
01:33:33,026 --> 01:33:35,028
You're no spirit.

1030
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:37,489
You're just a man in a mask.

1031
01:33:39,866 --> 01:33:42,202
You're no different than me.

1032
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:47,499
Finish him.

1033
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,042
No.

1034
01:33:50,043 --> 01:33:51,544
This isn't justice.

1035
01:33:51,711 --> 01:33:53,421
Justice

1036
01:33:53,546 --> 01:33:56,382
is what a man must take for himself.

1037
01:33:58,218 --> 01:34:00,261
No, I can't believe that.

1038
01:34:00,428 --> 01:34:01,721
I won't.

1039
01:34:01,888 --> 01:34:04,265
Windigo cut out brother's heart.

1040
01:34:05,266 --> 01:34:07,268
Where is brother's justice?

1041
01:34:07,769 --> 01:34:09,604
I'm not a savage.

1042
01:34:12,357 --> 01:34:14,234
You are not a man.

1043
01:34:15,068 --> 01:34:17,028
- I will do it.
- Wait.

1044
01:34:20,532 --> 01:34:23,243
You keep me from my destiny once.

1045
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:25,411
It will not happen again.

1046
01:34:26,746 --> 01:34:28,748
Now, windigo must die.

1047
01:34:28,915 --> 01:34:31,709
There's no such thing as a wendingo.

1048
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,003
You made it up.

1049
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:36,923
Like you make up everything.

1050
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:40,343
You sold out your whole village
for a watch.

1051
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:43,513
And now you're an outcast.
You're a band apart.

1052
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,681
A messed up little kid

1053
01:34:44,764 --> 01:34:47,433
who couldn't live with what you did.

1054
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,353
There's no such thing as cursed silver,

1055
01:34:50,562 --> 01:34:53,064
or a Spirit Walker for that matter.

1056
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:55,275
I'm not like you.

1057
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:56,943
I have a tribe.

1058
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:01,614
You have nothing.

1059
01:35:02,115 --> 01:35:03,616
Like me.

1060
01:35:05,702 --> 01:35:07,120
You're wrong.

1061
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:10,707
Go back to your tribe, white coward.

1062
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:13,793
I do not need you.

1063
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:22,135
Look at me.

1064
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,472
See the face of my people

1065
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,099
as you die.

1066
01:35:30,268 --> 01:35:32,520
I knew I could count on you, Counsellor.

1067
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:34,188
Shut up.

1068
01:35:58,254 --> 01:35:59,255
Hey.

1069
01:35:59,839 --> 01:36:01,507
Where am I?

1070
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:04,594
Drink.

1071
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,388
Feel better.

1072
01:36:21,861 --> 01:36:24,197
Your tactics
have been most effective, Captain.

1073
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,740
With the natives in retreat,

1074
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,575
we'll be in Promontory Summit
ahead of schedule.

1075
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:31,037
Believe me, what they have done to the
settlements we have given back tenfold.

1076
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:34,374
Tenfold.

1077
01:36:38,169 --> 01:36:40,964
Danny, I told you,
take it easy on the corners

1078
01:36:41,047 --> 01:36:42,757
and press down on the straightaway.

1079
01:36:42,924 --> 01:36:44,884
It's just a toy.

1080
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:48,096
Come here, Danny.

1081
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:49,597
I want to show you something.

1082
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,851
Since the time of Alexander the Great

1083
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:55,561
no man has travelled faster

1084
01:36:55,645 --> 01:36:57,313
than the horse that carried him.

1085
01:36:57,814 --> 01:36:59,315
Not any more.

1086
01:36:59,732 --> 01:37:04,070
Imagine, an entire continent
connected by iron rail.

1087
01:37:04,237 --> 01:37:07,156
That's fuel for our cities.
Metals for our factories.

1088
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:09,742
Food for the masses.

1089
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:14,080
Whoever controls this,

1090
01:37:14,247 --> 01:37:16,416
controls the future.

1091
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:20,586
Power that makes emperors and kings

1092
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:22,088
look like fools.

1093
01:37:26,759 --> 01:37:28,511
You mean it's mine?

1094
01:37:28,678 --> 01:37:30,972
It could be, son.

1095
01:37:31,764 --> 01:37:34,267
Could be all yours.

1096
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,647
Rebecca. Feeling better?

1097
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:42,150
Look what Mr Cole got me, Mama.

1098
01:37:42,275 --> 01:37:43,276
Huh!

1099
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:44,736
Danny...

1100
01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:45,820
Oh!

1101
01:37:46,612 --> 01:37:48,281
Well, it was the least I could do

1102
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:49,657
after what you've been through.

1103
01:37:49,782 --> 01:37:52,618
You should consider yourself
a lucky woman, Mrs Reid.

1104
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:54,996
Had Mr Cole not
come along when he did

1105
01:37:55,163 --> 01:37:57,123
with those outlaws,
who knows what manner

1106
01:37:57,206 --> 01:37:58,624
of violations might have transpired...

1107
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:00,126
Captain. Captain, please.

1108
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,461
The boy.

1109
01:38:01,627 --> 01:38:03,046
We're indebted to you.

1110
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:05,798
Oh, no. It is I who is indebted.

1111
01:38:05,965 --> 01:38:09,635
Ever since the war, I prayed
that God might send me

1112
01:38:09,802 --> 01:38:12,889
a family that I could care for.

1113
01:38:13,222 --> 01:38:14,807
And now he has.

1114
01:38:15,475 --> 01:38:16,517
Wait.

1115
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:19,145
There's one left.

1116
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,980
- I'm sorry?
- A Ranger.

1117
01:38:23,232 --> 01:38:24,317
A Ranger is still alive.

1118
01:38:24,484 --> 01:38:25,568
No, ma'am.

1119
01:38:25,735 --> 01:38:27,570
My troopers found seven graves.

1120
01:38:27,737 --> 01:38:29,322
So, perhaps when you fell
and hit your head...

1121
01:38:29,405 --> 01:38:30,406
Captain.

1122
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:33,785
If there is a Ranger still alive,

1123
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:36,954
we will scour the countryside
until we find him.

1124
01:38:37,497 --> 01:38:39,165
I promise you that.

1125
01:38:45,338 --> 01:38:46,798
Heavenly Father,

1126
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:50,343
we call upon you in this,
our hour of need.

1127
01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:53,346
For you are the shepherd

1128
01:38:53,513 --> 01:38:56,808
that shall guide the wanderer
through the desert.

1129
01:38:56,974 --> 01:38:59,560
You are the light
that shall be his beacon

1130
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:01,187
in the darkness.

1131
01:39:02,063 --> 01:39:04,398
And yours is the mighty sword

1132
01:39:04,524 --> 01:39:06,734
that shall strike down his enemies.

1133
01:39:07,235 --> 01:39:10,905
For he is on the path of righteousness.

1134
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:13,533
Amen.

1135
01:39:25,336 --> 01:39:26,546
Latham Cole!

1136
01:39:26,712 --> 01:39:28,172
Sir!
Someone's coming in!

1137
01:39:28,256 --> 01:39:29,882
Sentries,
at your posts!

1138
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,392
- Daddy!
- Dan.

1139
01:39:41,227 --> 01:39:42,228
We don't know who's out there.

1140
01:39:42,311 --> 01:39:43,896
I intend to find out.

1141
01:39:44,021 --> 01:39:45,314
Latham Cole!

1142
01:39:45,398 --> 01:39:48,526
Wendell, take Mrs Reid
and her son to the supply car.

1143
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:50,486
For their own safety.

1144
01:39:53,906 --> 01:39:54,907
What is it, friend?

1145
01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:01,539
This is the man you've been looking for.

1146
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:07,086
Butch Cavendish,

1147
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,338
just like one of those great lizards

1148
01:40:09,422 --> 01:40:10,882
buried in the desert.

1149
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:12,216
The last of a dying breed.

1150
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:16,262
That's enough.

1151
01:40:22,602 --> 01:40:24,770
I brought this man in for justice.

1152
01:40:26,772 --> 01:40:28,107
Of course.

1153
01:40:29,442 --> 01:40:31,569
Soldier.

1154
01:40:39,285 --> 01:40:41,287
I'm just doing my job, Mrs Reid.

1155
01:40:41,454 --> 01:40:42,496
You wanna keep me in this room,

1156
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,748
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1157
01:40:44,081 --> 01:40:45,207
Is that part of your job?

1158
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:48,753
Whoa!

1159
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:50,421
Danny.

1160
01:40:52,089 --> 01:40:53,841
And don't let him leave.

1161
01:40:55,134 --> 01:40:56,385
But he's just a boy.

1162
01:40:57,178 --> 01:40:58,346
That's right.

1163
01:40:59,513 --> 01:41:00,598
Oh.

1164
01:41:00,932 --> 01:41:02,808
And he's got a twitchy finger, too.

1165
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:31,212
Stupid white man.

1166
01:41:35,174 --> 01:41:37,343
There were rumours
that sustained us.

1167
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,053
A lone Ranger,

1168
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:41,889
a masked man.

1169
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:45,476
A ghost, some people said.

1170
01:41:46,352 --> 01:41:47,645
And now, here you are.

1171
01:41:50,189 --> 01:41:51,190
Flesh and blood.

1172
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:53,901
Civilised society
has no place for a masked man.

1173
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:55,027
Of course not.

1174
01:41:56,028 --> 01:41:58,197
How can I thank you
for what you've done?

1175
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:01,367
You can stop this war before it's too late.

1176
01:42:01,534 --> 01:42:03,119
Comanche didn't attack
those settlements.

1177
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:05,621
It was Butch Cavendish and his gang.

1178
01:42:06,706 --> 01:42:08,374
All for this.

1179
01:42:16,048 --> 01:42:17,466
Butch Cavendish.

1180
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:22,555
In one man,

1181
01:42:22,722 --> 01:42:25,725
everything I hate about this country.

1182
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:28,519
No sense of the common good.

1183
01:42:29,562 --> 01:42:31,063
No vision.

1184
01:42:33,232 --> 01:42:34,483
Come to think of it,

1185
01:42:34,567 --> 01:42:37,361
not unlike your brother, Dan.

1186
01:43:00,259 --> 01:43:04,180
Men like that can't accept
what we know to be true.

1187
01:43:04,347 --> 01:43:06,265
A man can't stay the same

1188
01:43:06,349 --> 01:43:09,352
with the world evolving around him.

1189
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:26,243
Remember me?

1190
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:29,663
But a man can't choose
his brother, can he?

1191
01:43:30,289 --> 01:43:33,584
It's almost as if his brother chooses him.

1192
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:36,879
You see, that's what we are.

1193
01:43:38,255 --> 01:43:39,423
Me and Butch.

1194
01:43:39,882 --> 01:43:41,425
Brothers.

1195
01:43:42,218 --> 01:43:44,178
Born in the desert.

1196
01:43:44,345 --> 01:43:46,138
All those years ago.

1197
01:43:50,267 --> 01:43:52,394
And now you've come back.

1198
01:43:53,312 --> 01:43:54,772
Train tracks.

1199
01:43:55,356 --> 01:43:57,733
That's what Dan found
in Indian Territory, isn't it?

1200
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:58,901
He knew there was gonna be a war

1201
01:43:58,984 --> 01:43:59,985
and he wouldn't go along with it,

1202
01:44:00,069 --> 01:44:01,570
so you had him killed.

1203
01:44:01,737 --> 01:44:03,155
Like I said,

1204
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:04,281
no vision.

1205
01:44:04,824 --> 01:44:06,951
Stop this train.

1206
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:09,286
Oh, there's no stopping this train, John.

1207
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,705
I think you know that.

1208
01:44:24,176 --> 01:44:25,886
Danny!

1209
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:29,140
You're not my daddy.

1210
01:44:29,557 --> 01:44:31,851
No. Put the gun down, son.

1211
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:33,769
Where's my daddy?

1212
01:44:34,103 --> 01:44:35,479
He's dead, Danny.

1213
01:44:37,022 --> 01:44:38,441
- He killed him.
- Shut up.

1214
01:44:38,816 --> 01:44:39,817
Listen to me, Danny.

1215
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,318
You remember me, it's your Uncle John.

1216
01:44:41,402 --> 01:44:43,529
You trust me, don't you, Danny?

1217
01:44:43,863 --> 01:44:46,657
Look, Danny,
I'm gonna put my gun away, okay?

1218
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:47,908
Nice and slow.

1219
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:49,785
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1220
01:44:51,537 --> 01:44:52,580
Shoot him, son.

1221
01:44:56,417 --> 01:44:58,043
Danny?

1222
01:44:59,545 --> 01:45:01,422
Is my daddy dead?

1223
01:45:09,054 --> 01:45:10,222
Is he?

1224
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,226
Is he?

1225
01:45:14,727 --> 01:45:16,437
Just put the gun down.

1226
01:45:17,563 --> 01:45:18,898
Please?

1227
01:45:22,151 --> 01:45:23,986
Now, just put the gun down.

1228
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:41,879
Captain, arrest these men.

1229
01:45:41,962 --> 01:45:43,589
This man is a common criminal

1230
01:45:43,672 --> 01:45:45,341
trespassing on railway property.

1231
01:45:45,424 --> 01:45:47,343
Comanche never
raided any settlements.

1232
01:45:47,426 --> 01:45:49,553
They staged the attacks
so they could violate the treaty.

1233
01:45:49,637 --> 01:45:51,388
We've heard enough. Captain.

1234
01:45:51,472 --> 01:45:53,015
You represent
the United States government.

1235
01:45:53,098 --> 01:45:54,225
You do not work for this man!

1236
01:45:54,308 --> 01:45:56,352
- Captain!
- They started this war!

1237
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:58,521
Well, if what you say is true,

1238
01:45:58,604 --> 01:46:01,273
that would mean
I attacked the Comanche for no reason.

1239
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,900
That's right, Captain.

1240
01:46:03,817 --> 01:46:06,153
Slaughter of the innocents.

1241
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,113
Their blood on your hands.

1242
01:46:09,615 --> 01:46:11,450
Tenfold.

1243
01:46:12,618 --> 01:46:14,828
Are you capable of that?

1244
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,630
Well, the way I see it,

1245
01:46:24,797 --> 01:46:27,633
these men are with the rail road.

1246
01:46:28,092 --> 01:46:29,802
So, the question is,

1247
01:46:31,512 --> 01:46:33,013
who the hell are you?

1248
01:46:51,907 --> 01:46:53,492
Clear the track, men!

1249
01:46:53,576 --> 01:46:55,119
Outta the way!

1250
01:47:10,175 --> 01:47:11,427
Going to pit!

1251
01:47:19,518 --> 01:47:20,686
My God!

1252
01:47:20,853 --> 01:47:22,646
Out here, it's just rock.

1253
01:47:22,813 --> 01:47:25,441
Put it on a train, it's priceless.

1254
01:47:25,607 --> 01:47:27,901
What could you buy with all of that?

1255
01:47:29,778 --> 01:47:31,030
A country, Captain.

1256
01:47:33,032 --> 01:47:34,575
A great country.

1257
01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:37,036
For which our children will thank us.

1258
01:47:39,079 --> 01:47:42,416
Take her ahead!
Line her up!

1259
01:47:48,088 --> 01:47:49,173
You're lined up.

1260
01:47:52,593 --> 01:47:54,011
RAILWAYMAN 22 That'll do!

1261
01:47:55,637 --> 01:47:57,681
Get these Chinamen out of here!

1262
01:47:57,848 --> 01:47:59,516
Move it, move it!

1263
01:48:00,392 --> 01:48:02,728
Detail, halt!

1264
01:48:05,314 --> 01:48:07,191
Order, up!

1265
01:48:17,409 --> 01:48:19,244
Didn't you hear me, Chinaman?

1266
01:48:19,495 --> 01:48:21,497
I said, get out!

1267
01:48:24,124 --> 01:48:25,542
Port arms!

1268
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:31,173
Please, don't do this.

1269
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:39,056
You'll take care of us, like you said.

1270
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:42,184
You don't have to do this.

1271
01:48:43,143 --> 01:48:44,770
Load!

1272
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:52,111
I ain't gonna tell you again!

1273
01:48:58,117 --> 01:48:59,368
What the hell is that?

1274
01:49:04,331 --> 01:49:07,209
Gas. That's gas!

1275
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:08,460
What'd he say?

1276
01:49:08,544 --> 01:49:09,795
Gas! Get out of there!

1277
01:49:10,295 --> 01:49:11,547
She's going to blow!

1278
01:49:17,803 --> 01:49:19,138
Shoulder arms!

1279
01:49:21,056 --> 01:49:22,641
I was at Gettysburg.

1280
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:26,019
Twelve-thousand casualties
before lunch.

1281
01:49:27,146 --> 01:49:29,440
Know what I learned in all that carnage?

1282
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:33,527
Nothing is accomplished
without sacrifice.

1283
01:49:37,656 --> 01:49:39,616
- Leave her alone!
- Danny!

1284
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,161
Nice and easy!

1285
01:49:42,244 --> 01:49:44,413
Gas! Oh, Lord! Gas!

1286
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:45,497
What the hell?

1287
01:49:45,581 --> 01:49:46,957
Gas! Gas! Gas!

1288
01:49:48,792 --> 01:49:50,461
Ready!

1289
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:52,838
I'm gonna have to
teach you about respect, aren't I, son?

1290
01:49:52,921 --> 01:49:53,922
No!

1291
01:49:55,549 --> 01:49:56,759
Aim!

1292
01:50:00,512 --> 01:50:01,638
Fire!

1293
01:50:03,265 --> 01:50:04,266
Oh!

1294
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:14,193
What the hell just happened?

1295
01:50:53,732 --> 01:50:55,526
Get the train moving!

1296
01:51:00,155 --> 01:51:03,492
Attack!
Maintain order! To arms!

1297
01:51:03,575 --> 01:51:05,035
Hold on, kemosabe.

1298
01:51:05,577 --> 01:51:06,578
Tonto?

1299
01:51:09,248 --> 01:51:10,582
What was that?

1300
01:51:10,749 --> 01:51:12,084
No reason for concern.

1301
01:51:12,209 --> 01:51:14,086
Over here! To the guns!

1302
01:51:14,503 --> 01:51:16,505
Defensive position!

1303
01:51:17,256 --> 01:51:18,257
John!

1304
01:51:19,174 --> 01:51:21,218
Rebecca! I'm coming for you!

1305
01:51:21,301 --> 01:51:22,427
John!

1306
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,012
Rally on me!

1307
01:51:35,524 --> 01:51:36,692
Lord, save us.

1308
01:51:41,446 --> 01:51:43,365
Faster! Now!

1309
01:51:45,117 --> 01:51:47,077
Form a firing line!

1310
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,745
Come this way. Fall in on me.

1311
01:51:52,082 --> 01:51:53,750
Hold your positions, gentlemen!

1312
01:51:55,586 --> 01:51:56,879
Hold!

1313
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,590
Steady!

1314
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,051
For God!

1315
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,179
And for country!

1316
01:52:09,683 --> 01:52:10,893
Fire at Will!

1317
01:52:15,314 --> 01:52:18,108
Tonto? What is that?

1318
01:52:27,576 --> 01:52:29,578
Now... must to jump!

1319
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:31,079
Left or right?

1320
01:52:31,163 --> 01:52:32,331
Yes!

1321
01:52:50,098 --> 01:52:51,850
Kerosene?

1322
01:52:52,017 --> 01:52:54,394
What are you trying to do?
Blow up the whole mountain?

1323
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:58,857
Trust me. These two have
a hard time staying dead.

1324
01:53:20,087 --> 01:53:21,338
Cover the flank!

1325
01:55:02,189 --> 01:55:03,607
Mister Tonto?

1326
01:55:06,526 --> 01:55:07,944
Mister Tonto?

1327
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:11,406
You mean, they killed all of them?

1328
01:55:12,449 --> 01:55:15,577
The Indians, the settlers...

1329
01:55:16,203 --> 01:55:17,329
Dan?

1330
01:55:17,954 --> 01:55:19,081
For silver?

1331
01:55:23,919 --> 01:55:25,796
You were right.

1332
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:28,048
There is no justice.

1333
01:55:29,007 --> 01:55:31,426
Cole controls everything.

1334
01:55:32,094 --> 01:55:35,347
The rail road, the Cavalry,

1335
01:55:36,431 --> 01:55:37,766
everything.

1336
01:55:40,644 --> 01:55:43,313
If men like him represent the law,

1337
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:45,649
I'd rather be an outlaw.

1338
01:55:48,819 --> 01:55:50,487
That is why

1339
01:55:51,613 --> 01:55:53,406
you wear the mask.

1340
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:15,095
Something very wrong with that horse.

1341
01:56:26,106 --> 01:56:27,774
Ladies and gentlemen,

1342
01:56:27,941 --> 01:56:30,485
we are here today to celebrate a dream.

1343
01:56:31,111 --> 01:56:33,280
And now I'd like to introduce the man

1344
01:56:33,446 --> 01:56:35,240
who made that dream a reality.

1345
01:56:35,407 --> 01:56:37,033
Chairman of the Transcontinental

1346
01:56:37,117 --> 01:56:39,077
Railroad Corporation,

1347
01:56:39,161 --> 01:56:40,537
Mr Lewis Habberman the Third.

1348
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,913
Thank you!

1349
01:56:42,247 --> 01:56:45,250
But I cannot take credit alone.

1350
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:46,585
No, sir.

1351
01:56:46,751 --> 01:56:50,630
The working men before you
deserve your applause!

1352
01:56:50,755 --> 01:56:52,174
Yes!

1353
01:56:52,924 --> 01:56:56,428
As does one man in particular,

1354
01:56:56,511 --> 01:57:00,515
and a more dedicated, loyal employee

1355
01:57:00,599 --> 01:57:02,893
the rail road could not ask for,

1356
01:57:02,976 --> 01:57:04,352
Mr Latham Cole!

1357
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:08,940
- Come on.
- Good man.

1358
01:57:09,524 --> 01:57:10,525
Bravo, sir.

1359
01:57:11,192 --> 01:57:12,611
Mr Cole!

1360
01:57:13,445 --> 01:57:16,448
A testament of our thanks.

1361
01:57:21,494 --> 01:57:22,621
Cheers!

1362
01:58:01,493 --> 01:58:03,203
You missed something.

1363
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:04,996
Where did you get the explosives?

1364
01:58:06,164 --> 01:58:07,832
I told you.

1365
01:58:08,458 --> 01:58:09,501
No, you didn't.

1366
01:58:11,544 --> 01:58:15,173
But you had a plan. I mean,
he didn't get away with it?

1367
01:58:15,507 --> 01:58:17,175
We had plan.

1368
01:58:20,136 --> 01:58:22,180
It was good plan.

1369
01:58:26,518 --> 01:58:27,894
This is a damn bank robbery!

1370
01:58:40,407 --> 01:58:42,158
Oh, Mr Habberman,

1371
01:58:42,242 --> 01:58:43,368
if you and the other shareholders

1372
01:58:43,493 --> 01:58:44,452
would like to follow me,

1373
01:58:44,536 --> 01:58:45,912
I have a little surprise for you.

1374
01:58:46,037 --> 01:58:47,163
Ah!

1375
01:58:51,751 --> 01:58:52,877
Oh, my.

1376
01:58:55,505 --> 01:58:56,923
What was that?

1377
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:00,343
Tunnelling for supply routes.
Nothing to be concerned about.

1378
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:02,053
This way, gentlemen.

1379
01:59:05,015 --> 01:59:06,558
Bring the girl.

1380
01:59:16,276 --> 01:59:17,569
He's coming for you.

1381
01:59:17,902 --> 01:59:19,738
Just like Frank said.

1382
01:59:20,572 --> 01:59:22,198
What you got makes them Reid boys

1383
01:59:22,282 --> 01:59:24,075
so hot under the collar, anyway?

1384
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:28,246
Maybe I'll have a taste and find out.

1385
01:59:28,413 --> 01:59:30,290
The men around this table represent

1386
01:59:30,415 --> 01:59:32,375
the finest families in our country

1387
01:59:32,459 --> 01:59:33,918
as well as controlling interest

1388
01:59:34,044 --> 01:59:36,296
in the Transcontinental
Railway Corporation.

1389
01:59:36,463 --> 01:59:38,089
Hear, hear!

1390
01:59:38,256 --> 01:59:39,340
What you cannot know

1391
01:59:39,424 --> 01:59:40,759
is that over the past six months,

1392
01:59:40,842 --> 01:59:42,260
I have leveraged a position

1393
01:59:42,385 --> 01:59:44,596
which will make me
the majority shareholder

1394
01:59:44,679 --> 01:59:47,599
when this company is
listed Monday morning

1395
01:59:47,724 --> 01:59:50,268
on the New York City Stock Exchange.

1396
01:59:50,435 --> 01:59:53,521
In essence, gentlemen, you work for me.

1397
01:59:53,605 --> 01:59:55,523
Have you lost your mind?

1398
01:59:55,607 --> 01:59:56,858
Do you have any idea the cost?

1399
01:59:57,192 --> 01:59:59,194
Each one of those freight cars contains

1400
01:59:59,277 --> 02:00:01,363
4.5 tons of purest raw silver.

1401
02:00:01,446 --> 02:00:03,448
When it reaches the bank
in San Francisco,

1402
02:00:03,531 --> 02:00:05,450
that's 65 million dollars.

1403
02:00:05,617 --> 02:00:07,786
It's what you might call
a hostile takeover.

1404
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:10,538
You can keep the watch.

1405
02:00:16,836 --> 02:00:18,963
Have you checked the undercarriage?

1406
02:00:19,839 --> 02:00:21,800
- Check it again.
- Yes, sir.

1407
02:00:26,554 --> 02:00:28,431
Pleasure to see you, Red!

1408
02:00:33,645 --> 02:00:34,687
Oh!

1409
02:00:34,771 --> 02:00:37,315
May I be of some
assistance to you, madam?

1410
02:00:37,482 --> 02:00:39,901
Seems I have a run in my stocking.

1411
02:00:41,653 --> 02:00:43,363
Ivory.

1412
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:53,623
Hurry up with them grapes.

1413
02:00:54,999 --> 02:00:56,042
Shh!

1414
02:00:58,878 --> 02:01:00,547
Make trade.

1415
02:01:05,885 --> 02:01:07,011
Hey, boy!

1416
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:10,390
Boy, I'm talking to you!

1417
02:01:13,768 --> 02:01:15,520
Hey! You can't leave that here!

1418
02:01:15,687 --> 02:01:19,023
Mr Cole's pickles. Take it up with him.

1419
02:01:19,190 --> 02:01:21,192
This is an outrage!

1420
02:01:21,359 --> 02:01:23,611
I, for one, am not gonna sit here

1421
02:01:23,695 --> 02:01:25,864
and negotiate with one of my employees.

1422
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:28,032
Then, let's get down to it, shall we?

1423
02:01:33,705 --> 02:01:34,664
My gluteus!

1424
02:01:34,747 --> 02:01:36,958
Gentlemen, our chairman
has had to take

1425
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:39,085
a sudden leave of absence.

1426
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:40,879
Any nominations?

1427
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:47,594
I nominate Mr Latham Cole.

1428
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,970
I accept

1429
02:02:01,774 --> 02:02:02,942
It's magnificent.

1430
02:02:04,027 --> 02:02:05,069
So clean.

1431
02:02:05,236 --> 02:02:06,571
You want to touch it?

1432
02:02:07,572 --> 02:02:08,698
Oh, yes.

1433
02:02:12,452 --> 02:02:13,912
Attention!

1434
02:02:14,204 --> 02:02:15,246
About face!

1435
02:02:16,414 --> 02:02:18,374
Everyone wants to touch it.

1436
02:02:25,673 --> 02:02:27,675
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1437
02:02:27,759 --> 02:02:28,760
Robbery.

1438
02:02:28,927 --> 02:02:30,720
We don't have no money here, boy.

1439
02:02:33,264 --> 02:02:34,933
Train robbery.

1440
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:36,559
A little higher.

1441
02:02:36,726 --> 02:02:38,394
How high does it go?

1442
02:02:38,561 --> 02:02:39,771
Almost there.

1443
02:02:40,563 --> 02:02:45,151
...land of the free

1444
02:02:45,944 --> 02:02:52,367
and the home of the brave

1445
02:03:01,876 --> 02:03:02,877
Um...

1446
02:03:02,961 --> 02:03:04,462
Mr Cole?

1447
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,965
They're stealing my train.

1448
02:03:07,799 --> 02:03:09,592
Get the horses!

1449
02:03:09,759 --> 02:03:10,969
Right

1450
02:03:12,804 --> 02:03:13,805
there!

1451
02:03:23,648 --> 02:03:25,483
What are you waiting for? To the engine!

1452
02:03:27,235 --> 02:03:29,237
Stop that train!

1453
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:36,828
Shoot him, you idiot.

1454
02:03:37,328 --> 02:03:38,746
- No, Danny's in there!
- That's an order!

1455
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:39,831
Mama!

1456
02:03:46,838 --> 02:03:48,172
I've been shot!

1457
02:03:48,673 --> 02:03:50,341
There he is, men!

1458
02:04:08,776 --> 02:04:10,278
John!

1459
02:04:17,785 --> 02:04:18,953
John!

1460
02:04:32,884 --> 02:04:34,052
Come on!

1461
02:05:00,703 --> 02:05:02,372
Get me close!

1462
02:06:04,767 --> 02:06:07,061
The Ranger! He's on the roof!

1463
02:06:10,273 --> 02:06:13,317
How many times
do I have to tell you to kill that Ranger?

1464
02:06:13,985 --> 02:06:15,611
I told you he'd come.

1465
02:06:37,842 --> 02:06:39,677
Adios, Counsellor!

1466
02:06:41,512 --> 02:06:42,597
John!

1467
02:07:12,543 --> 02:07:14,670
Dance, monkey! Dance!

1468
02:07:15,338 --> 02:07:16,672
Oh! Ooh!

1469
02:07:24,805 --> 02:07:25,848
Danny!

1470
02:08:24,699 --> 02:08:26,284
Butch Cavendish!

1471
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:30,037
Let her go!

1472
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:31,747
If you insist.

1473
02:08:35,293 --> 02:08:36,294
Go ahead.

1474
02:08:37,587 --> 02:08:38,588
John?

1475
02:08:39,297 --> 02:08:40,965
She tends to land on her feet.

1476
02:08:41,299 --> 02:08:42,383
John!

1477
02:08:43,801 --> 02:08:44,969
Oh!

1478
02:08:48,264 --> 02:08:49,599
What you gonna do, Counsellor?

1479
02:08:50,433 --> 02:08:52,143
Shoot me?

1480
02:08:54,061 --> 02:08:55,062
That's right.

1481
02:09:00,484 --> 02:09:02,820
Guess I cut out
the wrong brother's heart.

1482
02:09:06,741 --> 02:09:09,660
Don't tell me.
You boxed in law school.

1483
02:09:12,663 --> 02:09:13,831
What the hell?

1484
02:09:17,084 --> 02:09:18,961
As a matter of fact, I did.

1485
02:10:07,718 --> 02:10:08,719
Where is girl?

1486
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:11,138
What? Where's the silver?

1487
02:10:13,808 --> 02:10:15,476
What are you...

1488
02:10:40,167 --> 02:10:41,752
End of the line.

1489
02:10:43,713 --> 02:10:45,673
We've been here before, haven't we?

1490
02:10:46,257 --> 02:10:47,675
Easy.

1491
02:10:55,391 --> 02:10:57,768
Where did you say
that train was headed?

1492
02:10:57,935 --> 02:10:59,603
The future?

1493
02:11:02,732 --> 02:11:06,068
Well, this here train,
she going straight to hell.

1494
02:11:16,912 --> 02:11:19,040
You know something, Butch?
I believe you're right.

1495
02:11:22,376 --> 02:11:23,461
Enjoy the ride!

1496
02:11:32,428 --> 02:11:33,471
Huh?

1497
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:50,780
Hey!

1498
02:11:53,282 --> 02:11:54,325
Wrong brother?

1499
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:55,993
Not today.

1500
02:12:27,233 --> 02:12:28,526
Time's up, Indian.

1501
02:12:30,861 --> 02:12:31,904
Uncle John!

1502
02:12:47,211 --> 02:12:50,339
Pretty soon, no one will even know
you people were here.

1503
02:12:50,714 --> 02:12:52,883
I'm a Spirit Walker.

1504
02:12:54,176 --> 02:12:55,719
I can't miss.

1505
02:13:08,732 --> 02:13:09,775
All these years,

1506
02:13:09,942 --> 02:13:12,695
I think you are windigo.

1507
02:13:13,195 --> 02:13:14,196
But, no.

1508
02:13:16,574 --> 02:13:18,617
You are just another white man.

1509
02:13:20,077 --> 02:13:21,245
Who are you?

1510
02:13:24,748 --> 02:13:26,041
Bad trade.

1511
02:13:38,137 --> 02:13:39,722
You let him get away?

1512
02:13:40,931 --> 02:13:42,057
No.

1513
02:13:44,602 --> 02:13:46,437
The bridge.

1514
02:13:48,105 --> 02:13:49,773
What bridge?

1515
02:13:59,658 --> 02:14:01,076
Oh, my.

1516
02:14:02,786 --> 02:14:04,455
"Bad trade."

1517
02:15:08,686 --> 02:15:10,980
Ladies and gentlemen,

1518
02:15:11,146 --> 02:15:14,358
as Chairman of the
Transcontinental Railroad,

1519
02:15:14,525 --> 02:15:16,694
I'd like to express our gratitude

1520
02:15:16,819 --> 02:15:19,196
to this masked man,

1521
02:15:19,363 --> 02:15:23,075
this Lone Ranger.

1522
02:15:23,242 --> 02:15:24,702
Hear, hear.

1523
02:15:25,869 --> 02:15:27,204
Come on, come on.

1524
02:15:28,664 --> 02:15:32,209
A small token of our thanks.

1525
02:15:36,505 --> 02:15:38,298
There will be plenty more
where that came from.

1526
02:15:40,634 --> 02:15:44,555
Always nice to have a lawman
on the side of progress.

1527
02:15:49,476 --> 02:15:51,812
Time to take off the mask, son.

1528
02:16:00,821 --> 02:16:01,905
Not yet.

1529
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:25,721
I can't stay.

1530
02:16:27,681 --> 02:16:28,932
I know.

1531
02:16:31,185 --> 02:16:33,187
But if that badge
ever starts to weigh on you,

1532
02:16:35,522 --> 02:16:38,859
well, you know where to find us.

1533
02:16:39,401 --> 02:16:41,236
Train's headed west.

1534
02:16:42,112 --> 02:16:44,114
There's nothing
holding you here any more.

1535
02:16:45,616 --> 02:16:47,743
It's my home.

1536
02:16:54,708 --> 02:16:57,127
You're not a boy
any more, Danny.

1537
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:00,964
Your daddy would be proud.

1538
02:17:02,466 --> 02:17:04,426
You take care of your mama.

1539
02:17:40,295 --> 02:17:42,339
I thought I'd call him Silver.

1540
02:17:43,715 --> 02:17:44,925
Silver?

1541
02:17:45,968 --> 02:17:47,761
It is a good name.

1542
02:17:49,805 --> 02:17:51,181
You know, it isn't really a trade

1543
02:17:51,265 --> 02:17:53,392
unless both parties agree.

1544
02:17:53,559 --> 02:17:56,645
Who would really trade
a watch for some bird seed?

1545
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:02,484
Bird cannot tell time, kemosabe.

1546
02:18:06,363 --> 02:18:08,282
"Kemosabe." Yeah, about that.

1547
02:18:08,449 --> 02:18:10,075
Look, I was thinking,
if we're gonna be outlaws,

1548
02:18:10,242 --> 02:18:11,702
I'm gonna need a better name.

1549
02:18:11,869 --> 02:18:14,997
I was thinking, "The Mask of Justice."

1550
02:18:15,164 --> 02:18:16,373
No.

1551
02:18:16,832 --> 02:18:18,417
What about,
"The Lone Rider of..."

1552
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:19,501
No.

1553
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:22,045
Do you know
what "Tonto" means in Spanish?

1554
02:18:41,064 --> 02:18:43,066
I guess I should be heading home.

1555
02:18:44,401 --> 02:18:45,652
Home.

1556
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:51,575
It was nice to meet you, Mr Tonto.

1557
02:19:00,834 --> 02:19:03,170
So, the windigo.

1558
02:19:03,337 --> 02:19:05,005
Nature out of balance.

1559
02:19:05,172 --> 02:19:06,924
The masked man.

1560
02:19:08,258 --> 02:19:10,594
It's just a story, right?

1561
02:19:11,595 --> 02:19:14,097
I mean,
I know he's not real.

1562
02:19:15,015 --> 02:19:16,767
Was he?

1563
02:19:17,434 --> 02:19:20,604
Up to you, kemosabe.

1564
02:20:00,811 --> 02:20:03,313
Never take off the mask.

1565
02:20:05,524 --> 02:20:09,111
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

1566
02:20:12,656 --> 02:20:14,950
Don't ever do that again.
