1
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:15,319
Many strange tales
are told of this jungle.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,189
But none so strange as the
tale of the cub we call Mowgli.

3
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,975
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

4
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:38,726
Yeah, but if the branch
didn't break, I would've made it.

5
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:43,606
Crossing upwind, breaking from your numbers.
If you can't learn to run with the pack...

6
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,673
One of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.

7
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,035
How'd we do?

8
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,204
Got Mowgli again!

9
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,292
- He's never gonna make the council.
- Let's go!

10
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:53,406
It was higher ground.

11
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:55,992
Wolves don't hide in trees.

12
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,564
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

13
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,788
It was a dead tree.

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,249
How was I supposed
to know it was dead?

15
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,627
It had a fig vine. Any
tree girdled by a creeper...

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,589
Is either dead or close to it.
These are things a wolf must know.

17
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,509
Yeah, but if the branch
didn't break, I would've made it.

18
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,720
I realize you weren't
born a wolf, but...

19
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,097
Couldn't you at least act like one?

20
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:27,729
When I found him,
many years ago...

21
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:31,483
He was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.

22
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,889
Get the deer!

23
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,323
If he was going to survive,
I knew he needed a people.

24
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:41,617
A people to protect him.

25
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,745
It's why I entrusted
him to the wolves.

26
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:57,298
Akela, was a just and noble leader,
he allowed Mowgli to dwell among them.

27
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,258
All those years.

28
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:06,140
But, trouble was, wolves
grew so fast and Mowgli, well...

29
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,309
Let's just say he
liked to take his time.

30
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:12,187
- Mowgli, take me up high!
- Stop, not now.

31
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:17,442
It was Raksha who raised him.
She was the only mother he ever knew.

32
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,403
- Come on, let's play.
- I don't feel like playing, Gray.

33
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:22,947
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

34
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,490
Let's go chase some mice!

35
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,744
How did it go?

36
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,954
Caught me again.

37
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:34,916
If it's meant
to be, it will be.

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,285
Let me hear the law.

39
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:40,809
This is the law of the jungle.

40
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,280
As old and as true as the sky.

41
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,985
The wolf that keeps it will prosper...

42
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:48,650
The wolf that breaks it will die.

43
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:51,477
Like the creeper that
girdles the tree trunk...

44
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:53,752
The law runneth over and back.

45
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:56,477
For the strength of
the pack is the wolf...

46
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,581
And the strength of
the wolf is the pack.

47
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,135
Soon, the rains ceased to
fall and the dry season arrived.

48
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,892
Heat crept through the jungle.

49
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:44,146
Turning it yellow,
then brown, then black.

50
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,975
But that year was the driest
season that anyone can remember.

51
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,732
Even the moab didn't flower.

52
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:00,619
My leaf.

53
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,456
This is mine, mine, mine.
There's some other...

54
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,626
There's a rock. That's mud.
That's just mud. There's a rock!

55
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,136
That's my rock. That's my rock. Nobody touches my
rock. There's another rock. Two rocks. Three rocks.

56
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:15,717
Peace rock!
Peace rock!

57
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:19,011
It's the truce, the water truce!

58
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:21,219
It's the water truce!

59
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,185
It had been many, many years
since the peace rock was revealed...

60
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,729
And the water truce was called.

61
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,572
Hunting in the riverbank was now forbidden...

62
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:43,492
Because, by law of the jungle,
drinking comes before eating.

63
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:47,120
So you could come to the
peace rock, on a day like this...

64
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,581
And find all people. Side by side.

65
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:03,135
- Don't forget.
- No hunting.

66
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,138
- Playing only.
- Playing only. I got it, amma.

67
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:10,713
And remember, not everyone here has
seen a man cub in the jungle before.

68
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,449
So behave yourself.

69
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:14,247
Ok, ok. Can I go now?

70
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,480
Take the pups with you.

71
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,316
- Wait for me!
- Come on Gray!

72
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:22,153
Take a look at this guy.

73
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,321
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

74
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,000
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

75
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,121
Everybody's here.

76
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:34,914
Is that a peacock?

77
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:40,044
- Ooh, a stick!
- No, that's my stick.

78
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:48,480
Sorry. My bad. It's involuntary.

79
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,607
I could pee on it.

80
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:51,722
Watch yourself please.

81
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,431
Dad, what is that?

82
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,350
Think that's a man cub.

83
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,727
What's a man cub doing here?

84
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:02,314
- Woah, don't forget the truce.
- I know the law, bucks.

85
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:11,990
What is that?

86
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,628
- Weird.
- That's weird.

87
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:29,464
Mowgli.

88
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,094
What was the rule about your tricks?

89
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:38,181
It's not the wolf way.

90
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:39,849
No more tricks.

91
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:45,979
Chin up little one. We'll
make you a fine wolf yet.

92
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:50,775
What about me? Am I gonna be
a fine wolf? Look at me howl.

93
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,364
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

94
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,506
Mowgli, behind me.

95
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:19,969
Don't leave my side.

96
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:09,347
Everyone comes to peace rock,
so many smells to catch up on.

97
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:25,863
I can't help but notice
there's this strange odor today.

98
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:31,284
What is it? This scent that I'm on.

99
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:40,001
I almost... almost think
it was some kind of man cub.

100
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,380
Mowgli belongs to my pack, Shere Khan.

101
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,801
Mowgli? They've given it a name.

102
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:55,181
When was it we came to
adopt man into the jungle?

103
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,808
He's just a cub.

104
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:01,729
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

105
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:09,861
Shift your hunting ground for a few
years and everyone forgets how the law works.

106
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,782
Well, let me remind you.
A man cub becomes man.

107
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,660
And man is forbidden!

108
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,214
- What do you know about law?
- Raksha.

109
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,198
Hunting for pleasure,
killing for power.

110
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,293
You've never known law.

111
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:31,464
The cub is mine. Mine to me. So go back
to where you came from, you burned beast!

112
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,637
The tiger knows who rules this part of the jungle.

113
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm sure he doesn't mean to
come here and make threats.

114
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,435
Especially during a water truce.

115
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:57,071
Know I'm deeply respectful of
these laws that keep us safe.

116
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:02,368
So here's my promise.
Nothing lasts forever.

117
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:08,957
The rains will return and the river
will rise. And when this rock disappears...

118
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,750
That truce will end.

119
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,673
You want to protect him?
Fine. But ask yourselves:

120
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:21,469
How many lives is a man cub worth?

121
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,525
How many lives?

122
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,112
Who could answer that question?

123
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,350
- The rain!
- Rain!

124
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,000
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.
These quills get stuck on everything!

125
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,986
When the rains returned...

126
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,614
there was a question
the council had to face.

127
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,682
They deliberated and they argued.

128
00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,350
For many days.

129
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:07,107
What do you think
they're talking about?

130
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,028
No one had ever come
between the pack before.

131
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:17,533
But Shere Khan's threat
was not to be ignored.

132
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,502
Mowgli, you're not
supposed to go up there!

133
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,518
Please!

134
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:49,604
I am leaving.

135
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:54,317
I don't wanna see anyone get hurt.

136
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,569
Mowgli, go back to the den!

137
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,661
A man cub belongs with man.

138
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,532
- We raised him as one of our own.
- He'll have the boy either way.

139
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:02,992
Akela.

140
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,995
Maybe I can be of help.

141
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:11,124
The boy's right. Maybe it's
time he found another people.

142
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,626
- No.
- I am the one who brought him to you...

143
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:16,004
And now I'll return
him to where he belongs.

144
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,548
I won't let you.
He's my cub!

145
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,299
We knew this day would come.

146
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,968
We are the only
family he's ever known.

147
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:27,973
Raksha, it's the only
place he'll be safe.

148
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,105
It's okay, ammi. I won't go far.

149
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,316
I'll come back and visit.

150
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,528
Never forget this.

151
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:47,199
You're mine. Mine to me.

152
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,328
No matter where you go
or what they may call you...

153
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:54,289
You will always be my son.

154
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:36,744
I wish I could tell you that the
wolves could've fought Shere Khan.

155
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,539
But this is not that kind of a tale.

156
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,251
The turtles like me.

157
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,420
Maybe the crocodiles.

158
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,382
What about the rhinos?
They always let me hang around.

159
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,679
Of course, the
rhinos sleep standing up.

160
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:57,430
I don't think I'd
be very good at that.

161
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,932
It's either the
turtles or the crocodiles.

162
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,684
Which one do you think is better?

163
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:02,935
Neither.

164
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,436
What do you mean?

165
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,897
I'm bringing you to the man village.

166
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:10,025
What?

167
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,277
Bagheera, I don't know man.

168
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:13,778
You will.

169
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:19,408
You always said we're not
supposed to go near a man village.

170
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:20,910
That was different.

171
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:25,456
Why is it different? You always
said stay away from the man village...

172
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:29,835
Because you might fall in a trap or
get eaten or get hurt by flying rocks.

173
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,211
I know what I said.

174
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,468
Elephants.

175
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,595
- Bow your head.
- Why?

176
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,973
Show them respect.

177
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,142
The elephants created this jungle.

178
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,896
Where they've made furrows
with their tusks, the rivers ran.

179
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,857
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

180
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:58,653
They made all that belongs. The
mountains. The trees. The birds in the tree.

181
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,866
But they didn't make you.
That is why you must go.

182
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,811
- What if I live with the nilgai?
- No.

183
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:36,646
Or the mongoose?

184
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,439
This is not a discussion.

185
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,358
But this is my home. I
don't even know what man's like.

186
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:42,735
You'll learn.

187
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,863
But I wanna stay in the
jungle. Why do I have to go there?

188
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:50,492
Because the jungle is no longer safe
for you. You're being hunted by a tiger.

189
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:53,161
Only man can protect you now.

190
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,957
This isn't fair. You're
not giving me a choice.

191
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:01,419
There's a lot of stuff you're not
telling me too. Don't think I didn't notice.

192
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,391
You say you're taking
me where I came from...

193
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:04,797
But you found me in the jungle.

194
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,341
Are you bringing me
back to the jungle? No.

195
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,594
Why are you bringing me to the man
village if you found me in the jungle?

196
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,554
And why does that
tiger hate me so much?

197
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:15,157
Does he know me? Sure
seems like he knows me.

198
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,261
Down.

199
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,340
What? Now we have to
bow to the buffalo too?

200
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:23,397
Listen to me. This is not a game.
You're gonna run to that ravine.

201
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:25,649
What are you talking about?

202
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:29,101
Go to the North where the sky glows
at night. I'll find you on that path.

203
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,321
Bagheera, I'm not taking one more step -

204
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,972
Run, Mowgli!

205
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,309
Run!

206
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,814
Gray, what's wrong? Why
don't you come outside and play?

207
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,858
What is that?

208
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,989
Why did he have to leave?

209
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,323
Gray.

210
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,910
We could have protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

211
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:58,623
I miss him too. What's
important is he's safe now.

212
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Get inside.

213
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:56,384
I suppose you know why I've come.

214
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,430
The man cub has left the jungle.

215
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,938
I thought I made myself clear,
I wanted him turned over to me.

216
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:12,816
We no longer harbor him.

217
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,693
He has left the pack.

218
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,488
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

219
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,161
He is with his own kind now.

220
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,665
So the man cub has left the jungle.

221
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,834
That's right.

222
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:35,586
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

223
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:39,131
And, most importantly, we have peace.

224
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:47,681
Well, I guess it's done then.

225
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:52,493
Unless I can draw him back out!

226
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:54,489
Akela!

227
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,525
Have I got your attention now?

228
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:04,405
I didn't want it to be
this way. I made it so simple.

229
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,950
All I asked for was one
thing and you denied me.

230
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:13,204
Well, that ends
now. Spread the word.

231
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:17,750
Until I have the man cub,
these hills are my hills.

232
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:20,346
You did not respond to reason.

233
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,852
So now you will know fear.

234
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,309
Bagheera.

235
00:27:58,438 --> 00:27:59,534
Hey there!

236
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:05,060
Do you have a language?

237
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:10,555
You're kinda cute, I guess.

238
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:13,906
You wanna bite?

239
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,261
Come on. Come here.

240
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,459
Come on. It's all right.

241
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:21,756
Don't be afraid.

242
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:32,015
Come on.

243
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,966
Hey, those are mine!

244
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:40,353
Hey, come back!

245
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,145
Hey, those are mine!

246
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:47,963
Drop it!

247
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:05,783
Hello?

248
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,554
Who's out there?

249
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:27,092
Hi, little cub.

250
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,222
Oh no, don't be scared.

251
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,162
I'm not gonna hurt you.

252
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,260
I was just passing through.

253
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,256
I don't want any trouble.

254
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:41,189
There's no trouble.

255
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:44,378
Are you alone out here?

256
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,207
That's not good.

257
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,857
We should never be alone.

258
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,490
I'm waiting for a friend.

259
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,587
He should be here soon.

260
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:58,561
I can stay with you,
until he gets here.

261
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,446
Would that be all right?

262
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:06,576
I'll keep you safe.

263
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:11,095
Just you and
me. Sweet thing.

264
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:15,346
Who are you?

265
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:21,702
Kaa.

266
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:28,640
Poor, sweet little cub.

267
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:32,134
What are you doing
so deep in the jungle?

268
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:35,838
This is my home.

269
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:38,422
Don't you know what you are?

270
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,394
I know what you are.

271
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,887
I know where you came from.

272
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,643
You do?

273
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,271
Yesss.

274
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,821
Would you like to see?

275
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah.

276
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:11,048
Mostly, men stay in their village.

277
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,396
Far from the dark of the jungle.

278
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,152
But sometimes, they travel.

279
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:18,867
And when they do...

280
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,439
Their caves breathe in the dark.

281
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:23,997
They call it...

282
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,928
The red flower.

283
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:38,913
Man's creation.

284
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,971
It brings warmth and light.

285
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,593
And destruction to
all that it touches.

286
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:50,873
Who is that?

287
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,259
The traveler, protecting his cub.

288
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:20,544
Shere Khan ended the
man's life that night.

289
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,194
But not before he was burned...

290
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,594
by the red flower's touch.

291
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:28,835
He ran so fast...

292
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,779
He didn't notice
the cub he left behind.

293
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,837
And that cub... was you.

294
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,461
The panther found you.

295
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:25,974
Oh, you poor sweet thing.

296
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:30,353
You want to stay in the jungle?

297
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:40,488
You can be with me if you
want. I'll keep you close.

298
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:44,700
Let go of your fear now.

299
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:50,997
Trussst in me.

300
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,569
Relax, kid. No need
to get worked up, ok?

301
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:25,237
Where am I?

302
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:29,116
Uh, This is a
cave. It's my cave.

303
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,619
You don't remember
what happened, do you?

304
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:35,455
- No.
- I saved your life.

305
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,167
Yeah, I- I snatched you from the jaws of
death. The coils of death, if you will.

306
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:43,242
And lucky for you,
your new favorite hero...

307
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,956
Old Baloo here, just
happened to be passing by.

308
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,801
Uh, No big deal.
Just tell me this.

309
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,271
Can you...

310
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:57,488
- Climb?
- Yeah.

311
00:34:58,017 --> 00:35:00,811
Then let's quit wasting
time and get on with it.

312
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:02,611
Get on with what?

313
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:05,075
Payback, kid. Payback.

314
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:07,526
What do you mean,
payback? Payback for what?

315
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:13,796
You owe me, kid. You
owe me. You owe me.

316
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:14,586
Slow down!

317
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,826
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But...

318
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,619
'Cause that's right. That's the
right- You're gonna do the right thing.

319
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,498
That's the right thing to do here. Pay
me back. 'Cause you owe me. You got it?

320
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,991
Ok, here's our little task. You see
that golden stuff drippin' down there?

321
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,553
That's called honey.

322
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:44,518
All you need to do, little one, for payback
purposes, is to just shimmy on up there...

323
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,670
And get me that thing up there that's
making that funny noise and bring it down here.

324
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:51,900
You're kidding me, right?

325
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,277
No, not really.

326
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,905
- I can get killed going up there.
- Kid.

327
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,997
Kid, kid, kid...

328
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:04,703
Try to understand this. I'm a
bear. It means that I have to eat my...

329
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:11,281
Weight every day, for hibernation
purposes. I- I know I'm asking for a lot...

330
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,837
But I don't climb and you do.

331
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:15,634
Look, I really need your help.

332
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,199
Winter's coming. You
don't want me to go to sleep...

333
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,413
And never wake up.

334
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:51,038
- A lot of bees up here.
- Yeah, some. But don't worry...

335
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:52,177
These ones don't sting.

336
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:01,227
Thataboy!

337
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,437
Ow! I'm getting stung!

338
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,194
Ok, I would've done this
myself but I'm afraid of heights.

339
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:14,567
- Oh boy, here we go again.
- Why don'tcha mind your own business?

340
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,468
- You can do it!
- He's just gonna run away.

341
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:18,251
Not this one.

342
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:20,107
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.

343
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:21,457
- He's not a monkey.
- What is he?

344
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:23,210
- A man cub.
- A man cub?

345
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:28,105
Yeah, and could ya keep your voice down? I'm
trying to concentrate. Everything going A-OK up there?

346
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:29,387
Ow!

347
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:31,989
- Oh boy. Looks like he got another one.
- Buzz off.

348
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,131
It's a man cub.

349
00:38:33,214 --> 00:38:35,054
- A man cub?
- Yeah, it's a man cub.

350
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,552
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's not. It's a man cub.

351
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,553
You have never been a
more endangered species...

352
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,130
Than you are at this moment.

353
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:44,415
You're doing an amazing job!

354
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:46,143
I'm getting stung!

355
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:49,917
- Oh boy, here we go again.
- It's not a monkey, Fred. It's a man cub.

356
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:51,472
- A man cub?
- Yeah, it's a man cub.

357
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:53,018
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

358
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,636
Would you please shut up?!

359
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:58,196
Hey up there, everything
is going fantastically I see.

360
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:04,700
You got it.
Believe in yourself!

361
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,240
There you go!

362
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,939
Come on, almost!

363
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,084
Yeah, yeah!

364
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:21,500
- Oh, yeah!
- Uh-oh.

365
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:42,361
Exfoliate me.

366
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:48,450
You said they didn't
sting. What do you call this?

367
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,035
How the heck did you do that?

368
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:53,399
Oh, those must have been females!

369
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,544
They looked like males from
down here, females do sting.

370
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,461
Just put some, uh, honey on those.

371
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:02,254
Honey? Really?

372
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,048
Yeah. You put it on, you lick
it off. You feel much better.

373
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:08,677
It's nature's ointment.
I put it everywhere.

374
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,058
Thanks. Ok, so we're even now.

375
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:19,895
Hold on a minute. What's your name
anyway? We were never properly introduced.

376
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,231
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli.

377
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,692
Mowgli is a terrific name.

378
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:28,653
I bet you got that one all yourself too.

379
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:36,744
Mowgli, look, I got a lotta gathering to do these
next couple of weeks on account of the hibernation.

380
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,893
I could really use your help.

381
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,791
- You know, if you stuck around...
- I can't. I have to go to the man village.

382
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,089
- Uh, for what reason, man village?
- I don't have a choice. There's a tiger hunting me.

383
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,947
- Really? Why a tiger?
- Because I'm a man cub, alright?

384
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,261
Just leave me alone.

385
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,969
Mowgli, my friend, my buddy, my pal...

386
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:03,586
- Slow down a second, handsome.
- Bagheera said I have to go...

387
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:08,279
- To the man village.
- Oh, Bagheera. I know him, sure.

388
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:13,778
You know what his problem is? He
always plays by the rules. And sometimes...

389
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,907
Rules were meant to be, well, not
necessarily broken, but certainly bent.

390
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,445
And definitely
reinterpreted. Don'tcha think?

391
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,452
Well, he told me to
go to the man village...

392
00:41:21,494 --> 00:41:22,681
So that's where I'm gonna go.

393
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,143
Ok, fine. You wanna go to the
man village, have it your way.

394
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,792
In fact, I'll do ya one
better. I'll take you there myself.

395
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:31,044
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

396
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:38,899
? Bear necessities. ?

397
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:43,109
? Forget about your worries and your strife. ?

398
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:47,375
? I mean, the bear necessities. ?

399
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:50,729
- What's that?
- That's a song about the good life.

400
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,313
What's a song?

401
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:59,987
You never heard a song before? Everyone's
got a song. Didn't the wolves ever sing?

402
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:01,529
I don't know.

403
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:06,118
Oh, we recited the law of the jungle.

404
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:09,006
This is the law of the jungle.

405
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:11,489
As old and as true as the sky.

406
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,572
The wolf that keeps them may prosper.

407
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:15,613
But the wolf that breaks it will die.

408
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:20,589
Kid, that's not a
song. That's propaganda.

409
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:25,929
What's propaganda?

410
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:34,310
Just a little farther.

411
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:46,947
- That's the man village?
- Yep. You can always tell by the red flower.

412
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,737
They do love their red flower.

413
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,004
The red flower doesn't seem so bad.

414
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:58,417
Yeah? Let it loose
and it destroys everything...

415
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:01,511
It touches. Don't ever
play with it, you got that?

416
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:03,504
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

417
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:13,263
- Do you think that's where I'm from?
- Could be.

418
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:18,247
- I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?
- I don't remember it. All I remember...

419
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,354
- Is living with the wolves.
- Why do you wanna go there?

420
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:28,026
- Bagheera said I need a people.
- Oh, again with the listening to Bagheera.

421
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:29,945
Hey, he's my friend, ok?

422
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:32,566
Now I don't even know where he is.

423
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,329
Can't believe I'm
leaving the jungle for good.

424
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:44,875
May I just say one thing? What I saw you
do today, I've never seen anything like it.

425
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,627
I've been trying to get that honey for years.

426
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:50,338
- But I use my tricks.
- What tricks?

427
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:56,177
You know. Everything that I
built. It's not the wolf way.

428
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,555
Who cares? The wolf way.
That's the Mowgli way.

429
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,851
That's the Baloo way, that's our
way. That's how we get things done.

430
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:08,271
I can't even imagine what kind of potential you'd
have if you had somebody like me helping you out.

431
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:21,534
I tell you what. Now you know where the man village
is, you can always go down there whenever you want.

432
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,787
But I would personally appreciate it,
as a personal favor to me personally...

433
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,119
If we just work together. Just us.

434
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,639
Tricks and all.

435
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,887
And I think it would be
interesting to see just how much honey...

436
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:35,959
We could accumulate before winter.

437
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:39,906
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen, I will do.

438
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:46,890
And if- if it turns out to not be fun for you, I will walk
you right down to that man village myself. Is that a deal?

439
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,332
Just 'til winter.

440
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:54,610
Just 'til winter.

441
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:04,573
Ammi, wake up.

442
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:13,720
- Pups?
- They're up there.

443
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:45,594
But the one you have to
watch out for is the cuckoo bird.

444
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:49,550
Do you know how the
cuckoo bird survives?

445
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:53,135
By preying on a mother's weakness.

446
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:57,281
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise it's young. Instead...

447
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:00,958
It sneaks it's eggs into
the nests of simpler birds.

448
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:05,140
So when they hatch,
the mother bird is fooled.

449
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:07,673
She feeds them, nurtures them...

450
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:11,492
And do you know what
happens to her own chicks?

451
00:46:12,177 --> 00:46:15,406
They starve and die...

452
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,880
From neglect. All
because a mother loved a chick

453
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:24,049
That wasn't her own.

454
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:27,556
Come now. Time for sleep.

455
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:46,117
I think they like me.

456
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,461
Why are you doing this?

457
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,390
He's gone. Isn't
that what you wanted?

458
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:57,096
I want him dead.

459
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:05,017
Once he gets word of what
happened here, he'll come back.

460
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:07,769
And I'll be waiting.

461
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,115
- That's the first mark.
- Got it. That's the first mark!

462
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:13,455
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

463
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:22,213
Yeah, I got it! Tell him
to go to the second mark!

464
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:24,005
Got it!

465
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:26,257
Go to the second mark!

466
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:27,717
Got it?

467
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,088
Got it.

468
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:33,244
? Look for the ?

469
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,523
? Bear necessities. The
simple bear necessities. ?

470
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,538
? Forget about your worries and strife. ?

471
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:42,208
? I mean the ?

472
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,357
? Bear necessities. Oh,
mother nature's recipe. ?

473
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,594
? That bring the bear necissities of life. ?

474
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,403
? Wherever I wander. ?

475
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:54,758
? Wherever I roam. ?

476
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:57,067
? I couldn't be fonder ?

477
00:48:57,162 --> 00:48:59,428
? Of my big home. ?

478
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,556
? The bees are buzzing in the trees ?

479
00:49:01,674 --> 00:49:03,996
? To make some honey just for me. ?

480
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:06,793
? When you look under those rocks and plants ?

481
00:49:06,887 --> 00:49:08,873
? And take a glance at them fancy ants. ?

482
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,467
? And then maybe try a few. ?

483
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:16,190
? The bear necessities of
life, they'll come to you. ?

484
00:49:16,402 --> 00:49:18,957
? Wherever I wander. ?

485
00:49:19,065 --> 00:49:21,012
? Wherever I roam. ?

486
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,390
? I couldn't be fonder ?

487
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:25,420
? Of my big home. ?

488
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,913
? The bees are buzzing in the trees ?

489
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,414
? To make some honey just for me. ?

490
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,442
? When you look under the rocks and plants ?

491
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,586
? And then take a glance at them fancy ants. ?

492
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:37,332
? And then maybe try a few. ?

493
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,977
? The bear necessities of
life, they'll come to you. ?

494
00:49:42,907 --> 00:49:44,697
? They will come to you! ?

495
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:47,004
? Yeah, they'll come to you! ?

496
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:48,463
? Come to you. ?

497
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:51,503
Baloo, Baloo,
Baloo. Look.

498
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,382
Stay low on my back.

499
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,849
Come on out and show yourself.

500
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:14,566
Bagheera!

501
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:17,526
Mowgli.

502
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:22,012
Oh, I was looking everywhere
for you. I thought you were gone.

503
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:22,738
Are you alright?

504
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,658
Yeah, I can't believe you found me.

505
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,652
I was so worried about you.

506
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:30,887
I was lost, and I didn't know what happened.
But then I met Baloo. And then he saved me...

507
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:34,359
From a giant snake. And
now we're working together!

508
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:38,487
Really? That's a new wrinkle.
I didn't know soft bears worked.

509
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:40,631
Come on Mowgli, let's be on our way.

510
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:43,299
Wait!

511
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,842
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

512
00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:49,450
Don't be mad, ok?

513
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:50,815
Why would I be mad?

514
00:50:50,899 --> 00:50:52,439
'Cause you're always mad when I do stuff.

515
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:54,638
You gotta promise not to be mad this time.

516
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,687
Show me, then I'll decide.

517
00:50:57,438 --> 00:50:58,439
Come on, check it out!

518
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:07,363
These are vines I use on the cliff. I twirl
them together to make them longer and stronger.

519
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:09,156
See how strong they are?

520
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,327
You wanna see the really cool part?

521
00:51:12,952 --> 00:51:14,495
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

522
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:17,372
Come on!

523
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:30,135
It's the honey stash for winter!

524
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:33,930
Have you lost your mind?!

525
00:51:35,682 --> 00:51:37,058
You said you wouldn't get mad.

526
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:40,137
Did you listen to
anything Akela taught you?

527
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,541
There's no place in
the jungle for these...

528
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:45,858
Tricks. You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

529
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,027
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.

530
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:52,739
Bears don't hibernate in the
jungle. What are you teaching him?

531
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,576
Not full hibernation, but I nap. A lot.

532
00:51:57,076 --> 00:51:59,153
Listen to me, you con artist.

533
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:02,680
He may not know your game,
but I do. He's leaving now.

534
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:04,708
- But I don't wanna leave!
- You don't have a choice!

535
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,063
Why don't we all just settle down
for a minute? Look, it's gotten late...

536
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,048
Too late to travel. So why don't
we all just have a little honey?

537
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,593
- I don't eat honey.
- No problem. I'll eat the honey.

538
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:19,388
Let's all get a good night's sleep and
we can talk about this in the morning?

539
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,599
Fine.

540
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,434
But we're leaving first thing.

541
00:54:40,897 --> 00:54:41,897
Mowgli.

542
00:54:50,777 --> 00:54:51,777
Where is he?

543
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:54,491
- In the pit.
- In the what?

544
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:55,636
Is this your teaching?

545
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:58,409
Oh, come on. You know I'd never
teach him to mess around with elephants.

546
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:54,543
Hey guys.

547
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:06,972
What'd I tell ya? He's special.

548
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:10,517
I know he's special. I raised him.

549
00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:17,231
Then don't make him leave,
Bagheera. You gotta let him be what he is.

550
00:56:18,065 --> 00:56:22,528
- You don't understand. The boy is in danger.
- I know. He told me. He's being hunted...

551
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,202
By a tiger.

552
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,781
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.

553
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:27,407
Shere Khan's hunting him?

554
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:34,233
But if you send him back to the man village,
they'll ruin him. They'll make a man out of him.

555
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:36,638
We should send him back to the wolf pack.

556
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:38,501
Who's their alpha?
Akela? He can protect him.

557
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,753
Akela is dead.

558
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,672
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

559
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:48,406
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy, nothing.

560
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:52,222
The only way we can save him
is if he goes to that man village.

561
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,265
Please, Baloo?

562
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:57,143
You are the only he'll listen to.

563
00:57:25,544 --> 00:57:27,045
- Hey kid.
- Hey.

564
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:30,548
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

565
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:33,624
Bagheera didn't think so.

566
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:36,367
Oh no, I talked to
him. He was very impressed.

567
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:40,500
- He was?
- We both were. Yeah.

568
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:44,500
I- I've never seen anyone get
that close to an elephant before.

569
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,784
So, listen kid, I gotta
talk to you about something.

570
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,363
What do you wanna talk about?

571
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,240
Well, you know, I've been thinking.

572
00:57:57,615 --> 00:58:04,000
Now that your friend has shown up, maybe
it's time for you two to just mosey along.

573
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,270
Ya know, now it's winter and...

574
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:10,710
And it's really time for you to go.

575
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,046
But I wanna stay here with you.

576
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,841
We're buddies, aren't we?

577
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,293
Huh? No. We were never friends. I
certainly never thought of you as my friend.

578
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:27,104
I mean, you helped me get honey and
I don't really need you anymore but...

579
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:32,022
Do I have to spell this out?

580
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:36,567
I don't want you around anymore.

581
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:51,038
Well, I did it.

582
00:58:52,749 --> 00:58:54,500
And that's about the
hardest thing I've ever done.

583
00:58:57,211 --> 00:58:58,211
I know.

584
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:44,671
Go away.

585
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:51,844
Get away from me.

586
00:59:56,307 --> 00:59:57,391
Stop it!

587
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:07,025
Get away from me!

588
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:14,323
Mowgli!

589
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,004
Mowgli! Hold on!

590
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,174
Bagheera!

591
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:38,989
What was that? Where
are they taking him?

592
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,069
This way.

593
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,902
We see you, we see you!

594
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:06,205
Come on, jump!
And watch the claws.

595
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:19,008
Help!

596
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:23,678
Help!

597
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,065
- Uh...
- I'll take it from here.

598
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:17,603
No. I'm- I'm coming.

599
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:22,109
It- It's doable if
I don't have to go too high.

600
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:23,525
Good. Let's get going.

601
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:25,693
Alright.

602
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,228
A bird, that can't be a good sign.

603
01:03:14,342 --> 01:03:18,000
Baloo, look at me.
Look at nothing but me.

604
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:24,373
- You're doing fine. Just keep your eyes up. High.
- Alright. I'm coming, I'm coming.

605
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,001
What part of the jungle you from?

606
01:05:02,296 --> 01:05:06,634
You, man cub. You come from the South or North?

607
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:09,471
What- What part of the- the- the jungle?

608
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:12,194
The South, I guess?

609
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:19,395
Sodom jungle. The Seeonee. Beautiful,
I hear. I- I never been there myself.

610
01:05:20,271 --> 01:05:27,027
So, tell me, you ever had a taste of
the pawpaw fruit down there in the Seeonee?

611
01:05:27,778 --> 01:05:30,908
Some people call it, uh,
what's the word? Papaya.

612
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:33,443
Stolen words. I say pawpaw...

613
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37,128
'Cause of the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the jungle floor.

614
01:05:38,663 --> 01:05:40,164
Try it!

615
01:05:45,377 --> 01:05:47,295
Go ahead.

616
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:56,929
It's good.

617
01:05:58,524 --> 01:05:59,817
You know who I am?

618
01:06:01,285 --> 01:06:01,999
No.

619
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:05,312
I am the king of the Bandar-log.

620
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:09,858
Call me Louie.

621
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:21,744
I did it.

622
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:24,621
Well done, old chap.

623
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,166
He must be in there.

624
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:29,668
Follow me.

625
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:33,113
No, no. We're on level ground here.

626
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:36,007
I'm in charge and I've got a plan.

627
01:06:37,258 --> 01:06:41,345
And you are a man club who
wants to live in the jungle?

628
01:06:42,012 --> 01:06:43,597
How do you know that?

629
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:49,436
Kid, I got ears. My ears got
ears. You wanna live here...

630
01:06:49,936 --> 01:06:52,856
You'll need a
people to protect you.

631
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:57,235
Only I can protect you,
and I will for a price.

632
01:06:57,568 --> 01:07:00,529
I don't have anything to give you.

633
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:04,074
I think you do.

634
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,535
What?

635
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:08,995
Look around, man cub.

636
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:16,544
I got everything. I have plentiful food,
endless treasure, command vast legions.

637
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:22,132
But there's one thing I don't have
and that's the one thing you can give me.

638
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:25,928
The red flower.

639
01:07:27,095 --> 01:07:28,930
I don't have that.

640
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:32,100
You're a man, aren't you?

641
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:38,773
That's what makes you a man. You can
summon your red flower and control it.

642
01:07:39,273 --> 01:07:42,067
They told me not to go near the red flower.

643
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:44,342
You know why they tell you that?

644
01:07:44,354 --> 01:07:46,363
Because once you have it, you rise...

645
01:07:46,738 --> 01:07:54,287
To the top of the food chain. Nothing in
this jungle can stand up to the red flower.

646
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:59,375
Please, I just wanna go.

647
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:05,088
? Now don't try to kid me, man cub. ?

648
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:07,224
? I'll make a deal with you. ?

649
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:11,344
? What I desire is man's red
fire to make my dream come true. ?

650
01:08:12,011 --> 01:08:14,597
? Now gimme the secret, man cub. Come on! ?

651
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:20,478
? Clue me what to do. Give me the power
of man's red flower so I can be like you. ?

652
01:08:22,605 --> 01:08:25,023
? I wanna be like you-oo-oo. ?

653
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:29,611
? I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo ?

654
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:39,500
? You see, it's true-oo-oo. Someone like
me-ee-ee can learn to be like someone like you-oo-oo ?>/i>

655
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:44,708
? Now you might think it's
ridiculous that me, a gigantopithecus ?

656
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:49,212
? Would ever dream, I'd like to
team with the likes of you man cub. ?

657
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,800
? But together, we'd have powers.
All the jungle's treasure, ours. ?

658
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,429
? I got desire. You got the fire.
But the dream I dream takes two. ?

659
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:02,891
? I wanna be like you-oo-oo ?

660
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,604
? I wanna use that flame
just the same as you can do. ?

661
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:10,440
? Oh, how magnificus it would be! ?

662
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:16,654
? A gigantopithecus like me could
learn to do like you humans do-oo-oo ?

663
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:22,618
Just one thing we need
to reach our full potential.

664
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:25,370
Bring me that red flower.

665
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:32,168
And when we rule this jungle, I will protect
you and you will want for nothing ever again.

666
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:33,920
I can't!

667
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,172
You can't or you won't?

668
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,632
I can't!

669
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,508
You will!

670
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,385
Excuse me!

671
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,470
Anybody?

672
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,891
Excuse me. Am I in the right monkey temple?

673
01:09:48,812 --> 01:09:53,021
Oh my gosh, is that King Louie?

674
01:09:53,942 --> 01:09:55,644
This is so exciting.

675
01:09:56,057 --> 01:10:03,033
The legends do you no justice,
sir. You are truly enormous!

676
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:12,198
In the best way, look at all of that flesh
just squatting there on an ancient throne.

677
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,300
How- how- how majestic.

678
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,334
Seize him!

679
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:20,046
Hey, hang on! Can you hang
on? Can you just hang on?

680
01:10:20,588 --> 01:10:25,781
I climbed a mountain to see you, and I'm
not a climber, just to be in your presence.

681
01:10:25,897 --> 01:10:28,000
For me, this is a dream come true.

682
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,764
Throw him off the cliff!

683
01:10:31,181 --> 01:10:36,023
Wait, wait, wait. I
have no problem with that.

684
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:37,623
I don't have any problem with that.

685
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:42,000
I came up here without an
invitation. Extremely presumptious of me.

686
01:10:42,549 --> 01:10:45,474
Let me interrupt myself. I just
gotta say, you guys are so much...

687
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:47,696
Handsomer in person than anyone knows.

688
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:49,528
No one ever gets up close to you.

689
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:54,202
I guess that's why. Because of the
smell. I mean, the smell is- is- is rough.

690
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:58,800
But, it's not just, "Oh, look
at me!" It's, "I got the brains."

691
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:01,542
You guys got the- the
know how. You got the noggin.

692
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:05,917
You came up with this stuff, with the
thumb. Come on, show me. How do you do that?

693
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:09,900
I can't do that. Look. I scratch,
I rub. You know, I can grab a fish.

694
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:14,427
But I was hoping, and you may not be
open to this at all, but I was hoping...

695
01:11:14,487 --> 01:11:20,267
And once again, it's a dream, but I was
hoping that I might become a Bandar-log myself.

696
01:11:20,768 --> 01:11:24,438
Gosh, I wanna be like you. I
am hitching my wagon to your star.

697
01:11:29,105 --> 01:11:30,889
No one leaves!

698
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:33,571
I can show myself
out, thanks! Goodbye!

699
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:52,823
We'll try to hold them off.

700
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:30,054
Where you going man cub?

701
01:12:30,548 --> 01:12:31,548
Stay away from me!

702
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:36,311
You don't have anyone
now. I'm your only hope.

703
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:39,791
I can make it real good for
you here. Where else you gonna go?

704
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:42,885
I'll go back to the pack.
I'll go back to Akela!

705
01:12:43,552 --> 01:12:48,288
Akela? Oh, you didn't hear?

706
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:52,227
Shere Khan killed him.

707
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:56,298
Must have been on account of you.

708
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,358
No, you're lying!

709
01:13:03,674 --> 01:13:05,344
Don't run away...

710
01:13:08,075 --> 01:13:10,702
From who you are, ya hear me?!

711
01:13:37,068 --> 01:13:40,479
Think about it, man cub.

712
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:45,690
We can rule this jungle.

713
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,043
Listen to reason.

714
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:08,255
Gotcha!

715
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:51,787
Mowgli!

716
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:21,155
If anything happens to that
kid, I'll never forgive myself.

717
01:15:21,572 --> 01:15:22,596
Bagheera!

718
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:23,727
Mowgli?

719
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:27,438
Stay there! We'll come around to you!

720
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:30,969
Is it true?!

721
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:32,582
What?

722
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:34,659
Is Akela dead?!

723
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:38,546
We were going to tell you.

724
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:44,468
You knew! You both knew! And
nobody did anything about it!

725
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,470
Kid, just hold on!

726
01:15:47,054 --> 01:15:49,097
Someone's gotta do something!

727
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:51,266
Mowgli!

728
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:12,353
There's no trace of him!
Where could he have gone?

729
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,243
Come on!

730
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:53,183
It's man! He's come to the jungle!

731
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,358
- Ammi, what's happenin'?
- The red flower.

732
01:19:02,608 --> 01:19:05,569
Everybody, get to the river!

733
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:20,499
Red flower, red flower, red flower!

734
01:19:22,006 --> 01:19:23,953
Pups, come on! Stay close!

735
01:19:37,828 --> 01:19:40,976
Is that Mowgli?

736
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,196
Shere Khan!

737
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:49,151
Shere Khan! I'm not afraid of you!

738
01:19:50,107 --> 01:19:52,288
No one has to be afraid of you anymore!

739
01:19:56,841 --> 01:19:57,841
No.

740
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,040
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

741
01:20:20,644 --> 01:20:23,032
The man cub is now a man.

742
01:20:26,411 --> 01:20:28,228
Gray.

743
01:20:31,252 --> 01:20:35,624
Always a proud day
when they come of age.

744
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:42,533
You can fool them,
but you can't fool me.

745
01:20:42,616 --> 01:20:46,078
I'm the one who saw your future.

746
01:20:46,453 --> 01:20:48,843
I saw what you'd become.

747
01:20:54,740 --> 01:21:00,316
Come now. Use the red flower.
Use it on me like your father did!

748
01:21:04,188 --> 01:21:06,863
Show everyone what you really are!

749
01:21:12,528 --> 01:21:16,189
I am Mowgli of the
Seeonee and this is my home!

750
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:24,175
That was the stupidest
thing you could have done.

751
01:21:25,543 --> 01:21:33,543
And now, you have nothing. No
claws, no fur, no teeth. And no friends.

752
01:21:36,622 --> 01:21:41,128
This is the law of the jungle.
As old and as true as the sky.

753
01:21:41,865 --> 01:21:42,611
What is this?

754
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:45,353
The wolf that keeps it may prosper.

755
01:21:45,454 --> 01:21:48,389
- But the wolf that breaks it will die.
- You fools.

756
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:53,249
Like the creeper that girdles the
tree trunk, the law runneth over and back.

757
01:21:53,364 --> 01:21:58,541
Fine. Rise up, all of you! You want to
put yourselves between me and the man cub?

758
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:03,317
- And the strength of the wolf is the pack!
- I'm going to have you all in my teeth!

759
01:22:27,022 --> 01:22:28,046
No!

760
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:30,068
Wolves, attack!

761
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:38,675
- Stay here!
- But I wanna fight with the wolves!

762
01:22:38,711 --> 01:22:40,971
You can't fight him like
a wolf, you're not a wolf.

763
01:22:42,283 --> 01:22:43,860
Fight him like a man.

764
01:22:46,342 --> 01:22:47,385
Now, go!

765
01:22:50,369 --> 01:22:51,651
We'll hold him off.

766
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:41,509
It's time we put an end to this.

767
01:23:42,156 --> 01:23:43,490
No!

768
01:23:58,762 --> 01:24:00,339
Dead tree.

769
01:25:08,595 --> 01:25:10,270
It's just you and me now!

770
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:08,707
Break, break!

771
01:26:58,754 --> 01:27:01,338
You've got nowhere to go, man cub!

772
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:43,293
Did you think I would let you grow old?

773
01:27:51,303 --> 01:27:55,596
Either I'll devour you
or the red flower will.

774
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,599
It's just a matter of time.

775
01:28:02,217 --> 01:28:06,940
How long did you really
think you'd survive against me?

776
01:28:07,441 --> 01:28:10,610
Longer than your father did?

777
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:16,157
Longer than Akela?

778
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:35,633
I'm not afraid of you!

779
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,182
Do you hear me?

780
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:47,644
I'm done running from you.

781
01:30:17,058 --> 01:30:20,813
You stood your ground, old
boy. You stood your gound.

782
01:30:36,093 --> 01:30:37,828
Ammi, ammi!

783
01:30:39,705 --> 01:30:42,041
My son.

784
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,188
- Mowgli!
- It's Mowgli!

785
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,486
Will you look at that.

786
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:37,197
And where they made furrows in the
ground with their tusks, the rivers ran.

787
01:32:05,557 --> 01:32:09,800
In my years, I've seen a lot
in this jungle. But that night...

788
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,291
I saw something I'll never forget.

789
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:22,700
I saw a little boy, without a people, bring
all the jungle together for the very first time.

790
01:32:43,749 --> 01:32:46,405
- Just a few more turns.
- Going high!

791
01:32:46,822 --> 01:32:48,573
Stay low.

792
01:32:52,897 --> 01:32:54,579
He never listens.

793
01:33:03,983 --> 01:33:05,013
Gotcha!

794
01:33:05,172 --> 01:33:07,424
- Come on Mowgli!
- You went through the tree!

795
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:10,135
You guys!

796
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:14,472
Too fast! Anybody ever
teach you how to jog?!

797
01:33:15,098 --> 01:33:17,802
You went high when everyone
else stayed on the trail.

798
01:33:17,924 --> 01:33:18,924
But that's what you do.

799
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:21,911
Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.
Next time, stay together!

800
01:33:21,991 --> 01:33:23,119
Come on guys!

801
01:33:24,085 --> 01:33:28,944
Where the strength of
the pack is the- is the...

802
01:33:29,778 --> 01:33:33,740
- And the strength of the wolf is the pack.
- Mowgli's back!

803
01:33:37,495 --> 01:33:39,769
Hey Mowgli, wait for us!

804
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:42,924
- Hurry up guys.
- Hi Gray.

805
01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:51,089
Look well, wolves.

806
01:33:56,458 --> 01:34:01,307
- This is the law of the jungle...
- As old and as true as the sky.

807
01:34:02,057 --> 01:34:04,949
The wolf that keeps it may prosper...

808
01:34:05,049 --> 01:34:07,408
But the wolf that breaks it will die.

809
01:34:08,188 --> 01:34:10,815
And like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunks

810
01:34:11,483 --> 01:34:14,762
The law runneth over and back.
For the strength of the pack-

811
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:22,451
- It is nice up here.
- Now he can climb.

812
01:34:25,627 --> 01:34:29,457
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

813
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:35,254
Good.

814
01:34:37,988 --> 01:34:39,928
I could get used to this.
