1
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,455
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,314
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:19,549
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:21,185
Stay close.

5
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,262
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:32,963
Get on his back.

7
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,552
Hurry up.

8
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,520
Whoa!

9
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,192
Ow!

10
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,293
Whoa!

11
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,630
There he is.
Go get him.

12
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,200
Oh, you'll pay
for that.

13
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,591
No. No, please.

14
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:10,529
Please, no.

15
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,619
Hold it there.

16
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,069
I only got one...

17
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,805
but he's a fine specimen.

18
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:04,547
- That's all?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,282
That shroom bit me twice.

20
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:07,452
Huh.

21
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,760
Tomb Bloom.

22
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:39,749
<i>Once upon a time...

23
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:42,217
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,

24
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,152
<i>for you may
remember this story...

25
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:48,460
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.

26
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,869
<i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil

27
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,538
<i>and protector of the Moors...

28
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,707
<i>was still hated
after all this time.

29
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,677
<i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...

30
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,779
<i>but that was before
she found light

31
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,681
<i>in the heart
of a human child...

32
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,617
<i>and raised the girl
as her own.

33
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:17,487
<i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love

34
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:20,557
<i>which broke
that very same curse.

35
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:24,827
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.

36
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,129
<i>For as the tale was told

37
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,466
<i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...

38
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:34,472
<i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.

39
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,319
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

40
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,453
It's the big day!

41
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:51,588
- Come on.
- Let's go!

42
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,590
Wake up. Wake up.

43
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,727
Come on.

44
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:10,540
Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!

45
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,623
Do you both remember
the secret plan?

46
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,391
I've got it
all right here.

47
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:29,926
When do I tell the queen
the secret?

48
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,728
You must be patient,
Thistlewit.

49
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,596
Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?

50
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:36,799
Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

51
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,335
I see what you did there.

52
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:54,884
Next item of business,
the missing fairies.

53
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,386
I've sent more sprites

54
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,488
to search
the Tomb Bloom field.

55
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,956
They'll report back to me
at nightfall.

56
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,360
We will keep searching
until we find them.

57
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:07,597
Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.

58
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,735
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

59
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:15,004
Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.

60
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:20,910
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

61
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:27,250
We must all learn
a little kindness.

62
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:28,384
Coming through.

63
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,819
Excuse us.

64
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:30,987
Official pixie business.

65
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,422
A word,
Your Majesty.

66
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:33,856
- Maybe two.
- Aunties...

67
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,292
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

68
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,327
- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.

69
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,662
Not for a moment.

70
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,199
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

71
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:43,868
Is that...?

72
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,471
Pinto!

73
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,906
She's come
bearing gifts.

74
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:53,042
The first sap
from the warming trees.

75
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,011
It's for the big day!

76
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,579
Quiet, Thistlewit.

77
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:58,414
What big day?

78
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:01,986
Hey! My crown!

79
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:09,427
I'm not in the mood for this.

80
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,229
Pinto!

81
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,963
Whoa!

82
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:24,006
Come on.

83
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,042
Where are you going,
aunties?

84
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:29,545
Whoa!

85
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,716
I don't have time
for games, Pinto.

86
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,734
What's gotten
into all of you?

87
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:55,404
Oh. Uh-oh!

88
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,879
There she goes,
Your Majesty.

89
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,817
Come back here.

90
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:15,460
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

91
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,428
Look at me.

92
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:24,901
Oh.

93
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:26,869
Philip.
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:28,538
I was looking for you.

95
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,506
- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.

96
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,742
I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.

97
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,110
The Moors have turned
to madness.

98
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:35,678
I've got a castle
full of complaints.

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,713
- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!

100
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,015
I wanted to
ask you something.

101
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:40,082
Yes.

102
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:41,684
Do you think there
could be a union

103
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,354
between Ulstead
and the Moors?

104
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,955
A union?

105
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,723
To connect both lands.

106
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,126
To bring harmony
and peace.

107
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,996
I've been imagining a bridge.

108
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:53,932
Oh, a bridge.

109
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:55,932
Yes, a bridge.

110
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:58,434
A union's
a wonderful idea...

111
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:00,338
if both sides are willing.

112
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,473
Well, I'm working
on that part.

113
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,942
He's going to blow it.

114
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,011
Give him time.
He's warming up.

115
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:11,115
Wait.

116
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,619
That's your formal coat.

117
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,488
You're in on all of this,
aren't you?

118
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,957
If you're busy,
I could always come back.

119
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,859
No. No, no.

120
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,160
I'm not busy at all.

121
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:25,728
No, because I'd hate to...

122
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,096
Really. All ears.

123
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:28,433
What did you
want to talk about?

124
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,603
You're right.
He's blowing it.

125
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:35,473
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

126
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:39,711
I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.

127
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,445
I've loved you
since the moment I met you

128
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:43,779
and every day since.

129
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:47,183
If love has a truth,
here is mine.

130
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:48,718
There is no magic
nor curse

131
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,955
that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.

132
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,225
Are you sure
this is a good time?

133
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,562
Oh, Philip.

134
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,097
Oh, he's on his knee.

135
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,567
He took his sweet
time about it.

136
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,436
Will you marry me?

137
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:08,771
Yes.

138
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:10,539
- Yes?
- Yes.

139
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,678
Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.

140
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,590
We're having a wedding!

141
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,194
A secret surprise wedding.

142
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,800
Of course,
we have to tell our parents.

143
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:39,936
Do we?

144
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,600
Mistress.

145
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,035
What?

146
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,272
I have
a little bit of news.

147
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:18,074
Well, on with it.

148
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,042
It's nothing
of any real consequence...

149
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:24,113
and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.

150
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,750
It's just that...

151
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,985
Prince Philip has, um...

152
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:30,586
Disappeared?

153
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:33,589
No.
No. Philip has...

154
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:34,926
Yellow fever?
No, wait!

155
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,793
Leprosy!

156
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,129
No, Mistress.

157
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:43,065
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

158
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,802
Don't...

159
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,905
ruin my morning.

160
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,809
Mistress, please.

161
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:56,748
Stay calm!

162
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:05,721
<i>So, tell me, sire...

163
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,056
am I to be a best man,

164
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:09,158
or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?

165
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,092
General,
if that's your way

166
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,895
of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh...

167
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:14,964
I know
she said yes, sire.

168
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,700
What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?

169
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:19,302
What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?

170
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:22,138
"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?

171
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Winged beasts,
murderous trees.

172
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,008
Guard your tongue,
General.

173
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,310
You know nothing about them.

174
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,279
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

175
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,884
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

176
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,785
She's not like that.

177
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,187
It's my job to protect
this kingdom.

178
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,857
And I will do so,
old friend...

179
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,261
without hesitation.

180
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,962
Walk on.

181
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,169
Open the gates!

182
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:02,945
Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation

183
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:04,283
of the Midlands have arrived.

184
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,184
Weapons.

185
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:10,255
No. We have no need of arms.

186
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:13,124
Our days of war are over.

187
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,694
Ingrith...

188
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,896
you see where
I've had you placed.

189
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:21,899
Right behind me.

190
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:26,102
And that's
where I'll always be.

191
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:29,672
Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.

192
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:31,909
One can never be too careful.

193
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:40,015
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

194
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,951
Is it, now?

195
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,125
- Father, Mother.
- Well?

196
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:50,194
What did she say?

197
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,128
She said yes.

198
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,963
Yes!

199
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,932
That is wonderful news. Oh!

200
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,702
Two kingdoms united
at last.

201
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:00,705
Yes.

202
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,244
Yes.

203
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,177
Perhaps I've
been selfish...

204
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,415
looking at this
the wrong way.

205
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:14,150
You've made your choice.

206
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:15,784
Now is a time to celebrate.

207
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,392
I'm glad
you finally approve.

208
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:23,493
Much more than that.

209
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:28,265
I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms.

210
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,301
She shall come to dinner.

211
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,469
That would be incredible.

212
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,271
Under one condition.

213
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:36,273
She will bring her godmother.

214
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,440
Your Majesty, I strongly...

215
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:39,842
We will meet the one
who raised her

216
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,411
right here in this castle.

217
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:42,945
Yes.
The queen is right.

218
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,079
I'm not sure
her godmother will...

219
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,915
No, but I insist.

220
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,119
After all,
we will soon be family.

221
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,755
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

222
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:56,259
that my son
is to marry Aurora.

223
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,164
And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.

224
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,403
I shall send word
straightaway.

225
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,151
Oh!

226
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,892
Incoming.

227
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:33,332
Hold on to your petticoats!

228
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:46,445
Well, well.

229
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,449
So?

230
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,783
So.

231
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,389
Godmother...

232
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:03,362
Philip asked me to marry him.

233
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,095
Poor thing.

234
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,832
He'll recover.

235
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:11,869
My answer was yes.

236
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:17,039
- No.
- Yes.

237
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,173
No.

238
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:19,442
I wasn't really asking.

239
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,512
Nor was I.

240
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,878
What's next?

241
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,416
You'll turn him into a goat?

242
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:26,583
Hmm.

243
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,984
Stop.

244
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:31,086
Why don't you like Philip?

245
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,088
Well, for one thing,
he's human.

246
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,557
I'm a human.

247
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,462
And I have never
held that against you.

248
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,062
Until I fell in love.

249
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:45,368
Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.

250
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,037
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

251
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,607
A very handsome
and charming prince.

252
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,547
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

253
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,616
Please give him a chance.

254
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,451
Let us prove you wrong.

255
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,520
Philip is thoughtful...

256
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,187
he's very kind...

257
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:07,324
Kind of what?

258
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:09,492
The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...

259
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:12,629
and they have invited
both of us to the castle.

260
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,966
You want me
to meet his parents?

261
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,070
It's just a dinner.

262
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,105
They don't want me
in Ulstead.

263
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,308
Why on earth would I go?

264
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,145
Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.

265
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,148
Please.

266
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,458
Philip.

267
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,060
I want you
to wear this tonight.

268
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,695
Your sword?

269
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:46,730
Because of you,

270
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:49,401
Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.

271
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,537
Father,
my love for Aurora

272
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,306
has nothing to do
with politics.

273
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:58,641
Yes, but your love...

274
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:02,579
will ensure peace
for generations.

275
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,180
Now take it.
And wear it...

276
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:08,152
to know that you will
never have to use it.

277
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:11,256
Oh, my son.

278
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:15,126
I've never been more proud.

279
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:19,295
And what about Mother?

280
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:22,298
Is she okay with this?

281
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,405
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

282
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,560
Oh.

283
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,664
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

284
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,344
Oh.

285
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,215
I'm losing my patience.

286
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:46,282
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:49,084
You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.

288
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,286
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:54,091
Aurora said yes.

290
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,232
It's all coming together...

291
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,002
perfectly.

292
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,680
Hello.

293
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,450
Hello.

294
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:22,119
Hello.

295
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:26,056
Try it with
a little less fang.

296
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,160
How's this?

297
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:33,698
Try the greeting.

298
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:38,434
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

299
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:41,304
Remember,
it's not a threat.

300
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:45,310
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

301
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,312
- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.

302
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:50,315
Try it with a curtsy.

303
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,252
We can skip that part.

304
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,125
She really loves that boy,
you know.

305
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:04,663
You're doing her
a great kindness.

306
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:08,400
Kindness?

307
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:10,502
Mistress...

308
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,216
Doesn't she look lovely?

309
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,422
I have something for you.

310
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:33,425
Hmm?

311
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:37,194
For your horns.

312
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:39,529
I just thought
it might make

313
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:41,366
Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

314
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,133
And you, as well.

315
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:48,838
Maybe it's a bad idea.

316
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,475
No, it's...

317
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,478
It's all right.

318
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:04,687
I'm so excited.

319
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:07,857
Mmm... It's more
than I can bear.

320
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,364
It's Maleficent!

321
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,970
Pitchforks?

322
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:56,441
- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.

323
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:02,414
- It's getting better.
- Hmm.

324
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:20,329
Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.

325
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,399
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,911
They're here.

327
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:42,518
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

328
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,821
I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.

329
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,389
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

330
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:47,992
Why are we
talking about bears?

331
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,663
Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.

332
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:02,941
Thank you.

333
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,309
You look wonderful.

334
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,779
I'm so happy
to be here.

335
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:12,350
Aurora, this is
truly an honor.

336
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,289
Welcome to Ulstead.

337
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:22,859
Such a beautiful girl.

338
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:25,430
I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.

339
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:28,800
Your Majesty.

340
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,636
The flowers
in your hair.

341
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:35,438
I'm allergic.

342
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,739
I'm so sorry.

343
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,941
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.

344
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:40,343
They're beautiful.

345
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:41,479
Presenting Maleficent.

346
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:55,792
Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.

347
00:25:57,595 --> 00:26:00,429
This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.

348
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:02,333
And my mother,
Queen Ingrith.

349
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,737
Welcome to our home.

350
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,843
It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

351
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:14,979
Don't smile.

352
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:21,617
And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

353
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:25,388
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

354
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,089
Why would I have trouble?

355
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,861
Shoo!

356
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:33,129
He's making small talk.

357
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:35,333
I'll explain it later.

358
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,466
No trouble at all.

359
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:39,535
Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:41,070
dinner is served.

361
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:44,440
Please, make yourselves
at home.

362
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:02,827
Hmm.

363
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:14,639
Bird.

364
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,142
Delicious.

365
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:28,453
Is there a problem?

366
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:31,988
It's iron.

367
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,624
Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,

368
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,927
she is averse to iron.

369
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,562
I had no idea.

370
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:41,933
Take it away at once.

371
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,108
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

372
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,744
Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?

373
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,145
It certainly is.

374
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,849
Shoo!

375
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:03,786
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

376
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:08,059
to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?

377
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:18,801
Oh, I simply can't wait

378
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:20,505
to have a little one running
through the castle again.

379
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,876
This castle?

380
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,179
Yes, of course.

381
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:33,015
This will be their home.

382
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:36,688
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

383
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:39,689
Yes, sir, I do.

384
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:42,158
Yes...

385
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,996
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

386
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,898
- I made her queen.
- Her castle is

387
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
quite stunning.
You must see it.

388
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:53,237
Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.

389
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:55,940
Does she not?

390
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:58,541
Mother...

391
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,642
One in the Moors,

392
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:02,611
and one left behind
by her father.

393
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:06,215
King Stefan,
was it not?

394
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:09,520
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

395
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:13,290
So, you're also
a true princess.

396
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,691
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

397
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,528
Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?

398
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,631
Both.

399
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,734
Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.

400
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:28,738
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

401
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,776
A baby cursed to sleep...

402
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:33,978
and never wake up.

403
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:36,779
Really?

404
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,180
Who would do
such a terrible thing

405
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:40,252
to an innocent child?

406
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:46,856
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

407
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:49,359
I'm sure
your kind would agree.

408
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,127
What do you mean,
my kind?

409
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,629
She means humans.

410
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:55,631
There are fairies missing
from the Moors.

411
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,199
What I'm missing
is some wine.

412
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:59,101
Stolen by human poachers.

413
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,669
That's the first
I've heard of it.

414
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,939
Someone gave the order.

415
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:11,983
It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.

416
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:14,750
No, she never said that.

417
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:17,219
Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?

418
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:18,621
Your Majesty,
I must report

419
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:19,855
that two peasants
were found dead...

420
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:21,824
just outside the Moors.

421
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,692
They'd been missing
for several days.

422
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,227
I see.

423
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:27,663
Yes, we all see.

424
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,131
The borders are open,

425
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,900
but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?

426
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:34,770
What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?

427
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:38,241
Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...

428
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,011
and she's talking
about fairies.

429
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,416
Contain your animal.

430
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:48,318
Or I will.

431
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:54,257
If I didn't know better,

432
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,791
I'd say you were
making a threat.

433
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:56,959
Well, do you?

434
00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:59,061
- Do I what?
- Know better?

435
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:00,196
Enough.

436
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:01,599
Put her down.

437
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,936
Please, put her down.

438
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:10,041
We're here to celebrate.

439
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:15,245
Forgive me, he's right.

440
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,347
Let's not forget
why we're here.

441
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,285
The start of a new life
for Aurora.

442
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:23,888
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

443
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:31,861
You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent...

444
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:35,900
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

445
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,401
But now...

446
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:42,071
Aurora will finally get...

447
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:44,343
the love of a real family.

448
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,842
A real mother.

449
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:50,212
Because the one thing
I regret...

450
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:53,082
is never having a daughter
of my own.

451
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:56,085
But tonight changes that.

452
00:31:56,087 --> 00:32:01,426
Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.

453
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,106
Guards!

454
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:19,208
We have opened our home
to a witch!

455
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,855
Stop!

456
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:33,356
There is no union.

457
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,057
There will be no wedding.

458
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,927
- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!

459
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,762
Maleficent, please, stop now.

460
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,033
John, I'm so frightened.

461
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:43,500
Ah!

462
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:45,801
What has she done to me?

463
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,105
Father!

464
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,142
John!

465
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,077
We go home.

466
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:55,947
John!

467
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:58,115
It's a curse.

468
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:02,385
It's a curse!

469
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:04,323
Maleficent has cursed
the king!

470
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,358
What have you done?

471
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,194
I've done nothing.

472
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:13,432
Aurora, we go home now.

473
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,501
Aurora!

474
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:31,880
Aurora!

475
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:33,217
Wake him!

476
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,256
Wake him, please.

477
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:02,073
Stand aside!

478
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,510
To the bedroom!

479
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:10,014
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

480
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:14,917
There must be a lesion.

481
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,051
Proof of her witchery.

482
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:19,021
Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.

483
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:22,224
We all saw what Maleficent
did to him.

484
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:24,093
I'm so sorry.

485
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:27,432
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

486
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:32,101
All he wanted was peace.

487
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:34,270
This is all my fault.

488
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,475
You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.

489
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:41,444
Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.

490
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:43,315
Especially you.

491
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:46,884
We'll do our best
to protect you.

492
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:50,087
There must be a way
to reverse this.

493
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:54,225
Mother, could you
try kissing him?

494
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,296
True love and all that.

495
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,467
I doubt
that would work.

496
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:06,001
It could save him.

497
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:08,638
- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.

498
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,342
Very well.

499
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:23,453
You wanted peace...

500
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:26,458
now rest in peace forever.

501
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,467
I told you.

502
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:41,103
This is no fairy tale.

503
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:43,339
I have to return
to the Moors.

504
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:44,507
It's the only way.

505
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,008
Wait, wait. Come here.

506
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,510
I have to find her.

507
00:36:47,512 --> 00:36:48,645
It's the middle
of the night.

508
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,513
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

509
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,582
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

510
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:55,017
No. You should stay
with your family.

511
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,288
You are my family.

512
00:36:58,323 --> 00:37:00,423
Let her go, Philip.

513
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:02,661
Maybe she can save him.

514
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,416
Maleficent!

515
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,590
Maleficent!

516
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:14,831
Godmother!

517
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:24,108
Please come back.

518
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,314
She's not in the Moors.

519
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:31,683
Diaval.

520
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,183
No one's seen her.

521
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:36,688
I'm so happy to see you.

522
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:39,824
She's nowhere to be found.

523
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:43,326
What if she
never comes back?

524
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:45,595
I could be stuck
as a human forever.

525
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,299
I have to find her.

526
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,170
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

527
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,532
Tell me she's dead.

528
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,934
The iron pierced her flesh.

529
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:00,605
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

530
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:05,408
Then where is her head?

531
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,677
There was something else.

532
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,946
Another creature.

533
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:13,449
It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.

534
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:15,152
What did it look like?

535
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,621
Her.

536
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:20,523
It carried her
up into the sky.

537
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:22,992
Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out

538
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:24,494
and now she's not alone.

539
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,197
We must be ready for war.

540
00:40:30,268 --> 00:40:31,836
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

541
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:39,644
Stay inside!

542
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:48,553
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

543
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:25,450
If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.

544
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:30,989
They tried to kill her
with this.

545
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,808
Do you hear it?

546
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:52,310
Do you hear it?

547
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:54,946
Huh?

548
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:57,682
It's a message
from the humans.

549
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,919
I hear it loud and clear.

550
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:04,987
Time for us to die.

551
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:08,791
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

552
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,427
And we are almost extinct
because of it.

553
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:12,929
Killing peasants
on the Moors

554
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:15,731
will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.

555
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,466
They've pulled the iron
from the earth...

556
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:20,136
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

557
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:21,606
But this...

558
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:26,075
This will finish us.

559
00:43:26,077 --> 00:43:28,077
Our people are safe
here for now.

560
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,779
But for how long?

561
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,683
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

562
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,584
I call for war.

563
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,787
I call for war!

564
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,088
Right now!

565
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:42,093
There are
too many humans.

566
00:43:44,762 --> 00:43:45,895
Too many kingdoms.

567
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:48,030
Conall,
they will keep finding

568
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:49,966
new ways to destroy us.

569
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,636
We can't win.

570
00:43:55,773 --> 00:43:57,909
We can't win!

571
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:01,679
Not this way.

572
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,116
No. You're wrong, Conall.

573
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:09,554
We have something
they didn't plan on.

574
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,758
We have her.

575
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,765
She holds powers
none of us possess.

576
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:24,535
She is wounded, Borra.

577
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,138
Who are you?

578
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:39,951
Hmm.

579
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,819
Hmm.

580
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,957
You reek of human.

581
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:49,992
Maybe I was wrong about you.

582
00:44:49,994 --> 00:44:52,128
Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead

583
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,598
at the bottom of the sea.

584
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:58,736
No.

585
00:45:00,138 --> 00:45:02,173
It's there, isn't it?

586
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:05,043
It's inside you.

587
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,209
Mmm.

588
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:10,481
Ahhh!

589
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,163
You see?

590
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:31,767
You see what's inside her?

591
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:35,137
That is what will save us all.

592
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,792
You saved me.

593
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,731
Come.

594
00:46:04,336 --> 00:46:06,771
Let me show you who we are.

595
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,895
We're Dark Fey.

596
00:47:05,663 --> 00:47:06,964
Same as you.

597
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:19,944
We're all that remain.

598
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:24,215
Unseen here,
far away from mankind.

599
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:25,948
Look!

600
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:28,851
As more
human kingdoms emerged,

601
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:30,420
we went into hiding...

602
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:32,988
from every corner
of the earth...

603
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,158
doing what we had to,
to survive.

604
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,896
But many were lost.

605
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:03,986
Only a few
generations ago...

606
00:48:03,988 --> 00:48:06,190
our kind roamed
every part of the world.

607
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,058
The tundra.

608
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,427
The forest.

609
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,929
The jungle.

610
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,902
The desert.

611
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:26,243
Now, our only refuge
is here...

612
00:48:26,245 --> 00:48:28,043
in this cave.

613
00:48:28,045 --> 00:48:30,146
Our nest of origin.

614
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:37,054
Listen.
Play in the wind.

615
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:39,857
Go!

616
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:01,244
Those children
should be soaring

617
00:49:01,246 --> 00:49:03,413
over the trees and rivers.

618
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:05,350
Instead,
they are raised in exile.

619
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,419
I could protect them.

620
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:12,087
How? By waging war
against the humans?

621
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:14,156
I've been at war with them
my whole life.

622
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:16,158
Not all of them.

623
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,430
There was one you raised
as your own.

624
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:24,033
Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.

625
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,101
Maybe we can exist
without fear...

626
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:28,305
and war.

627
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:30,808
Find a way together.

628
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:34,212
That will never happen.

629
00:50:02,206 --> 00:50:03,874
Oh.

630
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:22,093
Whoa.

631
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,134
Whoa!

632
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:55,460
Ow! Oh.

633
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,228
Huh?

634
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:07,339
Gotcha!

635
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome to your new home.

636
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:37,034
We've been worried
about you, dear.

637
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,070
Your Majesty.

638
00:51:40,037 --> 00:51:42,071
I couldn't find her.

639
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:44,576
My heart breaks for you.

640
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,077
She has brought
a cloud of darkness

641
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,146
upon your happiness.

642
00:51:50,248 --> 00:51:53,249
I know she was
against this marriage.

643
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:56,586
Never trusted your
instincts as a queen.

644
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:59,223
When I saw her at dinner...

645
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,295
with her horns covered...

646
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,399
bent cowering...

647
00:52:12,236 --> 00:52:15,906
Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.

648
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:19,041
I just don't know
what to do.

649
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,944
You do truly love him,
don't you?

650
00:52:21,946 --> 00:52:23,281
My son.

651
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,882
Deeply.

652
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:28,620
It is love
that will heal you.

653
00:52:29,454 --> 00:52:31,987
It's what heals us all.

654
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:35,192
Let's move
forward together...

655
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,629
as a family.

656
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,146
<i>To all who live
on the Moors...

657
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:01,284
What is that noise?

658
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:03,051
<i>...and kingdoms
far and wide,

659
00:53:03,053 --> 00:53:04,387
<i>the king and queen
invite you...

660
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,055
<i>to attend the wedding...

661
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:10,027
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.

662
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:12,462
<i>All are welcome.

663
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:13,465
Huh?

664
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,135
<i>And all are expected!

665
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:22,070
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

666
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:24,274
I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!

667
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:26,476
I always knew
I'd be invited.

668
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:29,412
Just glad you two
made the cut.

669
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,249
Who's getting married?

670
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,295
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

671
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:46,629
The queen is right.

672
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:49,399
We owe it to everyone...

673
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:51,570
especially the king.

674
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,439
What about Maleficent?

675
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:59,644
She's gone.

676
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,122
The Phoenix.

677
00:54:14,124 --> 00:54:16,394
It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...

678
00:54:17,696 --> 00:54:19,731
evolved over centuries.

679
00:54:21,566 --> 00:54:24,001
You are the last
of her descendants.

680
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,137
Her blood is your own.

681
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,475
You are her.

682
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:37,380
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

683
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:40,217
destruction and rebirth.

684
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,086
But nature's greatest power

685
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:47,224
is the power
of true transformation.

686
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,264
You transformed
when you raised Aurora.

687
00:54:54,164 --> 00:54:56,466
When you found love...

688
00:54:56,468 --> 00:54:59,538
in the middle of your pain.

689
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:03,808
I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...

690
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,378
all of your pain...

691
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:09,512
and not use it.

692
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,751
Help us broker peace
with the humans.

693
00:55:14,586 --> 00:55:16,553
Because peace...

694
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:21,158
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

695
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:32,669
The Moors are our last
true nature on earth.

696
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:36,773
And yet you named
a human as queen.

697
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:39,477
A daughter you cared for.

698
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,682
I have no daughter.

699
00:55:46,418 --> 00:55:48,687
She has chosen her side.

700
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:03,366
We've just heard.

701
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:06,136
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

702
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,406
Humans will come
from all over.

703
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,408
That's when we attack.

704
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,345
We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead...

705
00:56:15,347 --> 00:56:17,349
and their young prince.

706
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:22,719
Their kingdom will fall.

707
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:25,390
And the Fey will rise again.

708
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,775
The fairies made it.

709
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,427
I wore it when I
married the king.

710
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,903
I'm sure it's perfect.

711
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:13,872
So am I.

712
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:22,712
Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.

713
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:24,514
Considering
how she was raised.

714
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:27,483
By the same evil witch
who cursed her.

715
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,386
It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along.

716
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:31,521
It's a miracle

717
00:57:31,523 --> 00:57:33,358
the poor child is
alive at all.

718
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:36,659
Thank you so much.

719
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,527
It's exquisite.

720
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:09,926
<i>When I'm older...

721
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:11,763
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

722
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:15,366
Then we can
look after each other.

723
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:38,556
- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.

724
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,360
Aurora, I know you
better than that.

725
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:46,397
This jewelry...

726
00:58:47,332 --> 00:58:48,731
my hair...

727
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,867
all these rules.

728
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:54,604
I can't breathe.

729
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:57,573
I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.

730
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,876
I feel like
a different person.

731
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:01,744
Listen...

732
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:05,381
I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.

733
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:06,916
You don't have to change.

734
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,020
I don't want you to change.

735
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,465
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

736
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:40,885
Ah, yes.

737
00:59:42,987 --> 00:59:43,988
Well...

738
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,089
Does it work?

739
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:48,891
I only have a handful

740
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:49,859
of fairy specimens
to work with...

741
00:59:49,861 --> 00:59:52,630
and the extraction process
is painstaking.

742
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:55,400
Extraction from what?

743
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:58,634
Tomb Bloom flowers.

744
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,869
They grow from
a fairy's grave,

745
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,637
contain their very essence.

746
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,639
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

747
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,609
the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.

748
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:08,112
We will need thousands more.

749
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:11,449
Show me.

750
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,884
Show me.

751
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:15,887
Very well.

752
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,122
So...

753
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:14,045
Finally,
the Moors will be mine.

754
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,847
No more fairies.

755
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,051
Stay alert, men.

756
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,901
Wow!

757
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:13,069
This is where
I found them.

758
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:14,737
Excellent.

759
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,572
But what if
the winged one returns?

760
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:18,509
Don't you worry about that.

761
01:02:19,244 --> 01:02:20,576
We'll be ready.

762
01:02:20,578 --> 01:02:21,713
Take the Tomb Blooms.

763
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:24,314
Get to work!

764
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,130
Sentries, stay alert!

765
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,600
Keep your weapons on hand.

766
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,622
Move it!

767
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:13,931
Maleficent...

768
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:59,877
This is where
we bury our dead.

769
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:03,014
They've destroyed it.

770
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,119
This is what
the humans do.

771
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:12,655
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

772
01:04:12,657 --> 01:04:14,192
We have to stop them.

773
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:20,129
You spent years
caring for a human...

774
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:23,134
now it's time
to care for your own.

775
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:33,811
Fire!

776
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:57,101
Reload! We go again!

777
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:03,408
Fire!

778
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:09,680
Reload!
There's another one!

779
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:28,491
Everyone, stay together!

780
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:30,360
We're about to leave
the Moors.

781
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,061
Grab the hand or the wing...

782
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,366
or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.

783
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:19,074
Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!

784
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,145
Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.

785
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,980
- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.

786
01:07:24,982 --> 01:07:26,148
I'm with the bride.

787
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,217
We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind

788
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:29,352
find their seats first.

789
01:07:29,354 --> 01:07:30,553
But I'm not a human.

790
01:07:30,555 --> 01:07:32,489
- I'm a raven.
- What?

791
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:35,258
A raven. The black bird.

792
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,527
Mmm. This rice is delicious.

793
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:39,094
You're supposed
to throw it

794
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,297
at the bride and groom.

795
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:42,965
What? And waste good rice?

796
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:44,066
What's the hold up?

797
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:46,303
Let me in!

798
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:48,273
Why can't humans come in, too?

799
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:51,476
Why can't we come in?

800
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,082
I know it's bad luck...

801
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:01,819
but I had to see you.

802
01:08:03,322 --> 01:08:04,621
For you.

803
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:06,489
A Tomb Bloom?

804
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:07,557
Where did you get this?

805
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,326
From my mother.

806
01:08:09,328 --> 01:08:12,063
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

807
01:08:19,571 --> 01:08:21,939
<i>From my mother.

808
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,809
Where should we sit, Flittle?

809
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:14,844
On the left.
We're with the bride.

810
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,579
Yes, we are.

811
01:11:16,581 --> 01:11:18,448
But the groom's lovely, too.

812
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,252
Mmm. Yes, he is.

813
01:11:21,185 --> 01:11:22,819
I'm with both.

814
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:25,055
Huh?

815
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,532
Now.

816
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:58,788
What's this?

817
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,657
Nobody is allowed in here
except me.

818
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:03,461
And I'm already here,
so go away!

819
01:12:21,646 --> 01:12:23,213
Maleficent, please stop.

820
01:12:30,322 --> 01:12:32,154
Maleficent.

821
01:12:32,156 --> 01:12:33,491
She didn't do it.

822
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:38,263
Get out!

823
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:41,229
Before I call the guards!

824
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:49,672
The missing fairies.

825
01:12:49,674 --> 01:12:51,206
I said get out.
Did you hear me?

826
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,843
What have you done?

827
01:12:58,182 --> 01:12:59,882
You're a pixie.

828
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:01,451
How dare you call me that?

829
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:03,553
I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...

830
01:13:03,555 --> 01:13:05,357
and I serve the queen.

831
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,326
She took your wings.

832
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,863
We have to release them.

833
01:13:13,865 --> 01:13:15,665
They belong on the Moors.

834
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:16,733
As you do, Aurora.

835
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,307
A human who has betrayed
her kind.

836
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,847
You put the curse
on the king.

837
01:13:30,849 --> 01:13:32,915
Oh, dear.

838
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:35,518
You may be queen...

839
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,320
but you are very young.

840
01:13:37,322 --> 01:13:40,423
Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated...

841
01:13:40,425 --> 01:13:44,295
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

842
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:49,199
When I was young...

843
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,436
my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.

844
01:13:53,438 --> 01:13:57,774
And one particularly
harsh winter...

845
01:13:57,776 --> 01:13:59,609
our crops died...

846
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:03,346
and the people
began to suffer.

847
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:05,948
And as we looked
over our walls...

848
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:10,319
we could see
the fairies thriving.

849
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,256
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

850
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:18,363
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

851
01:14:19,297 --> 01:14:21,330
Choosing peace
over our people,

852
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,666
he sent my brother
to do his bidding.

853
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,770
He never came back.

854
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:28,871
Those savages...

855
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:30,506
creatures who could
barely grunt,

856
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,877
let alone engage in talks,
killed him.

857
01:14:33,712 --> 01:14:35,278
I don't believe that.

858
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,646
Our people became fearful.

859
01:14:36,648 --> 01:14:39,482
They overthrew my father.

860
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:43,352
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

861
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:48,291
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

862
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:50,026
Another weak king

863
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,762
speaking of
tolerance and civility.

864
01:14:52,764 --> 01:14:55,364
And now, my own son...

865
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:59,368
corrupted with visions
of harmony.

866
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,740
But peace
will not be our downfall.

867
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:08,646
Now lock her up.

868
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:11,750
A war is coming.

869
01:15:17,589 --> 01:15:19,557
No! No!

870
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,435
I wish you could be here
with me.

871
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:41,012
Conall wanted peace...

872
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:45,984
<i>and they filled him with iron.

873
01:15:47,552 --> 01:15:49,888
Now, we will have our war.

874
01:15:51,956 --> 01:15:55,124
Our fight begins now!

875
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:57,927
We will rise together!

876
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,496
We fight together.

877
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:04,867
And we will show them
no mercy!

878
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,922
Come on! Go!

879
01:16:28,393 --> 01:16:31,394
Go! Go!

880
01:16:31,396 --> 01:16:33,898
Go! Go! Go!

881
01:16:47,779 --> 01:16:49,745
Where are all Philip's guests?

882
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:51,916
- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.

883
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:20,879
Start the music.

884
01:17:38,596 --> 01:17:40,463
Come on! Come on!

885
01:18:44,529 --> 01:18:45,530
She's gone.

886
01:18:47,065 --> 01:18:48,066
Hey!

887
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,979
It's a trap! Get down!

888
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,099
Your Majesty...

889
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,702
they're coming from the sea.

890
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:35,578
She escaped!

891
01:19:42,053 --> 01:19:44,022
Down this way, come on!

892
01:19:51,696 --> 01:19:53,162
Your Highness.

893
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:54,699
Upon my command.

894
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:06,909
Check every room!

895
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:09,981
She can't be far!

896
01:20:42,947 --> 01:20:43,948
Wait.

897
01:20:45,317 --> 01:20:46,651
Wait.

898
01:21:10,174 --> 01:21:11,976
What's going on?

899
01:21:16,214 --> 01:21:17,713
Now.

900
01:21:17,715 --> 01:21:18,814
Fire!

901
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:29,392
No!

902
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,189
They look just like her.

903
01:22:02,193 --> 01:22:03,926
Withdraw!

904
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:05,963
Withdraw!

905
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:08,831
Pull back!

906
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:10,267
Maleficent's
starting a war.

907
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:12,735
First my father,
and now this.

908
01:22:12,737 --> 01:22:15,004
Philip!
She didn't curse him.

909
01:22:15,006 --> 01:22:17,106
- Maleficent.
- What?

910
01:22:17,108 --> 01:22:18,876
She never cursed him.

911
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,810
It was your mother.

912
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,112
What are you saying?

913
01:22:23,114 --> 01:22:24,283
It was the spindle.

914
01:22:29,488 --> 01:22:31,421
The curse is still in it.

915
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:34,125
Your mother used it
against your father.

916
01:22:35,927 --> 01:22:37,262
Look.

917
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:41,464
It's the same.

918
01:22:41,466 --> 01:22:44,233
She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel.

919
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:45,535
This isn't a wedding.

920
01:22:45,537 --> 01:22:47,738
It's a trap.

921
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:54,845
Remember where
you came from.

922
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:57,815
Remember who you are.

923
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,954
I've made my choice.

924
01:23:04,055 --> 01:23:06,057
You'll have to make yours.

925
01:23:34,286 --> 01:23:35,920
Stay low!

926
01:23:38,155 --> 01:23:39,258
Divide!

927
01:23:41,493 --> 01:23:43,094
Follow me!

928
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,104
Attack!

929
01:23:54,406 --> 01:23:56,071
Attack!

930
01:24:07,051 --> 01:24:08,853
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

931
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,131
No!

932
01:25:04,543 --> 01:25:05,943
Aunties! Aunties!

933
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,382
It's too heavy!

934
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:13,148
Aurora!

935
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,319
Diaval! You're here.

936
01:25:17,556 --> 01:25:19,324
Oh, what's happening?

937
01:25:39,678 --> 01:25:41,145
Weapon change!

938
01:25:43,114 --> 01:25:44,249
Weapon change! Go!

939
01:26:24,556 --> 01:26:25,557
Mother!

940
01:26:26,491 --> 01:26:28,123
You have to stop this.

941
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,626
We are at war.

942
01:26:29,628 --> 01:26:31,661
This isn't a war.
It's a massacre.

943
01:26:31,663 --> 01:26:33,396
Philip,
you don't understand.

944
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:36,266
These creatures stand
between us...

945
01:26:36,268 --> 01:26:39,067
and everything
we need to survive.

946
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,403
You're wrong.

947
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:42,037
We can stand together.

948
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:44,741
Well, you're a fool
to believe that.

949
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:48,179
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

950
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,348
You lied to me.

951
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:53,483
I am protecting the kingdom...

952
01:26:53,485 --> 01:26:56,218
and your throne.

953
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,389
What about Father?

954
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:02,126
Were you protecting him, too?

955
01:27:04,396 --> 01:27:06,731
The prince
is not feeling well.

956
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,768
See him to his chambers.

957
01:27:13,638 --> 01:27:14,639
Now.

958
01:27:19,244 --> 01:27:20,412
Sire, stop!

959
01:27:47,339 --> 01:27:49,739
Yield! Yield!

960
01:27:49,741 --> 01:27:50,807
My mother cursed the king

961
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:52,107
so she could destroy
the Moor folk.

962
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:54,244
Your men are paying
heavily for it.

963
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:03,586
We have to do something!

964
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:08,491
Goodbye, girls.

965
01:28:09,694 --> 01:28:11,794
No, come back!

966
01:28:11,796 --> 01:28:13,598
Flittle! No!

967
01:28:26,278 --> 01:28:27,644
No!

968
01:28:27,646 --> 01:28:29,514
Hey, you,
stay with your own!

969
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:31,781
Run, Aurora, run!

970
01:28:31,783 --> 01:28:33,583
Let him go!

971
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:40,292
No! No!

972
01:29:07,419 --> 01:29:09,285
Godmother.

973
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:09,312
For Flittle!

974
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:20,224
We've got her!

975
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:35,807
Huh?

976
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:08,771
Go! Go!

977
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,507
This way! This way!

978
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:12,510
Go!

979
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,021
Stand down!

980
01:31:58,857 --> 01:32:01,023
This is not my fight.

981
01:32:01,025 --> 01:32:03,661
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

982
01:32:05,497 --> 01:32:08,399
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

983
01:32:26,718 --> 01:32:28,553
There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.

984
01:32:50,508 --> 01:32:52,542
This way!
This way!

985
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:56,514
Maleficent's back!

986
01:33:01,052 --> 01:33:03,621
She's going for the queen.

987
01:33:09,427 --> 01:33:11,427
Yield! Yield!

988
01:33:11,429 --> 01:33:12,562
Stand down!

989
01:33:12,564 --> 01:33:13,832
Lower your weapons!

990
01:33:26,077 --> 01:33:28,913
There's the evil
that I promised them.

991
01:33:32,584 --> 01:33:35,086
Your kind is more predictable
than humans.

992
01:33:41,726 --> 01:33:42,727
Stop!

993
01:33:43,628 --> 01:33:44,694
Stop!

994
01:33:44,696 --> 01:33:46,798
Well, almost.

995
01:33:47,065 --> 01:33:48,431
Stop.

996
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:51,701
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

997
01:33:51,703 --> 01:33:53,669
There's another way.

998
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:54,839
I know who you are.

999
01:33:57,475 --> 01:33:59,744
I know you.

1000
01:34:00,178 --> 01:34:01,844
You do not.

1001
01:34:04,115 --> 01:34:06,484
Yes, I do.

1002
01:34:06,951 --> 01:34:08,820
You're my mother.

1003
01:34:43,922 --> 01:34:45,156
No!

1004
01:35:00,972 --> 01:35:03,574
Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?

1005
01:35:04,809 --> 01:35:08,010
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

1006
01:35:08,012 --> 01:35:09,279
and then use that fear...

1007
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:10,481
Your Majesty.

1008
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:14,183
...against your enemies.

1009
01:35:14,185 --> 01:35:16,953
So...

1010
01:35:16,955 --> 01:35:20,556
I spread the story
of the evil witch...

1011
01:35:20,558 --> 01:35:24,060
and the princess she cursed.

1012
01:35:24,062 --> 01:35:27,865
It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.

1013
01:35:28,766 --> 01:35:30,866
They were all terrified.

1014
01:35:30,868 --> 01:35:33,972
And the story became legend.

1015
01:35:36,241 --> 01:35:38,941
I know you think
I'm a monster.

1016
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:43,915
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

1017
01:35:44,749 --> 01:35:47,850
I did for Ulstead.

1018
01:35:47,852 --> 01:35:50,619
You are a traitor
to your kind,

1019
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:52,223
and you will pay for it.

1020
01:35:53,258 --> 01:35:55,560
Maleficent is dead!

1021
01:35:58,563 --> 01:36:01,731
We will never again
live in fear!

1022
01:36:01,733 --> 01:36:03,134
Get back here!

1023
01:36:07,038 --> 01:36:09,306
Ulstead is free at last!

1024
01:36:09,308 --> 01:36:12,143
Let me go!

1025
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:21,919
What's happening?

1026
01:39:47,492 --> 01:39:49,361
Well, well.

1027
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:52,464
Hello, Beasty.

1028
01:40:11,182 --> 01:40:12,216
I missed you.

1029
01:40:14,018 --> 01:40:15,420
Did you bump
your head, then?

1030
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,219
I did.

1031
01:40:20,124 --> 01:40:21,393
Philip.

1032
01:40:21,959 --> 01:40:23,295
Yes?

1033
01:40:25,162 --> 01:40:27,031
Do you love my daughter?

1034
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:31,270
With everything I have.

1035
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:41,812
Good.

1036
01:40:50,422 --> 01:40:53,525
I believe this belongs to you.

1037
01:41:00,299 --> 01:41:02,465
Curses don't end.

1038
01:41:02,467 --> 01:41:04,235
They're broken.

1039
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:31,363
It ends.

1040
01:41:37,502 --> 01:41:40,035
There will be
no more fighting.

1041
01:41:40,037 --> 01:41:42,605
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

1042
01:41:42,607 --> 01:41:44,041
And from this day on...

1043
01:41:44,676 --> 01:41:47,377
we move forward...

1044
01:41:47,379 --> 01:41:49,847
and find our way...

1045
01:41:50,915 --> 01:41:52,250
in peace.

1046
01:41:52,651 --> 01:41:54,218
Together.

1047
01:41:57,489 --> 01:42:00,290
Today,
there will be a wedding.

1048
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:03,693
Not just a union
of two people...

1049
01:42:03,695 --> 01:42:07,029
but a union of two kingdoms.

1050
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:08,433
And all are invited...

1051
01:42:09,501 --> 01:42:11,601
all are safe...

1052
01:42:11,603 --> 01:42:14,036
and all are welcome.

1053
01:42:48,105 --> 01:42:49,907
Hello, there.

1054
01:43:30,682 --> 01:43:33,783
We cannot live
amongst monsters...

1055
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:42,427
Someone should
really cover those horns.

1056
01:43:59,478 --> 01:44:01,279
If only Conall could see you.

1057
01:44:03,415 --> 01:44:04,416
Borra...

1058
01:44:06,551 --> 01:44:09,218
it's time to come home.

1059
01:44:15,327 --> 01:44:16,628
Hello.

1060
01:44:18,296 --> 01:44:20,265
Can you come here?

1061
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:31,743
Yes?

1062
01:44:33,678 --> 01:44:35,514
Will you give me away?

1063
01:44:35,814 --> 01:44:37,382
Never.

1064
01:44:38,517 --> 01:44:40,483
No.

1065
01:44:40,485 --> 01:44:42,052
Will you walk me
down the aisle?

1066
01:44:42,521 --> 01:44:44,221
Ah.

1067
01:44:46,558 --> 01:44:47,559
Yes.

1068
01:45:10,815 --> 01:45:13,183
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

1069
01:45:25,497 --> 01:45:26,498
Is that...?

1070
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:29,199
She can change her back.

1071
01:45:29,868 --> 01:45:31,301
I suppose.

1072
01:45:31,303 --> 01:45:35,471
Only if we wanted to.

1073
01:45:35,473 --> 01:45:37,139
Father.

1074
01:45:41,646 --> 01:45:43,913
I'm so glad to see you.

1075
01:45:43,915 --> 01:45:46,282
I've dreamed
of this moment.

1076
01:45:46,284 --> 01:45:49,184
Two kingdoms
united at last.

1077
01:45:49,186 --> 01:45:51,921
And it's because of you.

1078
01:45:51,923 --> 01:45:54,857
I'm so proud of you.
So proud.

1079
01:46:23,822 --> 01:46:25,388
She looks better
in green.

1080
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:26,491
Pink, you mean.

1081
01:46:29,761 --> 01:46:30,862
No, in green.

1082
01:46:31,596 --> 01:46:32,662
Pink.

1083
01:46:32,664 --> 01:46:33,898
- Green.
- Pink.

1084
01:46:37,234 --> 01:46:38,668
Flittle!

1085
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:40,905
It's perfect.

1086
01:47:25,417 --> 01:47:27,252
Let her go.

1087
01:47:40,765 --> 01:47:43,566
Pull yourself together.

1088
01:47:43,568 --> 01:47:46,769
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1089
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:48,473
divided by fear.

1090
01:47:49,374 --> 01:47:51,407
Today, you teach us

1091
01:47:51,409 --> 01:47:54,544
we are not defined
by where we are from...

1092
01:47:54,546 --> 01:47:56,715
but by whom we love.

1093
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,418
The bands, please.

1094
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,834
Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...

1095
01:48:17,836 --> 01:48:18,636
I do.

1096
01:48:20,538 --> 01:48:21,771
And do you,
Aurora, take...

1097
01:48:21,773 --> 01:48:23,473
I do.

1098
01:48:23,475 --> 01:48:27,343
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1099
01:48:27,345 --> 01:48:29,380
You may kiss the bride.

1100
01:49:00,011 --> 01:49:01,110
You're smiling.

1101
01:49:24,002 --> 01:49:25,737
It's a new day.

1102
01:49:28,139 --> 01:49:29,908
It is.

1103
01:49:41,586 --> 01:49:42,620
Morning.

1104
01:49:43,521 --> 01:49:45,721
Will you stay awhile?

1105
01:49:45,723 --> 01:49:47,456
A little while.

1106
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:49,492
But don't worry...

1107
01:49:49,494 --> 01:49:51,896
I'll see you
