1
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:30,898

2
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,685
- Mike!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

3
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,854
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's called driving, Marcus.

4
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:14,094
Slow down!

5
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:16,996
What? Four minutes? Speed up.

6
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:20,801
Oh, so you want me to speed up
and slow down at the same time?

7
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:24,971
Moving southbound on Collins.

8
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:29,376
- Fast approaching 22 Street.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

9
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:31,613
<i>Air support has a visual.</i>

10
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:34,815
Mike!

11
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,989
I'm about to throw up.

12
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,825
Oh, you bett... The hell not.

13
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:48,096
That is hand-stitched leather.
You better drink it.

14
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,934
<i>Blocking off 6th Street.</i>

15
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:56,302
That was your turn, Mike!

16
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,571
Damn it! Look, you are
the navigator, okay?

17
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,507
That's why you're sitting
in that seat.

18
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,376
Where are your glasses?
You need to put your glasses on.

19
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:06,112
- I don't need glasses.
- Marcus, you can't see shit.

20
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,815
Oh, sh... Mike. Mike. Mike.

21
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,050
- Relax. Relax!
- Mike. Bus, bus, bus.

22
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,234
Sorry, rich white people.

23
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,637
We're not just black,
we're cops too.

24
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,939
We'll pull ourselves
over later.

25
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:47,956
Hoo-hoo!

26
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,999
Hey, even the Batmobile don't
hold the road like this bitch.

27
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:07,042
- Whoo!
- Get me the fuck out of this car.

28
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,519
- Hey!
- Oh, shit.

29
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,088
Come on, man.

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,456
You can get that buffed out.

31
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,259
No. You can get that buffed out.

32
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,294
- Miami PD. Make a hole.
- Coming through.

33
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:29,964
- Make a hole. Miami PD.
- Miami PD.

34
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,765
Go! Go!

35
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,032
Sorry.

36
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,136
Daddy!

37
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,507
Joker.

38
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,475
You a pop-pop.

39
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:54,354
- Hi.
- Oh. Oh.

40
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:57,023
- Oh, baby, look at him.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,793
- No doubt. It's in the eyes.
- Mm-hm.

42
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,829
And the ears.

43
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:02,897
And the name.

44
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,098
Marcus Miles Burnett.

45
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,467
- But that's my name.
- His name too.

46
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,335
We decided to name him
after you.

47
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,273
It was Reggie's idea.

48
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:15,341
Thought it would be
a very respectful gesture, sir.

49
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,678
- I hope you approve.
- That's cool.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,947
But you still need
to make a honest woman

51
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,548
out of my baby girl there.

52
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,684
Uncle Mike, ready
to hold the baby?

53
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:27,654
Oh, mm-mm. No. Uncle Mike
don't want to catch that.

54
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,125
Uh-uh, okay?
That's that shit.

55
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,660
- No, Mike.
- Stop.

56
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:34,594
Look at the baby.

57
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:36,262
Stop it right now.
Seriously.

58
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:38,431
- Look at the baby.
- Okay, you know what?

59
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:42,602
I'll be outside
when you get your shit together.

60
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:44,070
Mike.

61
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,541
- The baby.
- Oh, it's okay.

62
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:10,700
Aretas.

63
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,702
Aretas.

64
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:09,384
Mama.

65
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,016
Come here, Marcus. Come here.

66
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:52,318
We're here to celebrate and to
raise a glass to one of our own.

67
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,289
And I sincerely hope
that someday

68
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,292
your namesake follows
in the footsteps

69
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,060
of his old-ass grandpa...

70
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:04,131
...to protect and serve
our fair city.

71
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,199
To Marcus.

72
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:07,433
To Marcus!

73
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:09,169
May the name Marcus Burnett

74
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:12,505
strike fear into the hearts
and minds of assholes

75
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:13,907
for years to come.

76
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,146
Thank y'all. Thank...
Thank you all.

77
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:23,951
Mike and I, we're going on 25
years of working these streets.

78
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,320
And I like to think
we made a difference.

79
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,487
You all are the best.

80
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,390
And I thank you.
It's been a real honor.

81
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,393
Marcus!

82
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:38,701
<i>Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!</i>

83
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:45,706
Daddy buried
that cash deep, huh?

84
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,342
If these are empty,
you're still gonna owe.

85
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,679
- Whoa!
- Mamma mia!

86
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,717
Buried treasure in the ocean.

87
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:59,585
I heard the stories,
<i>pero coño...</i>

88
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:03,023
Should cover the cost
of the materials we discussed.

89
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,425
And then some.

90
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:09,595
This is
what you get to keep.

91
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:10,766
What'd you say?

92
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,333
We had a deal.

93
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:16,003
I'm renegotiating.

94
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,072
Whoops.

95
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,516
Whoops.

96
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,153
Come here.

97
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:35,958
Look at me.

98
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,494
I don't renegotiate.

99
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,199
My family's taking back
management of this town.

100
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,468
We're gonna need some,
uh, loyal employees.

101
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,973
Who wants a job?

102
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,076
So how's your dental?

103
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:00,481
Say that again.

104
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:10,757
You give yourselves a raise.

105
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,928
You start with
that pile right there.

106
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,065
- Okay?
- Okay.

107
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,772
You work for me now.

108
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,140
Get your people to fall in line,

109
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:30,545
stay out of my fucking way,
and I won't kill you.

110
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:35,248
<i>Vamos, muchacho,</i>
get this money <i>¡Dale!</i>

111
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,316
<i>Vamos.</i>

112
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:39,955
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

113
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:42,789
Mama.

114
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,557
<i>Armando.</i>

115
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,439
I'm done, Mike.

116
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,907
Oh, here we go again.

117
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,976
No, this time it's different.

118
00:12:02,978 --> 00:12:05,278
When I looked into
that little baby's eyes,

119
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,579
something changed.

120
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,814
I want to spend my days

121
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:10,250
watching that little boy grow.

122
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:13,387
Man, Theresa does not want
your ass sitting at home,

123
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,022
getting fat and breaking shit.

124
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:18,692
You know, Mike, we got more time
behind us than in front.

125
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,094
It's time to make
some changes, for real.

126
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,997
You can miss me with that.
I'm living my best life.

127
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,433
You're dyeing
your goatee, Mike.

128
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:28,634
- What?
- You're dyeing your goatee.

129
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:30,669
I am not dyeing my goatee.

130
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,839
That's Midnight Cocoa Bean.
I recognize that.

131
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,342
- Go ahead with that shit.
- That ain't Midnight Cocoa...?

132
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,511
- Go ahead somewhere.
- Let me ask you something.

133
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:41,782
You want your legacy to be
muscle shirts and a body count?

134
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,051
Don't you know family
is all that matters?

135
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:45,584
Hey, granddaddy!

136
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,454
- Rita.
- Oh, no. Pop-pop.

137
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,755
He's going with Pop-pop.

138
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,090
- Pop-pop?
- Yeah.

139
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,124
Got pics, Pop-pop?

140
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,326
- Oh, you know I do, right?
- Let's see.

141
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,696
There you go.

142
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,964
Oh, my God, the ears!

143
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,966
Yeah, my grandbaby.
That's my grandbaby.

144
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,103
- I love him.
- Yeah.

145
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,172
And congrats to you,
lieutenant.

146
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:07,374
I hear Howard tapped you
to head up AMMO.

147
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,309
Wow, congrats.

148
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:10,544
What's AMMO?

149
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,746
Advanced Miami Metro Operations.

150
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,580
A small team trained
in new tactics

151
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:15,916
and investigative methods.

152
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,218
Gonna replace us old dogs.

153
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,921
- Or teach them some new tricks.
- Heh.

154
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:23,523
For real, Marcus.
So happy for you.

155
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,991
Thank you.

156
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:32,532
Hey, guys!

157
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:35,402
Hey! Everyone's here.

158
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,470
How are you?

159
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,038
Dumbass.

160
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,407
- What?
- She is perfect for you.

161
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,608
Smart as hell.

162
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,478
Confident. Ambitious.

163
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,213
She just wasn't the one for me.

164
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,747
- All right?
- What is for you?

165
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,916
Dying all alone
and sad as shit?

166
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,184
You just jealous.

167
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:53,153
How long you been married?
Twenty years?

168
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,288
- Twenty-six.
- Tell the truth.

169
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,023
When's the last time
you had sex?

170
00:13:57,025 --> 00:14:00,093
- None of your damn business.
- Exactly.

171
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:02,963
How many great women
are you gonna let go? Heh.

172
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,798
I mean, you get
a lot of loving,

173
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,933
but have you ever
really been in love?

174
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:11,304
Of course. I mean, yeah,
I was... I was in love.

175
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:12,772
One time.

176
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,841
A long, long time ago.

177
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:16,143
You never told me.

178
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:18,512
Nigga, I don't tell you
all my business.

179
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:20,046
Look, all you need to know

180
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,216
is that I'll be running down
criminals till I'm 100.

181
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,385
You the last brother
that needs to be talking

182
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:27,754
about running down anyone
after the hospital.

183
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,655
The hospital?
What you talking about?

184
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:31,091
What happened at the hospital?

185
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,792
Running to see baby Marcus.

186
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:34,394
I dusted your ass.

187
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:38,098
You spent that run staring
at my one good ass-cheek, Mike.

188
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,101
You're saying that
you actually outran me?

189
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,837
- You beat me in a footrace?
- It's been said.

190
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,071
Oh, hell, no.

191
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:46,873
Nothing sadder than old men

192
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,041
revisiting the past.

193
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,676
Whoa, hey, no stretching.

194
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,344
Stretching is cheating.

195
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:55,148
- Hey, who you got, Cap?
- I got 50 on a torn ACL.

196
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,250
I ain't running for free.

197
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,986
- What's the bet?
- I win, we lay it down.

198
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,956
We turn in our papers
and we retire.

199
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,424
All right, well, <i>when</i> I win,

200
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:06,860
you stop all this
foolish retirement talk.

201
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,995
We ride this thing
till the wheels fall off.

202
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:11,531
- Bad boys for life.
- Uh, bad boys

203
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,999
ain't really boys anymore.

204
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:15,101
Hey, Cap, just
have the ambo on standby.

205
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,737
Old boy gonna need
fluids and oxygen.

206
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,873
- That's him, Cap. That's him.
- Okay.

207
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,809
On your mark, get set, go!

208
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:24,978
- Go, Marcus! You got this!
- Where you at?

209
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,347
- You got this! Breathe!
- Uh-oh, where you at?

210
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,481
Come on, baby!

211
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,323
Breathe, baby, breathe! Go!

212
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,823
Where you at, baby?!

213
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,602
Mike!

214
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:59,145
Mike. Mike! Oh, shit!
Get some help!

215
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:04,150
I got an officer down.
We're on Ocean Drive, 700 block.

216
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,952
- Hold on. Hey.
- Gunshot...

217
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:07,254
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

218
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,522
- Just get... Get some help!
- Who did this?!

219
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:10,657
Who the fuck did this?!

220
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,325
Driving a motorcycle...

221
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,094
Come on. Don't do this.

222
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:15,929
- Mike, stay with us.
- Come on.

223
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,364
Get an ambulance!

224
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,666
- Come on, Mike. Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

225
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,901
Phone... I got him on the phone.

226
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,507
You gonna be all right.
You gonna make it through this.

227
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,109
Come on, man. Stay with us, man.

228
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:31,911
Come on, Mike. I'm right here.

229
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,637
Dear God...

230
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,240
it's me, Marcus.

231
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,779
You blessed me
with a lot of stuff lately.

232
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:07,981
<i>I know I haven't been
to church in a while.</i>

233
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,949
<i>Probably Easter.</i>

234
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,918
<i>But I ain't gonna lie,</i>

235
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,587
<i>I wasn't paying attention.</i>

236
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,524
I haven't lost faith.

237
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,927
It's just...

238
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,730
I was ashamed

239
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:24,765
at some of the stuff
we had to do.

240
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:28,001
<i>I know "thou shall not kill,"</i>

241
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,706
<i>but they were bad guys,
all of them.</i>

242
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:36,076
<i>You know, Mike hardly had
a life yet.</i>

243
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,411
<i>No wife, no kids.</i>

244
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:42,182
<i>If you could just please
find it in your heart</i>

245
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,918
to give him
one more chance, man.

246
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,421
<i>Straight up,
he's my best friend.</i>

247
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:49,622
<i>My brother.</i>

248
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:52,425
If you just spare him,

249
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,594
I swear to you,

250
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:58,565
I will put no more violence
in this world.

251
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,567
<i>A drive-by shooting</i>

252
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:03,771
<i>has a famed Miami-Dade police
officer fighting for his life.</i>

253
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,039
<i>Witnesses report hearing shots</i>

254
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,607
<i>and a blacked-out bike
fleeing the scene.</i>

255
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,677
<i>Lowrey remains in critical...</i>

256
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,479
Guys, let's run Cap through
what we got on the case.

257
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,048
Kelly, run us
through ballistics.

258
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,118
So the slugs
in Officer Lowrey were SS190.

259
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,587
P90 fires that caliber,
the Herstal.

260
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,156
But these were subsonic
5.7-by-28s, custom rounds.

261
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,125
I wanna know who made
those bullets.

262
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:26,526
We are watching 4chan

263
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,162
and cross-referencing
players in the market

264
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:31,131
with the feds' red lines.

265
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,301
Mike's like a son to me.

266
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,838
I want this asshole.

267
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,313
This is personal for me too.

268
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,649
Let's bring every single thing
we got, all right?

269
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:50,652
You got it.

270
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,777
<i>Retired DA Rodrigo Vargas</i>

271
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:51,244
<i>was gunned down this afternoon.</i>

272
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:02,790
<i>The DEA is mourning</i>

273
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,257
<i>Jack Weber this evening,</i>

274
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,926
<i>a 20-year forensic investigator</i>

275
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,494
<i>for the agency in Miami.</i>

276
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:17,905
There you are.

277
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:21,174
<i>In yet another
execution-style homicide...</i>

278
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,344
<i>Judge Leon Sorenson was shot</i>

279
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,981
<i>outside his courthouse
late Wednesday.</i>

280
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:42,228
<i>The war on
law enforcement continues.</i>

281
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,165
Three other law
enforcement personnel

282
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,902
have been killed
that could be linked.

283
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:51,170
- It's a war on the goddamn law.
- All the same shooter as Mike.

284
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:54,107
- Connected how?
- Traffic cams, witnesses,

285
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,211
tire treads all put the same
blacked-out bike at the scene.

286
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:31,311
We want to thank
you for joining us today.

287
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:33,816
It means a lot to the family.

288
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:37,918
And I now pronounce you
man and wife.

289
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,119
You may kiss the bride.

290
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:46,659
I really gotta
stop crying like this.

291
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,810
Hey, you guys are great.

292
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:06,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our first toast.

293
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,785
I'm going to bring up
Officer Mike Lowrey,

294
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:15,321
affectionately known
as Uncle Mike.

295
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,391
All right. Let's do this.

296
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,844
First off, Reggie,

297
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:40,346
I am shocked that you
are even still here.

298
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,751
I remember your first date
with Megan,

299
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:47,988
and trust me, me and Marcus did
everything we could possibly do

300
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,523
to make sure
you never came back.

301
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:54,293
But I'm telling you,
love is hard.

302
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:57,196
And your relationship
will be tested.

303
00:22:57,198 --> 00:23:02,803
And your father and I have
weathered storm after storm.

304
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:06,539
And we have a mantra
that we say to each other

305
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,075
in our darkest days,

306
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:11,812
and it always seems
to bring us back together.

307
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:15,751
And, Reggie, Megan, I would
like to share it with you.

308
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:18,752
We ride together,

309
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:20,586
- we die together.
- We die together.

310
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,622
Bad boys for life!

311
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:38,708
No.

312
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:42,442
- No, what?
- You know what.

313
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:44,577
The minute I heard
you were still breathing,

314
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,313
I've been waiting
for this shit to hit the fan.

315
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,582
Look at me, Mike. No.

316
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:51,350
You don't know
what I'm gonna say.

317
00:23:51,352 --> 00:23:53,789
I know you. I know
what you're gonna say.

318
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:57,191
AMMO's got this.

319
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:58,591
AMMO?

320
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:02,162
Come on, Cap. AMMO?
With all due respect,

321
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,798
AMMO is a high school musical...

322
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,968
boy band with guns.
They don't even have shit.

323
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,771
How do you know what they have
or don't have? They have!

324
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:13,439
- What do they have? What?
- They have.

325
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:15,308
The bullets
they carved out of you,

326
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,946
they were custom rounds
for the P90 Herstal.

327
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,480
AMMO's gonna find the dealer

328
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,450
- that supplied your shooter.
- How?

329
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:26,053
State-of-the-art police work,
that's how.

330
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,455
Cap, look... All right.

331
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:29,759
- Sir.
- Sir?

332
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,393
You are desperate.

333
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:35,095
But I can't.

334
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:36,295
Mike, I can't let you

335
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:38,364
- investigate your own case.
- All right.

336
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:40,266
Let me investigate
the Vargas case.

337
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,902
No. The last thing I need

338
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:45,139
is having IAD shoving
a Hubble telescope up my ass

339
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,672
for a full-on colonoscopy.

340
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:49,877
- You know the rules.
- Fuck the rules, Cap.

341
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,816
Come on. Put me and Marcus
on this shit.

342
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,118
Have you talked to your partner?

343
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,157
You retired?

344
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,792
It's my daughter's wedding.

345
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,927
Do we have to do this right now?

346
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,695
Uh, yeah.

347
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:11,765
- I told you I was retiring.
- Wha...? What?

348
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,835
Wait, nah, hold up.
We raced, you lost.

349
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:18,138
Now you reneging? What happened
to bad boys for life?

350
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,406
Yeah, for life. It's off.

351
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:21,842
You died.

352
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:24,278
What? The hell
are you talking about?

353
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,413
You coded out, Mike,
three times.

354
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:28,882
Marcus, look,

355
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:31,484
this motherfucker
stole something from me

356
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:32,753
and I need it back.

357
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:35,022
What did he take from you, Mike?

358
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:36,355
You're still here.

359
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:38,424
All he took from you
was the legend,

360
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:39,827
"Bulletproof Mike."

361
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,095
But I saw you
on the ground bleeding.

362
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:45,232
You're human,
just like the rest of us.

363
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:47,600
Yeah, his ass bleeds too.

364
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:49,535
Heh, I'm telling you, Mike.

365
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:52,840
You go out there for vengeance,
you gonna get someone killed.

366
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,476
Oh, we definitely
bringing some smoke.

367
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:58,078
That fool put holes in me!

368
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,681
And you're filling them
with hate, Mike.

369
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:05,052
Look, you need to start thinking
about your karma, man.

370
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:06,619
This was a sign.

371
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,156
A sign, yeah.
A sign to turn up.

372
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,725
I'm supposed to bow down?
Give this bitch a pass?

373
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:15,295
"Turn up"? What are you, 20?

374
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:18,165
You need to turn that shit off.

375
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,867
You know, Mike, heh...

376
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,903
Rita called me every day
you were in the hospital.

377
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:26,039
There's something
still there, a future.

378
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:29,442
My future is hunting
this motherfucker.

379
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:30,980
Well, it's not mine.

380
00:26:32,513 --> 00:26:35,548
All right. So let me
get this straight.

381
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:41,188
So somebody get to dump my ass
out in the street

382
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,689
and you ain't gonna do shit?

383
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,392
You just gonna quit?

384
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:49,462
How dare you, man?

385
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,967
I sat by your bedside.

386
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:57,371
I wiped the drool
off your chin, Mike.

387
00:26:57,373 --> 00:27:00,073
Don't disrespect me like that
because you don't know.

388
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:03,076
All right, all right.
All right, man.

389
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:07,681
Look, Marcus,

390
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:09,484
I'm asking you.

391
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:13,655
I'm begging you, man.

392
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:16,825
I need this.

393
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,695
Bad boys...

394
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,597
one last time.

395
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:32,841
No, Mike.

396
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,945
No.

397
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:17,652
Mama.

398
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,527
<i>Video of a
shooting of a Miami detective</i>

399
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,298
<i>has surfaced online, going
viral in a matter of hours.</i>

400
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,501
<i>The video first appeared
on the darknet</i>

401
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:10,303
<i>and soon spread
to mainstream social media.</i>

402
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:13,674
<i>Authorities believe the shooter
uploaded the video himself.</i>

403
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,578
Too slow.

404
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,216
You're slipping.

405
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:25,218
Still had the key.

406
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,887
What's up?

407
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:29,356
Howard told me
you wanted back in.

408
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,024
Obviously, that can't happen.

409
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:33,326
Says who?

410
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:34,593
Michael...

411
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:36,797
you got shot.

412
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,732
Yeah, people keep
reminding me of that.

413
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:41,368
Well, why do you think
that is? Huh?

414
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,736
Oh, you shrinking me now.

415
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:44,938
You say that
when you don't wanna get real.

416
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,744
No, I always say that
when you start shrinking me.

417
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,746
Hey, this is the type of case

418
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:54,381
that AMMO was built for.

419
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,615
You just have to trust me,
that's all.

420
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,952
Oh, come on. What?

421
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,887
Why you always go there?

422
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,491
This don't have nothing to do
with me trusting you or not.

423
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:07,427
- Oh, no?
- No.

424
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,529
Are you even healed?

425
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,231
- Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.
- Yeah?

426
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,200
- You sure you're fine?
- Oh, shit. Rita.

427
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:16,069
- You sure you're fine? Hey.
- Rita. Stop. Rita.

428
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,772
This is me
you're trying to bullshit.

429
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,507
If you get involved,

430
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:23,677
you're gonna make mistakes
you can't take back.

431
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,645
- <i>Hasta el fuego.</i>
- <i>"Hasta el fuego."</i>

432
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,949
What does that mean?
Where'd you get that?

433
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:32,419
Until you burn? Until you die?

434
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:36,690
You know me well enough to know
not to ask me to quit.

435
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:39,627
It's because I know you,
I'm asking.

436
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:42,729
Because I care about you.

437
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:47,703
As a friend.

438
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:51,106
Let us handle this.

439
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:49,529
Shit. Alexa,
turn down the volume.

440
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,508
Oh! Oh!

441
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,744
Oh!

442
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,212
Ah! Marcus!

443
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,214
You need to get out
of the house!

444
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,515
Sorry, baby.

445
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:09,783
So sorry.

446
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,418
How about a spa day?

447
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,868
- Is that Manny's car?
- Yeah.

448
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,875
- Where's Manny?
- He's in the back.

449
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,722
Oh, shit. Mike Lowrey.
What are you doing here, man?

450
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,222
You look like a ghost, man.

451
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:51,958
You know they say
you're dead, fuckboy.

452
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,660
I gotta show you something.

453
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:54,995
The streets is talking.

454
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:56,796
That cop shit
ain't working for you.

455
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,832
Come work for me
at Manny's Prime Rib.

456
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,801
See, look, you get dropped
right here.

457
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:03,370
And guess what.

458
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:06,741
You're trending worldwide.

459
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:09,175
Ow! My fucking hand, man!

460
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:11,978
Yo, this ain't
no fucking cop shit, man!

461
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,880
What happened
about reading my rights?

462
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,282
This is not how
it's supposed to go.

463
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,250
You're supposed
to ask me questions,

464
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,853
and then I tell you,
"Go fuck yourself!"

465
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,588
What the fuck, man?

466
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,123
Fuck! Ow!

467
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,457
My fucking hand, man.

468
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:27,695
P90 Herstals, custom,
who's making them?

469
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:29,697
Mike, I'm not
in the game no more.

470
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,966
Oh, nah? Okay. My bad.

471
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:36,002
Ah! Mike, Mike,
fucking chill, man.

472
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:38,104
So all these vegans in Miami,

473
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:40,273
and you want me to believe
that that hot rod

474
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:42,342
outside comes
from selling pork chops?

475
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:44,210
I work at Manny's.
I'm a family man,

476
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:48,083
- and I'm a hardworking man.
- Oh. I got you...

477
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:56,923
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

478
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:59,659
Did you just get pig fat
on my suit?

479
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,227
Sorry, Mike.

480
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:02,529
Sorry.

481
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,197
No! Booker Grassie!

482
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:06,933
That's the name! Booker Grassie!

483
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:09,469
That's the name, man!

484
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:15,508
Yo, Mike! Mike! Yo, Mike!

485
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,913
The handcuffs, man!

486
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,948
Booker Grassie.
Only arms dealer in Miami

487
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,884
customizing for the P90 Herstal.

488
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:26,486
- What'd I tell you?
- I know.

489
00:34:26,488 --> 00:34:29,089
I'm not supposed
to investigate my own case.

490
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:32,359
But this fool posted a video
of him trying to kill me.

491
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,828
I saw it.

492
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,628
I can go after him
vigilante style,

493
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,831
or you can bring me in.

494
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,934
Or I could shoot you myself.

495
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:42,135
Fuck me!

496
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:45,140
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

497
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,345
- If...
- Mm-hm.

498
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:55,215
...I bring you in, to consult,

499
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,217
and you go cowboy on me,

500
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,220
I need you to comprehend
the level-five shitstorm

501
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,789
I will be drowning in.

502
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,824
No gold-plated watch.

503
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,425
No cop retirement village.

504
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:08,228
I'm sticking myself out
on a skinny limb!

505
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,866
Scratch that.
A twig in an ice storm!

506
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:14,567
Me, on the edge, "tithering."

507
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,035
You mean, teetering?

508
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:17,705
That's what I said!

509
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:20,106
And picture me very fat!

510
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,509
Uh, think I got the image, Cap.

511
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:25,378
- What is he doing here?
- He's gonna be helping out.

512
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,480
- I don't want him.
- I'm not working with her.

513
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:30,785
He's not. You're not.
He's consulting. It's your show.

514
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:32,018
- Captain, come on.
- Wait.

515
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
I know you guys
got history together,

516
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:36,456
- so let's not make it personal.
- Personal?

517
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,258
I'm the only one
being professional.

518
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,660
This is not détente. I'm
informing you of my decision.

519
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,128
This is a bad idea.

520
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,532
He's gonna investigate
this case, no matter what!

521
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:51,772
So this way, we keep him on
a short leash, we control him.

522
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,941
Uh, I'm standing
right here, Cap.

523
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,111
Mike will consult.

524
00:35:58,113 --> 00:35:59,880
He'll observe.

525
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,047
That's it.

526
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,449
Now, what do you got?

527
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,718
Picked up chatter.
The dealer we think customed

528
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,887
those rounds,
he's making another sale.

529
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,321
- Booker Grassie.
- Uh-huh.

530
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,557
You share any other
confidential information?

531
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,426
What? Not me.
He's the one that told me.

532
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:16,296
Guess my old tricks
still work a little bit.

533
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:19,065
You're a distraction.

534
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:22,502
You see that?
That's what I like, teamwork.

535
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:26,039
Already
a beautiful relationship.

536
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,208
<i>The video,
presumed to be posted by the shooter...</i>

537
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,544
Guys. This is
Detective Michael Lowrey.

538
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:34,380
He'll be joining us
as an adviser only.

539
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,649
<i>Police have no suspects.</i>

540
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,420
<i>And the shooter
is still at lar...</i>

541
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,388
Nice to meet you all as well.

542
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,891
- Thrilled to see you've had...
- Sweet.

543
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,860
I am much better now. Thank you.

544
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,093
I am so sorry about that.

545
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:49,562
- You look good, Michael.
- Uh, look,

546
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:52,265
she calls me
by my whole government name,

547
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:54,300
but everybody...
You can just do Mike.

548
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:55,870
- For sure, Mike.
- Got it, Mike.

549
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,203
Yeah, sure thing, Michael.

550
00:36:57,205 --> 00:37:00,406
- Ah, so you're that guy.
- Hey, there's always one.

551
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:03,476
- Yeah. Right up till there's not.
- What's that supposed to mean?

552
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:05,880
It's Mike Lowrey, okay?
Be cool. For once.

553
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,380
Let's load up!

554
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,384
Ooh.

555
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:14,521
Think I might be able to hang
out with you guys after all.

556
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:18,558
Nah, nah, that ain't the one.
We're taking The Crawdaddy.

557
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,995
Wait until you see the inside.

558
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:23,630
- You need any help, Gramps?
- Go ahead somewhere, boy.

559
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,401
Look at you trying to be
all cool and shit.

560
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:33,908
Okay, everybody
is way too serious.

561
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,308
Raids are supposed to be fun.

562
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,244
They're like field trips
with guns.

563
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:42,016
This is not a raid.
It's surveillance.

564
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,583
Surveillance? Right.

565
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:46,152
Meaning we're just gonna
watch the crime.

566
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:47,520
We'll record him in the deal

567
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:49,389
and bring him in
facing serious time.

568
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,926
Then we'll get him to talk
and he's gonna tell us

569
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,626
everything that we need to know.

570
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:57,932
Or since he's gonna be there
and we're gonna be there,

571
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,066
I mean, we could just grab him.

572
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,168
Well, thank you for your input.

573
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,804
Okay.

574
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:05,005
Listen up.

575
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,372
Booker Grassie is the guy

576
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:09,409
that sold the bullets
we took out of Michael.

577
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:12,645
Hey, look, um, you think
you could stop

578
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:14,882
calling me Michael
in front of everybody?

579
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:16,384
It's your name.

580
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:18,821
Okay.

581
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,623
<i>Relax and clear your mind.</i>

582
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:25,826
<i>Use God's inspiration</i>

583
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:27,861
<i>to bring people
peace and tranquility</i>

584
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:31,600
<i>by penetrating their souls
with your heart.</i>

585
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:42,241
We're here.

586
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:43,978
Excuse me, Mr. Lowrey.

587
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,681
- Just need to get past, please.
- Sure thing, buddy.

588
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:52,287
Uh, you're the tech, huh? Jeez.

589
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:55,956
They just leave you
in the van?

590
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,926
Yeah, I'm more, uh...
More comfortable in here.

591
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,828
Got it.

592
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,161
Sending in Big Barry.

593
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,563
You're not Big Barry?

594
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:06,399
He's our, uh,
surveillance drone.

595
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:09,268
Ah, so you send the drone in.

596
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,207
Let's fly.

597
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:22,417
I guess Barry gets
to have all the fun.

598
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,686
There. Black pickup truck.

599
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,988
- That's our H-77 Boyz.
- Who are they?

600
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,092
These guys are definitely
from out of town. Trying to step up.

601
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:34,730
I need wide angle, whole deal.

602
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:43,906
Zoom in.

603
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:52,715
Booker's hooking them up
with a crate of 5.7-by-28s.

604
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:56,418
- That's Booker Grassie.
- There's our deal.

605
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,317
Audio.

606
00:39:58,319 --> 00:39:59,753
<i>Here it is.</i>

607
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,755
These will put a hole
through anyone

608
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:04,624
and anything
you point your gun at.

609
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:07,193
- <i>I guarantee my product.</i>
- He's right there, Rita.

610
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:08,929
- We can grab him.
- No.

611
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:11,664
I'm not risking
the collateral damage.

612
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,034
- Let's move.
- Let's wait.

613
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,869
- You're the boss.
- Yeah, I know.

614
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,237
- That's what I just said.
- I just confirmed it.

615
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,141
- Okay.
- You two used to date, right?

616
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:22,442
- Sort of.
- Not really.

617
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:24,512
<i>Need to see the cash.</i>

618
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,948
- <i>See the cash.</i>
- Wait.

619
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,483
Back. Go back.
Right there. That guy.

620
00:40:30,485 --> 00:40:32,019
- What?
- <i>I need to see it.</i>

621
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,687
The bag is empty.

622
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,056
There's no money in the bag.
It's a rip.

623
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,157
<i>I need to see yours.</i>

624
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,491
They're gonna kill...
It's a rip.

625
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:39,860
- Michael.
- We need Booker alive!

626
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,461
Michael, get back here!

627
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:44,330
Shit. Kelly, go. Go!

628
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:54,375
Get me body cams.

629
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,756
<i>Michael, do not engage</i>

630
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,359
<i>until we have the rest
of the team in position.</i>

631
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,299
Can we count the cash, or what?

632
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:23,638
This is a nice song.
Put it louder.

633
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,878
Now!

634
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:37,543
Put it down! Put it down!

635
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:39,012
Can you hear me?

636
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,380
I'm gonna need you
to lay me down some cover.

637
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:43,050
We're coming to you.

638
00:42:43,052 --> 00:42:46,753
All right. You wanna live,
you stay with me.

639
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:49,790
Fuck with me
and I'm gonna kill you.

640
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:52,159
Coming at you on three.

641
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,493
Bring the truck! Grab the merch!

642
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:59,565
One, two, three.

643
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:33,869
Shit.

644
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,105
Shit.

645
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:40,040
Shit. Hey. Hey. Booker.

646
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:43,143
Booker, look at me.
Hey. Hey. Don't die.

647
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:47,147
P90 Herstals. P90 Herstals,
who's the buyer?

648
00:43:47,149 --> 00:43:48,650
Oh, shit.

649
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:57,190
- Hey, hey. Booker. Booker.
- Michael?

650
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,927
Hey, get an ambulance in here
now. Get the paramedics.

651
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,962
- Booker. Booker.
- Uh, Michael.

652
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:04,298
- Just bring them in.
- Calm down.

653
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,934
Hey, just do what I ask you
for once, please!

654
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,335
He's dead!

655
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:15,375
- Is that Diego or his twin?
- Shh!

656
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:16,777
Yeah, yeah, his twin.

657
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,279
Carmelita, no, no, no.

658
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,654
- Who this?
- <i>It's Carver Remy.</i>

659
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:30,656
Look here, I'm busy, all right?

660
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:32,926
Don't waste my time, Carver.
Leave me alone.

661
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:35,162
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

662
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:36,562
Keep an eye on my baby.

663
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:39,199
- <i>Marcus.</i>
- I'm retired.

664
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:40,466
Only rats I talk to

665
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:41,835
are in my basement.

666
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:45,671
- Carmelita shot the wrong twin!
- Oh, shit.

667
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,874
The guy who shot Mike,
he's trying to kill me.

668
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:49,409
- What?
- <i>I'm serious.</i>

669
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:51,610
<i>A guy on a black bike's
been tracking me.</i>

670
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,180
<i>The one on the news. It's him.</i>

671
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,949
- Bullshit.
- <i>Marcus, would I lie to you?</i>

672
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:59,119
Yes. That's why we stopped
using your ass as a CI.

673
00:44:59,121 --> 00:45:01,554
- I'm telling you, it's him.
- What do you want?

674
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:03,790
<i>Protective custody. To not die.</i>

675
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:06,525
<i>Please, man.
Use me as bait, whatever.</i>

676
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:09,062
You want this guy?
He's coming for me.

677
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:11,398
- You talk to Mike?
- <i>I called you.</i>

678
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,870
<i>Nineteenth and Miami.
Third floor. I'll be waiting.</i>

679
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,081
What did I say? No, no.
What did I say?

680
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:31,018
I said consult.
I said observe. I...

681
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,586
Look at this... This mess.
It's carnage!

682
00:45:33,588 --> 00:45:36,589
I didn't do all this shit.
They did this to each other.

683
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,792
Wait, wait, wait.
You didn't shoot anybody?

684
00:45:38,794 --> 00:45:41,061
- You know I shot some people.
- Yeah.

685
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:43,263
- Look, they had already started.
- What...?

686
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:45,098
Ah, Jesus. Mike, you promised.

687
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,300
- No, no, I didn't promise.
- You promised.

688
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:49,069
- I said I could picture you...
- Yeah.

689
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:51,637
...on a limb, fat as hell,
with sharks and some shit.

690
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:52,806
Right. That's a promise.

691
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:53,940
We were here to watch.

692
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,409
What? Yeah, and I saw.

693
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:56,777
All right, Cap, look.

694
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:59,880
The bag is empty,
all right? No cash.

695
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,982
The guy reached up
and scratched his nose.

696
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:03,817
I saw it had no weight to it.

697
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:06,853
- That's very impressive, sir.
- Yeah. See, I like that one.

698
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:09,356
If I hadn't come in, Grassie
was a dead man for sure.

699
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:11,892
That's a relief, because
your guy's in a body bag

700
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,394
- and he sure looks dead.
- Cap. Ah...

701
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,529
Good job, Mikey.

702
00:46:15,531 --> 00:46:17,898
Hey, look. Young boy, seriously.

703
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,232
Let me tell you something.

704
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,201
Stay in a child's place,
all right?

705
00:46:21,203 --> 00:46:23,937
Spare me the street knowledge,
grandpa. Nobody asked.

706
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:25,638
Just because
I fucked your mother

707
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
- don't make me your grandpa?
- Oh, oh, oh.

708
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:29,109
- Fucked my mother?
- That's enough.

709
00:46:29,111 --> 00:46:30,844
- Stop.
- You got me fucked up.

710
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:32,446
- Old ass.
- Stand down! Let's go.

711
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:33,747
- You better go on.
- Let's go.

712
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,782
I will knock your ass
clean the fuck out.

713
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:37,250
- Knock me out. Hit me.
- What am I,

714
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,618
a nursery school teacher?
Come on, let's go!

715
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,620
Shit. I got time today.

716
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:44,623
Cool down. Keep walking.

717
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,861
- Excuse me, sir.
- Go ahead, man.

718
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:49,396
- Do you guys want a...?
- No, go.

719
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:50,866
Just go ahead somewhere.

720
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:53,735
What?

721
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:06,647
What, quitter?

722
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,087
This is some sad shit.

723
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,721
Where the hell is your ride?

724
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:16,692
Girls took it to the spa.

725
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,566
You all right?

726
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:28,802
I'm fine. You all right?

727
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,772
Never felt better.

728
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,241
I mean, you could,

729
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,409
if you wanted to,

730
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:39,012
just do the speed limit.

731
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,949
You let a Prius pass us.

732
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,486
And what is that? What, you got
your balls tucked up in there?

733
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,289
Hey. You know what?
Neither one of my balls

734
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,793
wanna be here
with your stupid ass.

735
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:01,067
You brought Little Marcus
on a murder investigation?

736
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:03,336
We're dropping him at the spa.

737
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,205
Dropping him off at the spa?

738
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:08,742
Carver is scared.
He is not gonna wait, man.

739
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:10,043
It's on the way, Mike.

740
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:11,945
And what's the person
that shot me

741
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:14,347
want with a snitch
like Carver Remy anyway?

742
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,286
I'm taking you
to find out, motherfucker.

743
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:20,754
Sorry about that, Little Marcus.

744
00:48:20,756 --> 00:48:22,656
Pop-pop shouldn't be swearing
like that.

745
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:25,892
Only when you're dealing
with people like Mike Lowrey,

746
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:28,562
you got no fucking choice.

747
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,098
Sorry. There I go again.

748
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:41,741
- Take the baby in.
- Oh, I ain't going in there.

749
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:44,444
Then you ain't gonna find out
who tried to kill you.

750
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,113
See, if I go in there,
I know who's gonna kill me.

751
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:49,182
- Theresa Burnett.
- Stop fucking around.

752
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:50,650
Take your baby. Go ahead.

753
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:53,119
Mike, Carver's scared.

754
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:54,921
He ain't gonna wait all day.

755
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:56,158
All right.

756
00:48:57,192 --> 00:48:58,992
All right.

757
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:15,242
Uh-uh. No. Mike! Mike!

758
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,544
Tell Marcus I'm gonna kill him!

759
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:18,912
Go, go!

760
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,114
- Go, go, go!
- What'd she do? What'd you do?

761
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:23,516
- Is she coming? Oh, shit!
- Go, go, go!

762
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:26,820
Mike, you known Theresa
a long time.

763
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:28,488
How pissed would you say
she was?

764
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,091
- What you mean? Like, one to 10?
- Yeah, 10 being...

765
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,826
Like when I broke up
with your sister?

766
00:49:32,828 --> 00:49:34,729
No. That was me at a 10.

767
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:38,031
- Why would you bring that up?
- All right. I'm just trying to...

768
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,566
No, a Theresa 10 would be...

769
00:49:39,568 --> 00:49:42,369
Me that time you spilled
Frappuccino in my Ferrari.

770
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:44,739
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
That's it.

771
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:46,906
Uh, she's probably
like a nine, then.

772
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:50,477
- A nine? Oh, sh...
- Yeah, man.

773
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,112
Oh, shit.

774
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,247
Better make it a 10.

775
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:55,982
Forgot to give her
the baby wipes.

776
00:49:55,984 --> 00:49:57,384
Oh, tragedy.

777
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,957
Are you stopping?

778
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,493
Dude, that was a yellow light.

779
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:09,562
We are in a hurry. Come on...

780
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,601
Oh, what? You embarrassed
to be seen like this?

781
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:18,438
We got Mike Lowrey here!

782
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,844
Mike Lowrey in a Nissan Quest!

783
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:26,179
Nobody gives a shit, Mike.

784
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:28,984
He's... He's my Uber driver!

785
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,285
A big part of fighting crime

786
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:34,387
is being ahead of the criminals.

787
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:36,323
You don't have
to stop for pigeons.

788
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,227
You just drive up to them.
They'll fly away.

789
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:47,802
That better be a safe...

790
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:49,338
or a piano.

791
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,739
Oh!

792
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:55,408
- This is my wife's car!
- And that's fucking Carver Remy!

793
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,278
You don't know that's Carver
Remy. That could be anybody.

794
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,348
- Cover the front door!
- I'm retired!

795
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,551
I'm a civilian!

796
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:05,352
Oh...

797
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,725
This is a sign.

798
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:12,459
It's a sign from God.

799
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,894
Oh!

800
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:16,896
Oh, shoot.

801
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:18,699
She knows.

802
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,467
She always knows.

803
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,610
I need 315
at the Broadmoor Hotel.

804
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:34,349
Fuck!

805
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,394
God, I know I asked you
to help Mike out before...

806
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:49,498
but he's really
getting his ass whupped.

807
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,433
Lord, give me a sign.

808
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,084
What the hell are you doing?
Mike!

809
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:23,596
Shit!

810
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:03,338
You okay?

811
00:53:04,707 --> 00:53:07,474
I'm better than you gonna be
when Theresa see this car.

812
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,061
<i>Armando...</i>

813
00:54:05,968 --> 00:54:09,469
Pass it! Pass it! Thattagirl!

814
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,707
Thattagirl, Callie!

815
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,644
Make them wanna play soccer!

816
00:54:16,746 --> 00:54:20,081
- You're done, Mike.
- Yeah, I know.

817
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:22,482
No!

818
00:54:22,484 --> 00:54:24,919
If she fouls you,
you foul her back!

819
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,419
- Yes!
- Yeah.

820
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:29,823
So there's this...
This Buddhist guy, right?

821
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:33,226
And, uh, you know,
mountain man, way up high,

822
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,295
going down
this long winding road.

823
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:38,331
And out of nowhere,
this other guy

824
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:42,002
is riding a horse
right toward him.

825
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:44,370
He's Buddhist too, I think.

826
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:46,272
Actually, I'm not sure.

827
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:48,676
Just let them
both be Buddhist, Cap.

828
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:52,579
Okay, fine.
So the guy on the horse

829
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,348
is riding toward our guy so fast

830
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,417
that our guy's gotta
get out of the way,

831
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,352
so as not to be trampled
by the horse.

832
00:54:59,354 --> 00:55:01,654
And the guy gets up,
all dusty, and he goes:

833
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:04,659
"Hey, where the fuck
are you going?"

834
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:09,029
And our guy on the horse,
he says:

835
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:11,664
"I don't know!

836
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:14,202
Ask the horse!"

837
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:18,538
Ask the horse? Huh.

838
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,339
Exactly.

839
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:20,808
Yes! Yes!

840
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,611
See that face...? That. That?

841
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,013
That's it.

842
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:27,883
That was my face.

843
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:32,352
The horse represents

844
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:36,122
all of our fears and traumas.

845
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:40,060
And it's got us running around
a hundred miles an hour,

846
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:45,298
to the point where we can't
even answer a simple question.

847
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,402
"Where are you going?"

848
00:55:49,939 --> 00:55:52,072
Where are you going, Mike?

849
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:57,276
No, Callie!

850
00:55:57,278 --> 00:55:58,444
Don't pass!

851
00:55:58,446 --> 00:56:00,382
Shooters shoot!

852
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,125
Kid's got the family curse.

853
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:13,326
Mike...

854
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,963
you gotta get control
of your life.

855
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:17,798
You gotta grab the reins

856
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,737
before your horse
runs you off a cliff.

857
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,015
Come over for dinner.
Callie would love to see you.

858
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,118
I'll read you a Buddhist story.
I got a book full of them.

859
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,953
Wait, you gonna be
cooking again?

860
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:41,521
- Hell, yeah.
- Ooh...

861
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,424
- All right. We'll order pizza.
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

862
00:56:51,499 --> 00:56:52,902
Bingo.

863
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:57,639
- Cap!
- I don't know! Go, go, go!

864
00:56:59,742 --> 00:57:00,710
Get him.

865
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:07,282
I can help. What does he need?

866
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:10,920
- Shoot.
- <i>Cállate.</i>

867
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:14,822
- Through the bitch.
- No, move.

868
00:57:14,824 --> 00:57:16,422
- Get behind the car.
- I can help.

869
00:57:16,424 --> 00:57:18,560
Move! Get behind the car!

870
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:23,329
What's wrong with you, man?

871
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:25,199
You had that shot.

872
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:26,634
No innocents.

873
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,872
You crazy, man, you know that?

874
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:34,174
Three-fifteen. Shots fired.
Officer down.

875
00:57:34,176 --> 00:57:35,978
Jose Marti Park.

876
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,146
We need Air One on a three.

877
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:41,115
This is Detective Mike Lowrey.

878
00:57:41,117 --> 00:57:43,251
The captain is down.

879
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:46,756
The captain is down.

880
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,309
Ready!

881
00:58:11,346 --> 00:58:13,279
Aim! Fire!

882
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:17,318
Ready! Aim! Fire!

883
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,288
Ready! Aim! Fire!

884
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,853
You were right, man.

885
00:58:52,353 --> 00:58:55,925
You said if I went out there,
I was gonna get somebody killed.

886
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,839
One last time?

887
00:59:47,243 --> 00:59:48,911
One last time.

888
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:35,956
I ran a suspicious
financial report on Booker.

889
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,126
All his LLC fronts
have the same accountant.

890
01:00:39,128 --> 01:00:41,795
Picante Jenkins, CPA.

891
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:44,599
Yep. You don't meet
too many Picantes.

892
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,108
So we just gonna do
a knock-and-talk?

893
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,877
Yeah.

894
01:00:56,879 --> 01:01:00,314
Whoa! What the hell
is all that?

895
01:01:00,316 --> 01:01:01,982
What you talking about?

896
01:01:01,984 --> 01:01:05,152
Mike, you don't need
a grenade launcher.

897
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:06,820
Yeah, but I want one.

898
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:08,922
He's an accountant, Mike.

899
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:11,457
Look, Mike, we're not
going in there like that.

900
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,694
- Like what?
- Hey, look, all our lives,

901
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,494
we've been bad boys, all right?

902
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:17,665
Now it's time to be good men.

903
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:22,601
Who in the hell
wanna sing that song?

904
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:26,809
♪ Good men,
good men What you gonna do? ♪

905
01:01:27,843 --> 01:01:29,843
Well, maybe if you sang the song

906
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:33,113
like you meant it,
it'd catch on.

907
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:34,480
Nah.

908
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,283
Knock and talk.

909
01:01:36,285 --> 01:01:37,853
Yeah. Knock, knock.

910
01:01:40,055 --> 01:01:42,322
- Mike! Mike!
- Miami PD! Get down!

911
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,423
- Mike! Mike!
- Get down!

912
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:44,590
- What is happening?
- Mike!

913
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:46,093
What happened to knock and talk?

914
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:48,362
Hey, you broke my door.
You broke my door!

915
01:01:48,364 --> 01:01:50,030
Sir, sorry about
the door, okay?

916
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:52,766
A little Gorilla Glue
will make that just fine.

917
01:01:52,768 --> 01:01:55,668
- Hey, where's your warrant?
- I need you on your knees

918
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,771
with your hands behind
your head right now!

919
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:03,677
Sir, if you keep moving, I'm
gonna shoot you in your face.

920
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,412
- No, he's not.
- Yes, I am!

921
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:09,182
Mike, the man is an accountant.
We just need to talk to him.

922
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,084
So you wanna have
a conversation

923
01:02:11,086 --> 01:02:13,420
with a coked-out
orange mountain?

924
01:02:13,422 --> 01:02:15,255
Here's the latest figures.

925
01:02:15,257 --> 01:02:18,058
Look, let me handle this, okay?
Just back up.

926
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,129
I'm gonna penetrate
this man's soul with my heart.

927
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:23,163
What?

928
01:02:23,165 --> 01:02:24,297
Yeah.

929
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:26,601
Watch and learn.

930
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:29,036
Hey! Hey, ass licker.

931
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:31,371
I'm gonna fast-food
fist-fuck you.

932
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,740
Sir, that's just nasty.

933
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:37,177
Now, I recognize that this
is a difficult situation.

934
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:39,880
- Don't come over here.
- Don't go over there, Marcus.

935
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,315
We just need
your client's receipts.

936
01:02:42,317 --> 01:02:44,718
- What?
- Booker Grassie.

937
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,988
- Any record of...?
- Unh!

938
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,158
Mm.

939
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:54,428
Hey. How deep you think
you got in his soul?

940
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,531
Sometime you gotta suffer
for what is right.

941
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,266
Don't you turn
that other cheek.

942
01:02:59,268 --> 01:03:01,001
- Get off me!
- All right.

943
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:06,273
Now, sir, I realize
that you're scared.

944
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:10,712
Hell, we all scared.
You know, sometimes fear just...

945
01:03:19,354 --> 01:03:21,455
So, what you thinking?

946
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:26,493
I think you should
handle this one.

947
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:27,660
Yeah, me too.

948
01:03:28,897 --> 01:03:30,363
Hey!

949
01:03:30,365 --> 01:03:32,999
MLK just tapped out.
You got Brother Malcolm now.

950
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:35,068
We can handle this
by any means necessary.

951
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,337
I recognize you.
You're that cop that got shot.

952
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:39,638
Bad year you're having,
Butterscotch.

953
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,543
If you didn't have that gun
and badge, I'd fucking eat you.

954
01:03:43,545 --> 01:03:46,513
This the only thing that's
keeping you from eating me?

955
01:03:46,515 --> 01:03:48,684
- Yeah.
- Oh.

956
01:03:50,152 --> 01:03:51,384
Bring it, big boy.

957
01:03:57,493 --> 01:03:59,394
- Left line clear!
- Cuff him.

958
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,230
What the hell
are y'all doing here?

959
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:05,265
I called them.

960
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:09,536
What? What happened to bad boys
one last time?

961
01:04:09,538 --> 01:04:11,371
This is one last time.

962
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,740
But this here's the remix, Mike.

963
01:04:13,742 --> 01:04:15,277
We work with AMMO now.

964
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:21,114
That's that shit, okay?

965
01:04:21,116 --> 01:04:24,885
You got three seconds
before I bite it off.

966
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:27,420
Get your damn finger
out my face.

967
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:31,057
So tell us.
Judge, prosecutor, criminal informant,

968
01:04:31,059 --> 01:04:33,760
the captain, and you.
Who do you have in common?

969
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:35,962
Hundreds of investigations,
operations...

970
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:37,731
Eight hundred
and forty-seven cases

971
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:39,099
in the nexus of the victims.

972
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:41,268
Well, who up there
wants to kill you?

973
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,069
- Hell, who doesn't?
- All right.

974
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:45,338
That just the criminals
that we're looking at.

975
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,741
I don't trust a person
that don't wanna kill him.

976
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:51,044
- Hell, put my name up there.
- Thanks. Got it. Appreciate it.

977
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:52,646
What you get
out of the accountant?

978
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:54,814
- His records are a mess.
- Surprising.

979
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:57,684
But I did manage
to get into his Keychain.

980
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,853
- So?
- All of his social.

981
01:05:01,056 --> 01:05:02,024
Boom.

982
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,891
Looking at a lot of dick pics

983
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:06,159
but not so many clues.

984
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:08,128
Facial rec for anyone
in our system.

985
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,398
On it.

986
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,166
That's three days
before I got hit.

987
01:05:13,168 --> 01:05:15,869
Hey, go back to that last shot.
The chain.

988
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,972
Yeah, zoom in.

989
01:05:18,974 --> 01:05:21,041
- Heh. Zway-Lo.
- Zway-Lo.

990
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:24,244
- Who's Zway-Lo?
- Lorenzo Rodriguez.

991
01:05:24,246 --> 01:05:25,712
Goes by Zway-Lo.

992
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,714
Used to coach him
in peewee hoops

993
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:29,382
before he went
for that thug shit.

994
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,152
Great player, but I had to bench
him during the championship.

995
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:34,521
You benched a 10-year-old
in the championship?

996
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:36,957
Yeah. Little fucker
called me a dickhead.

997
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,992
- Did y'all win at least?
- Hell, no.

998
01:05:38,994 --> 01:05:40,360
He was our star player.

999
01:05:40,362 --> 01:05:43,563
We lost by 40,
but I made my point.

1000
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,632
Okay, there's no "I" in "team."

1001
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:47,167
There is one in "dickhead"
though.

1002
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:51,171
Man, shut up. Look, Zway-Lo's
into drugs, weapons.

1003
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:53,039
He's one
of Taglin's lieutenants.

1004
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:55,676
Taglin was found dead
the same night Mike got shot.

1005
01:05:55,678 --> 01:05:58,245
I guess he's someone
else's lieutenant now.

1006
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,813
Lorenzo Rodriguez.

1007
01:05:59,815 --> 01:06:03,016
No mortgage,
not even a bank account.

1008
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:05,218
But it is his birthday tomorrow.

1009
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,689
If he's celebrating, there's
three spots for a cat like that.

1010
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:11,825
Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion.

1011
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:13,493
Can you get into
their club records?

1012
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:17,998
Pfft, Ice 45 should really up
their cyber security.

1013
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,667
Okay. Ice 45.

1014
01:06:20,669 --> 01:06:23,171
Ditto. Zillion.

1015
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,741
There. Rodriguez.

1016
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:29,042
- Bam!
- The party's tonight.

1017
01:06:29,044 --> 01:06:31,046
Zillion it is.

1018
01:06:32,648 --> 01:06:35,148
All right,
we meet at the club at 2300,

1019
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,317
UC, so wear your Sunday best.

1020
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,053
This is a grab. We're in.
We're out. No bodies.

1021
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:43,556
This raid is strictly nonlethal.

1022
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:45,058
Nonlethal.

1023
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,494
Has anyone informed
the bad guys?

1024
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:50,897
ACLU rounds. Rubber.
Trust me, you'll enjoy them.

1025
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:53,233
You get to shoot
as much as you want.

1026
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:55,302
♪ Bad boys, bad boys ♪

1027
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,370

Never. Y'all will <i>never</i>

1032
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,213
Yeah, and you fucking up
the lyrics,

1033
01:07:07,215 --> 01:07:08,948
which take a long time to learn.

1034
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,617
- Don't do that.
- All right.

1035
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:11,951
- No. Don't do that.
- Seriously.

01:07:11,953 --> 01:07:13,119
- Okay.
- Sorry, sorry.

1037
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:14,821
- Shit.
- Won't happen again.

1038
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,156
Get your own damn song.

1039
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,792
You believe that shit?

1040
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,466
Dumbass.

1041
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:00,801
Whatever, man.

1042
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:03,269
Miss me with that bullshit.

1043
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:05,038
I got this.

1044
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,640
Hello there, ladies.
Uh, Georgio in there tonight?

1045
01:08:07,642 --> 01:08:10,545
- No idea who that is, sir.
- The line's in the back.

1046
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:14,447
Nicole! Paige!

1047
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:16,116
- Hey!
- Oh!

1048
01:08:16,118 --> 01:08:18,184
- Hey!
- You guys look so good.

1049
01:08:18,186 --> 01:08:20,688
- Thank you.
- So beautiful. Oh, my God.

1050
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:25,125
That's my Uncle Michael, and
that's his pal, Uncle Marcus.

1051
01:08:25,127 --> 01:08:28,128
You mind if they come in?
He just got divorced.

1052
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,964
- Oh, that is so sad.
- Mm, yeah.

1053
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:32,432
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Come on.

1054
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:34,100
- Oh, hell, no.
- Come on, kids. Let's go.

1055
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:35,602
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, no.

1056
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:37,070
- No, yeah.
- Uh-uh.

1057
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,739
- It's real.
- No, not at all.

1058
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:39,973
- Yeah.
- No, sir.

1059
01:08:39,975 --> 01:08:41,441
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.

1060
01:08:41,443 --> 01:08:43,276
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

1061
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,888
Kelly, what's the target QTH?

1062
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:56,356
<i>Second level. VIP platform.</i>

1063
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:59,492
- <i>I have eyes on.</i>
- Up top.

1064
01:09:09,872 --> 01:09:11,271
Hi, baby.

1065
01:09:20,817 --> 01:09:22,883
Target confirmed.

1066
01:09:22,885 --> 01:09:26,019
<i>Platform is one way
in, one way out.</i>

1067
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:27,620
<i>We got him cornered.</i>

1068
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,825
Man on his two-side
has a 55, hot.

1069
01:09:30,827 --> 01:09:32,091
Stay with the A-plan.

1070
01:09:32,093 --> 01:09:33,960
Kelly, you're on
Zway-Lo's bodyguard.

1071
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,031
<i>Copy.</i>

1072
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:47,942
Mike,
how you think she DJ like that?

1073
01:09:47,944 --> 01:09:51,179
She must got some
strong ass muscles.

1074
01:09:52,414 --> 01:09:55,048
Look, I'm gonna be honest
with you, Mike.

1075
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,785
- I ain't had sex in a long time.
- Whoa, whoa.

1076
01:09:57,787 --> 01:10:00,987
Yeah, too long. Too long.
I be thinking of shit.

1077
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,122
- Crazy shit, Mike.
- Marcus.

1078
01:10:03,124 --> 01:10:05,191
I feel like
I'm locked up since...

1079
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:07,460
Hey, Marcus, you know
they can hear you?

1080
01:10:07,462 --> 01:10:10,630
It's too loud. They can't
hear us. They can't hear us.

1081
01:10:10,632 --> 01:10:12,900
Look, look, sometime
I go to the Internet,

1082
01:10:12,902 --> 01:10:15,468
<i>and I see some weird shit
on there.</i>

1083
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,170
- <i>I saw a man put his...</i>
- <i>Marcus.</i>

1084
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,574
- Marcus.
- What?

1085
01:10:20,977 --> 01:10:22,242
We can hear you.

1086
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:24,979
Oh! Oh! Ha, ha!

1087
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:28,782
That's a little jokey joke.
Y'all didn't hear that, did you?

1088
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:32,820
- In position.
- <i>Setting up.</i>

1089
01:10:32,822 --> 01:10:36,456
<i>Mike, Marcus, meet you
at the top.</i>

1090
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:40,059
<i>Mike and Marcus
moving, stairs right.</i>

1091
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:42,497
<i>Rita on the move, stairs left.</i>

1092
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:47,133
- Everybody in position?
- Set.

1093
01:10:47,135 --> 01:10:48,668
- <i>Set.</i>
- Set.

1094
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,404
<i>That dress is incredible, girl.</i>

1095
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:53,674
- You got style.
- Oh, hi.

1096
01:10:53,676 --> 01:10:55,009
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1097
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:56,877
Stand by. Stand by.
Stand by.

1098
01:10:56,879 --> 01:10:59,947
<i>I can't.
I'm here with my girlfriends.</i>

1099
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:01,749
Mm, they can come too, baby.

1100
01:11:01,751 --> 01:11:03,616
Ah, I can't tonight.

1101
01:11:03,618 --> 01:11:06,553
Knee him in his balls,
and let's go.

1102
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:08,956
- From Tétouan. Mwah.
- From Tétouan.

1103
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:10,758
- Bye, baby. Ha, ha!
- Bye, baby.

1104
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,861
Why'd she wear that?
That is not a undercover dress.

1105
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:17,664
You should've wore
something... undercover.

1106
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:19,033
Happy birthday.

1107
01:11:19,035 --> 01:11:20,701
Yo, yo, yo, everybody!

1108
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:22,168
Let's make some noise!

1109
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,273
We got a special guest
in the house! It's his birthday!

1110
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:29,142
Let's wish him
a birthday on one!

1111
01:11:29,144 --> 01:11:30,476
Three, two, one.

1112
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:32,780
Happy birthday!

1113
01:11:32,782 --> 01:11:35,648
We love you, Zway-Lo!

1114
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,116
Hey! Yeah!

1115
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,920
- <i>Zway-Lo! Zway-Lo!</i>
- Top of the world, baby!

1116
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:42,355
- <i>Zway-Lo! Zway-Lo!</i>
- Happy birthday, dickhead.

1117
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:01,509
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1118
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:09,750
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1119
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:17,256
- Yeah!
- You going to jail, motherfucker.

1120
01:12:17,258 --> 01:12:19,158
When I say "criminal,"
you say "jail."

1121
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,159
- Criminal.
- Jail.

1122
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:21,996
- Criminal.
- Jail.

1123
01:12:21,998 --> 01:12:23,463
Miami PD! Freeze.

1124
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:31,206
Damn!

1125
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,974
I told you he was an athlete.

1126
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:36,309
- We gotta jump.
- I'm not jumping.

1127
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:38,244
- He's getting away! Jump now!
- Shit!

1128
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:43,583
Zway-Lo!

1129
01:12:46,221 --> 01:12:47,555
Get out of the way!

1130
01:12:49,357 --> 01:12:50,891
- I need this. I need it.
- Hey, whoa!

1131
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:52,960
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
- What you doing?

1132
01:12:52,962 --> 01:12:54,895
- Hey, hold on!
- Official police business.

1133
01:12:54,897 --> 01:12:56,930
- That's my car!
- This is the police.

1134
01:12:56,932 --> 01:12:58,464
Back up!

1135
01:12:58,466 --> 01:12:59,967
- What the fuck?
- Come on!

1136
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:01,467
It is of no advantage for me

1137
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:04,370
to jump off the fucking thing
if you take the stairs!

1138
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:06,106
I told your ass
I wasn't jumping!

1139
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:10,077
<i>Zway-Lo turned left on 2nd Ave.</i>

1140
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:11,879
- Shit! Whoa!
- Ugh!

1141
01:13:14,717 --> 01:13:16,315
- Putting your seat belt on?
- Yeah.

1142
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:19,153
- That's how we do it now?
- You're damn right.

1143
01:13:19,155 --> 01:13:20,888
Number one's on my ass!

1144
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:23,523
<i>Crossing 395 into Overtown.</i>

1145
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,726
Whoa, Mike. Overtown's a no-go.

1146
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:28,294
<i>Zway got people here.
Dangerous people.</i>

1147
01:13:28,296 --> 01:13:29,997
We're dangerous people.

1148
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:31,732
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1149
01:13:31,734 --> 01:13:34,168
Shit, whoa!

1150
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,770
Damn Nerf gun,
rubber bullet bullshit.

1151
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:39,272
They shooting slugs,
we firing gummy bears.

1152
01:13:39,274 --> 01:13:43,242
Mike, pull over for a minute.
I need to tell you something.

1153
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:44,610
- Pull over?
- Yeah.

1154
01:13:44,612 --> 01:13:46,980
One second. Let me see
if Zway will pull over.

1155
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:50,616
Zway-Lo! Marcus needs
to pull over for a second!

1156
01:13:50,618 --> 01:13:52,052
Hey, can we get a time-out?

1157
01:13:52,054 --> 01:13:54,520
Damn it, Mike, I need
to tell you something!

1158
01:13:54,522 --> 01:13:56,589
- What?
- I made a promise to God.

1159
01:13:56,591 --> 01:13:58,826
- To who?
- To God.

1160
01:13:58,828 --> 01:14:00,728
What the hell
are you talking about?

1161
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,464
Look, I told the Lord
that if you made it through

1162
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:06,599
that I would make
no more violence.

1163
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:09,002
He definitely knew
you was bullshitting with that.

1164
01:14:09,004 --> 01:14:10,436
Violence is what we do.

1165
01:14:14,009 --> 01:14:15,641
It's about your soul, Mike.

1166
01:14:15,643 --> 01:14:18,212
Our job is to protect and serve.

1167
01:14:18,214 --> 01:14:21,882
You're damn right. I'm about
to serve this bitch right now.

1168
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:38,431
- Oh, shit! What...?
- Oh, shit.

1169
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,234
Oh, look at that!

1170
01:14:40,236 --> 01:14:41,634
- Damn!
- Oh!

1171
01:14:41,636 --> 01:14:44,972
That is some Elephant Man shit
right there.

1172
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:45,939
- Yo, you see that?
- Oh!

1173
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,407
- Yeah, I see it.
- Hey, stop it.

1174
01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:50,543
- It's calling me, Mike.
- What? Leave it...

1175
01:14:50,545 --> 01:14:52,545
I can't help it,
but it's calling me.

1176
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:54,547
Stop it. What the hell
is wrong with you?

1177
01:14:54,549 --> 01:14:56,083
Just leave it alone.

1178
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:57,084
Yo, leave it alone.

1179
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:58,551
- Leave... Marcus.
- Ahh!

1180
01:14:58,553 --> 01:15:00,687
- You're gonna pop that shit!
- That shit nasty!

1181
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:03,623
- Then leave it alone.
- Oh, shit. Oh!

1182
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,793
- Damn.
- Oh...

1183
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:07,393
Just leave it alone! Let's...

1184
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:09,062
One more time.
One more again.

1185
01:15:10,266 --> 01:15:11,965
Overtown is waking up.
Let's go.

1186
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:14,234
- <i>AMMO, where you at?</i>
- Got jammed up.

1187
01:15:14,236 --> 01:15:15,869
- Hitting Overtown now.
- Gear up.

1188
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:23,611
Come on.

1189
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:35,323
Fuck!

1190
01:15:36,225 --> 01:15:37,791
We got your man!

1191
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:40,294
- Shit!
- I'll kill his ass!

1192
01:15:40,296 --> 01:15:42,595
Oh, shit!

1193
01:15:42,597 --> 01:15:44,198
Stop it! Wake up, Zway-Lo!

1194
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,835
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake your ass up!

1195
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:49,337
Coach Burnett?

1196
01:15:50,873 --> 01:15:52,505
Dickhead.

1197
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:55,845
- Ahh!
- Still think I'm a dickhead?

1198
01:15:56,812 --> 01:15:58,411
Zway-Lo, who wants to kill me?

1199
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:00,446
Shit, everybody wanna kill you.

1200
01:16:00,448 --> 01:16:02,049
Yeah, I told you, Mike.

1201
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,019
What's he saying?

1202
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:08,021
What's he saying?

1203
01:16:09,424 --> 01:16:11,490
- Y'all both dying tonight.
- Coming up.

1204
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:12,728
Oh, shit.

1205
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,931
Thank you, God!

1206
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,672
Why'd you let him get away?!

1207
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:27,609
Lay suppression fire!

1208
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,525
- Oh, shit!
- Get in!

1209
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:48,831
- There's a pit bull!
- Hey, come on!

1210
01:16:50,032 --> 01:16:53,033
Wanna get bit,
you wanna get shot?

1211
01:16:53,035 --> 01:16:55,403
- Whoa! Ahh!
- Come on! Let's go!

1212
01:17:06,749 --> 01:17:08,614
- Oh, shit.
- What you got?

1213
01:17:08,616 --> 01:17:11,885
It's like an angry white man's
basement in here.

1214
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:16,957
- Shit, a fucking grenade.
- Pull it.

1215
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:20,459
- Pull it!
- This ain't fucking Vietnam!

1216
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:23,098
- Hang on to it, then.
- Damn you, Mike!

1217
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:34,677
Oh, shit!

1218
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,156
- Ahh!
- Come on, man! What else you got?

1219
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:50,693
Ahh! Oh, yeah!

1220
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:54,194
- Shoot that shit!
- No, no, Mike!

1221
01:17:54,196 --> 01:17:57,064
I made a promise
to God! No more violence.

1222
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:04,037
Who do you think
sent you that weapon?

1223
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:06,539
- I don't know!
- That is God's gun!

1224
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:08,742
- It is?!
- Sent in your time of need.

1225
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:10,077
Well, shit!
I do need it now!

1226
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:12,645
Yes. You are a vessel
for the Lord's work.

1227
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,547
- Yeah, I'm a vessel.
- Like David and Goliath.

1228
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:18,885
- Yeah, David with the slingshot.
- Yes! That is your slingshot!

1229
01:18:18,887 --> 01:18:21,654
- Yeah!
- To smite thine enemies!

1230
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:24,657
You know what?
Bad boys of the Bible, baby!

1231
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:28,395
- Exactly! Amen? Amen?
- Amen! Amen!

1232
01:18:30,565 --> 01:18:33,033
- Shit!
- Where are your glasses?

1233
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:36,370
- I don't need no damn glasses!
- You ain't hitting shit!

1234
01:18:44,246 --> 01:18:46,179
Oh! Oh, oh!

1235
01:18:46,181 --> 01:18:47,615
- Oh!
- Oh!

1236
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:49,685
Let's go!

1237
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:02,530
Shit! Oh!

1238
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:07,367
- Get that ATV! I got the six!
- Oh!

1239
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:26,554
Yes!

1240
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,158
No!

1241
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:35,028
Mike! Mike! Mike!
What the hell you doing?!

1242
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:38,398
Oh! Lord, I don't wanna die
this way!

1243
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,335
- Mike!
- Oh, shit!

1244
01:19:41,937 --> 01:19:44,337
- My bad, my bad.
- Damn right, that's your bad!

1245
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:54,983
Oh, shit.

1246
01:20:12,935 --> 01:20:14,401
Oh!

1247
01:20:14,403 --> 01:20:16,004
Oh, shit!

1248
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:29,583
Oh, shit! Ahh!

1249
01:20:29,585 --> 01:20:31,685
Mike! Mike!

1250
01:20:31,687 --> 01:20:33,956
- Ahh!
- Whoa!

1251
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,061
Oh, oh!

1252
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:09,892
Get out of the fucking way!

1253
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:24,940
<i>Haste el fuego.</i>

1254
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:26,068
Hey, Dorn. I need you.

1255
01:22:27,869 --> 01:22:29,603
Hey, hey, look.

1256
01:22:29,605 --> 01:22:32,405
I been there before. Many times.

1257
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:33,807
It's gonna be all right.

1258
01:22:33,809 --> 01:22:36,378
That's Zway-Lo's phone.
Can you break it?

1259
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:43,452
- Yeah. What am I looking for?
- Who he's talking to. Call logs.

1260
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:48,323
And I'm gonna need you
to hurry up just a little bit.

1261
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:52,993
Okay, but I'm gonna
have to go on the dark side.

1262
01:22:52,995 --> 01:22:55,264
All right. You good with that?

1263
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:57,497
Yeah.

1264
01:22:57,499 --> 01:22:58,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

1265
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:04,304
Dorn, he's a big guy.

1266
01:23:04,306 --> 01:23:06,072
How'd he get so good
at this stuff?

1267
01:23:06,074 --> 01:23:08,275
- What stuff?
- Tech shit.

1268
01:23:08,277 --> 01:23:12,012
- He looks like a killer.
- Is. Used to be a bouncer.

1269
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:14,381
Guy one night was getting
physical with a woman...

1270
01:23:14,383 --> 01:23:16,616
Yeah, big man lost it.
Hit him.

1271
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:20,355
- Bastard dropped dead.
- Avoided the fight ever since.

1272
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,859
Here we go.

1273
01:23:25,827 --> 01:23:28,495
Give me the last two months.

1274
01:23:28,497 --> 01:23:29,663
Shit.

1275
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:31,166
Mexico.

1276
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:34,634
What are you after here?

1277
01:23:34,636 --> 01:23:36,636
All right. To each one
of those numbers,

1278
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:41,009
I need you to text the phrase,
<i>"Hasta el fuego."</i>

1279
01:23:44,112 --> 01:23:45,178
Done.

1280
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,148
All right. I got it. Thank you.

1281
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,116
- You sure?
- I got it. Go.

1282
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:55,415
We're shut down.

1283
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,417
- What?
- What do you mean, shut down?

1284
01:24:57,419 --> 01:24:58,553
AMMO's done.

1285
01:25:00,622 --> 01:25:02,021
I'm sorry.

1286
01:25:02,023 --> 01:25:03,758
Look, everything's
gonna be all right.

1287
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,826
Trust me on this, okay?

1288
01:25:05,828 --> 01:25:07,596
Everything's gonna be all right.

1289
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:21,709
Mm-mm.

1290
01:25:21,711 --> 01:25:23,011
Mike.

1291
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,318
You all right?

1292
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:34,822
I think he's my son.

1293
01:25:34,824 --> 01:25:36,091
What?

1294
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:52,272
Twenty-four years ago,
before we partnered up, um...

1295
01:25:52,274 --> 01:25:55,108
Captain Howard pulled me
right out of the academy.

1296
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,377
Uh, nobody knew who I was.

1297
01:25:57,379 --> 01:26:01,249
He sent me in undercover
with the Aretas cartel.

1298
01:26:02,685 --> 01:26:03,918
<i>Sorenson.</i>

1299
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,185
<i>Weber.</i>

1300
01:26:05,187 --> 01:26:06,986
<i>Vargas. Carver.</i>

1301
01:26:06,988 --> 01:26:09,956
All of the victims
were on that case.

1302
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,291
This is revenge.

1303
01:26:11,293 --> 01:26:13,593
Yeah, Mike, but you
weren't on that case.

1304
01:26:13,595 --> 01:26:16,062
My name wasn't on it.

1305
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,700
That's how deep I was.

1306
01:26:18,901 --> 01:26:20,935
I was Ricky Rollins.

1307
01:26:20,937 --> 01:26:22,903
Benito Aretas.

1308
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:25,538
He's dead, Mike.
He ain't after you.

1309
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,106
Not him.

1310
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:28,443
His wife.

1311
01:26:29,946 --> 01:26:31,179
Isabel.

1312
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:34,013
I was her driver.

1313
01:26:34,015 --> 01:26:37,751
We connected so... deep.

1314
01:26:37,753 --> 01:26:42,155
We talked about everything.
She showed me the whole game.

1315
01:26:42,157 --> 01:26:46,259
How to walk it, how to talk it,
put clothes on it.

1316
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:49,498
She made Mike Lowrey.

1317
01:26:51,868 --> 01:26:53,701
- We fell in love.
- Heh.

1318
01:26:53,703 --> 01:26:55,903
Are you telling me
the one time that you...?

1319
01:26:55,905 --> 01:26:57,938
Isabel Aretas.

1320
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:59,773
The one time.

1321
01:26:59,775 --> 01:27:04,177
Takedown was coming.
DEA, ATF, everybody.

1322
01:27:04,179 --> 01:27:07,781
And I was gonna ghost
the whole operation.

1323
01:27:07,783 --> 01:27:10,483
Me and Isabel were gonna
run away with each other.

1324
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:12,953
What made you change your mind?

1325
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:15,457
They call her <i>La Bruja.</i>

1326
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:17,624
The Witch.

1327
01:27:18,728 --> 01:27:22,262
<i>She is into some dark shit.</i>

1328
01:27:22,264 --> 01:27:23,665
<i>Santa Muerte.</i>

1329
01:27:24,834 --> 01:27:27,066
That woman...

1330
01:27:27,068 --> 01:27:31,072
was a stone-cold killer.

1331
01:27:32,207 --> 01:27:33,741
<i>So I had to put
the woman I love</i>

1332
01:27:33,743 --> 01:27:37,078
<i>behind bars
for the rest of her life.</i>

1333
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:43,686
Chose the badge, and I've been
choosing it ever since.

1334
01:27:45,587 --> 01:27:49,224
Mike, you fucked
a married witch?

1335
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,561
So all the shit I just said,
and that was your takeaway?

1336
01:27:54,563 --> 01:27:56,496
No, it's just a lot to digest.

1337
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,832
You think
you know somebody and...

1338
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:03,369
Well, hell, now it explains why
you dress like a drug dealer.

1339
01:28:03,371 --> 01:28:05,405
So you wanna hear
this shit or you don't?

1340
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:08,341
Sorry. But you don't know
that's your son, Mike.

1341
01:28:08,343 --> 01:28:10,579
You don't know
who that witch was fucking.

1342
01:28:12,715 --> 01:28:15,381
Benito Aretas
couldn't have kids.

1343
01:28:15,383 --> 01:28:19,218
Isabel gave birth in prison,
eight months after her arrest.

1344
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,321
<i>"Hasta el fuego."</i>
He said that to me

1345
01:28:21,323 --> 01:28:23,156
before I jumped
from the chopper.

1346
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:26,125
<i>Me and Isabel made that up.</i>

1347
01:28:26,127 --> 01:28:27,695
<i>It's not even real Spanish.</i>

1348
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:29,562
<i>It's some shit
we said to each other.</i>

1349
01:28:29,564 --> 01:28:32,700
<i>It meant like, "We'll be
together until we burn."</i>

1350
01:28:40,475 --> 01:28:43,643
- Nah, Mike.
- Marcus, he's the right age.

1351
01:28:43,645 --> 01:28:46,112
<i>He's crazy like me.
He's ruthless like me.</i>

1352
01:28:46,114 --> 01:28:47,848
<i>He's fearless like me.</i>

1353
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:49,984
He's the fucked-up me.

1354
01:28:49,986 --> 01:28:51,752
No, Mike.

1355
01:28:51,754 --> 01:28:53,321
You the fucked-up you.

1356
01:28:54,489 --> 01:28:56,824
You jumping to conclusions.
All right?

1357
01:28:56,826 --> 01:29:00,159
Shit's gonna work itself out.
You gotta trust that.

1358
01:29:00,161 --> 01:29:01,496
Yeah...

1359
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:04,633
You're right.

1360
01:29:07,036 --> 01:29:08,736
Oh, man.

1361
01:29:08,738 --> 01:29:09,872
Aw.

1362
01:29:10,906 --> 01:29:13,007
I love you, man.

1363
01:29:13,009 --> 01:29:14,442
I love you, man.

1364
01:29:16,211 --> 01:29:18,346
- I gotta go. All right?
- Mike.

1365
01:29:19,514 --> 01:29:20,914
Mike.

1366
01:30:17,873 --> 01:30:22,109
Let me get past you there, sir.
Sorry there. Excuse me.

1367
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:24,210
Excuse me.

1368
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,982
That's the right spot
for me right there.

1369
01:30:28,984 --> 01:30:30,818
Oh, excuse me, sir.

1370
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,418
Seat right there.

1371
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,420
Let me get by you.
Watch your toes.

1372
01:30:34,422 --> 01:30:36,156
Watch your toes there.

1373
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:38,624
It's all right. There you go.

1374
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:41,627
No, Marcus.

1375
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:42,763
I'm not letting you go

1376
01:30:42,765 --> 01:30:45,467
on a suicide mission
alone, Mike.

1377
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:48,001
This is on me.

1378
01:30:48,003 --> 01:30:51,337
I'm not letting anybody else
get killed dealing with my shit.

1379
01:30:51,339 --> 01:30:53,639
Mike, she's a <i>bruja.</i>

1380
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:56,677
She'll make your eyes melt
into your stupid-ass head.

1381
01:30:56,679 --> 01:30:58,814
She'll make your dick fall off.

1382
01:31:00,381 --> 01:31:01,849
I meant penis.

1383
01:31:01,851 --> 01:31:05,418
You should be minding
your own business anyway.

1384
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:08,222
Marcus, please go home.

1385
01:31:08,224 --> 01:31:11,424
We fly together.
We die together.

1386
01:31:11,426 --> 01:31:13,193
- What?
- Oh, no.

1387
01:31:13,195 --> 01:31:15,028
That's just something we say.

1388
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,463
It's all good. It ain't...

1389
01:31:17,465 --> 01:31:20,033
Oh, I can see how that
got y'all a little...

1390
01:31:20,035 --> 01:31:23,605
Uh, where y'all from?
Where you from?

1391
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:30,811
So, what you gonna do
when you see him?

1392
01:31:30,813 --> 01:31:33,312
You really gonna
put your son behind bars?

1393
01:31:33,314 --> 01:31:36,282
No. I'm gonna kill him.

1394
01:31:37,285 --> 01:31:38,584
Kill him?

1395
01:31:38,586 --> 01:31:41,587
You really gonna kill
your own son, Mike?

1396
01:31:41,589 --> 01:31:45,625
I'm gonna put him
in a fucking bag.

1397
01:31:45,627 --> 01:31:48,427
- You mind if we switch seats?
- Yeah, please.

1398
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:49,832
Excuse me.

1399
01:31:53,869 --> 01:31:56,870
You realize
you will go to hell?

1400
01:31:56,872 --> 01:32:00,540
- I don't believe in hell, Marcus.
- Well, it believes in you.

1401
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:02,276
I mean, killing your own son.

1402
01:32:02,278 --> 01:32:06,546
Brother, that's a darkness
that swallows you whole.

1403
01:32:06,548 --> 01:32:10,618
Well, maybe I already
been swallowed.

1404
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,353
I died, remember?

1405
01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:16,624
I'm ending this shit, man.

1406
01:32:19,995 --> 01:32:22,595
I should have known
he was your son.

1407
01:32:22,597 --> 01:32:26,834
Because the way
he whupped your ass, Mike.

1408
01:32:26,836 --> 01:32:30,570
That was a ass-whupping
straight from thy own loins.

1409
01:32:30,572 --> 01:32:33,006
A supernatural ass-whupping.

1410
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:34,708
- Mm-mm.
- Well...

1411
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:35,541
Mm-mm.

1412
01:32:40,282 --> 01:32:42,648
Can I be the godfather?

1413
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,450
You know
what you can be, Marcus?

1414
01:32:44,452 --> 01:32:46,452
- What?
- Quiet.

1415
01:32:46,454 --> 01:32:48,088
- Oh, I should be quiet?
- Yeah.

1416
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:51,591
All right, you just had
a warlock baby with <i>La Bruja</i>

1417
01:32:51,593 --> 01:32:54,695
who's trying to kill
your ass, probably mine too,

1418
01:32:54,697 --> 01:32:57,097
sucking our blood
and all of that shit,

1419
01:32:57,099 --> 01:32:59,398
but I should be quiet.

1420
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,269
Yeah. Yeah, okay, Mike.

1421
01:33:05,174 --> 01:33:08,574
How you fuck a witch
without a condom?

1422
01:33:08,576 --> 01:33:10,978
You wrap that shit up, man.

1423
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,046
Hey, my man.
We need to change seats.

1424
01:33:13,048 --> 01:33:14,781
Yep. Okay.

1425
01:34:20,115 --> 01:34:22,550
Mike <i>y</i> Marcus.

1426
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,925
This makes us even
for Miami.

1427
01:34:43,205 --> 01:34:44,637
Yo, we hot.

1428
01:34:59,654 --> 01:35:02,758
- You called them again.
- Hey, Rita called me.

1429
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:06,259
- What's up, fellas?
- Hey.

1430
01:35:06,261 --> 01:35:08,627
Hey. Hey.

1431
01:35:08,629 --> 01:35:09,798
<i>Hola.</i>

1432
01:35:10,866 --> 01:35:13,166
I feel better when they're here.

1433
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:14,703
Yeah, me too.

1434
01:35:16,504 --> 01:35:18,537
Whoa, where'd you get
all the toys?

1435
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:20,173
DEA station in Cuernavaca.

1436
01:35:20,175 --> 01:35:23,076
We capture her,
they take the credit.

1437
01:35:23,078 --> 01:35:26,380
Get ourselves killed, they've
got nothing to do with it.

1438
01:35:26,382 --> 01:35:28,115
All eyes on me.

1439
01:35:28,117 --> 01:35:30,851
I'm the bait.
We meet at Hidalgo Palace.

1440
01:35:30,853 --> 01:35:32,853
It's an old hotel
outside the city.

1441
01:35:32,855 --> 01:35:35,722
I'll keep her talking
till you guys spot the shooter.

1442
01:35:35,724 --> 01:35:39,359
- What if she just shoots you?
- Nah, she's gonna wanna talk.

1443
01:35:39,361 --> 01:35:42,095
We, uh... have history.

1444
01:35:42,097 --> 01:35:43,897
Okay. Snatch and grab.
We get them,

1445
01:35:43,899 --> 01:35:46,235
and we're on a plane
to the States by dawn.

1446
01:35:47,903 --> 01:35:50,337
Dorn, get me a floor-plan
satellite image.

1447
01:35:50,339 --> 01:35:55,110
We'll have eyes
on the outside and...

1448
01:35:56,445 --> 01:35:57,944
on the inside.

1449
01:35:57,946 --> 01:36:01,715
Hey. Nobody touches the shooter.
He's mine.

1450
01:36:01,717 --> 01:36:03,683
Uh, yes, he is.

1451
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:20,903
You, uh, coloring a little bit
outside the lines today, huh?

1452
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:25,640
Don't die.

1453
01:36:26,508 --> 01:36:28,777
You make sure we both come home.

1454
01:36:56,338 --> 01:36:59,473
No identifiable threats.
Monitoring channels inside.

1455
01:36:59,475 --> 01:37:00,740
Jamming everything in case

1456
01:37:00,742 --> 01:37:02,676
they're running
countersurveillance.

1457
01:37:02,678 --> 01:37:04,111
No way she's here alone.

1458
01:37:04,113 --> 01:37:06,947
It's the cartel. She's gonna
have serious backup.

1459
01:37:06,949 --> 01:37:08,515
Marcus is moving
towards the back.

1460
01:37:08,517 --> 01:37:11,284
Marcus, we're covering
your position from the sky.

1461
01:37:11,286 --> 01:37:13,220
Still nothing.

1462
01:37:13,222 --> 01:37:15,122
Moving in closer.

1463
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,735
<i>Hola,</i> Ricky.

1464
01:38:02,471 --> 01:38:04,072
<i>Hola,</i> Isabel.

1465
01:38:29,598 --> 01:38:31,366
I'm gonna kill her myself.

1466
01:38:33,435 --> 01:38:34,403
Keep it.

1467
01:38:37,706 --> 01:38:40,340
Where is he?

1468
01:39:02,864 --> 01:39:05,332
This is some
real telenovela shit.

1469
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:16,111
Ah...

1470
01:39:19,716 --> 01:39:20,882
Shit!

1471
01:39:21,817 --> 01:39:23,350
I just lost all comms.

1472
01:39:23,352 --> 01:39:25,952
- Fuck. AMMO?
- Marcus, come in.

1473
01:39:25,954 --> 01:39:28,355
- Shit.
- They're jamming us.

1474
01:39:28,357 --> 01:39:30,357
They know we're here.
This is fucked.

1475
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:32,592
- I can't get back in.
- Still got Baby Barry

1476
01:39:32,594 --> 01:39:34,363
on an outside frequency.

1477
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:50,212
Mm.

1478
01:39:56,952 --> 01:39:59,953
It was gonna be a surprise.

1479
01:39:59,955 --> 01:40:01,556
After we ran away.

1480
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:12,499
I'm seeing tactical movement.

1481
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:14,702
Twenty to 30 threats
forming a perimeter.

1482
01:40:14,704 --> 01:40:15,835
We gotta go.

1483
01:40:15,837 --> 01:40:18,104
- Alt points of entry?
- Here.

1484
01:40:18,106 --> 01:40:20,307
That cold airflow could be
a laundry exhaust.

1485
01:40:20,309 --> 01:40:22,575
How could you do this
to our son?

1486
01:40:22,577 --> 01:40:23,910
My son.

1487
01:40:23,912 --> 01:40:25,412
Who does he think I am?

1488
01:40:25,414 --> 01:40:27,280
Exactly who you are:

1489
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:29,949
The coward, the traitor...

1490
01:40:33,021 --> 01:40:35,455
Don't do this.

1491
01:40:44,032 --> 01:40:45,965
Keep it moving, detective.

1492
01:40:54,811 --> 01:40:56,443
You see that?

1493
01:40:56,445 --> 01:40:58,645
Drop it.

1494
01:40:58,647 --> 01:41:00,313
Let's go!

1495
01:41:00,315 --> 01:41:01,581
Let's go!

1496
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,049
What you gonna do?

1497
01:41:03,051 --> 01:41:04,785
- <i>Hasta el fuego.</i>
- Whoa.

1498
01:41:04,787 --> 01:41:06,920
No <i>"el suego."</i>
That means fire, right?

1499
01:41:06,922 --> 01:41:09,055
- <i>Cállate.</i>
- No, no <i>"cate."</i>

1500
01:41:09,057 --> 01:41:10,924
You and this man need to talk.

1501
01:41:10,926 --> 01:41:13,026
- It's life-changing shit.
- Shut the fuck up.

1502
01:41:13,028 --> 01:41:15,395
- Easy on the barrel! Easy!
- Marcus, relax.

1503
01:41:15,397 --> 01:41:19,632
Mike, it's lack of communication
that got this shit fucked up.

1504
01:41:19,634 --> 01:41:22,202
He needs to tell you something.
You ain't gonna like it,

1505
01:41:22,204 --> 01:41:23,838
but you need to hear it.

1506
01:41:49,699 --> 01:41:51,066
Oh, shit!

1507
01:41:54,403 --> 01:41:57,172
Yo, Mike,
they're moving up to the chopper!

1508
01:42:00,475 --> 01:42:02,108
Marcus!

1509
01:42:08,718 --> 01:42:11,752
- Put your glasses on!
- What the hell was that?

1510
01:42:11,754 --> 01:42:13,286
That was a bad throw!

1511
01:42:17,426 --> 01:42:19,361
Yo, Mike, careful!

1512
01:42:22,364 --> 01:42:24,164
You were right
about the glasses.

1513
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:27,135
I been telling your ass
that shit for years.

1514
01:42:33,275 --> 01:42:35,477
Shit, this is like HD!

1515
01:42:39,448 --> 01:42:41,682
Go! Go! Go!

1516
01:42:47,589 --> 01:42:49,624
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1517
01:43:02,604 --> 01:43:04,239
Go! Go, go, go!

1518
01:43:12,214 --> 01:43:15,114
Hey, Isabel and the shooter
went up the stairs.

1519
01:43:15,116 --> 01:43:16,851
Can you cover us?

1520
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:19,185
- Kelly! Flank right!
- Copy!

1521
01:43:19,187 --> 01:43:21,922
- Rafe, pan left! Push!
- Copy that!

1522
01:43:21,924 --> 01:43:24,692
- Dorn, follow Rafe!
- Yup!

1523
01:43:24,694 --> 01:43:26,159
Hey, big man.

1524
01:43:26,161 --> 01:43:28,094
I'm gonna need you
to hurt some people.

1525
01:43:28,096 --> 01:43:29,763
I'll pay for therapy,
all right?

1526
01:43:29,765 --> 01:43:32,131
I'm gonna need it. Seriously.

1527
01:43:32,133 --> 01:43:34,735
- Yeah, I got you.
- I'll hold the middle.

1528
01:43:34,737 --> 01:43:37,705
- You push hard for the stairs.
- Push hard for the stairs.

1529
01:43:37,707 --> 01:43:38,873
Yeah.

1530
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:41,241
Hey. It's good shit, lieutenant.

1531
01:43:41,243 --> 01:43:43,009
You too, detective.

1532
01:43:43,011 --> 01:43:45,078
You ain't such a dumbass
after all.

1533
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,448
On me!

1534
01:43:47,783 --> 01:43:49,048
Go!

1535
01:43:53,823 --> 01:43:55,555
Transition!

1536
01:44:09,671 --> 01:44:10,605
Go!

1537
01:44:15,878 --> 01:44:17,277
Shit.

1538
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:24,919
- Shoot!
- Take them both!

1539
01:44:24,921 --> 01:44:26,321
Right there, right there!

1540
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:57,652
Where the hell they getting
all these helicopters?

1541
01:45:24,145 --> 01:45:26,245
Mike!

1542
01:45:26,247 --> 01:45:28,383
- Take out the pilot!
- Take out the rotor!

1543
01:45:31,087 --> 01:45:33,754
- What are you aiming at?!
- The pilot!

1544
01:45:33,756 --> 01:45:36,558
Aim at the rotor!
If you shoot the pilot...

1545
01:45:38,126 --> 01:45:40,027
Got him!

1546
01:45:45,735 --> 01:45:47,669
Oh, shit!

1547
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,477
Shit. You got
a fucked-up family, Mike.

1548
01:46:10,826 --> 01:46:13,827
The building's coming down!
We gotta move!

1549
01:46:13,829 --> 01:46:15,662
Mike! Marcus!

1550
01:46:15,664 --> 01:46:16,797
Shit.

1551
01:46:34,382 --> 01:46:36,251
On your knees, Isabel. Get down.

1552
01:46:43,059 --> 01:46:44,257
Mike!

1553
01:47:11,987 --> 01:47:14,489
Let that be a lesson
to your witch ass.

1554
01:48:16,786 --> 01:48:18,020
Armando...

1555
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:22,423
you're my son.

1556
01:48:27,196 --> 01:48:28,630
You're my son.

1557
01:48:31,499 --> 01:48:33,501
I don't wanna fight.

1558
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:51,452
Uh-uh.

1559
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:55,088
Stay down.

1560
01:48:57,358 --> 01:48:59,392
I said, stay down.

1561
01:49:05,034 --> 01:49:07,100
I didn't know.

1562
01:49:07,102 --> 01:49:08,503
If I had known...

1563
01:49:17,579 --> 01:49:21,116
Mike, what are you doing?

1564
01:49:23,518 --> 01:49:28,454
I'm trying
to penetrate his soul...

1565
01:49:28,456 --> 01:49:30,356
with my heart.

1566
01:49:30,358 --> 01:49:31,859
No.

1567
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:33,327
No, Mike, no.

1568
01:49:33,329 --> 01:49:35,698
I was going through something.

1569
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:46,674
Who are you?

1570
01:49:47,943 --> 01:49:49,078
I told you.

1571
01:49:50,511 --> 01:49:51,812
Liar.

1572
01:50:02,423 --> 01:50:03,959
Last chance.

1573
01:50:07,096 --> 01:50:08,563
Who are you?

1574
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,398
Ask your mother.

1575
01:50:28,751 --> 01:50:31,251
Hey, y'all see
all this <i>fuego?</i>

1576
01:50:31,253 --> 01:50:34,189
- Can we take this shit outside?
- <i>Cállate.</i>

1577
01:50:35,858 --> 01:50:37,824
- Tell him!
- Tell him, mama.

1578
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,901
Is he my father?!

1579
01:50:47,903 --> 01:50:48,837
Yes.

1580
01:50:52,274 --> 01:50:53,707
Kill him.

1581
01:51:03,786 --> 01:51:06,086
- No, no, wait, wait, wait...
- Shit.

1582
01:51:37,252 --> 01:51:39,485
Lay down. Down. Down.

1583
01:51:39,487 --> 01:51:41,223
Oh, shit.

1584
01:51:47,562 --> 01:51:49,229
Mike, we gotta go.

1585
01:51:49,231 --> 01:51:51,630
Mike! Gotta move! Now!

1586
01:51:51,632 --> 01:51:53,102
Mike! We gotta go!

1587
01:52:00,309 --> 01:52:02,575
Hold me! Hold me!

1588
01:52:02,577 --> 01:52:04,878
Oh, shit!

1589
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,281
Mike! Don't let me go!
Don't let me go! Oh, shit!

1590
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:11,785
Hold on. I got you.

1591
01:52:11,787 --> 01:52:14,354
Mike! I can't get to you!

1592
01:52:14,356 --> 01:52:16,289
I can't hold on.

1593
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:17,791
Oh! Oh!

1594
01:52:17,793 --> 01:52:20,659
Pull me up! Mike, I don't
wanna die this way!

1595
01:52:24,665 --> 01:52:26,235
Oh, Mike, I'm slipping.

1596
01:52:30,072 --> 01:52:31,040
Come on!

1597
01:52:32,708 --> 01:52:35,210
Hurry!
I can feel my ass cooking!

1598
01:52:37,179 --> 01:52:38,113
Come on.

1599
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:45,185
Let's go! We gotta move!

1600
01:52:57,066 --> 01:52:59,766
Gunshot wound, upper chest!
We need medical!

1601
01:52:59,768 --> 01:53:01,634
- En route!
- All right.

1602
01:53:01,636 --> 01:53:04,271
- It's okay, I got it.
- Put him down.

1603
01:53:04,273 --> 01:53:06,775
- We need a trauma dressing.
- Right.

1604
01:53:15,317 --> 01:53:16,850
Relax.

1605
01:53:16,852 --> 01:53:20,087
I can't promise you
it's gonna be all good...

1606
01:53:20,089 --> 01:53:23,090
after all the stuff
you've done, but...

1607
01:53:23,092 --> 01:53:26,261
I can promise you
I'm gonna be there, all right?

1608
01:53:30,866 --> 01:53:32,499
Hey.

1609
01:53:32,501 --> 01:53:34,269
I'm your Uncle Marcus.

1610
01:53:35,504 --> 01:53:37,670
But we'll talk about that later.

1611
01:53:56,624 --> 01:53:58,325
Yeah, yeah.

1612
01:53:58,327 --> 01:54:00,961
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1613
01:54:00,963 --> 01:54:03,230
- Whoa. Hey.
- Hey.

1614
01:54:04,733 --> 01:54:05,765
There we go.

1615
01:54:05,767 --> 01:54:06,833
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

1616
01:54:06,835 --> 01:54:07,901
- Wow.
- You guys.

1617
01:54:07,903 --> 01:54:09,736
- There it is.
- Yes. Now...

1618
01:54:09,738 --> 01:54:11,471
it's time to raise
your glasses...

1619
01:54:11,473 --> 01:54:14,341
- to our new captain.
- To our new captain.

1620
01:54:16,211 --> 01:54:17,410
Hey, my mom says hey.

1621
01:54:17,412 --> 01:54:20,013
Oh, you're not gonna let me
live that down.

1622
01:54:20,015 --> 01:54:22,549
Oh, and, guys, I got
some news for you.

1623
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:23,917
I just started therapy.

1624
01:54:23,919 --> 01:54:25,852
My therapist thought
it'd be beneficial

1625
01:54:25,854 --> 01:54:28,155
if maybe we could hit up
a group sesh together.

1626
01:54:28,157 --> 01:54:29,756
- It's super sick.
- Oh, for sure.

1627
01:54:29,758 --> 01:54:31,758
- Definitely.
- Yeah, we will be there.

1628
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,727
- Marcus, let me holler at you.
- Yeah.

1629
01:54:33,729 --> 01:54:36,329
Uh, let me think about it.

1630
01:54:36,331 --> 01:54:39,533
- He want us to go to therapy.
- Yeah, I'm not going.

1631
01:54:39,535 --> 01:54:41,234
Ha, I'm not going.

1632
01:54:44,439 --> 01:54:46,406
Hey, man, look, um...

1633
01:54:46,408 --> 01:54:51,244
We don't say this kind of shit
to each other, man, but just...

1634
01:54:51,246 --> 01:54:52,445
thank you.

1635
01:54:54,016 --> 01:54:56,616
Mike, you don't
have to thank me.

1636
01:54:56,618 --> 01:54:58,919
If you wanna retire,

1637
01:54:58,921 --> 01:55:02,756
just know that I am not
gonna try to stop you.

1638
01:55:02,758 --> 01:55:03,990
You earned it.

1639
01:55:03,992 --> 01:55:06,626
And I will support you 100,

1640
01:55:06,628 --> 01:55:07,827
no matter what.

1641
01:55:07,829 --> 01:55:10,430
- But you're forgetting one thing.
- Hm?

1642
01:55:10,432 --> 01:55:14,234
- We said for life.
- For life, baby.

1643
01:55:18,407 --> 01:55:21,074
- There's my nephew.
- Yes.

1644
01:55:21,076 --> 01:55:23,043
- Hey.
- Little Marcus just woke up.

1645
01:55:23,045 --> 01:55:25,946
Okay, first things first.

1646
01:55:25,948 --> 01:55:28,014
Little surprise for you.

1647
01:55:28,016 --> 01:55:30,383
Three days at
the Marion Springs Resort.

1648
01:55:30,385 --> 01:55:33,053
You know, kind of
a little apology

1649
01:55:33,055 --> 01:55:34,988
for the spa day I crashed.

1650
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:37,824
Yes, a little
quality time, baby.

1651
01:55:37,826 --> 01:55:39,526
- Quality time.
- Yeah, baby,

1652
01:55:39,528 --> 01:55:42,095
but Megan and Reggie
are on their honeymoon.

1653
01:55:42,097 --> 01:55:44,764
Oh, I got the baby this weekend.

1654
01:55:44,766 --> 01:55:46,733
Me and my AMMO squad.

1655
01:55:46,735 --> 01:55:48,868
You and Theresa go ahead,
have fun.

1656
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:50,804
You still got
them blue pills, right?

1657
01:55:50,806 --> 01:55:52,372
I don't need
no damn blue pills.

1658
01:55:52,374 --> 01:55:54,341
That's what you said
about your glasses.

1659
01:55:54,343 --> 01:55:56,810
That baby looks good
on you, Mike.

1660
01:55:56,812 --> 01:55:59,145
You do look good holding
a baby, Mike.

1661
01:55:59,147 --> 01:56:01,316
- Yeah, you think?
- I do.

1662
01:56:02,784 --> 01:56:04,884
You good, Mike? Let's go, team.

1663
01:56:04,886 --> 01:56:06,253
- Yep.
- Wait, nothing...

1664
01:56:06,255 --> 01:56:09,055
Wait, no. We said we were
doing this together.

1665
01:56:09,057 --> 01:56:10,490
Oh, no, I have to work.

1666
01:56:10,492 --> 01:56:12,025
I'll check on you tomorrow.

1667
01:56:12,027 --> 01:56:14,194
- I'll bring wine.
- Rita, stop playing. Hey, no.

1668
01:56:14,196 --> 01:56:17,664
Y'all all agreed that we were
all gonna stay with the baby.

1669
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:19,332
Marcus,
I'll be in the car.

1670
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:23,136
- Just text my mom.
- Oh, okay, that's not fun... No.

1671
01:56:23,138 --> 01:56:25,505
Okay. All right, all right. Shh.

1672
01:56:26,908 --> 01:56:29,677

It's a big one.

1684
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:35,909
Opportunity may have
presented itself

1685

some of that debt.

Would you fuck a witch
without a condom?

1689
01:58:04,973 --> 01:58:06,875
I would not.

1690
01:58:08,543 --> 01:58:10,477
He would not, Mike.

1691
01:58:12,416 --> 01:58:17,416
