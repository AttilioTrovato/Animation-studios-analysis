- Yeah?

678
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:11,205
Like, rabies, you know?

679
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:12,915
Like, when you act dangerous

680
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:15,501
- and contagious and scary.
- Huh?

681
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,712
- ALLEY DOG: Hmm.
- Like, you're gonna kill someone.

682
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:21,299
Oh. I have rabies!

683
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:24,552
- I am acting dangerous!
- Oh, my goodness!

684
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:26,804
- Easy, easy.
- And contagious!

685
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:29,682
And sometimes, it's even a little more
subtle than that.

686
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:32,852
- Rabies! Rabies! Rabies!
- And sometimes, it's not.

- Yes, you are.

690
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:43,696
Oh, right! Yes, I am!
I'm getting rabies everywhere! (GROWLING)

691
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,323
Even the sausages?

692
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:46,657
Oh, yeah!

693
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,077
- ALLEY DOG: What?
- Yes, especially on the sausages.

694
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,496
- These are rabies sausages now.
- What do we do?

695
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:52,914
Quick, run! Save yourself!

696
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:54,165
What about my sausages?

697
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,000
- Just go! Just leave it!
- (GROWLING)

698
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,586
- Here she comes!
- Wait, stop! I think she's got me!

703

Wait, I seem to remember
you calling me a street dog,

704
00:38:10,098 --> 00:38:12,767
but here you are out on the streets.

705
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,146
Strange. Let me guess,
baby moves in, dog moves out?

No, not at all!

Uh-huh. You're welcome
for saving your life, by the way.

709

And in exchange, I got you a free meal.
So, I think we're even.

That's the craziest "thank you"
I've ever gotten.

711
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,245
Maybe you do have rabies.

712
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:34,664
Hilarious. Okay, well,
seeing as I'm the reason

713
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:38,167
that you got that garbage,
help me get this thing off my face.

714
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:41,629
(SCOFFS) Fine. I'll see what I can do.

715
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:43,548
I think I got a friend who can help.

716
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,800
Now, he's a little stiff.
Kinda reminds me of you.

717

718

Please. Don't be ridiculous.
This is my friend.

- LADY: Of course it is.
- Come on.

721
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,860
You just need to hook that wire
onto his teeth.

722
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:07,155
- Is your plan for him to bite it off?
- Would you just do it?

723
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:09,198
Like this?

724
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:12,744
- This doesn't feel like progress.
- Do you want me to help you or not?

725
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,787
Just lean back
so this thing doesn't move...

- What? Could you stop moving so much?

as hard as we can. You ready?

Oh, okay.

I guess I won't bother telling you
that's the, uh, wrong way.

755
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:32,448
I mean, if you're going home,
that would be the wrong way.

No, I know. I just wanted to see
what was over there.

- Now, I'm going home.
- Okay.

(GROANS) Okay, yes, I am lost.

760
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:47,630
So, you just gonna stand there and mock me
or are you gonna help me out?

761

Is that an either or question?
Because ideally...

762
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:51,801
Just point. I'll be on my way, okay?

763

I would like to get home eventually.

770

Why do you even want to go home?

771
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:19,537
I told you.

about me by now.

You may think that you know people,
but you don't know my people, okay?

779

wind up on the streets.

Now you try.

1015
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:08,681
I don't know if I can.

1016
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:10,475
Of course you can.

1019
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,021
What?

1020
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:17,940
Okay, look, you just
gotta reach down deep,

1021
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:20,526
and you gotta find
that inner wolf inside you.

1022
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,652
Go ahead.

1023
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:24,155
Okay, give me a minute.
It might be buried deep.

or were you just kinda warming up?

Hey. (STUTTERS) It's not so bad.

1042
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:18,793
Look at you now. You're up here,
you're howling at the moon!

1043
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:23,631
Yesterday, the only experiences you had
were from behind a fence.

1044

Yeah, I know! I know.

1045
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:30,680
But there was a lot behind that fence.

1046
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:32,932
You know?

1047
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:36,227
My life was full of love and meaning.

1048
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:39,647
I was a part of something special.

1049
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:42,567
We were a family.

1050
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:47,697
It doesn't matter how much howling I do,
I feel bad about leaving them.

1051
00:55:49,574 --> 00:55:51,701
You don't have to worry
about leaving them.

1052
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,457
They already left you. I mean, look,
I know how much it hurts...

1053
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,459
No, how? How would you know?

1054
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:03,963

You do know.

1057
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:16,851
You did have a home, didn't you?

1058
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:17,935
Yeah.

1059
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:20,104

And if I were still with 'em,
I wouldn't have met you.

I should've just believed you.

No. You shouldn't have believed me.

Whatever I said about that, about,
you know, being free and...

1375

That was not true.

1376
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:32,298
Because being free without you there,
now it's just...

1377

I wasn't so sure at first but,
you know, it's like Lady said,

"Our world is bigger now."

1716
01:34:18,132 --> 01:34:20,676

About the time I sniffed out
a dog catcher?
