4
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,664
<i>Mist coming in--</i>

5
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:48,454
<i>--Like something is brewing,
about to begin--</i>

6
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:53,609
<i>--Can't put me finger on what lies in store--</i>

7
00:00:54,309 --> 00:01:00,252
<i>--But I feel what's to happen,
all happened before--</i>

8
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:39,079
Mrs Travers.

9
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,471
Like pink clouds on sticks.

10
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:49,811
Excuse me?

11
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,454
The cherry blossoms,
I was trying to think of what it looks like--

12
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:56,534
The car should be here, by now.

13
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,533
May I use.. the phone?

14
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:03,440
I cancelled it.
- You--?  What?

15
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,202
Pamela!
- Mrs Travers.

16
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:09,402
Mrs Travers...

17
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:12,160
Why would you cancel the car?
- I shan't be going.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,872
We've been through this.

19
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:18,247
- I've changed my mind.
- You made an agreement.

20
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:21,040
Do you understand?
A verbal agreement.

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,273
Why in the world are you speaking to me
as if I am a neonate?

22
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:26,053
He's going to--
- What? What is he going to do? Sue?

23
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,715
He is very welcome to every penny
I don't posess.

24
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:33,674
Look----I've represented you for a long time.

25
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:36,885
I like to think of you as a friend--

26
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:40,629
I like to think of it,
believe me I know it's not reciprocated.

27
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:42,948
I would never,

28
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,544
suggest you do something that would cause you
anguish but there's no more money Pamela

29
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,173
-- Mrs Travers. Simply no more.

30
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,255
Sales have dried up, no more royalties.
You refuse to write further books so-

31
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:58,764
Do you understand? I'm..

32
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,100
I'm..frightened,
you don't understand what that means.

33
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:03,730
I know what he's going to do to her--

34
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,916
- she'll be cavorting and twinkling!
Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze--

35
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,833
--We've been trying to do this deal for twenty years!

36
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,359
He's agreed to both your stipulations.
No animation,

37
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,490
script approval--
- Use her to pay my bills? If I believed..

38
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,990
in a hell I'll be sitting in its waiting room--

39
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:22,610
--script approval! He's never granted
anything like that before! I don't know what else to do!

40
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,521
Where is Polly?
- I fired her.

41
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:37,503
It's just as well. It seems
I can't afford her anymore anyway.

42
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,558
You don't know how much she means to me.

43
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,758
Polly?

44
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,709
Of course not Polly!

45
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,467
For God's sake.
Los...Angeles.

46
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,175
You have only to go there and work for two weeks.

47
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:00,583
Collaborate.

48
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,854
You haven't signed the rights over, yet.
- Yet!

49
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,357
You must make it work Mrs Travers--
- Oh I must, must I?

50
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:11,289
You need the money. I don't want you to see you--
- Stop saying money! It's a filthy, disgusting word!

51
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,090
I am picking up the telephone Mrs Travers--

52
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,664
I..I have final say?
- You do.

53
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:24,314
I have final say.

54
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:26,851
And if I don't like what they are doing to her?

55
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:28,651
Then, You don't sign the papers.

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,860
He cannot make the film unless
you grant the rights.

57
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,427
It's an exploratory trip--

58
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,984
What do you say?

59
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,770
I want to keep my house.

60
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,495
mm..hhm?
Excuse me ma'am,

61
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,817
have you seen my daughter?

62
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:06,324
I was quite sure,
I had left her around here somewhere!

63
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,302
Her name is Helen,

64
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,502
no, erm.. Shirley,

65
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:17,690
No, erm.. good lord;
I've quite forgotten!

66
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,372
Could it be Prunella?
- No!

67
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,892
Pamela?
- No, no...no. No!

68
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:27,226
I'm sure I have a special name for her..
- Ginty!

69
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,750
Why, thank you ma'am!
Ginty it is of course!

70
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,484
Now, have you seen her?
- It's me!

71
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:40,721
Gosh! So it is!

72
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:43,088
Well, thank goodness for that!

73
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:46,744
I was positive, I was going to be beheaded for losing..

74
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:52,934
Her Highness.. The Royal Princess
Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!

75
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,134
You can't lose me!

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,273
Never. I promise.

77
00:05:58,207 --> 00:05:59,998
I will never lose you!

78
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,176
You ready?
Are you sure?

79
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,500
C'mon! The adventure is about to begin!
C'mon.

80
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,535
Line: 84   (Silen=83.62) (EMedp=1.985)

81
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,425
Line: 85   (Silen=80.21) (EMedp=2.171)

82
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,474
Can I help you?
- I'm perfectly capable thank you.

83
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:22,674
They've used all the space;

84
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,810
...so greedy.
- I'll take it Madam.  I can put it up in front.

85
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,010
I don't want it up there. I would it here,

86
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,675
in the corresponding holding area
for my assigned seat!

87
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,695
The flight's closing in just a few moments Madam.
I'll have to take it.

88
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:36,152
You can move mine instead.
It's the grey one.

89
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,352
- Thank you.

90
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,854
Will the child be a nuisance?
It's an eleven hour flight.

91
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,496
Er-- no,--
- Jolly good.

92
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,224
I hope we crash.

93
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,613
Where is he carriage?

94
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,477
A carriage? Who needs a carriage?

95
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,571
But, there's so many...
- Every leisurely stroll is a gift, Darling!

96
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,771
It's a gift!

97
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,373
Now, Biddy..
are up staying?

98
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,573
You're coming with us?
- Mmm, hm.

99
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:22,773
Excellent!

100
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,528
Thank you so much.
For everything.<font color=#D3EFFE>-: D</font>

101
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:31,728
Thank you, Miss.

102
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,422
Hurry up, everyone!
We mustn't be late the train.

103
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,320
All aboard!
Everybody ready?

104
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Yes.

105
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,069
See you soon Katie Nanna!
- Take care, love.

106
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,184
Everybody ready?

107
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,912
Walking bus!
Left, right..left...

108
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,112
Miss?

109
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,049
Thank you.

110
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,309
Left. Left, right left...

111
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,809
And, one, two three-
New town,

112
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,994
new job, new bank.
New life.

113
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,658
Come on, my little ducklings!

114
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,240
Left, right left..
C'mon, come along!

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,890
Hold!

116
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,520
Allora--

117
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,295
Ginty, Come on, my love.

118
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,163
<font color=#50BEFA>Pilot:</font><i>"Ladies and Gentlemen,
we begin our descent into Los Angeles."</i>

119
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,365
Fiery dust, I see.

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,105
Travers? P.L. Travers?
- Mrs.

121
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,060
Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers!
Welcome to the City of Angels.

122
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,150
Let me take those.

123
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,575
I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh, nevermind.

124
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,475
Sun came out to say hello just to you.

125
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:48,995
Don't be preposterous.

126
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,805
It smells. Like--

127
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:55,327
Jasmine.
--chlorine and sweat.

128
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,406
It's dreadful.

129
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,560
Absurt.

130
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,655
You okay back there Mrs P.L. Travers?

131
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:30,810
It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--
Oh, it's too hot.

132
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,670
No problemo!

133
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,770
No problemo! We got a brand new
air conditioning system, Missus;

134
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:42,370
Just about make you feel like
you're in good old Engerland again!

135
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,673
Things they can put in cars these days--

136
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,873
Gosh almighty.

137
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,299
No problemo.

138
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,465
And, here we are. Ma'm.

139
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:14,239
Thank you.
- Ma'am?

140
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:17,202
Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am?

141
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,499
Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments;

142
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,514
May I suggest, you take employment in a launderette.

143
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,496
Odd.

144
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,540
Oh, Dear.

145
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
For Heaven's sake...

146
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,944
What on earth..

147
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,635
Oh no, no, no.
No, no, no.

148
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:56,835
This will never do.

149
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,178
Absolutely, no pears.

150
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,539
No pears.

151
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:15,730
A palace!

152
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,887
Complete with mighty steed.

153
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,797
And chickens.

154
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:21,997
Oh, my..

155
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:24,082
We'll build beautiful memories here my angel.

156
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:28,813
Girls, come on.

157
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:36,983
--in this house, you get to share room.

158
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,576
How old do you think i am?

159
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:19,445
A five years old...
I suppose.

160
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:55,248
And you can stay there
until you learn the art of subtlety.

161
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,339
There you are.

162
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,151
Don't worry!

163
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,706
There's nothing wrong with your television set.

164
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,000
This is a pixie bell,

165
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,273
the sound is much too high for human ears.

166
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,511
Oh, there you are Tink!

167
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,912
Hey! What..Hey!

168
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,914
Get that stuff off of me!

169
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,619
You know, if you're familiar with our story
of Peter Pan.

170
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,917
You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust
can make you fly!

171
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,885
Where are you going, Tink?
Haven't you forgotten something?

172
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:55,085
Off!

173
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,235
That's how we deal with you.

174
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,760
Good morning Mrs!
- It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, nevermind.

175
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,242
We're just not going to get it right are we?

176
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:21,820
What's that?

177
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,574
Will it be the same..

178
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:28,072
driver every day?
- Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.

179
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:31,555
Hey, Sun came out again!

180
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,379
You say it like you're surprised.
As if the sun is particular about whom it appears.

181
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:40,179
It seems you think that I am responsible,
for it's miraculous dawning every day.

182
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,466
For heaven's sake, it's California!

183
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,666
It certainly is!

184
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
I would so much rather be accountable for the rain.

185
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,150
Oh, that's sad.

186
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,060
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

187
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,180
I shan't bother explaining why;
it'll just...Zip!

188
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,590
Okey dokey.

189
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,660
The rain brings life!

190
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:12,035
So does the sun.

191
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,314
Be quiet!
- Yes ma'am.

192
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,165
I'll get that, Sir!

193
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,400
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,650
Good morning! Pamela!

195
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,030
It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger
use my first name.

196
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,705
Mrs Travers. Please.

197
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,905
I do apologize,

198
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:59,567
Mrs Travers.
I am Don DaGradi, the script writer.

199
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,376
Co-script-writer.
I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.

200
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,576
Gradi.

201
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,267
Wonderful! I welcome your input.
- If indeed we ever sign off on a script.

202
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,540
Right, uhmm..

203
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,081
this is the rest of your team,
This is Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics.

204
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:21,406
Boys, this is the one and only Mrs P.L. Travers,
creator of our beloved Mary.

205
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,761
Poppins.
<i>- Who else?</i> - Mary Poppins.

206
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:24,961
Never ever, just Mary.

207
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,841
A pleasure to meet you, though I  fear
we shan't be acquainted for too long.

208
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,041
Why is that?
- B'cos These books...

209
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:35,506
simply do not lend themselves
to chirping and prancing.

210
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,870
No. Certainly not a musical.

211
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,536
Now, where is Mister Disney?

212
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:43,396
I should so much like to get this started and finished
as briskly as is humanly possible.

213
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:46,224
Perhaps, one of you can point me in his direction.
That'd be superb..wonderful. Thank you.

214
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,424
We were hoping to give you
a little tour of the studio.

215
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,620
No thank you.

216
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,040
Walt just wants to show the place off.

217
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
No one likes a show off.

218
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,925
Mrs Travers-- it's quitea long way--

219
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,585
Not a musical?

220
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,695
I am perfectly capable of walking.

221
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,160
Good morning.
- Good morning, Dolly..

222
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,200
Could you let Mister Disney know
I have arrived please?

223
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,840
Absolutely, please have a seat.

224
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,580
Oh, no. There's no need.

225
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,390
He'll be just a.. a moment, Mrs.Travers.
Why don't we sit.

226
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,994
She's here!

227
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:43,292
A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I may.

228
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:45,940
You may. Whether I heed it or not
will be another matter entirely.

229
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,193
Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney.

230
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,640
We are all on a first name basis here.

231
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,820
Well,

232
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
there ya are at last!

233
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,609
Oh, my dear gal!

234
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,550
You can't imagine how excited I am to finally meet you!

235
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,047
Hum-- well, It's an honour, Mister Disney.
- Oh Walt, you gotta call me Walt.

236
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,382
‘Mister Disney?was my old man.
Isn't that right, Don?

237
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:21,582
Absolutely, Walt.

238
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,080
Tommie, say hello to...
the one and only Pamela Travers!

239
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,930
It's so nice to meet you.

240
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,037
Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L. Travers,
right here, in my office,

241
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,691
after all these years-- almost twenty of ‘em.

242
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,220
Yes.
- Twenty. Long. Years.

243
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,530
Wish ya coulda?seen me then Pam!

244
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,310
As lean as a whippet I was! A race horse!

245
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,910
Well, anyway...

246
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
here you are. Look at you!

247
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,770
I could eat you up!

248
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,840
That wouldn't be appropriate.

249
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,989
You know what.
When Diane here was...

250
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,599
seven years old--
can I get you a drink? Coffee? Soda?

251
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,513
A pot of tea would be most welcome.

252
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,603
Anyway, She was seven years old
and I was walking past her room..

253
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,194
and there she was on her bed reading
to her sister Sharon,

254
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:14,953
and well, thsoe gals were giggling
their little socks off!

255
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:15,520
Tommie,

256
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,240
A hot tea for Pamela and Me.

257
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,300
She's a doll.

258
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,070
Anyways,

259
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,548
I asked them girls, what's so funny??

260
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,560
And Diane said to me, why daddy,

261
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,020
Mary Poppins!?

262
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,980
Well, I didn't even know what a Mary Poppins was!

263
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,440
And then she gave me your book.
And oh, by gosh! My imagination was caught on fire!

264
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,230
Absolutely, ON FIRE!

265
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,900
And those embers have burned ever since-- as you know.
- I do.

266
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,112
Yes.
- Twenty years!

267
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:50,312
So you keep saying--

268
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,230
A man cannot...

269
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,120
break a promise he's made to his kids.
No matter how long it takes for him..

270
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,720
to make it come true..Now,

271
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,900
You might've kept me dangling all this time,

272
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,880
but now, I gotcha!

273
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,820
Gotcha indeed!

274
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,960
Mister Disney, if you have

275
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,770
dangled then it is at the end of a rope
you have fashioned for yourself.

276
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,430
I was perfectly clear, when you approached me
20 years ago..that she wasn't for sale

277
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,600
and I was clear again when you approached me the following year,
and clear again when you approached me every annum

278
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,360
for the subsequent 18 years.
Quite honestly, I feel corralled, --

279
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,951
Oh no, Pam, the last thing I wanna do is to make you feel--
- Would you mind, my name, is MRS Travers.

280
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,151
I promised them.

281
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:35,451
That's a fact. You got kids?
- No, not precisely...

282
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,420
I have never, I absolutely never, gone back on a promise
i made to either one of my daughters.

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,260
That's what being a daddy is all about right?

284
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,120
Is it?

285
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,497
Our motion picture isn't just going to make my kids happy.

286
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,697
It's going to make ALL kids happy!
Adults too...

287
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,920
B'cos, my guys are gonna do things with it that are,
well, are revolutionary.

288
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,864
Pam, REVOLUTIONARY! Your Mary Poppins is gonna literally
fly off the pages of your books!

289
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:00,064
Thank you, Tommie.

290
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:06,080
This magical woman who has only lived in your head,
you're gonna be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing.

291
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,770
Now, this singing, I am glad you've come to that.

292
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,670
oh, Milk in first, please.

293
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,110
Then, the tea.

294
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,340
And a spoonful of sugar.

295
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,180
You don't mean for this film to be a musical?

296
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,052
I absolutely do!

297
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,252
No.
- No?

298
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:24,452
No.

299
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,198
Mister Disney, Mary Poppins..

300
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:31,063
does not sing.

301
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:32,263
Yes she does!

302
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,580
When?
- In your books!

303
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,700
Those aren't songs!
They're recitations.

304
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,289
She is not a giddy woman,

305
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,789
she does not jig about!
Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary,

306
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,460
for a governess, an educatress. No.
It would just ruin it.

307
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,937
I won't have her turned into
one of your silly cartoons.

308
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,930
Now...Pam,

309
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,460
I want you to know--

310
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,100
that the last thing I would do,

311
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,780
the very last thing,

312
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,212
is tarnish a story, I have cherished.
Now, the pages--

313
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:19,636
pages of your book are worn down to tissue,

314
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:24,577
They  are dog eared and falling out.
B'cos,  I have poured over them gripped, tormented.

315
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:25,777
Because I love her, Pam.

316
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,090
I love Mary Poppins,

317
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,578
you... you got to share her,
with me.

318
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,700
Nothing happens without your say so.

319
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,671
Quite right.
- It's all here, in the rights agreement.

320
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:49,033
As approved by your agent,Dermot.
- Diarmuid.

321
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,233
Darmitt.

322
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,892
A live action film. No animation.

323
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,282
Live action.
Here's a pen.

324
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,271
I'll like that on tape.
<i>- On tape?</i>

325
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,989
Your promise-- and all the discussions we have here
-- on tape.

326
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,990
Ah huh, there you are.

327
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,780
Mary Poppins and the Banks's,
they're family to me.

328
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,600
I understand now.
I do.

329
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:20,296
Well then!

330
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,070
Shall we begin?

331
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,290
Let's make something wonderful.

332
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,626
Let's see if that's at all possible.

333
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:38,011
Woah.

334
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,050
Damn.

335
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,330
Testing, one, two.

336
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,760
What is all this...

337
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,873
jollification?
- We have a whole script to get through.

338
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:06,073
It's gonna be a long day Mrs T.

339
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,260
Mrs..
Mrs Travers.

340
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,065
We could save a starving country
with benefaction from this room alone!

341
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,840
Ugh, It's so vulgar.

342
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,020
Could you, turn on--

343
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,630
Now, Let us begin.

344
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,770
Scene one.
<i>- Scene one. Ext.</i>

345
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,987
Exterior Cherry Tree Lane.
<i>- Ext? What's Ext?</i>

346
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,530
Exterior. It means
the scene is taking place outside.

347
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,990
Ah, I see, an abbreviation.

348
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,720
Oh, I'm sorry Mr DaGradi,
did you feel you should--?

349
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,623
No, No, please be my guest,
Mrs Travers.

350
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:45,823
Yes, I do think it's best.
I've the most practise.

351
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,908
Readings of my books you know?

352
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,108
Absolutely.
- Anyway--

353
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,750
Scene one. Exterior.

354
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,620
17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day.

355
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,862
Yes. That's good, that can stay.

356
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:02,389
- That's just the scene heading!
--Though I do think we should say number 17,
instead of just 17,It's proper. Yes?

357
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,589
- No one's going to see it.

358
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,789
I will see it.

359
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:08,176
Write it down, write it down,
chop chop.

360
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,087
Is that on the tape?
We got that?

361
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:12,856
Ahh..Yes.
-Very good.

362
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,056
-- onwards.

363
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:15,972
I'm sorry to interrupt.

364
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,340
Is this a joke?

365
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,581
Excuse me?
- Do you think you are a comedienne?

366
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,619
I'm sorry I don't understand.

367
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,819
Unbelievable.

368
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,682
I think we are all set with..with..
thank you.

369
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,000
Scene One. Exterior. <b>Number</b>

370
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,750
17 Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day.

371
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,497
Bert, a one-man band- The rumour is that
this is to be your Mr.Van Dyke. Is that right?

372
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:42,697
We do hope so!
- Well, we'll see about that.

373
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:43,897
It's a horrid idea.

374
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,450
Dick is one of the greats.

375
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,640
Dick Van Dyke?!
- Yes.

376
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,244
Robert, my dear,

377
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,208
Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness

378
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:01,100
- greats without question. I can assure you..
I can assure you--

379
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,927
that Dick Van Dyke is not!

380
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:12,067
Bert, a one-man band plays to a small gathering
outside the gates to the park.

381
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,988
Bert says--
You can do Bert.

382
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,162
Thank you. Ahhmm?

383
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,362
Guys..shall we...

384
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,310
give it a whirl?

385
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,580
What's happening?

386
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,712
What're you doing?

387
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:34,081
Alright Ladies and gents, comical poem,
suitable for the occasion--

388
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,281
--extemporized and thought up
before your very eyes!

389
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,799
Alright, here we go--

390
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,610
Room here for everyone gather around,

391
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,690
The constable's "responstable."

392
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,360
Now, how does that sound?
- No no no no... no no no.

393
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,810
Responstable

394
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,500
is not a word.

395
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:57,763
We made it up!
- well..

396
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:00,767
un-make it up.

397
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,961
Irresponstable.

398
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,260
There's my girl.

399
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,160
Ahhh,

400
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,820
That's it, boy. Albert c'mon.
Give Ginty a kiss.

401
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,085
There you go.

402
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,070
Poor old Albert;

403
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,530
he's your secret uncle you know?

404
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,038
But a miserable,
horrid witch turned him into a nag.

405
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,730
Why did she do that?

406
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,200
Because she hated the sound of his laugh.

407
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,980
Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix him?

408
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,540
We have to teach the witch
how to be happy again.

409
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,380
How?

410
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,290
I'm not quite sure darling.

411
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,030
Do you want to know
what it feels like to fly Ginty?

412
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,470
Albert. You old nag.
Come here.

413
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,470
You trust me?
- Yes.

414
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,640
Yah!

415
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:21,758
Nobody walks.

416
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,970
Leisurely stroll's a gift.

417
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,240
Beautiful ain't it?

418
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,110
If you like that sort of thing.

419
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,260
I do.

420
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,310
We do find it helps to have a visual.

421
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,976
Plus, It's fun!

422
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,600
No, no, no. Goodness me, no.

423
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
- No?

424
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,410
The Banks house doesn't look like that!
No No.

425
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,590
My house is a terraced house

426
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,500
with a pink door, white bricked

427
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,433
with a crack in the gable.
- Okay,  we get it. The house is not what you pictured.

428
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,180
The window frames are lead-lined

429
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,558
and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums
to go with the pink door.

430
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:48,758
We got that?

431
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,774
Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.
It's all wrong.

432
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:54,152
It's all wrong?
- It's too grand!

433
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:57,761
The Banks's are -
normal, everyday sort of people.

434
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:58,961
This isn't normal. It isn't everyday!

435
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,652
They're not aristocrats!

436
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,860
Oh, Do I even have to say it?

437
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,290
Um-- i'm afraid so.

438
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,826
Why in the world have you made
Mrs Banks a silly suffragette?

439
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,026
- I wonder if Emmeline P
would agree with that adjective--

440
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,116
Quite possibly, looking back.
- It does seem

441
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:43,438
strange that Mrs Banks allows
her children to spend all of their time

442
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,740
with the nanny when she has no job to speak of--

443
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,077
Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful?
- Yep.

444
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,499
No! Of course not!
We just felt that if she had a job

445
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,999
it would go some way to explaining--
- Being a mother is a job.

446
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,340
A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to,
that not everybody should have taken on in the first place!

447
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,950
I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.

448
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,405
At least something warm,

449
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,209
something a bit..
sexy.

450
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,710
How about Mavis?

451
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,290
Sybil?
- Great.

452
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,934
Prudence?
- Gwendolyn?

453
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:17,134
Winifred!

454
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,650
I could go with Winifred.

455
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,760
Yes, that's because it's very good.

456
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,870
This isn't Mr Banks? This isn't him.
- Yes, that's him Mr.Banks.

457
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,540
He has a set of moustaches!

458
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,463
In the books he--
- I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair

459
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:35,680
but she chose to ignore me.
Now, this time around..

460
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,600
This is MY film and I shall have MY way.

461
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,987
Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt.

462
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:43,187
Why?

463
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,660
I think he identify..
- He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven!

464
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
Does it matter?

465
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,680
Does it

466
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,050
mattterrrrrrr?

467
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,810
You can wait outside!

468
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:08,408
I shan't say it again Robert.

469
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,758
What is wrong with his leg?

470
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,625
He got shot.

471
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:26,825
Hardly surprising.

472
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,415
Can I expect anymore drama from anyone else?

473
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,200
Why do you do that?

474
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,240
For you my dear!

475
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,208
Tell me, Gintamina.

476
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
Which kind of kisses do you prefer..

477
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,681
Scratchy ones or silky ones?

478
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:19,881
- Silky ones.

479
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:27,928
Well then, Swish!
Swoosh!

480
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,334
A man must shave
for to spare his daughter's cheeks!

481
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,261
Swish!

482
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:45,873
Swish!

483
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,886
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

484
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,068
What on earth are you talking about?
Supercali--? Supercali--

485
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,500
or whatever the infernal thing is!
- It's something to say when,

486
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,735
when you don't know what to say!
- Well I always know what to say.

487
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,070
If you so much as step one foot in here

488
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,140
with that tray I shall scream!

489
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,770
One cannot live on cake alone!

490
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,640
Hit me with it.

491
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,898
She has a lot of-- ideas.

492
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:22,740
Ya? What kind of ideas?

493
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,950
The name Cynthia has been changed to Winifred.

494
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,870
Fine, fine.

495
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,456
She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

496
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,230
The sketches of the Banks house
make it look too opulent,

497
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,310
there must be no hint of romance
between Mary Poppins and Bert,

498
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,140
she wants to know why Mr Banks
has been given a moustache, <i>--I asked for that.</i>

499
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,040
Yes. They did tell her that
but she wants to know why.

500
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,030
Because, I asked for it.

501
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:57,858
Right. Of course.

502
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:02,190
Uh-- the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record
Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape,

503
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,860
not a ruler,

504
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
She only wants green vegetables and broth,

505
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,930
I don't know what that is

506
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,615
but she wants it in the room from now on

507
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,388
and oh! She doesn't want the colour red in the film--

508
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,886
at all.

509
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,750
I've simply gone off the colour.

510
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,970
We can't make the film without the colour red!

511
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,500
The film is set in London for pete's sake.

512
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,063
- And?

513
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,170
There's buses and mail boxes

514
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,380
and guards uniforms-- heck!
The British flag!

515
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,400
I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do.

516
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,445
I just-- hm-- I don't know what it is,

517
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,610
I'm just suddenly very anti-red.

518
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,060
I shan't be wearing it ever again.

519
00:38:49,972 --> 00:38:51,575
Is this a test Pamela?

520
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,490
Are you requiring proof

521
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,520
of how badly I wanna make you happy
so that we can create this beautiful thing together?

522
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,356
I took you at your word Mr Disney?

523
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:05,122
and it seems my first stipulation has been denied.

524
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:06,420
There will be many more,

525
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,084
so-- perhaps we should just call it quits;

526
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,980
and I should hand you back these.

527
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:29,223
Alright.

528
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:32,114
No red in the picture.

529
00:39:32,314 --> 00:39:33,300
What?! Walt?

530
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,100
He doesn't have the rights--

531
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,623
Quite.

532
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,420
Tommie!

533
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,890
Scotch Mist.

534
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,220
What do you think?

535
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,160
What do I think I-- what?
- You're a woman.

536
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,500
That's a canny observation Walt.

537
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,610
What am I missing here?

538
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,740
You think the female of the
species has some sort

539
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,670
of psychic insight
when it comes to others of her kind?

540
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,350
We don't.

541
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,082
You'll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling.

542
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:26,282
Give it up.

543
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,402
That woman.

544
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,620
Good afternoon Ma'am.
What can I fix you?

545
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,780
A pot of tea.
If you please.

546
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,570
Sure thing.

547
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,360
Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul
don't you agree?

548
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,350
Girls, will you please just..

549
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,050
In you go.

550
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,720
Alright?

551
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,830
Ahoy Goffs!
- Father!

552
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,050
Ahh, that's better.

553
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,470
What a wonderful surprise!

554
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,720
Did you finish early?

555
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,190
couldn't stop thinking about
my beautiful girls on this--

556
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,420
beautiful day in this beautiful place..

557
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,820
.. and I thought to hell with it!

558
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,690
Don't you have work to do?
- But--

559
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,280
Buts are for goats my love!

560
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:44,252
I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

561
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,780
A gift of a pear, for my lady.

562
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,751
Now...What are we playing?

563
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,860
-The hen got out and we've been trying
to catch her!

564
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,152
That's no hen!

565
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,140
That's Aunt Ellie,

566
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,243
your mother's horrendiferous sister!

567
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,890
That's a made up word!
- Yes, it is.

568
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,490
Hury! Catch her before she flies away on the--
- West Wind!

569
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,690
West Wind!

570
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,478
--darling, it's just that um--
a little scared--

571
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:57,848
--Meg sweet,
I had a throat scratch

572
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,670
But, the bank is getting you down again?

573
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,490
Perhaps my sister--
- no!

574
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,507
God no!

575
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,900
No. I can endure.

576
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,991
I will endure. For the girl's sake--

577
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,073
Just, please--
not Ellie.

578
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:40,198
She's a Foul fowl.

579
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,937
It's gotta be like a slogan!
- Her prescription for life.

580
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:49,653
An apple a day.
- A stitch in time!

581
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,784
Time and tide wait for no man.

582
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,360
Sugar!

583
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,676
Sugar?
- Yeah.

584
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:03,155
Jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday.

585
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,350
No ouch.
- No ouch?

586
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,320
Sugar. They put it in a cube.
- Medicine in sugar?

587
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Cube's an odd word.

588
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,230
Spoonful?

589
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,520
You need sugar with sugar.

590
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,350
Well, Morning!
May I walk with you?

591
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,233
I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws
against it..

592
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:32,380
Nope. Go back to the chorus.

593
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,004
<i>Chorus..Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down!</i>

594
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:41,890
<i>medicine..</i>

595
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,050
It's missing...?

596
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,090
WAIT! She always does what's unexpected.

597
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,620
She goes UP the bannisters.

598
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,890
So, go up.

599
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:02,176
<i>Just.. a... spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down.</i>

600
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:03,376
That's it. That's it!

601
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,960
Man is in the forest.
I want you to play that..

602
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,340
for him. Walt?

603
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,786
It's just a chorus--
Tell us what you think.

604
00:46:14,986 --> 00:46:19,970
He knows dum dum
Will help dum dum dum duuuum!

605
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:27,265
<i>For a..a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down--</i>

606
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:31,561
<i>the medicine go do-own,
medicine go down;</i>

607
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:36,244
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down.</i>

608
00:46:36,444 --> 00:46:39,579
<i>In a most de da dee daaa!</i>

609
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,754
We'll work out the other lyrics.
- You see how it goes up on the word down?

610
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:48,483
It's ironic.
- Forget ironic, it's iconic.

611
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,820
I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!

612
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:55,127
Well, It seems enormously patronising to me.

613
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,007
The very sort of annoying tune
you would have playing in your themed park I daresay.

614
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:02,723
All giddy and carefree, encouraging
children to face the world unarmed.

615
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:08,284
All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a
brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life'stools.

616
00:47:08,484 --> 00:47:09,484
Wonderful!

617
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,090
What's your point Pam?

618
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,365
- MRS Travers! Please.

619
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:19,745
My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is
the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.

620
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:20,945
She is truthful,

621
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,623
She doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world
that these children will eventually come to know.

622
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,166
She prepares them for it,
she deals in honesty!

623
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,652
One must clean one's room;
it won't magically do it itself!

624
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:35,404
This entire script is flim flam!

625
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:36,604
Where is its heart?

626
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,520
Where is its reality? Where...

627
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,306
.. is the gravitas?

628
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,550
No weight Mister Disney!

629
00:47:58,026 --> 00:47:59,543
See?

630
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,780
No whimsy or sentiment says the woman..

631
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,427
who sends a flying nanny with a
talking umbrella to save the children.

632
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:11,432
You think Mary Poppins is saving
the children Mr Disney?

633
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,095
Oh dear.

634
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,460
Mr Belhatchett!
- Good afternoon.

635
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:35,438
Allow me--

636
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,380
I want you gone.

637
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:11,829
Ginty!

638
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:17,266
Sweet thing! What are you doing here?

639
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:21,325
You said today was ice cream day.

640
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,930
Ice cream day! Yes! I did!

641
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,277
What kind of father am I?
Come here.

642
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:36,511
Are you fired again?

643
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:41,988
Ah, yes it does seem that--
- No sweetheart--

644
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:45,587
No. He isn't.

645
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:51,591
Darling, wait inside for a second.

646
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,930
If you can't straighten up for your own sake.

647
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,020
Do it for your daughter.

648
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,303
Irresponsible.

649
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,760
We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

650
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,220
This world..

651
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,855
is just an illusion, Ginty old girl.

652
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,893
As long as we hold that thought dear,
they can't break us.

653
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,800
They can't make us endure
their reality.

654
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,330
They can bloody as it is.

655
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,540
Money, money, money.

656
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,810
Don't you buy into it Ginty!

657
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,800
It'll bite you on the bot!

658
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,000
I loathe this place, Mr Russell.

659
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,188
It's bringing up these-- it's..

660
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:25,388
it's so hot and stuffy I--

661
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,980
..feel as I am being attacked.

662
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,670
These odd dreams,

663
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,370
like my subconscious is after me.
Punishing me..

664
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,750
for entertaining the idea that I might..

665
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,150
... hand her over.

666
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,300
I am at war with myself Mr Russell.

667
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,140
The script is ghastly,

668
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:54,102
empty pack, exactly as I expected--

669
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,925
Yes, a few more days and then I'll decide--

670
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:31,453
Serves me right. Money, money, money.

671
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:34,067
Bit me on the bot.

672
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,819
<i>All around the cathedral</i>

673
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,980
<i>the saints and apostles</i>

674
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,764
<i>look down as she sells her wares.</i>

675
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,510
<i>Although you can't see it </i>

676
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,469
<i>you know they are smiling </i>

677
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:51,454
<i>Each time someone shows that he cares--</i>

678
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,510
<i>Though her words are simple</i>

679
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,080
<i> and few listen,</i>

680
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,100
<i> listen, she's calling to you--</i>

681
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:14,160
<i>Feed the birds, tuppence a bag</i>

682
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,190
<i> tuppence,</i>

683
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,840
<i> tuppence,</i>

684
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,050
<i> tuppence a....</i>

685
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,274
<i> ...bag.?/i>

686
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,710
That'll work.

687
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,752
She's going to say no isn't she?

688
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,431
The woman is a conundrum.

689
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,760
<i>My world was calm,</i>

690
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,920
<i>well ordered,</i>

691
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,910
<i> exemplary</i>

692
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,050
<i>Then came this person,</i>

693
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,520
<i>with chaos in her wake. </i>

694
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,920
<i>And, now my life's ambitions go</i>

695
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,890
<i> with one</i>

696
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,030
<i> fell blow</i>

697
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:29,540
<i>It's quite a bitter pill to</i>

698
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,770
<i> take.</i>

699
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,930
Inspired by someone we know?

700
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,550
You'll have to ask Bob.

701
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,420
She might surprise us all.

702
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,080
No! No..she won't.

703
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,230
You don't know that.
- No, I do. I do know it,

704
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,240
I know it only too well.

705
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,200
I've fought this battle from her side.

706
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,380
Pat Powers,

707
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,020
he wanted the mouse

708
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,534
and I didn't have a bean in my pocker, back then.
He was this big, terrifying...

709
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:05,727
New York producer and I was just a kid
from Missouri, with a sketch of Mickey.

710
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,749
It woulda?killed me, to give him up.

711
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,500
Honest to god, that would've killed me.

712
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:17,094
That mouse, he is family.

713
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,680
Go home.

714
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,754
<i>The world..</i>

715
00:56:45,954 --> 00:56:49,190
<i> is an illusion Ginty, old gal.</i>

716
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,597
Ahh, the Countess- Mary Sparklestick!

717
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,055
Pray tell me,
what are you concentrating so hard on?

718
00:57:09,255 --> 00:57:10,255
I am laying eggs!

719
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:13,401
Really!? Fabulous!

720
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,640
Today, I am a hen.

721
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,997
Indeed! I can see the feathers
sprouting as we speak!

722
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,920
Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please?
- I'm not Helen!

723
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,191
She can't possibly lay a table;
she's busy laying eggs!

724
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,864
Helen, would you lay the table for supper please?
- She's laying!

725
00:57:37,983 --> 00:57:39,871
I'm sorry!

726
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:43,654
I should--
- Ginty?

727
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:48,861
Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love.

728
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,293
You can be anyone you want to be.

729
00:57:52,493 --> 00:57:55,939
Anyone.
- I want to be just like you.

730
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:01,266
Don't.

731
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:02,466
Don't.

732
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,430
Ya alright Mrs?

733
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,893
<font color=#50BEFA>DON:</font>Mrs Travers?

734
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,120
Mrs Travers?

735
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,890
We were just saying that we'll like to play you
the song in the bank.

736
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,724
Would that be good?

737
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,980
Fidelity Feduciary Bank.

738
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,014
So you have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?

739
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,650
<i>No, I want it to feed the birds! </i>
Michael says,

740
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,230
Fiddlesticks boy!
Feed the birds and what've you got?

741
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,800
Fat birds!

742
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,920
<i>But! If you invest your tuppence</i>

743
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,970
<i> wisely in the bank</i>

744
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,167
<i>Safe and sound--</i>

745
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:53,165
<i>Soon, that tuppence safely invested in the bank--</i>

746
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,698
Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals.

747
01:00:13,898 --> 01:00:17,001
He is indeed!
On behalf of the bank.

748
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,600
Maybe, he will pin one on me,
for the maple.

749
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,810
He might.
- Where is Father?

750
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,050
I think, he is practising his speech somewhere.

751
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:46,760
<i>In the hands of the directors</i>

752
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:51,178
<i> who invest as propriety demands.</i>

753
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,435
Father--

754
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,490
Why is he speaking for the bank?

755
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,320
He's the manager..Sir.

756
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,471
He looks terrible.

757
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:19,415
Good afternoon, distinguished guests,

758
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,227
our biggest supporter, Mr Randolph Belhatchett

759
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,510
and his lovely wife,

760
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,220
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!

761
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,490
I'm honoured to be here on behalf of

762
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,863
the Belhatchett Bank of
Australia.

763
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,000
Shortly, it will uh..

764
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,320
It'll be my very pleasant duty to present the awards
to our uhhm..

765
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:42,270
our young performers.

766
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,510
But before,

767
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,120
I begin,

768
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,130
I'll like to say a very few words

769
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,630
to our very youngest citizens about the er,
about the.. er

770
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,310
the role...

771
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,900
of the Bank in our community.

772
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,780
<i>When you deposit tuppence</i>

773
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,420
<i> in a bank account,</i>

774
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,720
<i>Soon..</i>
- Soon you'll see,

775
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,179
<i> that it blooms into credit of..</i>

776
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,679
a generous amount

777
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,288
<i> Semi-annually!</i>

778
01:03:14,488 --> 01:03:18,635
<i>And you'll achieve that sense of stature</i>

779
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,989
<i>As your influence expands.
To the high</i>

780
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:27,535
financial strata

781
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,404
<i> That established credit now commands--</i>

782
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:35,640
You can purchase, first and second trust deeds

783
01:03:35,865 --> 01:03:39,840
Think of the foreclosures!
Bonds! Chattels! Dividends!

784
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,009
Shares!
- Bankruptcies!  - Debtor sales!

785
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,620
Opportunities!
All manner of private enterprise!

786
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:49,534
Shipyards! The Mercantile!
Collieries!

787
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:54,697
Tanneries!
Incorporations! Amalgamations!  Banks!

788
01:03:58,144 --> 01:04:00,504
Uhmm. Thank you kindly.
Thank you.

789
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:16,900
It's a marvellous thing..

790
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,890
to encourage children to open accounts.

791
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,290
marvellous!

792
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,450
My daughter, the Princess Ginty--

793
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,799
she's-- uh.

794
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,661
How old are you?

795
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,440
Come up here.

796
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,130
Come here, Ginty.

797
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,317
Ginty has an account--

798
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,790
and that's good.

799
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,370
Give her a drink!

800
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,130
I mean.. give her a hand.

801
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,420
I shall return in just a few moments,
to present the awards.

802
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,360
But right now,

803
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,938
I need to relieve myself.

804
01:05:24,138 --> 01:05:25,138
Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you?

805
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,897
I'm busting.
There's a good girl.

806
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,720
It works.
- It's getting great.

807
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,926
Why did you have to make him so cruel?
He was not a monster!

808
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,860
Who are we talking about? I'm confused.

809
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,307
You all have children, yes?
- Yes.

810
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:12,550
And do those children make letters for you,
do they write letters, make drawings...

811
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,630
And would you tear up those gifts?

812
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,120
In front of them?!

813
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:21,712
It's a dreadful thing to do! I don't understand!
Why must father, tear up

814
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:24,036
the advertisement, his children have made;

815
01:06:24,236 --> 01:06:27,504
and throw it in the fireplace!?
Why won't he mend their kite?

816
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:30,605
Why have you made him so unspeakably, awful?

817
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,550
In glorious technicolor?

818
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,090
For all the world to see.

819
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,350
You claim to make them live--
why can't he?

820
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,210
They.. live well?

821
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,650
I can't bear it.
Please don't--

822
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,370
Please don't.

823
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,280
I'll feel like I let him down again.

824
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,350
Mrs Travers?

825
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,360
I don't suppose,
you can give me any more

826
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:03,502
for the pain?

827
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,040
When will enough be enough, Travers?

828
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:22,622
I've brought you something father.

829
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:27,467
Be a darling Ginty, my old pal!

830
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:28,667
Come here.

831
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,059
I'm sick.

832
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:38,890
Help father out won't you?

833
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,749
You know, In my washroom--

834
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:47,542
there's a bottle of medicine
that father needs.

835
01:07:47,742 --> 01:07:50,710
- Mother took it away.
- Godammit!

836
01:07:53,898 --> 01:07:56,561
I wrote a poem father.

837
01:07:59,298 --> 01:08:02,218
It - it won first prize, at school.

838
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,013
Shall i read it to you, father?

839
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,216
Mrs?

840
01:09:56,330 --> 01:10:01,366
I, uh, brought you a tea.
- It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup.

841
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:09,720
Everything okay, mrs?

842
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,350
Would you like me to drive you home?

843
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:15,880
All the way to England?
Yes, please.

844
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:23,824
You got family, back there Mrs?
- You're an impertinent man, you know?

845
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:25,024
You ask an awful lot of questions that have

846
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:28,930
absolutely, no relevance to you
being able to carry out your duties.

847
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:35,192
I know! I do, do that. Yes!
- And you have no barometer.

848
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,220
Let us say, that I haven't

849
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:46,244
family who'll notice, whether I was halfway
across the world or sitting, in my living room.

850
01:10:48,756 --> 01:10:50,963
Make a little furrow, there.

851
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,420
I gotta kid.

852
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,620
Well, most people do.

853
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,710
Jane--

854
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,540
What a terrific kid.

855
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:17,849
Beautiful, little girl.

856
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,420
She's got a of problems though.

857
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:24,146
She's Handicapped, you know?

858
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,506
She's in a wheelchair.

859
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,137
See? That's why I concern myself
with the weather so much.

860
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,730
Sunny day, she can sit out in the garden.

861
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,914
Rainy day, I have to leave her cooped up inside.

862
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:47,140
Worry about the future,

863
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,450
but, you can't do that.

864
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,530
Only today.

865
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:55,990
Hmmm.
- Yeah.

866
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,340
Now look.

867
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:04,040
It's a band stand.
- Ahh!

868
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,100
A river!
- Lake.

869
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,150
Hey, Hey..Hey!
I sure would like to take her there!

870
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,272
Wouldn't that be nice?

871
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:38,999
I know you gave it to him.

872
01:12:43,806 --> 01:12:45,663
Take care of your sisters.

873
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,880
I know you love your father more.

874
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,440
But, one day..

875
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,110
you will understand.

876
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,560
Mother!

877
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,400
Mother?

878
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,880
Mother!

879
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:33,101
Mother!

880
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,090
Mother!

881
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,240
Mother?

882
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,170
It's time to go home.

883
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,580
I'm sorry.

884
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:07,650
Oh, my God!

885
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,700
I'm sorry.

886
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,490
Mrs Travers! Yes?

887
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,220
Pam! Walt.

888
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:39,490
Mr Disney.

889
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,990
I'm Callin?to..uh check up on you.

890
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:46,138
I understand, things didn't go so well today.

891
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:47,700
Something about Mr. Banks?

892
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,720
They went as well as
they've gone every other day;

893
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,046
that I've been here. I don't recall special 
phone calls from you on any of those other evenings.

894
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,110
Pam, What's this all about?

895
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,010
Really?

896
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,470
I'm wondering what I have to do
to make you happy.

897
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:07,327
- Ha!
- And, you've been wondering that too, Aren't you?

898
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,900
You know,

899
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,820
you've never been to Disneyland!

900
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,700
That's the happiest place on Earth!

901
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,020
Tommie!

902
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,860
Cancel my morning tomorrow.
I'm taking a ride with my favorite author!

903
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,398
No, no no, please, Mr. Disney.

904
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,020
I cannot tell you how uninterested,

905
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,961
no, positively sickened, I am..
at the thought of visiting your...

906
01:16:26,161 --> 01:16:28,057
your dollar printing machine!

907
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,160
For crying out loud. When does anybody
get to go to Disneyland, with Walt Disney himself?!

908
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:38,113
Disappointments are to the soul,
what the thunderstorm is to the air.

909
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:39,313
Hello?

910
01:16:45,652 --> 01:16:48,090
He hung up!

911
01:16:58,203 --> 01:16:58,950
Gangs, We gotta fix this.

912
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,000
Father, winds from the east.

913
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,591
The Aunt.

914
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,230
Now,

915
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:58,081
I've brought every new fangled treatment
available in Sydney.

916
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,330
Close your mouth please Biddy,
we are not a codfish.

917
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,880
Now, I see a multitude of jobs
that need to be done!

918
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,810
They've been so worried-- I've--
- Do stop babbling nonsense!

919
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,000
I'm here now
and I shall fix everything.

920
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,982
I thought I had made it quite clear,
that you two were to begin helping.

921
01:18:34,182 --> 01:18:35,182
Hmm?

922
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,798
Spit spot!

923
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,100
Where are we--? This isn't the way.

924
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,230
Change of venue this morning, apparently.

925
01:18:46,045 --> 01:18:48,150
Ugh.

926
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:07,404
Wow!

927
01:19:07,405 --> 01:19:11,276
There he is!
Living, breathing.

928
01:19:12,405 --> 01:19:15,030
Oh boy!

929
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,265
Oh, I can get that.

930
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:33,330
Mrs.Travers, Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!

931
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,670
Is it all like this?

932
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,973
Yup! Isn't it wonderful?

933
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,738
Do you always get everything you want, Walter?

934
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:47,940
Pretty much!

935
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,370
With the exception of the rights
to my books of course!

936
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,450
Well, War ain't over yet Pam!

937
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,460
War ain't over yet.

938
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,320
I love you so much! Can I--?

939
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,690
Sure, sure..there you go.

940
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,590
Pre-signed?

941
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,310
Hey, You should get hers too.
This woman's a bona fide genius!

942
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,040
Tour starts this way, Pam!

943
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,980
Hot dog!

944
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:20,680
Whoa, move along,
move along.

945
01:20:24,801 --> 01:20:27,540
Each section of the park, has a high point.
So, you can get your benefits.

946
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:31,940
In Adventureland there is a tree--

947
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,190
This is a fun fact. A titbit.

948
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,880
- Tidbit.

949
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,430
It got three million leaves,

950
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,450
four million flowers.

951
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,927
Gosh.
- And they said only God could make a tree!

952
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,850
Where did she come from?

953
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,180
- Who?

954
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,670
Oh, I think you know who.

955
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,340
She flew in through the window, one day.

956
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,370
Through the window huh?

957
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:17,100
It's just that easy, isn't it Mrs Travers?

958
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,900
You see those spirals?

959
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,120
Plated with 24 carat gold.

960
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,930
Now, I know you don't wanna be here
so I'm gonna take you to one ride--

961
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:36,098
My favourite amusement,
and then.. I'll set you free.

962
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:52,097
Mrs Travers, I would be honoured
if you would take a ride on Jingles, here.

963
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:53,297
She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse.

964
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,260
No, thank you. I'm happy to watch.

965
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:01,437
Now, there's no greater joy,
than that seen through the eyes of a child.

966
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:04,913
There's a child in us all.
- Maybe in you Mister Disney,

967
01:22:05,113 --> 01:22:06,113
but certainly not in me.

968
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:07,700
Get on the horse Pamela!

969
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,550
Now, When we first met,
you said to me they're family.?

970
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,715
I said what?

971
01:22:21,915 --> 01:22:24,778
Mary Poppins,
the Banks's, they're family.

972
01:22:24,978 --> 01:22:27,109
The boys have had an idea
for your Mister Banks.

973
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:31,250
I think it'll make you happy.
- You brought me all the way out here, to tell me that?

974
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:35,270
Oh, no..No. I brought you all the way out here
for monetary gain.

975
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,980
Had a wager with the boys,

976
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,610
that I couldn't get you on a ride.
I just won 20 bucks.

977
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:41,810
Yah!

978
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:39,540
All the garments are half done.

979
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,280
Good morning, Mrs Travers!

980
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:26,100
What horrors have you in store for
my beautiful characters today?

981
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:27,890
You, sit here.

982
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,340
What're you upto?

983
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,380
We were thinking about..

984
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,610
what you said,

985
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,450
and..you are right.

986
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,960
Mr Banks isn't cruel. He isn't.

987
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,777
So, we've got a new ending for the film.

988
01:24:52,977 --> 01:24:55,805
Oh god, I hope you like it.

989
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:15,316
Michael says, he mended it! It's wonderful!?

990
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:17,260
However did you manage it?

991
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:22,700
He mended the kite?

992
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,840
<i>With...</i>

993
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:27,924
<i> tuppence for paper and strings</i>

994
01:25:27,925 --> 01:25:31,824
<i> You can have your own set of wings.</i>

995
01:25:32,775 --> 01:25:35,274
<i> With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight!</i>

996
01:25:35,275 --> 01:25:40,705
<i>with your fist holding tight,
To the string of your kite .</i>

997
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:45,920
<i>Oh oh oh oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

998
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:53,757
<i>Up to the highest height,
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

999
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,768
<i> and send it, soaring </i>

1000
01:25:58,105 --> 01:26:00,865
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1001
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,739
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1002
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:10,105
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite.</i>

1003
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:13,767
And then, Mrs Banks runs to her house.

1004
01:26:14,225 --> 01:26:16,724
She gets the suffragettes ribbon.

1005
01:26:16,725 --> 01:26:20,515
And says,
<i>“A proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think?!?/i>

1006
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:25,935
<i>Oh, oh oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1007
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,119
<i>Up to the highest height,</i>

1008
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,990
<i>Let's go fly a kite...</i>

1009
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:37,265
<i> and send it soaring,</i>

1010
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,459
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1011
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:44,010
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1012
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:50,684
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite!</i>

1013
01:26:51,965 --> 01:26:58,485
<i>When you send it flying up there;
All at once you're lighter than air</i>

1014
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:03,885
<i>You can dance on the breeze over
houses and trees with your fist holding tight,--</i>

1015
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:08,394
<i>To the string of your kite.</i>

1016
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:12,250
Mr Disney! Walt!

1017
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,550
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's just she's--

1018
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,190
She's dancing!

1019
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,814
Mrs Travers. She's dancing with Don!

1020
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:26,880
<i>Oh, Oh Oh Oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1021
01:27:27,395 --> 01:27:29,320
<i>Up to the highest height.</i>

1022
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:37,541
<i>Let's go fly a kite
and send it soaring..</i>

1023
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:40,514
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1024
01:27:40,515 --> 01:27:44,647
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1025
01:27:44,847 --> 01:27:51,086
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite!</i>

1026
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,750
Oh! He fixes the kite!
Oh, I love it!

1027
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:03,354
Though proper English would be
-let us go and fly a kite.?

1028
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,820
<i>Let us go..and fly a..</i>

1029
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,260
But, I might be willing to overlook that.

1030
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,370
Alright!

1031
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,409
Very good!

1032
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:03,840
Father?

1033
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:27,050
You're quite right? You know,
It is beautiful. Exquisite.

1034
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,020
It's always new.

1035
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,760
So, Jolly Holiday's in?
- By all means.

1036
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,600
Wonderful!
- I do have a question about it actually.

1037
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:50,643
How in the world does Mister Disney
propose to train penguins to dance?

1038
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:53,112
I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees.

1039
01:29:53,312 --> 01:29:57,675
So, I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling
scheme but it does seem rather far fetched.

1040
01:29:57,875 --> 01:30:01,514
Can you train a
penguin to dance?

1041
01:30:01,714 --> 01:30:03,020
No.

1042
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,231
I don't think you can train--
- They're animated.

1043
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,890
They are what?
- Cartoons.

1044
01:30:18,918 --> 01:30:20,133
What?

1045
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,650
Are we getting real penguins?

1046
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,240
Good afternoon Mrs Travers!

1047
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:35,230
I'm here to see Mister Disney.

1048
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:42,380
Mrs Travers!

1049
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,310
I'm terribly, sorry..Walt.

1050
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,100
It's Alright Tommie, just close the door.

1051
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,440
Never let anybody see me smoking.
I'll hate to encourage bad habits.

1052
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,330
Please, sit down.
- I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!

1053
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,080
Pamela--
- MRS TRAVERS. PLEASE!

1054
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:03,600
Mrs Travers, what hasyou so upset now?

1055
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,440
Penguins!

1056
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,540
Penguins have very much upset me,
Mister Disney!

1057
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,201
Animated, dancing penguins!

1058
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:16,822
Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney,
yes you have. Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head;

1059
01:31:17,022 --> 01:31:21,167
but I shall not be moved
on the matter of cartoons, Sir.

1060
01:31:21,367 --> 01:31:22,720
Not.. one inch!

1061
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:24,970
It's a sequence--

1062
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:29,660
You promised me. You promised me
that this film would not be an animation!

1063
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,450
And it isn't!

1064
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,640
So, they're real penguins?

1065
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:38,180
No, they're animated.

1066
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,410
But, the actors you see...

1067
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:43,115
the actor is very very much real.

1068
01:31:43,315 --> 01:31:44,315
You foolish old woman.

1069
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,910
Pamela! Pam!

1070
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:06,220
Dolly, would you be so kind
to ring my driver, he can come collect me?

1071
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,330
Yes, Ma'm.
-Thank you.

1072
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,960
Here we are, Mrs.
- Thank you.

1073
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,340
It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs.

1074
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,670
No one likes a fibber.
- NO..no. No.

1075
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,540
I really have enjoyed it.

1076
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,583
Didn't know who you were at first
and then guess what?

1077
01:32:53,783 --> 01:32:57,590
You found out?
- I was telling my daughter all about my day..

1078
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,650
and how I was driving this nice writer lady,
Mrs Travers for Mr Disney.

1079
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,380
and uh--

1080
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,310
And--

1081
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,020
And--

1082
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:15,763
And, she made me go to her bedroom
and  bring her this!

1083
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,180
Can't stop reading it. You know..

1084
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:22,480
I'm very slow mind you.

1085
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:25,110
Would you like me to sign it?

1086
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:28,100
Would you?!

1087
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,340
I'll be honoured.

1088
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,270
To..

1089
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:42,410
Jane.

1090
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:46,712
and her dearest father--

1091
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,540
I've just this instant realized
I don't know your name.

1092
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:52,740
Ralph.

1093
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:54,900
Pamela.

1094
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,809
You're the only American
I have ever liked, Ralph.

1095
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:06,470
May I ask why?

1096
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:07,670
No. Now,

1097
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,310
take this--

1098
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,460
Albert Einstein,

1099
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,150
Van Gogh,
Roosevelt,

1100
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:17,950
Frida Kehlo..
- Kahlo.

1101
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,860
What is this?
- They all had difficulties.

1102
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,373
Jane, can do anything,
that anyone else can do.

1103
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:27,980
Do you understand?

1104
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:33,900
Oh.

1105
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,020
I almost forgot,
turn it aroud.

1106
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,380
Walt Disney!

1107
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:45,632
Hyperactive behavior and deficiencies in concentration.
It explains everything!

1108
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,150
Thank you, Mrs.

1109
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,530
She has come and gone, huh?

1110
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,880
- Yeah, Flight left 10 minutes ago.

1111
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:07,180
Beverly Hotel, front lemousine..

1112
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,110
First class plane ticket back to England,

1113
01:35:11,608 --> 01:35:16,216
Wait, Goff? Who's Helen Goff?

1114
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:18,448
That's her. That's her real name.

1115
01:35:18,648 --> 01:35:19,648
She acts so, hoity toity British
and she's really an Aussie.

1116
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:25,111
Then, who's Travers?

1117
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,390
I've been talking to the wrong person.

1118
01:35:51,289 --> 01:35:53,001
He is gone.

1119
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,780
No, no..no you mustn't.

1120
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:03,275
Let her go, Margaret.

1121
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:42,486
I dropped the pears.

1122
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:46,429
I'm sorry, daddy.

1123
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,700
Helen, dear girl...

1124
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:56,660
You promised, you would fix everything.

1125
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,513
Hello, house.

1126
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,220
Oh, dear god!

1127
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,340
It was one heck of a job getting a seat..

1128
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:18,935
on the very next flight, let me tell you.

1129
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,350
Mrs.Travers..

1130
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:27,763
I could sure use, a nice pot
of English tea, about now.

1131
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:36,655
Here we are.

1132
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:38,990
Allow me.

1133
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:42,905
The milk goes in first. Milk.

1134
01:38:43,105 --> 01:38:44,105
I remember.

1135
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:48,500
And, a spoonful of sugar?

1136
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:51,448
I think, I'll have whiskey.

1137
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,560
Oh well, when in Rome!

1138
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:12,902
You've come to change my mind. Haven't you?

1139
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,720
To beat me into submission.

1140
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:21,693
No, no. I've come because, you misjudge me.

1141
01:39:21,893 --> 01:39:22,893
Yeah.

1142
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,750
How do I misjudge you?

1143
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,700
You look at me and you see
some kind of Hollywood King Midas.

1144
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:37,298
You think, I've built an empire and that I want to use your
Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom.

1145
01:39:37,498 --> 01:39:39,666
- And don't you?

1146
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,640
If that was all it was,

1147
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:46,050
would I have pursued an cranky,
stubborn dame like you for twenty years?

1148
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,663
I would have saved myself an ulcer!

1149
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:55,990
No, you expected me to disappoint you
and so, you made sure I did.

1150
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,740
Well, I think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers.

1151
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:06,768
I think it's done that a lot. And i think,
Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't.

1152
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:11,639
- Mary Poppins, isn't real.
- That's not true.

1153
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:15,549
Oh, no. She's real as can be to my daughter's

1154
01:40:15,749 --> 01:40:17,980
and to thousands of other children--
adults too.

1155
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,843
Been there as a nighttime comfort
to a heck of a lot of people.

1156
01:40:23,043 --> 01:40:24,690
Well, Where is she when I need her?

1157
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:28,960
Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins
and who should be standing there..

1158
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,240
...but Walt Disney!

1159
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:35,490
Mrs Travers, I am so sorry.

1160
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,610
I hoped--

1161
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:43,883
this would be a magical experience for you,
for all of us.  But I let you down--

1162
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:47,540
and in doing so, I've broken
a twenty year old promise I made to my daughters.

1163
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:56,332
I've been wracking my brains,
trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and I--

1164
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,290
Well...

1165
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:05,960
You see, I have my own Mr Banks.

1166
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:09,950
Mine had a moustache.

1167
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:15,870
So, not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

1168
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:20,250
But it is true that you created yourself
in someone else's, yes?

1169
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:27,829
Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers?
Do you know Missouri at all?

1170
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:33,160
I can't say I do.
- Well, It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter cold.

1171
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:40,010
My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there.
Thousand papers. Twice daily.

1172
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,660
The morning and an evening edition.

1173
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:46,270
Dad, he was a tough businessman.
He was a...

1174
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,473
..save-a-penny anywhere you can type of fella;

1175
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,820
So, he wouldn't employ any delivery boys,
no, no..no. he just used me and

1176
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,090
my big brother Roy.

1177
01:41:57,090 --> 01:42:02,081
I was uh, I was eight back then.
Just eight years old.

1178
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:05,630
Like I said, those winters were harsh..

1179
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,830
and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until,
the old ones were worn right through.

1180
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:15,100
Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow drift
sometimes they were up over my head!

1181
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:18,440
We'd push through it like wading through molasses.

1182
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,170
And the cold and the wet would be
seeping through the shoes.

1183
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,220
Skin peeling from our faces.

1184
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,130
sometimes, I'll find myself sunk down in the snow,

1185
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,157
Just waking up, cuz I must've passed out
or something, I dunno.

1186
01:42:36,357 --> 01:42:38,760
Then, it's time for school, i was too cold
too wet,

1187
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,440
to figure out an equations and things.

1188
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:45,580
Then, it was right back out into the snow
again to get home just before dark.

1189
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,850
My mother would feed us dinner..

1190
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:53,590
..and then, it was time to go right back out again,
for the evening edition.

1191
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,500
You best be quick there Walt,

1192
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:03,820
get those newspapers up on that porch,
and under that store and doors..

1193
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,020
or poppa's gonna loose his temper again
and show you the buckle under his belt.

1194
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:17,525
Now, I don't tell you,
all this to make you sad Mrs Travers,

1195
01:43:17,725 --> 01:43:19,612
I don't. I love my life.

1196
01:43:19,812 --> 01:43:21,847
I think it's a miracle. And I loved my dad.

1197
01:43:22,047 --> 01:43:23,047
He was a wonderful man.

1198
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,310
But, rare is the day..

1199
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:33,805
where I don't think of that little boy
delivering newspapers in the snow.

1200
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:41,213
And old Elias Disney with his strap and fist..
and I'm just so tired--

1201
01:43:41,413 --> 01:43:42,413
Mrs. Travers.

1202
01:43:42,613 --> 01:43:47,630
I'm tired of remembering it, that way.

1203
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,470
Aren't you tired too, Mrs Travers?

1204
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:57,812
We all have our tales but
don't you want to finish the story?

1205
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:02,502
Let it all go and have a life
that isn't dictated by a past?

1206
01:44:06,765 --> 01:44:09,062
It's not the children she comes to save.

1207
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:12,512
It's their father.

1208
01:44:15,801 --> 01:44:17,665
It's your father--

1209
01:44:17,865 --> 01:44:21,209
Travers Goff.

1210
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:29,465
- I don't know what you think you know
about me, Walter.

1211
01:44:29,665 --> 01:44:33,651
You must've loved and admired him
a lot to take his name.

1212
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,540
It's all about him, isn't it?

1213
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:38,612
All of it. Everything.

1214
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:47,396
Forgiveness, Mrs.Travers.
It's what I learned from your books.

1215
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,150
- I don't need to forgive my father.
He was a wonderful man.

1216
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,460
No,

1217
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:55,841
you need to forgive Helen Goff.

1218
01:44:57,525 --> 01:45:01,180
Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself.

1219
01:45:05,124 --> 01:45:08,165
Give her to me, Mrs Travers.

1220
01:45:08,365 --> 01:45:11,790
Trust me, with your precious Mary Poppins.

1221
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,340
I won't disappoint you.

1222
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:18,030
I swear, that every time a person
walks into a movie house.

1223
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,540
- from Leicester to Kansas City..

1224
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,790
they will see, George Banks being saved.

1225
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:26,550
They will love him and his kids,

1226
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:29,984
they will weep for his cares,

1227
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:34,134
They will wring their hands,
when he loses his job.

1228
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:38,421
And when he flies that kite,

1229
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,380
oh Mrs Travers! They will rejoice,

1230
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,200
they will sing.

1231
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,280
In movie houses all over the world,

1232
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:53,219
in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and
their mothers and fathers  for generations to come,

1233
01:45:53,419 --> 01:45:56,722
George Banks, will be honoured.

1234
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,210
George Banks will be redeemed.

1235
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:04,060
George Banks and all he stands for will be saved.

1236
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,709
Maybe, not in life, but in imagination.

1237
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:11,150
Because, that's what we storytellers do.

1238
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,840
We restore order with imagination.

1239
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:19,032
We instill hope, again and again and again.

1240
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:25,810
Trust me, Mrs Travers.
Let me prove it to you.

1241
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:30,337
I give you my word.

1242
01:46:47,357 --> 01:46:50,172
Enough.

1243
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,810
Make those two changes,
I'm sure everything will be just fine.

1244
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:17,407
Walt, could i get your approval on that please.

1245
01:47:17,607 --> 01:47:20,610
What is it?
- Invitation list for the premiere.

1246
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,810
Is this everyone?

1247
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:23,010
It's not everyone.

1248
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:30,860
There'll be a premiere in London,
that'll be more convenient for her.

1249
01:47:32,951 --> 01:47:36,845
Tommie, this wasn't an easy decision for me.
But, you know what she is like.

1250
01:47:37,045 --> 01:47:41,800
We got press interviews, cameras--
I need to protect the picture.

1251
01:47:43,838 --> 01:47:45,551
- Okay.

1252
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,294
Just answer the door!

1253
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:13,330
I am very pleased to hear that Pamela.

1254
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,530
I should think, you'll have a draft very soon.

1255
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,860
Polly! Where's that tea?
It's coming along marvelously!

1256
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:24,650
Aren't you going to pour it, for us?

1257
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,660
You're perfectly capable 
of pouring it yourself.

1258
01:48:30,726 --> 01:48:32,758
She's quite the worst maid I've ever had!

1259
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:35,881
So, why do you keep her?
- I don't know, she reminds me of me.

1260
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:40,530
Do you have a title?
- Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.

1261
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,730
Wonderful.

1262
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,250
Should we start talking about, the film rights?

1263
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,562
NEVER again.
- Okay.

1264
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,153
Now, tell me, Have you got your tiara
 for the premiere?

1265
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:55,353
Oh, I'm not going to that.

1266
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:56,580
Why not?

1267
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:59,740
Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me.

1268
01:49:00,926 --> 01:49:02,830
 Anyway, it's not convenient.

1269
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,040
He hasn't invited you, has he?

1270
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,310
Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for that!

1271
01:49:19,452 --> 01:49:22,084
Can I help you?
- I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

1272
01:49:22,284 --> 01:49:23,234
As i recall.

1273
01:49:25,735 --> 01:49:28,455
Sweet of you.

1274
01:49:31,425 --> 01:49:33,924
Walt?
- Hello Dolly!

1275
01:49:33,925 --> 01:49:36,040
Walt?
- Tommie,

1276
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:39,029
 you're gonna have to move that meeting with G.E.

1277
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,315
What?

1278
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:51,850
Mrs. Travers!
- Me again!

1279
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:53,740
How wonderful to see you.

1280
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:56,030
I'm here for my premiere.

1281
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,390
Great!

1282
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,345
I didn't receive my invitation,
but I just assumed

1283
01:50:02,545 --> 01:50:05,965
 the American postal service had
fallen down on the job, as per usual.

1284
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:09,790
I'll have a replacement, 
sent to your hotel right away.

1285
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:14,349
You are very kind, Mr Disney.
I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me.

1286
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:20,733
Pam, how could I forget you?

1287
01:50:20,933 --> 01:50:27,090
Good evening.

1288
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,270
Hello, could you please order me a cab?

1289
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:31,479
Absolutely.

1290
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:50,519
Ralph!

1291
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,763
I had a feeling, a certain friend of mine
might be needing me tonight.

1292
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,550
Wow!

1293
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,040
You look like a million bucks!

1294
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,020
Thank you.

1295
01:51:08,945 --> 01:51:11,906
Let's get you to that ball, huh?
- Thank you, Ralph, thank you.

1296
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:01,325
This is your night.

1297
01:52:01,525 --> 01:52:05,647
None of this would be possible
without you.

1298
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:33,570
Sometimes, the person we love.
Through no fault of his own,

1299
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:35,930
can't see past the end of his nose.

1300
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:40,780
What's the end of his nose.

1301
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:44,273
Now, your dad is a fine gentleman.
And he loves you.

1302
01:54:44,473 --> 01:54:48,134
I don't think so.
You should've seen the look on his face.

1303
01:54:48,334 --> 01:54:49,740
It doesn't look like his own.

1304
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:54,110
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1305
01:54:55,070 --> 01:54:58,715
You know, i met your father..

1306
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:05,050
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank day after day,

1307
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:08,790
 hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1308
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,250
I don't want to see any living thing caged up.

1309
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,500
Father in a cage?

1310
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:16,440
They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1311
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:19,170
Bank-shaped some of 'em,
carpets and all.

1312
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,810
Mary Poppins, You won't ever leave us will you?

1313
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,460
Whatever would we do without you?

1314
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:27,090
<i>- I shall stay until, the wind changes.</i>

1315
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:04,190
It's all right.

1316
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:10,326
It's all right, Mrs Travers.
Mr Banks is going to be all right. I promise.

1317
01:56:10,526 --> 01:56:11,526
No, no. It's just that-- 

1318
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,707
I can't, I can't abide cartoons!

1319
01:56:22,030 --> 01:56:27,600
<i>Ohhh! Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1320
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:31,452
<i>Up to the highest height.</i>

1321
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:38,142
<i>Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring,</i>

1322
01:56:38,342 --> 01:56:41,541
<i>Up through the atmosphere..</i>

1323
01:56:41,741 --> 01:56:45,009
<i>Up where the air is clear...</i>

1324
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:14,211
Don't leave me.

1325
01:57:16,593 --> 01:57:18,361
Never.

1326
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:22,969
 I promise.
I will never lose you.

1327
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:39,021
<i>Winds in the East 
Mist coming in--</i>

1328
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:40,880
<i>--Like something is brewing,</i>

1329
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:43,600
<i> about to begin--</i>

1330
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:50,265
<i>Can't put me finger, on what lies in store--</i>

1331
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,550
<i>But I feel what's to happen,</i>

1332
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:58,528
<i>all happened before--</i>
