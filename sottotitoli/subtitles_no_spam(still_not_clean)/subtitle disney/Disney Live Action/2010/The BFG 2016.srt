1
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,328
<i>It was the Witching hour,</i>

2
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,608
<i>when the bogeyman comes out.</i>

3
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,647
<i>When people go missing.</i>

4
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,686
<i>Matron thinks the Witching hour arrives at midnight.</i>

5
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,043
<i>The girls say 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock in the morning.</i>

6
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,641
<i>I think it comes at 3:00 in the morning,</i>

7
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,201
<i>when I'm the only one left awake.</i>

8
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,529
<i>Like always.</i>

9
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,810
<i>Like now.</i>

10
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,961
Hat's in your eyes, mate.

11
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,485
Quiet. Quiet.

12
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,562
- It's that way!
- Shh!

13
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,210
Quiet.

14
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,248
Come on.

15
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,761
- Shh.
- Quiet.

16
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,128
Get outta the water, mate.

17
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,964
It's unclean.

18
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,087
That stuff will kill you.

19
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,887
Oi!

20
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,569
You're bladdered, the lot of you.

21
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,601
Would you clear off?

22
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,604
There are children trying to sleep.

23
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,366
Hello, little missy!

24
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,171
Don't little missy me!

25
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,245
I'll call the coppers. I will do it.

26
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,087
Watch the water! Come on!

27
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,331
Never get out of bed.

28
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Never go to the window

29
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,569
and never look behind

30
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,726
the curtain.

31
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,121
Never get out of bed! Never go to the window!

32
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,964
And never look behind the curtain.

33
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,484
There ain't no place to go

34
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,251
unless you has wings.

35
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,971
I is hungry. It's time for eats.

36
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,129
Whoa! Whoa!

37
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,764
Where am I?

38
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,205
Giant Country.

39
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,921
No such place.

40
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,930
We travelled a long, long way.

41
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,044
Yeah, it be a distance.

42
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,563
What's that? What's that?

43
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,085
Giants.

44
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,207
There are more of you?

45
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,210
Yeah, well...

46
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,803
Fleshlumpeater, Bonecruncher, Manhugger...

47
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,649
Childchewer, Meatdripper, Gizzardgulper, Maidmasher...

48
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,205
Blood bottler.

49
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,441
Blood bottler?

50
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,966
Yeah! And the Butcher Boy.

51
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,890
Butcher Boy?

52
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,765
Please don't eat me.

53
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,131
Me?

54
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,161
You think because I'm a giant, that I'm a man-gobbling cannybull?

55
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,761
Me? Gobbling up human beans?

56
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,207
Do you mind? This I never...

57
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,886
Then who are you?

58
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,803
What kind of a monster are you?

59
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,166
You has me wrong.

60
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,408
You snatched me.

61
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,962
Yeah, well, there you has me right.

62
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,685
Anyway, I didn't steal you very much.

63
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,842
After all, you's only a little thing.

64
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,090
Still, but I can't help thinking about

65
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,685
your poor mother and father.

66
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,966
They must be skump...

67
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,327
I don't have a mother or father.

68
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,686
You don't?

69
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,601
They... They both died when I was a baby.

70
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,410
So, you is a norphan?

71
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,126
Yes. You took me from an orphanage.

72
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,281
You didn't know?

73
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,281
I didn't know that.

74
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,965
Were you happy there?

75
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,725
No, I hate it.

76
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,725
The matron who runs it is incompetent, and she has crazy rules

77
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,007
and you get punished a lot!

78
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,370
How is you punished?

79
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,764
She locks you in a dark cellar.

80
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,330
There are rats down there.

81
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,801
The filthy old fizzwiggler.

82
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,000
The other giants, are they nice like you're nice?

83
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,841
No, I's sorry to say, the boys would eat you up in one dollop.

84
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,768
My 24 foot?

85
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,242
Puddlenuts in Giant Country.

86
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,368
And that's where you is, in Giant Country now.

87
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,283
But why did you bring me here, and why did you take me?

88
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,450
Well, I had to take you

89
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,566
'cause the first thing you'd be doing, you'd be scuttling around

90
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,846
and yodelling the news that you were actually seeing a giant.

91
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,451
And then, there would be a great rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?

92
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,688
And all the human beans would be rummaging

93
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,282
and whiffling for the giant what you saw, and getting wildly excited.

94
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,806
And then they'd be locking me up in a cage

95
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,080
to be looked at with all the squiggling, you know...

96
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies, and jiggyraffes.

97
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,884
And then, there would a gigantous look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.

98
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,246
I won't tell.

99
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,809
No one would listen to me anyway.

100
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,565
I'm an untrustworthy child.

101
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,970
Yes, you would.

102
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,330
No, I wouldn't.

103
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,045
Yes, you would.

104
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,281
No, I wouldn't.

105
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,368
- Yes, you would.
- No, I wouldn't!

106
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,205
You would be telling the whole wonky world

107
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,329
most likely on the telly-telly bunkum box

108
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,402
and the radio squeaker.

109
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,524
I won't tell. I wouldn't ever.

110
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,245
Please, take me home. I'm scared. I want to go home.

111
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,044
No.

112
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,525
That's horrible.

113
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,008
You're just gonna have to be stayin' here with me for the rest of our lives.

114
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,844
You mean, of my life.

115
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,648
For the rest of my life.

116
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,450
Hey, is you not all frigidy cold, eh?

117
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,728
In your little nightie.

118
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,123
I will run away.

119
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,969
Listen. Listen, you.

120
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,249
I is warnin' you

121
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,401
not to ever go whiffling out of this cave without I is with you

122
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,848
or you is comin' to an ucky mucky end.

123
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,450
You can't stop me.

124
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,602
I've run away 1,000 times.

125
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,523
I have instincts.

126
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,846
Instincts? I thought human beans was full of brains.

127
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,167
You is not very clever.

128
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,607
I can stop you.

129
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,966
Eh.

130
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,451
Those giants,

131
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,771
they would swallop you up like a piece of frumpkin fry.

132
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,129
It's pumpkin pie, not frumpkin fry.

133
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,448
And jiggyraffes are giraffes.

134
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,042
Crocadowndillies are crocodiles,

135
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,010
and hippodumplings are hippopotamuses.

136
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,690
Well, I cannot be helpin' it if I was sayin' things a little squiggly.

137
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,646
I cannot be right all the time.

138
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,764
Quite often, I is left instead of right.

139
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,802
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

140
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,401
Yeah.

141
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,491
Well, what I'm says and what I means

142
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,087
is sometimes two different things.

143
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,204
Hey, what is you reading?

144
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,765
<i>Nicholas Nickleby.</i>

145
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,848
- Ah?
- What's in those jars?

146
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,001
Dreams.

147
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,251
Dreams aren't things.

148
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,886
I don't dream, actually. I've got insomnia.

149
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,402
Is that right?

150
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,929
Dreams is actually very mysterious things.

151
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,650
All the time...

152
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,166
they is searching

153
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,685
for...

154
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,683
For sleeping...

155
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,330
people.

156
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,364
"With throbbing veins and burning skin

157
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,801
"eyes wild and heavy."

158
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,326
You can... You can read!

159
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah.

160
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,129
"Thoughts hurried and disordered

161
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,366
"he felt as though the light were rep-roach

162
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,327
"and shrunk involuntarily from the day

163
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,728
"as if he were some foul and hideous

164
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,525
"thing."

165
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,486
Help me!

166
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,611
No! Help!

167
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,402
Help me!

168
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,531
Help!

169
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,249
You did that.

170
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,203
There you has me right.

171
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,766
I told you I didn't dream

172
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,002
so it was much scarier than it needed to be.

173
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,682
Needs must.

174
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,291
Titchy little snapperwhippers like you

175
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,649
should not be higgling around with old sage and onions like me.

176
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,086
Giants is all murderful and cannybulls.

177
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,810
They's swallopin' up human beans like they's sugar lumps.

178
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,002
"Beings", not "beans".

179
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,927
Yeah, well, they'd eat you either way.

180
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,568
What... What is that green fizz?

181
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,445
Frobscottle.

182
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,282
All giants is drinking frobscottle.

183
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,567
It... It's fizzing the wrong way.

184
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,961
Eh?

185
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,447
Our bubbles go up.

186
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,362
Up? Up?

187
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,131
Upward-going bubbles gives a filthsome belchy burp.

188
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,287
But what's wrong with a little burp now and then?

189
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
It's loathsome.

190
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,285
But if the bubbles in your tummy go down

191
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,842
and come out someplace else...

192
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,964
- Yeah?
- That could have a far nastier result.

193
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,051
A whizzpopper.

194
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,249
- Whizzpopper?
- Yeah.

195
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,967
A sign of true happiness.

196
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,685
Oh, no.

197
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,484
It's glummy!

198
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,889
Whoopie!

199
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,201
Whoa!

200
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,564
Runt.

201
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,164
Is you at home, Runt?

202
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,881
No.

203
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,203
You is jabbeling.

204
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,567
Who is you jabbeling to, Runt?

205
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,762
Why is you such a chatbag in the morning?

206
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,008
Why is you not sleeping today?

207
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,845
Because you keep me awake with your jabbeling.

208
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,890
I has a boo-boo.

209
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,048
Oh, possibly later.

210
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,686
Now, Runt!

211
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,808
Never mind, I will. Don't...

212
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,044
Right, now we just have to fetch some water.

213
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,124
No, no, no. No water.

214
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,160
No water.

215
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,009
Hide behind something. Hide behind there.

216
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,290
All right. Gimme it.

217
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,806
Gimme it. Give it here.

218
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,324
Does you have a new little petty-poo?

219
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,886
No.

220
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,129
I smells bean, Runt. I finds him...

221
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,168
- Hold still. - ...I eats him up.

222
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,846
You is barking up the wrong dog.

223
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,968
There ain't no bean here.

224
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,164
I is hungry.

225
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,210
Hey, yeah. Why don't you have that snozzcumber?

226
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,451
Oh, that is a scrumptious snozzcumber. It's fresh.

227
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,602
You lives on some rotten garbage, Runt.

228
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,886
Don't be like that.

229
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,281
- Have you never tried that, Fleshlumpeater?
- No, never.

230
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,526
I'll tell you, I's guzzling that wonderveg gleefully, night and day.

231
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,846
Well, that's what's wrong with you.

232
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,929
The outside is horrigust.

233
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,928
But the inside is smelling something...

234
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,685
...sweetly familiar.

235
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,167
Yeah! Go on! Go on, boy.

236
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,761
Get your lips around that. That is lovely.

237
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,604
- Wait! Wait!
- Huh?

238
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,248
You hates vegetables! You eats only beans!

239
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,849
I hate vegeterribles.

240
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,810
I eats only beans.

241
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,645
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

242
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,801
Yeah!

243
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,287
Yeah.

244
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,211
That's what I said.

245
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,650
That's what I is sayin'. I said it.

246
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,126
I hates, ugh, fruits and vegeterribles.

247
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,361
And water!

248
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,162
And water.

249
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,925
And water.

250
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,165
I'm taking this.

251
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,931
You.

252
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,287
You is an insult to giant people.

253
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,921
Cheers.

254
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,371
Too hot! Too hot! Too hot!

255
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,891
Too hot!

256
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,091
And something to wear?

257
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,926
What?

258
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,645
Where'd you get that jacket?

259
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,209
Um, in your scraps. It's nice.

260
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,800
Is, um, something the matter?

261
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,681
No, it's just...

262
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,807
Never mind.

263
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,451
Where are you going?

264
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,844
Uh, to work.

265
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,371
What do you do for work?

266
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,525
Oh, now you's asking me to tell you whopsie big secrets!

267
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,930
I... I won't tell a soul.

268
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,771
How could I anyway?

269
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,803
I'm stuck here for the rest of my life.

270
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,282
I catch dreams.

271
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,091
I want to come!

272
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,491
Yeah, I bet you...

273
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,843
No, you is staying here.

274
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,531
No, I'm not!

275
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,648
Yes, you are. You is human bean

276
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,321
and human bean is like strawbunkles and cream

277
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,449

278
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,801
You've a nice safe place right here.

279
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,285
Not possible.

280
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,444
I goes to catch dreams, same as every day.

281
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,729
I goes alone. I's a feature of habit.

282
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,206
But you'll be leaving me here with them.

283
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,170
They will eat me.

284
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,964
They is sounding asleep.

285
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,046
I is going dream catching.

286
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,169
I is going alone.

287
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,688
You be snug as a bug up there.

288
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,285
Oh, my...

289
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,727
You can't have secrets from me.

290
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,245
It's too late for that.

291
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,924
You must take me.

292
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,610
No.

293
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,690
We can't have secrets. I'll tell you mine.

294
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,529
I sneak around at night too.

295
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,921
And I steal sometimes. And I lie.

296
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,209
So... So I'm lonely most of the time.

297
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,887
I've never had a best friend. Sounds like you, I'll bet.

298
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,883
We... We gets over it.

299
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,480
And we... We gets on with it.

00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,362
Fleshhead, he'll come and eat me.

301
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,325
My blood will be on your hands.

302
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,128
Everything about you goes against all my better judgementals, girl.

303
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,123
Well, I'm right about this one.

304
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,124
I promise I am.

305
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,331

00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,568
We have to go right past all those sleeping giants,

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,968

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,204
Runt!

312
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,843
Where is you galloping off to in the daytime, Runt?

313
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,407
<i>You know I was going off to my work.</i>

314
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,970
<i>Well, you could be seen by snoopers</i>

315
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,731

- Oh, no, no...

316
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,241
And we is not wanting a giant hunt, is we?

317
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,926
Now, let me down, Fleshlumpeater.

318
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,684
Let the boys sleep in the day.

319
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,366
Well, we is all awake now, we might as well...

320
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,561

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,767
Frolic.

322
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,729
Yeah, we might as well frolic.

323
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,686
What's frolic?

324
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,482
Frolic, you know, like...

325
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,804
- Frolic.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, frolic. Yeah, yeah.

326
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,450
Don't just take it.

327
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,284
Do something.

328
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,842
Gizzardgulper, go long.

329
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,682
Oh! Oh!

330
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,765
Why you not hunt with us, Runt?

331
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,080
Ooh!

332
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,446
Hey.

333
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,886
Whoa!

334
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,170
Oh...

335
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,810
Look at the puffers.

336
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,604
Rain be coming.

337
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,010
Huh? Huh?

338
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,484
- Bean.
- Bean.

339
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,209
Now...

340
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,326
You... You shouldn't let them treat you like that.

341
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,640
Nobody should.

342
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,966
I lives with nine bean-eating giants.

343
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,643
They takes, so I gives back. I blows my dreams about.

344
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,490
Well, that's as good as I can do.

345
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,402
I do something, eh?

346
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,963
I do something.

347
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,089
We is here, at last.

348
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,001
You is in Dream Country now, missy.

349
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,928
I shared you a secret.

350
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,969
Look at all the stars.

351
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,444
Oh, yeah.

352
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,722
Often enough, on a clear night I is hearing faraway music

353
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,207
coming from those stars in the sky.

354
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,404
- You do? What else?
- Well...

355
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,491
I is hearing the tiny little ants chittering to each other

356
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,403
as they skiddle about in the soil.

357
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,328
Cattlepiddlers though, they is the worst chatbags.

358
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,127
All the time, they is arguing about who will be the most pretty butteryflies.

359
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,122
Go on, please.

360
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,730
I hear the footsteps of a lady bird as she walks across a leaf.

361
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,086
But the funniest...

362
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,528
The funniest old stories I's heard from the plants and the trees themselves.

363
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,926
Yeah.

364
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,171
They is living and growing, laughing, chittering, just like you and me.

365
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,490
Come on, down you go.

366
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,570
Yeah.

367
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,288
I is hearing all the wondrous and all the terrible...

368
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,045
Terrible, terrible things.

369
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,451
All the secret whisperings of the world.

370
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,762
Really?

371
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,291
You think I's swizzfiggling you, don't you?

372
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,005
No.

373
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,051
It's just all rather hard to believe.

374
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,726
At one point, someone...

375
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,611
Someone called me the...

376
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,007
The Big Friendly Giant.

377
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,043
What shall I call you, gal?

378
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,089
My name is Sophie.

379
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,928
Well, jump, Sophie.

380
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,803
This be where all my dreams is beginning.

381
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,484
Oh, my...

382
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,006
<i>As a dream comes whiffling by it's so silvery soft,</i>

383
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,242
<i>it was making like a tiny little buzzing, humming sound, like music.</i>

384
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,129
Bogswinkles!

385
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,202
It's a phizzwizard!

386
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,967
I don't be seeing many of them any more.

387
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,083
It's behind you on your elbow!

388
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,009
No, not that elbow! The other one!

389
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,805
Now it's on your foot!

390
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,965
The other foot!

391
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,125
It's on your bottom!

392
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,770
I gots it.

393
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,484
Seems to know you, gal.

394
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,601
Look.

395
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,364
It is a golden phizzwizard.

396
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,002
I wish I could hear it.

397
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,281
Here.

398
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,171
It be's very soft.

399
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,567
Do you actually hear what these dreams say?

400
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,971
Yeah, I do.

401
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,089
Well, this one sounds like you.

402
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,482
Hello, beautiful dream.

403
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,047
It...

404
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,331
Look.

405
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,210
Go on, make yourself useful, my little frogglefrump.

406
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,441
I...

407
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,522
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.

408
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,365
Use your hands, your titchy little figglers.

409
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,961
Oh.

410
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,445
Ah! I got one!

411
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,124
Let it go, Sophie.

412
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,284
Give it here. Give it to me.

413
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,204
Give it to me.

414
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,004
Go, give it here.

415
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,010
Oh, mince my maggots.

416
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,371
I think this be a very, very bad dream.

417
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,167
There are bad dreams here, too?

418
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,847
It be a trogglehumper.

419
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,529
What are you going to do with it?

420
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,247
I locks them up, you wicked beastie, you.

421
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,243
What does the bad dream say?

422
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,571
It says...

423
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,169
"Look at what you has done and there be no forgiveness."

424
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,050
Where are you?

425
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,170
I can't see you.

426
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,409
Big Friendly Giant!

427
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,209
Big Friendly Giant, I'm going to call you...

428
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,485
BFG.

429
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,927
You calls me what you likes.

430
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,526
Where are you going next?

431
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,965
Dream-blowing.

432
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,122
It be as good as I can do.

433
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,925
Why here?

434
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,851
Because I hears a little heart.

435
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,488
What be your pleasure, missy?

436
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,284
Make them all happy.

437
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,806
BFG, did your mother or father teach you about dreams?

438
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,483
Giants don't have mothers or fathers.

439
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,810
Never?

440
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,326
How old are you?

441
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,009
Oh, I's as old as the Earth, I suppose.

442
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,367
I is getting a little bit crumply

443
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,480
but us giants is mostlyjust going on and on, and on...

444
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,927
Like whiffsy time-twiddlers.

445
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,484
BFG...

446
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,889
...did you hear my heart at the orphanage?

447
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,206
Yeah, I hears it right now.

448
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,321
What does the dream say?

449
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,566
Well...

450
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,923
<i>The boy, he's dreaming that the tellyphony</i>

451
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,565
<i>is ringing in his house.</i>

452
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,007
<i>His da, he answers it and he says,</i>

453
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,970
<i>"Yes, this is Mr. Goulash speaking."</i>

454
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,126
And then, he's gasping like he has a lobster stuck in his throat.

455
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,891
<i>And he's saying, "Who? What? Yes, sir, I understand.</i>

456
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,409
"But, surely, sir, it is me you wish to be speaking to, not my little boy."

457
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,251
And then, his face turns white and his eyes pop out of his head

458
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,924
<i>and he says, "Yes, sir. He is here, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir."</i>

459
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,327
<i>And he hands the phone to the boy.</i>

460
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,691
<i>"Is you knowing the President of the United States?" he asks.</i>

461
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,251
<i>"No." Says the boy.</i>

462
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,766
<i>"But I suspect he's hearing about me."</i>

463
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,970
And then he takes the phone, the boy, and he...

464
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,971
He's having a long chittery chat on the phone with the President.

465
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,364
"Well, let me take care of it, Mr. President.

466
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,930
"No, no. No, no, no.

467
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,442
<i>"You'll bungle it up, sir, if you do it all your way."</i>

468
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,760
<i>And his dad...</i>

469
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,047
<i>His eyes is googling out of his head.</i>

470
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,442
<i>And then his ma, she comes into the room.</i>

471
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,205
<i>And his dad, he tells her. And then...</i>

472
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,848
<i>so on, and so on, and so on.</i>

473
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,527
Dreams are so quick.

474
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,326
Yeah, on the outside.

475
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,122
They's long on the inside.

476
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,685
Shh... Shh...

477
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,085
What?

478
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,242
I hears lament.

479
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,610
Somebody's silkies is crying for their darling.

480
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,645
Look!

481
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,970
Monsters.

482
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,330
We have to stop them.

483
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,531
You can't keep living like this, BFG.

484
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,489
BFG, what did you do with my blanket?

485
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,608
I thought you had it there.

486
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,730
Where is it, in my other...

487
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,771
- In the cape?
- Oh, I think I dropped it in Giant Country.

488
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,203
You dropped it in Giant Country?

489
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,007
Giant Country...

490
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,890
Did I fall asleep?

491
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,446
Why are you giving me a dream?

492
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,523
Why are you giving me a dream?

493
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,086
Why are you giving me a dream?

494
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,762
You dropped your blanket.

495
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,602
So they must know you was there.

496
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,603
You's not safe with me, girl.

497
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,204
So? You is not safe with me.

498
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,966
Never mind that now.

499
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,130
There was a boy.

500
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,164
He liked to read. He taught me how to read.

501
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,289
You's wearin' his little red jacket.

502
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,091
I hears his lonely heart just like I hears yours.

503
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,401
Then he seen me, like you did.

504
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,001
So I had to take him, hipswitch.

505
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,730
I could have brought him back home.

506
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,965
But then it be too late.

507
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,686
It won't be like that.

508
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,885
We'll stop the giants.

509
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,281
We'll make them go away forever.

510
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,208
Was the boy scared?

511
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,842
Yeah. In the end.

512
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,210
I'm not.

513
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,842
Brave Sophie.

514
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,011
I'm not!

515
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,726
I'm not.

516
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,250
I'm not.

517
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,731
BFG.

518
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,006
You say you can hear ants talk and spiders spin.

519
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,569
That you can hear the stars.

520
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,449
Can you still hear me?

521
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,169
I feel you're here.

522
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,088
I know you're here.

523
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,811
BFG.

524
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,405
Jump, Sophie.

525
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,608
We need a plan...

526
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,368
We need a plan...

527
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,687
Need a plan...

528
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,570
Are you thinking up a plan?

529
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,011
I's not having the foggiest idea in the wonky world.

530
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,968
Well, keep at it.

531
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,525
<i>Runt!</i>

532
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,525
Sophie. Hide.

533
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,007
<i>Oh, Runty, is you at home?</i>

534
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,244
Quick, quick, quick!

535
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,601
I has a boo-boo.

536
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,531
Well, you's a big boy.

537
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,684
You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.

538
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,206
Oh, I will.

539
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,646
Oh, he Will!

540
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,722
You has a bean.

541
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,446
Right. Out!

542
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,206
<i>Let's get on with it.</i>

543
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,327
<i>Let's get on with it.</i>

544
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,368
- Time to hunt.
- Time to hunt.

545
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,446
Skitter scatter, boys.

546
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,563
Find me the chiddler.

547
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,206
<i>No, no, no.</i>

548
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,970
No, no. Don't! No!

549
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,491
No, don't!

550
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,721
This be my work. This be my work, boys!

551
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,806
Look at me!

552
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,450
Once, us giants, we be gentries.

553
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,326
Those days are over.

554
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,246
Where is the delicious little chatbag?

555
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,529
Oh!

556
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,250
Right! Out, all of you!

557
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,490
Toot toot.

558
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,085
Whoa!

559
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,883
Oh.

560
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,650
He find the last one.

561
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,686
I finds this one.

562
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,130
This be my home.

563
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,961
Ow, hot! Hot!

564
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,327
You don't come in here anymore!

565
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,443
Go on, get out!

566
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,329
Cursed you be, Runt.

567
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,446
Get out!

568
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,608
This be my home!

569
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,321
You...

570
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,847
You is insult to giants.

571
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,126
Ow!

572
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,128
Well, there be more dreams disappeared into a thick ear.

573
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,404
Into thin air.

574
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,129
Words.

575
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,882
They's all such a twitch-tickling problem to me all my life.

576
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,122
I knows exactly what words I want to say

577
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,446
but somehow or other

578
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,887
they all comes out squiff-squiddled 'round.

579
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,447
Don't worry. That happens to everyone.

580
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,886
Not like it happens to me.

581
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,810
I speak in the most terrible wigglish.

582
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,521
Well, uh, I think you speak beautifully.

583
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,804
You do?

584
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,811
You really do?

585
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,089
Mmm-hmm. Simply beautifully.

586
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,444
Oh, that...

587
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:23,404
Oh, that is the nicest present that anybody's ever given me in my entire life.

588
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,211
BFG...

589
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,203
How whoopsey-splunkers.

590
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,966
BFG.

591
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,565
How absolutely...

592
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,328
What's the word? Squiffling.

593
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,087
- BFG.
- I is all of a stutter.

594
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,764
BFG!

595
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,045
Yeah, yeah?

596
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,686
I have a plan.

597
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,205
A Plan?

598
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,691
We are going to the Queen.

599
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,364
We really, really need her help.

600
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,283
We can be there by dawn.

601
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,445
Right.

602
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:08,084
You be giving your Queeny a frightsome curd-bloodling trogglehumper.

603
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,325
Needs must. Scary as you can make it.

604
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,524
Oh, chiddlers.

605
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,763
The Queen will dream that giants, all nine of them, are in England.

606
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,289
And they are eating little children.

607
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,281
And be sure to put some army in it.

608
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,688
Be sure you add a little of me.

609
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,840
Right.

610
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,091
Did you add yourself?

611
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,530
The Queen will dream that a little girl is sitting on her windowsill.

612
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,408
Then, she wakes up and I am there.

613
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,886
We are there.

614
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,049
Uh, then what happens?

615
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,884
Well, then a Big Friendly Giant steps forward

616
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,844
and bows and says,

617
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,288
"Your Majesty, I am your humble servant."

618
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,771
You mean she actually sees me?

619
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,050
No. Not in a month of Mondays, girl.

620
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,926
Huh?

621
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,406
BFG, stop! You are going to knock me off.

622
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,844
Just trying to listen to the different breathing of manly bean and lady bean.

623
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,046
<i>No.</i>

624
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,371
<i>No, no. No, no it's not...</i>

625
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,807
<i>It's horrible. Don't. Stop them.</i>

626
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,330
<i>Make them stop. Make 'em stop!</i>

627
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,803
<i>Giants? Giants.</i>

628
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,645
<i>Horrible.</i>

629
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,564
<i>Man... Man-eating giants, no.</i>

630
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,331
<i>No, no, stop. No! No, no, no!</i>

631
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,561
<i>No!</i>

632
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,290
Your Majesty.

633
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,606
What is it?

634
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,444
Oh, Mary.

635
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,123
I had the most horrible dream.

636
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,970
Oh.

637
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,448
Well, only a dream, ma'am, hmm?

638
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,805
Let me get your tea.

639
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,887
I dreamt that girls and boys

640
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,725
were being snatched out of their beds in boarding schools

641
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,680
and were being eaten by the most ghastly giants.

642
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,769
There was so many of them.

643
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,365
There was the...

644
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,965
The Fleshlumpeater

645
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,083
and the Gizzardgulper

646
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,242
and the Meatdripper.

647
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,243
And the, uh...

648
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,690
<i>Butcher Boy?</i>

649
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,400
Butcher Boy.

650
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,125
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Oh!

651
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,807
The giants put their hands in through the windows

652
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,486
and pluck the children out with their fingers.

653
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,848
It was so bloody, so vivid, so real.

654
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,487
So real, Mary.

655
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,887
The children just disappeared.

656
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,406
Oh, my!

657
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,041
Uh...

658
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,243
What's the matter, dear? You're white as a sheet.

659
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,406
- Sit down, Mary. Sit.
- Yes.

660
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,568
You're trembling. What is it?

661
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:42,011
Well, it's just, uh, so odd, ma'am.

662
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,445
So very odd.

663
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,925
You haven't seen the papers?

664
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,206
No, I haven't seen them yet.

665
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,044
Well, here. Look.

666
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,883
It's the very dream you had.

667
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,002
Children have disappeared in the night.

668
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,123
Gone. Taken.

669
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,603
But, not by giants.

670
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,684
Well, no, it couldn't be could it, ma'am?

671
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,884
Draw the curtains.

672
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,205
Yes, ma'am.

673
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,921
<i>Oh!</i>

674
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,802
I don't believe it.

675
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,889
There's a small girl standing on the window sill.

676
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,603
Is there not, Mr. Tibbs?

677
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,929
There is indeed, ma'am.

678
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,811
She is standing right there, ma'am.

679
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,890
You didn't dream it.

680
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,244
But I did dream it.

681
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,848
How in the world did you get there?

682
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,369
- Well...
- Let me take care of this, ma'am.

683
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,044
- Here. Come down. Come with me.
- No, no, don't do that.

684
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,086
A giant put you there.

685
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,121
Yes, he did, ma'am.

686
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,010
He's waiting in the garden now.

687
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,520
Is he?

688
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,880
Is he?

689
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,165
He's my best friend.

690
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,731
He made your dream.

691
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,684
- Did he?
- Did he?

692
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,205
Did he?

693
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,243
Queen's garden, rear window, please.

694
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,450
Why have you and your giant come to see me?

695
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,604
I... I think you would remember that, Your Majesty,

696
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,609
if the mixing went well.

697
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,324
Yes, I remember.

698
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,647
You have a plan. You need me.

699
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,161
Yes, we do. Should we call for him now?

700
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,281
I suppose we should.

701
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,604
You promise you won't hurt him, ma'am?

702
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,923
Rear garden, rear garden, please.

703
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,091
I'm ready.

704
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,085
BFG!

705
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,649
BFG, the Queen would really like to meet you.

706
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,445
You won't put him in the bunkumhouse?

707
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,162
Come down from there, child.

708
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,283
Mary, take her downstairs and get her some breakfast.

709
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,721
- Mr. Tibbs, find out where she comes from.
- Come on, dear. Come on.

710
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,890
No! No! No, he's just afraid.

711
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,562
He's never done anything like this in his whole life before.

712
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,204
BFG, be brave!

713
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,120
You promised you wouldn't hurt him.

714
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,047
Mr. Tibbs, tell the guards to stand down.

715
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,771
Mr. Tibbs?

716
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,046
Stand down, gentlemen, please. Stand down.

717
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,970
Dear, come here.

718
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,247
Your Majesty, I am your humble servant.

719
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,844
Your Majester, I is your humbug servant.

720
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,249
I'm so pleased to make your acquaintance.

721
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,401
Oh, Majester. Oh, Monacher.

722
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,761
Oh, ruler of...

723
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,644
straight lines.

724
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,365
I's come, with my little friend Sophie

725
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,565
to give you a...

726
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,601
Uh...

727
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,361
To give me what?

728
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,327
Asistance.

729
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,611
Thank you.

730
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,121
I'm sure you have, but not in my dressing-gown.

731
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,567
Oh, dear.

732
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,848
Giants, Boris. Man-eating giants.

733
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,604
Have people been disappearing?

734
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,840
Ha!

735
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,161
We have verifiable intelligence.

736
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,242
We might need air clearance. I'll get back to you.

737
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,806
Nancy, is Ronnie there?

738
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,570
Well, wake him.

739
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,087
Her Majesty the Queen.

740
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:04,001
This way, sir. Just follow me.

741
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,650
Follow me.

742
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,006
That's it, sir.

743
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,047
Slow ahead. Careful. Slow ahead.

744
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,085
And full stop.

745
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,362
To port side, sir. Oh!

746
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,249
Careful of the antiques, sir.

747
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,682
And up. Up.

748
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,120
Careful, up, up. That's it.

749
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,324
Hard to port.

750
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,971
And slow ahead.

751
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,571
Steady...

752
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,086
Yes, sir.

753
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,640
Oh!

754
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,968
Bogswinkles! What was that?

755
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,291
That was Louis Quatorze.

756
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,282
I'm so, so sorry, Your Majesty.

757
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,607
He's never really been in a house before.

758
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,404
Your cape, sir.

759
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:03,440
What a whoppsy, spliffling room we is in.

760
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,724
Your valise, sir.

761
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,610
Your Majesty.

762
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,046
This... This room is so gigantous

763
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,806
I's needed bicirculers and telescoops to see what's going on at either end.

764
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,045
Does he always talk like that?

765
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,528
Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,244
He's never had schooling.

767
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,606
Ah.

768
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,291
Ah.

769
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,966
Sir.

770
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,361
Please, BFG. Start.

771
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,280
Oh.

772
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,403
There's only one word for that, Majester.

773
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,209
Scrumdiddlyumptious.

774
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,482
Oh, that is glummy.

775
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,801
Goodbye snozzcumber.

776
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,404
What's snozzcumber?

777
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,242
It's this horrible stinky vegetable, and I'm afraid it's all he has to eat.

778
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,561
Doesn't seem to have stunted his growth at all.

779
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,801
Mmm...

780
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,762
Pour BFG his coffee, please.

781
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,727
What's that? What's that black stuff?

782
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,569
What is that?

783
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,690
Where'd you get all that foam?

784
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,964
He's magnificent, your giant.

785
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,844
Sophie, dear, do start.

786
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,410
You must be famished.

787
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,046
It's delumptious.

788
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,161
Ah.

789
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,960
Oguflug!

790
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:44,004
Please, Majester, what is this horrible swigpill I's drinking, Majester?

791
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,325
Would he prefer tea?

792
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,721
He would prefer frobscottle.

793
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,090
- Frobscottle?
- Yeah.

794
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,243
A little gift for Your Majester.

795
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,726
Delunctious, fizzy, frobscottle.

796
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,963
It be a personable ferment.

797
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,840
How kind.

798
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:06,808
Would Your Majester be so kind as to honour me with...

799
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,971
...a pour?

800
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,730
It's fizzing the wrong way.

801
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,050
Our bubbles go up.

802
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:22,566
Oh, yeah. We wouldn't have some glumptious, whizzpopping music?

803
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,401
Does he like music? We have bagpipes.

804
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,968
The generals have been briefed, ma'am.

805
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,363
This is a story which beggars belief, but we don't have the time.

806
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,403
We're on our way to Giant Country.

807
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,887
BFG will chart a course for you.

808
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,601
Generals, BFG.

809
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,571
In 10 hours, the giants will once again be on the hunt.

810
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,407
And I intend to stop them.

811
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,525
And where exactly is Giant Country, sir?

812
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,401
Exunctly, well, let's see.

813
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,606
Hey.

814
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,046
There.

815
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,725
- What?
- There.

816
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,210
Gentlemen, your men will follow the BFG.

817
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,206
I have promised him you will go only once to Giant Country.

818
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,761
You not be finding it a second time.

819
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,442
Just look at those bubbles.

820
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,611
I believe in the BFG.

821
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,171
The BFG!

822
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,760
To the BFG.

823
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,404
Marvellous bubbles.

824
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,844
To Giant Country.

825
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,729
We will hold here.

826
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,362
BFG, I was asking if you had a plan.

827
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,763
BFG. Do you have a plan?

828
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,202
BFG! Do you have a plan?

829
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,566
The trogglehumper I caught, you're giving it to the giants?

830
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,569
Yeah, I was giving the boys this most horrigust dream of despair.

831
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,488
If the dream does its job, they wakes trapped in flush bunking remorse.

832
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,127
And if those wopsy bellypoppers out there does their job,

833
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,886
then I think we stands a chance.

834
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,767
"Look at what you has done, and there be no forgiveness."

835
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,289
Needs must. Now, stand back, girl.

836
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,370
We's brought the hunt to Giant Country.

837
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,606
Uh...

838
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,808
What is Sophie's dream?

839
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,890
Your golden phizzwizard.

840
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,167
I don't see much of them anymore.

841
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,246
But what does it say?

842
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,850
It tells a story of a little gal.

843
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,561
A little chiddler with her whole life ahead of her.

844
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,125
With a fambly of her own.

845
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,281
Little chiddlers of her own, too, someday.

846
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,843
There will be great successfuls...

847
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,531
...and funnies ahead for her,

848
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,649
and truth to tell, just a dribble of despair.

849
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,726
Times'll be hard, times is be soft.

850
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,411
Adventures will come and go.

851
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,450
But in the end...

852
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,765
she remembers the good deeds.

853
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,370
Now, Sophie, I...

854
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,286
I know...

855
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,051
that story be your heart's desire.

856
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,650
I knows it.

857
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,766
The dream, it came to you, didn't it?

858
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,082
It be Sophie's dream.

859
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,882
But, then I wake up.

860
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,289
Then you wakes up.

861
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,566
But not here.

862
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,846
No.

863
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:21,609
You has more dreams to catch, my little frogglefrump.

864
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,529
But not in Giant Country.

865
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,090
But will I still have you?

866
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,122
Will you still hear me when I call for you?

867
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,564
Are you forgettin' something?

868
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,691
Are you forgettin' these?

869
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,768
It be time, BFG.

870
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,209
Now, where did I put the...

871
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,847
I left me trumpet at Her Majester's.

872
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,561
Oh, I is such a mixed-up,

873
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,522
boggled-up giant sometimes.

874
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,569
Deliver us from weasels.

875
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,970
Sophie?

876
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,767
Oh, no. Oh, no, Sophie.

877
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,530
And what does we have here?

878
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,164
- You is a cannybull.
- You is a cannybull.

879
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,525
I is bad.

880
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,326
Have pity on a poor little giant.

881
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,841
You are a very bad giant.

882
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,450
I has no regrets.

883
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,682
- Runt!
- Run, Sophie! Run!

884
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,401
It's over, Fleshlumpeater.

885
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,202
It's over, boy.

886
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,044
It's time to stop now.

887
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,402
I's always hungry.

888
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,566
Huh?

889
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,525
Whoa!

890
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,443
Back of the LZ.

891
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,601
Roger that.

892
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,885
Come on, lads!

893
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,331
Take him away!

894
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,169
Go! Go, go!

895
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,931
Secure that side!

896
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,604
Take cover!

897
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,646
<i>The giants were taken far, far away</i>

898
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,007
<i>to a place you've never heard of</i>

899
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,889
<i>and a place you'll never go.</i>

900
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,484
<i>The Queen sent them off with snozzcumber seeds.</i>

901
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,762
<i>It was all they would have to eat...</i>

902
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,206
<i>... and they were just going to have to get used to it.</i>

903
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,601
It's time to wake up, darling.

904
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,483
Morning, Sophie.

905
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,004
<i>I had a dream last night.</i>

906
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,167
<i>In the dream, I was awakened by a beautiful,</i>

907
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,766
<i>buzzing, humming noise floating above my bed.</i>

908
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,165
<i>I walked to the window</i>

909
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,006
<i>and against the horizon I saw his long legs leaping,</i>

910
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,160
<i>suitcase and trumpet in hand.</i>

911
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:16,084
<i>I could see all the way to Giant Country.</i>

912
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,763
<i>I could see the garden BFG was growing.</i>

913
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,447
<i>He had fruits and berries, cauliflower and tomatoes.</i>

914
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,690
<i>He refused to have Brussels sprouts, though.</i>

915
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,049
<i>But snozzcumbers were still growing at the side of his cottage.</i>

916
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,887
<i>How else would he make frobscottle?</i>

917
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,441
<i>I saw the stone door, and the crooked windows.</i>

918
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,648
<i>His cape was hanging by the door.</i>

919
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:45,809
<i>I saw the crow's nest and his sailor boat bed.</i>

920
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:52,126
<i>I saw his rocking chair and a fire burning in the fireplace</i>

921
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,885
<i>with a much nicer stew cooking.</i>

922
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,969
<i>I could see the scattered pages of the book he was writing.</i>

923
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,801
<i>He was happy, and I was happy.</i>

924
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:14,481
<i>When I'm lonely, which is not nearly as often as before,</i>

925
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,368
<i>I talk to him and he actually hears me.</i>

926
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,846
<i>Because BFG hears</i>

927
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,408
<i>all the secret whisperings of the world.</i>

928
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,324
Good morning, BFG.
