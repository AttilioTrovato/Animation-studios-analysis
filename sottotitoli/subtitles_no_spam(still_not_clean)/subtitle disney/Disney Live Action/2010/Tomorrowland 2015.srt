undefined.

Could you be more
specific, please?

Well, Miss Newton,

1787
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,641
you wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?

So, I once told your predecessor

1792
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,796
that she was nothing but a
combination of ones and zeroes.

1793
01:58:58,591 --> 01:59:00,217
I was wrong.

1794
01:59:00,384 --> 01:59:02,011
She was much more than that.

1795
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,347
You are much more
than that, too.

1796
01:59:05,555 --> 01:59:08,643
So, go out there and do
what she would have done.

1797
01:59:09,894 --> 01:59:11,938

haven't given up.
