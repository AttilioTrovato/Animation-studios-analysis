1
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,735
More than three
thousand years ago,

2
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,768
a man named Job complained to
God about all his troubles.

3
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,711
And the Bible tells
us that God answered.

4
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,352
Do you give the
horse his strength?

5
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,947
Or clothe his neck
with a flowing mane?

6
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,553
Do you make him
leap like a locust,

7
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,494
striking terror with
his proud snorting?

8
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:09,558
He paws fiercely,
rejoicing in his strength

9
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,832
and charges into the fray.

10
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,396
He laughs at fear,
afraid of nothing.

11
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,636
He does not shy away
from the sword.

12
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,743
The quiver rattles
against his side,

13
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,271
along with the flashing
spear and lance.

14
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,013
In frenzied excitement
he eats up the ground.

15
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:31,180
He cannot stand still
when the trumpet sounds.

16
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,244
Kate, Sarah, you have to
leave in ten minutes.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,080
Penny, I have three shirts
to pick up at the cleaners,

18
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,585
and two more to go in the
hamper, if you wouldn't mind.

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,986
- I'll pick those up.
- Also go by the wine shop,

20
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,754
pick up some Riesling?
I have a client

21
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,219
coming in. That's all he drinks.

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,817
Sarah, orange juice, please.

23
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,125
- No nuclear devices on the table.
- Come on, Dad.

24
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,631
Daddy, I need to pick up a gown.

25
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,155
Another gown?

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,964
When you earn your own money, you
can buy gowns for every party.

27
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,558
I'm sure we can find something

28
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,734
reasonable. We can go
look this weekend.

29
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,418
Not Gewürztraminer, only Riesling.

30
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,708
Mum, can we have pancakes?

31
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,234
- Working on it.
- Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh?

32
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,443
What are you doing?

33
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,771
Getting ready for a
Christmas pageant.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,410
- A Christmas pageant? When?
- Spring.

35
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,183
It's experimental. Has to do with
Christmas and lots of things.

36
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,952
Really? That's great.
What's the role?

37
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,324
- The War Protester.
- I was thinking that we could...

38
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,329
- The what?
- The War Protester.

39
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,791
It's a really good role, Mum.
You'll love it. You, too, Dad.

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,039
Tweedy residence. This is she.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,863
War protester in a
Christmas pageant?

42
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,243
We'll leave this
afternoon. Thank you.

43
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,698
What are you doing? I don't pay
you to dream, I pay you to work.

44
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,240
Now, let's get to it. Come on.
You do that on your own time.

45
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,542
Thank you.

46
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,876
Oh, Hollis.

47
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,745
Mama's gone.

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,159
She's gone. Hi, Jack.

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,512
Hollis, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

50
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,890
Your mother was
always so kind to me.

51
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,804
- Miss Chenery, we're sorry.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,801
Penny...

53
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,313
Penny, darling. Darling.

54
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,647
Girls, you remember Miss
Ham? Granddaddy's secretary?

55
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,952
- Hi, Miss Ham.
- Oh, my, you two have grown.

56
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,955
Thank you so much, Miss
Ham. For everything.

57
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,164
Hollis said you found her.

58
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:30,100
She had just fallen. The
doctor said she didn't suffer.

59
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,232
She looked... peaceful.

60
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,698
How is Daddy?

61
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,713
He keeps asking, Where is she?

62
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,844
But I'm not sure if he's
asking for your mother or you.

63
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,086
Girls, I'm going to go in and
see your granddaddy now.

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,985
I'll bring you in later.

65
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,997
Come on, girls. Let's get
you something to eat.

66
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,498
Don't let them fool you, darling.

67
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,607
It's not whether
they think we won.

68
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,202
It's whether we think we won.

69
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,948
You run your race, Penny.

70
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,853
We'll take 'em.

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,132
We just got ourselves
a couple new horses.

72
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,191
Are we going to race them?

73
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,964
No.

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,201
They're going to be mommies
and daddies for new horses.

75
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Helen?

76
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,250
Daddy, it's Penny.

77
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,448
Penny.

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,718
You got married.

79
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,219
Yes.

80
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,090
But I'm here now.

81
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:12,429
Because Mama's gone.

82
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,508
Mama's pin?

83
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,051
Yours now.

84
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,255
Daddy.

85
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,324
The Lord shall preserve thy
going out, and thy coming in.

86
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,097
From this time forth...

87
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,929
and even forever more.

88
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:51,432
And so we return to You your
faithful servant, Helen Chenery.

89
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,911
Loving mother, devoted wife...

90
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,377
who lived each moment
to the fullest,

91
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,510
cherishing the life she had with
her beloved husband, Christopher.

92
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,647
And may the peace that
passeth all understanding

93
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,090
be in your hearts now
and forever more.

94
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,287
- Amen.
- Amen.

95
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,628
Eddie? Eddie, I just wanted to
thank you so much for coming.

96
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,870
Miss Penny, your mama
was a fine woman.

97
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,242
I just feel real bad
for Mr Chenery.

98
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,439
He always thought
the world of you.

99
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,959
He said you could hear the horses'
thoughts through your hands.

100
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:33,451
Yeah, well, your father's
a good man, Miss Penny.

101
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,578
Thank you.

102
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,985
Mrs Tweedy?

103
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,652
I'm Arthur Hancock.

104
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,457
- Your daddy called me...
- Bull.

105
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,794
Oh, yes, and everyone else
did, too, as I recall.

106
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,696
This is my son, Seth.

107
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,099
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Thank you for coming.

108
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,765
Your mother was a fine woman. It
was a privilege just knowing her.

109
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,898
Thank you.

110
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,498
I know you're going to
be making some changes,

111
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,477
and if you or your family have any

112
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,639
questions, Miss Ham's
got my number.

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,908
Thank you, Bull.

114
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,242
Ma'am...

115
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,313
Your daddy's eyes would always
light up when he talked about you.

116
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,954
How smart you are. How
much you loved the horses.

117
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,169
Doctor says there may
be some brief moments

118
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,200
when he is aware of things,
but we shouldn't expect much.

119
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:36,203
Practical thing would be to
put him in a nursing home.

120
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:41,413
This is home to him. And
he knows he's here.

121
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,655
I think as long as
he does, we should

122
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,856
hire nurses and let
him stay at home.

123
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:50,225
The farm has to go. And
it won't bring much.

124
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:54,631
It's been losing money hand
over fist for years now.

125
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,036
We have to face facts. To run
a horse breeding operation,

126
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,902
you need a certain touch.

127
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,568
I'm a professor, and
you're a housewife.

128
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,434
I moved up our flight
to first thing

129
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,011
tomorrow. I've got to get back.

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,039
Jack, I need a few more days here.

131
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,526
I have to make sure Daddy's all

132
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,521
right, sort through
Mother's things.

133
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,046
The kids could all do with
a little responsibility.

134
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,581
It will just be a few days.

135
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,892
We need to file right away
for his power of attorney?

136
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,331
Miss Ham says he tried to sell
four of his best horses last month

137
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,331
for half of what
they're worth. Mum had

138
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,999
to step in and stop
him, and now...

139
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,701
I suppose someone will have to
clean up for the liquidation.

140
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,167
Hollis, if you need
any help on the

141
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,175
tax issues you call me, anytime.

142
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,915
Thanks, Jack. It will
just be for a few days.

143
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,283
Sarah makes great pancakes.

144
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,588
- Oh, no.
- They're toxic. We won't survive.

145
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,322
That's right, you won't.

146
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,922
Make sure Hollis has that
power of attorney order.

147
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,259
- The estate's vulnerable.
- I will. I'll stay on him.

148
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,493
Mum, give Granddaddy a hug
for us when he wakes up.

149
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,404
- I will. I love you.
- Love you.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,101
- Bye, Mum.
- Be good.

151
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,234
We will.

152
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,029
Miss Ham. Thank you.

153
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,055
Two sugars and cream?

154
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,259
How did you know?

155
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,498
- It's how your daddy likes it.
- Oh.

156
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,462
You doing all right, honey?

157
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,400
Yes.

158
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,670
No. But I'll be all right.

159
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,313
These two are both
pregnant by Bold Ruler.

160
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,551
And great colts come
from great sires.

161
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:05,654
Miss Ham?

162
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:09,293
My mother thought
the world of you.

163
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,432
And my father's trust in
you was... is absolute.

164
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,338
I hope you'll stay.

165
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,034
Funny, I was about to
tell you the same thing.

166
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,547
Al. Who the hell told you
to bring this one out?

167
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,072
The sable, put it back. Bring
out the yearling in 18.

168
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,847
- Yes, sir, Mister Jansen.
- Who are you?

169
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,214
Penny Tweedy.

170
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,419
- Penny Chenery.
- Oh, you're the daughter.

171
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,120
- Better get back to work.
- Excuse me, Mr Jansen?

172
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,668
Could I talk with you
a moment? In private?

173
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,636
Oh.

174
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:47,655
About what?

175
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:50,402
I wanted to ask you
about that sale

176
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,842
of those broodmares that my
mother stopped a few weeks ago.

177
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,399
I know you and your brother aren't

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,143
horse people and you
suffered a loss,

179
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,617
but you don't need to worry
about this right now.

180
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,777
Apparently, I do

181
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,387
since they're my
father's horses, and

182
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,913
the sale would've
been bad business.

183
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,476
It's bad business to come to a
barn, interrupt a trainer's work.

184
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,659
- Not if you want to keep him.
- I understand.

185
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,297
- But about that sale?
- What about it?

186
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,301
They were worth twice what we
were going to sell them for.

187
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,565
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I checked the books

188
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,663
and I made some calls
this morning to be sure.

189
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,956
Like you say, I don't
own the horses.

190
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,733
Your father has to sell them.

191
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,109
But as trainer, you
would know their worth

192
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,671
and that they were
about to be sold.

193
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,792
I'm wondering why it
had to be my mother

194
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,515
who stopped the sale and not you.

195
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,316
The old man, your father? Ask him.

196
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:40,353
I'm asking you. My father's been
sick for quite a long time now.

197
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,257
You've been paid to look
out for his interests.

198
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,978
And I do. Just because
this place is

199
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,525
going downhill it ain't my fault.

200
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,631
The sale was going to
be to Oakworth Farms?

201
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,689
I learned this morning
that the owners

202
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,399
of Oakworth were already talking

203
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,761
about selling our horses for twice

204
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,239
the price they were
going to pay us.

205
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,490
You train for them,
too, don't you?

206
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:00,009
I don't have an
exclusive deal here.

207
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,708
I work for them
sometimes. So what?

208
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,442
So if you arranged a deal

209
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,417
that gave them four horses
at half their market value

210
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,375
and they paid you
back, plus an extra

211
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,944
share on everything they made,

212
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:13,048
that wouldn't just be disloyal.
That would be committing fraud.

213
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,186
Who the hell do you think you
are? Coming here, accusing me?

214
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,420
Someone who knows enough
law to know she's right.

215
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,129
And I'm not Missy anything. Get
your things and get off my farm.

216
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,468
I have a contract,
and I'll sue you.

217
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,587
If I ever even hear
your name again,

218
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,499
I will see that you go to prison.

219
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,217
Where does Bull Hancock eat lunch?

220
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,720
At his club, every day.

221
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,517
But it's gentlemen only.

222
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:04,300
Miss? Miss, you can't...

223
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,183
I'm sorry, Mr Hancock.
I told her this

224
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,804
was a gentleman's
club, she just...

225
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,873
it's all right, Brenda.
It's all right.

226
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,817
Thank you, Seth. I apologise
for interrupting.

227
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,879
It's fine. I have friends
here, Miss Chenery.

228
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:18,981
Thank you.

229
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,987
Well, how's it going?

230
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,326
I fired Earl Jansen.

231
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,524
Do tell.

232
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:32,269
Does that mean you're selling
the horses or keeping them?

233
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,832
The farm's in bad
shape, as is Daddy.

234
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,900
But I'm not willing to sell it
unless I get what it's worth.

235
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,276
Well, horse farm needs a
strong hand on the reins,

236
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,717
but the hand that
threw Earl Jansen out

237
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,878
the door looks
pretty strong to me.

238
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,448
Well, I've got a
family back in Denver.

239
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,556
I need a good trainer just
to get things stabilised.

240
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:06,202
You need to talk to Lucien
Laurin. He's a French Canadian.

241
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,829
Dresses like Super Fly.

242
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,270
He's trying to retire.

243
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,368
What do you mean, trying?

244
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,032
Mr Laurin?

245
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:43,101
Excuse me. I'm Penny Chenery,
Chris Chenery's daughter.

246
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,410
And, I need a
trainer. Bull Hancock

247
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,237
suggested that I find you...

248
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,144
Yeah, Bull called
me, but I tell you,

249
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,617
I'm tired of babysitting half-ton
animals who are nearly as stubborn

250
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,881
and stupid as their owners are.

251
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,382
I've lost interest in racing.
Don't even follow it any more.

252
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,591
Well, I'm in a bit
of a tight spot.

253
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,656
I wonder if you might just try it

254
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,862
- for a few months and see how...
- I don't need to try anything,

255
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:13,928
and trainers don't go anywhere
to work for a few months.

256
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,209
They go where there
is a good horse.

257
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,102
We have plenty of good horses.

258
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,944
No, you don't. You have one or two
that might be worth the time,

259
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,605
but you're a little
short on people

260
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,779
over there who know
what they're doing.

261
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,152
Well, that's why I've come
to see you, Mr Laurin.

262
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:33,201
Miss, you're not
hearing me. A trainer

263
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,955
makes his living off commissions.

264
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:38,759
Ten percent off sales,
ten percent off winners.

265
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,459
To get a top trainer,
you need a top horse.

266
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,362
You're going to have
to go back to Bull

267
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:44,992
and see if he has any other ideas.

268
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,967
Mr Laurin, two of our mares
are pregnant by Bold Ruler

269
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,237
who is the finest stallion
of his generation.

270
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,766
- Fore.
- Hey.

271
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,779
- Fore.
- Watch where you're hitting.

272
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,046
Well, I yelled fore, you
idiot. That's what fore means.

273
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,853
You see how I am, Miss
Chenery, when I put myself

274
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,122
in a position to do
something poorly?

275
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,629
And I'm afraid at your stable, I'd
be yelling fore all day long.

276
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,968
Give my regards to your father.

277
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,722
Fore.

278
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,780
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

279
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,013
I need to talk to you about
this coin toss thing.

280
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,521
- Coin toss?
- Jack, listen.

281
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,754
Stallions cost more than mares.
No, they're more glamorous.

282
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,728
But Daddy knew that a great horse

283
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,230
comes just as much from
the mare as the stallion.

284
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,393
He invested in mares, which is
the first smart thing he did.

285
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,531
Second smart thing he did was he
made a deal with Ogden Phipps.

286
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,097
Phipps? Richest man in America?

287
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,075
Yes. Instead of paying a stud fee,

288
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,040
Daddy made a deal to breed Phipps'

289
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,309
best stallion with
our two best mares.

290
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,735
When the mares are
close to term, they

291
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,114
toss a coin to see
who gets which foal.

292
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,619
That coin toss is in two weeks.

293
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,477
What's the difference?
I don't have

294
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,094
any idea which horse to choose.

295
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:27,997
I've been through the stud books,
Jack. Bold Ruler, that's the sire.

296
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,469
He was fast, but he couldn't
last over distances.

297
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,631
Now the two dams are Hasty
Matilda and Something Royal.

298
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,006
Hasty Matilda is eight years
old. She's still young.

299
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,877
Since broodmares tend
to produce their

300
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,970
best offspring while
they're young, that

301
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:45,140
makes her foal the obvious choice,
since Something Royal's 17.

302
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,981
But her grandsire
was Princequillo.

303
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,585
He had great stamina, Jack.

304
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,556
- Penny? Penny.
- Do you know what that means?

305
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,822
- What?
- Sire and dam and Sam-I-Am?

306
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,854
What is this? Come on.
We need you here, Penny.

307
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,195
Come home.

308
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,959
Right after the coin toss.

309
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,914
- You about ready?
- We're ready.

310
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,747
Excuse me just a minute.

311
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,222
I'll be making the toss. Are
you waiting on anybody else?

312
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,323
- No, I came alone.
- We toss right on the hour.

313
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,694
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

314
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,496
Hi. Good to see you, Mr
Hancock. How are you?

315
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,098
Hollis. What are you doing here?

316
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,200
I called Jack about
our tax issues,

317
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,373
and he told me you
fired our trainer.

318
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,846
How do you expect we can fetch
a good price on the farm

319
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,372
if we don't have a training
operation in place.

320
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,931
He was dishonest.
He had to go. You

321
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:57,514
came down here because
of a trainer?

322
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,253
This coin toss is big. The foal
could be worth a great deal.

323
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,920
I checked with some
of Phipps' people.

324
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,794
They think he wants
Hasty Matilda's foal.

325
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,354
So that's who we'll choose.

326
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,264
No, Hollis, I think that's wrong.

327
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,185
Something Royal's
colt could have an

328
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,964
unusual mix of speed and stamina.

329
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,013
Phipps has the best
horse people in the

330
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:16,770
world. You know more than they do?

331
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,540
Come on.

332
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,907
Please don't take
offence, Miss Chenery,

333
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,082
but your father almost
never won our coin tosses.

334
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,488
And I do hope you've
inherited his luck.

335
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,584
All right. We're all here now.

336
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,128
Mr Phipps has the call as
the owner of Bold Ruler.

337
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,397
The winner has the choice of the
offspring of Mr Chenery's mares.

338
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,371
Hasty Matilda or Something Royal.

339
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:51,432
Are we all in agreement here?
All right. Here we go.

340
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,841
- Call.
- Heads.

341
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,721
Heads it is. I'll go
with Hasty Matilda.

342
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,725
Miss Chenery. Please give
my best to your father.

343
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,026
Well, that's that.

344
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,533
But I got what I wanted.

345
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:24,841
You got what nobody else
wanted. Time to go home.

346
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,280
Can I give you a lift home?

347
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,180
No, thank you, I have
Daddy's truck here.

348
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,208
- All right.
- Bye, Bull.

349
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,457
So, who won the coin toss?

350
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,830
Phipps. He went
with Hasty Matilda.

351
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,629
Of course he did.

352
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:54,231
Call me when she's ready
to drop her foal.

353
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,219
Pigs. Pigs. They're all such pigs.

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,840
We've been putting on this
Protest Pageant for a year.

355
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:13,335
Now the teacher says it's too
political and we can't put it on.

356
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:15,122
What do you mean you can't?

357
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,526
They have a rule that theatre
projects can't be political.

358
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,105
When the teacher saw what we were

359
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,929
doing... Dad, can
we, like, sue them?

360
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,280
If you didn't disclose
until today, they

361
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:25,425
couldn't be held
liable for a breach.

362
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,867
What?

363
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,376
Honey, listen. If this is really
important to you, you won't...

364
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,241
- Tweedy residence.
- Is Miss Chenery there?

365
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,190
Can we talk about this some more?

366
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,191
Yeah. Ok. Fine.

367
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:39,707
Penny. For Miss Chenery.

368
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,613
- This is Penny.
- This is Eddie.

369
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,421
Something Royal is about
to drop her foal.

370
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,724
- All right. Thank you.
- Bye, Miss Chenery.

371
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,339
Something Royal's
foal is on its way.

372
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:15,782
Kick hard. Come on. Kick,
Chris. Come on. Good job.

373
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,978
Hey, John. How would
you like to come

374
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,557
with me and see a
horse being born?

375
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,919
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,154
Ok.

377
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,430
How many times has she done this?

378
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,273
She did it 13 times.

379
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,538
You've done it four.

380
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,545
Yes.

381
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,635
It's a boy. It's a boy.

382
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:20,576
- Have you ever seen that?
- No. Not me.

383
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,348
- What?
- A colt stand up that fast.

384
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,084
Hey, Daddy. I brought
you some company.

385
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,857
This is the Bold
Ruler colt, Daddy.

386
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,736
We call him Big Red.

387
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,124
Let him run his race, darling.

388
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:55,612
Flight 226 to Denver is ready
for boarding. Gate 33-D.

389
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,460
- Almost done.
- I know this is hard for you.

390
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,164
How long do you think you can
keep living two lives at once?

391
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,307
The yearlings are looking
good, especially the red one.

392
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,436
We've cut expenses.

393
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,914
We're breaking even.

394
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,146
I thought the point was to sell
the farm, not to break even.

395
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:42,883
When I went off to college,
I felt like that colt.

396
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,792
Full of promise.

397
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,560
Full of adventure, like I could...

398
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,495
make something work.

399
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
I gave up a career to
have our family, and...

400
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,576
this colt is part
of our family now.

401
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,270
I just want to see him run.

402
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,612
So after two years of
juggling all this...

403
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:11,579
it isn't ending, it's
just... beginning?

404
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,580
How's he feel, Jimmy?

405
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,310
Just a big kid having
fun out there.

406
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,475
He'll figure it out. Huh, Red?

407
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,577
That's good. That's good.

408
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,081
Now, listen, don't try to
change his natural gait, ok?

409
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,787
Don't force him.

410
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,698
Well, Mr Laurin,
what do you think?

411
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:02,831
I think he's 1100
pounds of baby fat.

412
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,535
He eats too much and too often.

413
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:06,346
The only reason he
doesn't eat more

414
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,067
is because he's too busy sleeping.

415
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:13,072
He only does what he wants to do
exactly when he wants to do it.

416
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,218
He lays against the back
of that starting gate

417
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,224
like he's in a hammock
in the Caribbean.

418
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,028
And when he finally does
get out of the gate,

419
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,826
it takes him forever
to find his stride.

420
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,195
Any other questions?

421
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,465
I have one. How much did
you spend on that hat?

422
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,337
Right now this horse
is all sleep and eat.

423
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,502
But he's got fire inside
him. Ain't that right, Red?

424
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,480
That horse couldn't beat a
fat man encased in cement

425
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:46,210
being drugged backwards
by a freight train.

426
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,775
Well, you should know, Mr Laurin.

427
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,219
You thought that was
funny. I did, too.

428
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,020
I wish we could just race
him under his name. Red.

429
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,818
The Jockey Club insists
on unique names.

430
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,194
I keep sending them, they
keep rejecting them.

431
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,200
I've tried Something Special,
Royal Line, DEO Volente...

432
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,667
DEO Volente. God willing.

433
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,466
God may have been willing,
but The Jockey Club wasn't.

434
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:12,807
Well, there is a race up in
Aqueduct in a couple weeks.

435
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,931
I think we should
send him out. It's

436
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:16,905
time. Not that I'm expecting much.

437
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,013
Let's enter him, then.

438
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,675
DEO Volente.

439
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,415
- Well, that was really good.
- Can we be excused?

440
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,581
Sure.

441
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,925
- Please bring in the dessert.
- Ok, Mum.

442
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,425
It's good you're home.

443
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,930
Your daughters have something
they want to talk to you about.

444
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,229
Oh? What's that?

445
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,010
Kate and I were
thinking of going to

446
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,030
Chile. Just for a
couple of months.

447
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,132
Chile? What for?

448
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,471
Teach English and learn Spanish.
It's part of a cultural mission.

449
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,871
A mission to stir
up trouble and act

450
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:55,418
cool, you mean? Chile
is socialist now.

451
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,647
- Thank you.
- Go play.

452
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,917
It is not. And that's
not why we're going.

453
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,666
Although if an
opportunity to protest

454
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,016
the war did present itself...

455
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,458
See? This is what you're missing.

456
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,224
Your teenage daughters are
growing up to become rebels.

457
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,731
No, more like hippies.
Free spirits.

458
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,359
Hippies are running from
paying the price of freedom.

459
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,392
If there's a price, how
is it freedom, Dad?

460
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,631
I'll answer that question
when you become an adult.

461
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,663
Would anyone like some pie?

462
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:19,036
- No, thanks.
- No, thank you.

463
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:20,705
Well...

464
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,748
When do you have to
give an answer by?

465
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,183
There's a meeting for the
parents on the fifth.

466
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,584
The day after my Protest Pageant.

467
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,480
Your play? You're doing your play?

468
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:38,086
Yeah. I present it as a civic
arts summer programme, so...

469
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,691
Oh, Kate, after two years,
you're finally going to do it.

470
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,064
Both of you can make it, right?

471
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,398
The new colt runs his
first race on the fourth.

472
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,779
That's in New York. I will
be on the first plane home.

473
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,180
- Ok.
- Oh, by the way, Miss Ham called.

474
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,515
Something about a
name for the horse.

475
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,819
Rounding out the field
in the fourth race.

476
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:10,884
Secretariat.

477
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,628
Right up through there,
that one's ours.

478
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:21,400
Let's take off this stupid...
Paul. Where's Paul? Paul.

479
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,669
- Here. Right here.
- Listen.

480
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,628
Quit sneaking around.
Got it? Listen.

481
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:26,629
Yes.

482
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,040
Watch out for number
six. He's got the speed.

483
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,277
Also, watch out for number
three, who's going to hold back

484
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,945
with five and eight along with
him. And watch out for number one.

485
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,717
That's the best horse in the
field. Watch out for him.

486
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,236
- All right.
- Where do you want this?

487
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:42,633
Are there any horses he doesn't
need to be watching out for?

488
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:43,927
Did I say number four?

489
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,792
We're four.

490
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,559
- What?
- We're four.

491
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,432
Oh, yeah. Right. Well, definitely
watch out for number four.

492
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:08,441
- Jockey's mighty young.
- He is mighty young.

493
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,283
He's good enough. He'll do.

494
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,916
You don't like my hat? Why?

495
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,185
Do you like my hat?

496
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,733
- Your hat?
- Yeah.

497
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,396
I... Well... it's...

498
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,732
I do. I like the hat.

499
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:35,144
Sorry. I do, I do, I
like the hat. Help me.

500
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,945
Of course I do. I
like it very much.

501
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,280
Sorry.

502
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,989
- Oh.
- What's wrong?

503
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,687
I just realised that's the
first time I've laughed,

504
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,893
I've really laughed, in a...
Since I don't remember when.

505
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,864
She scares me.

506
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,874
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the fourth race at Aqueduct,

507
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,961
maiden trip for
two-year-old, among

508
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:13,680
them, Secretariat by Bold Ruler.

509
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,482
Secretariat leaning against
the back of the gate.

510
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,751
And they're off.

511
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,323
It wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

512
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,159
You said he was ready to race.

513
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,463
He was ready to race. He just
wasn't ready to play bumper cars.

514
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,265
Fourth? And he runs like he's
afraid? I expect more than that.

515
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,329
So do I. What were you doing?

516
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,861
He got hit coming out of the gate.

517
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:37,862
We saw he got hit.

518
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:39,984
You got him mugged
at the gate, mugged

519
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:42,111
in the pack, and
mugged on the rail.

520
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,080
- You're off him.
- We need to talk about this.

521
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,913
Don't start with me.
You are off him.

522
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,315
Go on home. Just go on.

523
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,614
And you stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

524
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:53,975
Excuse me? What are you saying?

525
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:55,454
The horse should never have lost.

526
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:58,523
Are you sure that it was
Paul's fault, then?

527
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,763
Say that in English.

528
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:17,070
No. It was my fault.

529
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,539
He doesn't have enough
experience. This

530
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,716
horse needs a jock
with more experience.

531
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,350
Well, I know this.

532
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,326
If his jockey won't back off, Red
won't back off. From anything.

533
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,108
You want a jockey who won't back

534
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,127
off, then you want
Ronnie Turcotte.

535
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,925
I want to meet with him.
When I'm back in two weeks.

536
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,245
One more thing. I'm
new to this, and you

537
00:35:42,246 --> 00:35:44,330
know a lot more
about it than I do.

538
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,468
But don't ever say this
is none of my business.

539
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,173
Every bit of this is my
business. Do you understand?

540
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,507
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,923
I called to check on your flight.

542
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,649
They cancelled it due to weather.

543
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,650
Oh, no.

544
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:15,469

- Hey.
- Get out of the street.

570
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,123
I'm trying to get
across the street.

571
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,962
Move out of the way. Use
crutches on the sidewalk.

572
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,592
Idiot.

573
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,150
- Miss Chenery?
- Mr Turcotte. Oh, I'm so sorry.

574
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,484
Well, Lucien and I
were so hoping that

575
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:16,249
you'd be able to ride
in our next race.

576
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,318
I'll be ready. Why wouldn't I be?

577
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,197
I spoke with some of the
owners you ride for.

578
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,100
They say you're one of the
best. You got a great touch.

579
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,733
You're great with young horses.

580
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:35,973
They also say that you
can be over-aggressive.

581
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,904
Use bad judgement.
Put a horse into

582
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,847
too much traffic
where he can't run.

583
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,475
Then why did you come to me?

584
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:46,446
I hear you have the heart of a
champion. I know my horse does.

585
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,975
I read here that
the last horse you

586
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:55,627
were on ran so hard
his heart burst?

587
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,896
- I'm sorry?
- Lucien told the truth.

588
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,431
- What did Lucien say?
- That you're hard as nails.

589
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,877
Miss Chenery, I risk my life
every time I climb on a horse.

590
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:11,005
I'm not afraid. Neither are they.

591
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,516
I want to win, just like they do.

592
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,850
It's true. The last horse I rode
ran so hard his heart burst.

593
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,823
But it's who they are.
And it's who I am.

594
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,326
You want somebody else,
get somebody else.

595
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,351
I don't want somebody else.

596
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,354
I want you.

597
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,973
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

598
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,650
So which of you ladies
owns Secretary?

599
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,050
His name is Secretariat.

600
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,459
And he's going to make
your horse take dictation.

601
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,523
You don't know which
horses we own.

602
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,067
Doesn't matter. Mine's the big red

603
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:09,705
one. And he's going
to beat them all.

604
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,373
Big red one.

605
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,981
- I see him.
- Yup.

606
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,846
It's a beautiful day
at Saratoga Park.

607
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,887
- Close them up.
- We're ready for our six-furlong,

608
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:28,774
single-turn sprint
for two-year-old.

609
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,987
Conditions are perfect. The
track is rated very fast.

610
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,124
And they're off.

611
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,902
The field is spreading out.
Russ Miron out quickly.

612
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,071
Come on, Ronnie, make your move.

613
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,846
He's got nowhere
to move. I thought

614
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,918
you said Turcotte was aggressive.

615
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,683
Ok, Red. Let's go get them.

616
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:08,455
Secretariat. Secretariat
making a bold move.

617
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,268
Secretariat surging,
knocking Blackthorn

618
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,462
and Fat Frank aside
with brute force.

619
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,739
That's it, Red. We got them.

620
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:22,141
He's overtaking the field,
passing Joe Iz, Tropic Action,

621
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,646
now approaching Blackthorn.

622
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,673
A spectacular event. Secretariat
is catching up to Russ Miron.

623
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,209
- Fore.
- Russ Miron on the inside.

624
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,815
Secretariat on the outside, now
getting the lead by a head.

625
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,784
Secretariat pulling away.

626
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,819
It's Secretariat.
Secretariat and Russ Miron.

627
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,764
Secretariat taking the lead
as they come to the wire.

628
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,134
It's Secretariat with an
impressive victory by two lengths.

629
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,343
Oh.

630
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,876
Thank you.

631
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:07,653
- Looks like you finished last.
- I was there long enough.

632
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,319
Oh.

633
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,266
Is it just me, or is
that horse posing?

634
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,026
You and I both know that horse...

635
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,104
Owner hates the attention,
but the horse loves it.

636
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,282
Secretariat wins by three lengths.

637
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,186
Secretariat by five lengths.

638
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,964
Secretariat by eight.

639
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,864
Secretariat wins.

640
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,707
- Secretariat.
- Secretariat.

641
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,140
Secretariat.

642
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,997
Seven wins in four months.

643
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,090
There's talk he could
be Horse of the Year.

644
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,961
But most of the sons of Bold Ruler

645
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,269
couldn't handle the
distances 3-year-old runs.

646
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,067
And they've all failed as
Triple Crown contenders.

647
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:10,545
So what can you tell
us about Secretariat?

648
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:14,277
He loves to run. Loves it.

649
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,245
Likes to come from behind.

650
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,546
Nerve-racking for me,
but his fans love it.

651
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,122
And he's a ham.

652
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,895
He likes to show off, doesn't he?

653
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,595
You really think he
knows what he's doing?

654
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,087
Don't look at me.
Beyer's the one that

655
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:33,959
said you can't run long distances.

656
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,632
You do acknowledge
the issue, right?

657
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,335
That speed and endurance
don't necessarily go...

658
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,241
Oh.

659
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,144
No way.

660
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,307
Hey, Thelma. Bring more hamburger.

661
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:49,744
These little guys
eat like elephants.

662
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,214
You are doing a great
job with him, Lucien.

663
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:59,194
Let me ask you something.
Why did you choose me?

664
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,220
I know Bull recommended me.

665
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:04,028
But you had to know, you do your
homework, that there were other

666
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:07,036
more successful trainers
you could've gotten.

667
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,131
The truth? I was hungry.
And so were you.

668
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:15,799
I heard that you
carried the clippings

669
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,173
from the big races that you lost.

670
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,743
So that's why you didn't try
very hard to convince me.

671
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:27,546
I knew you couldn't stay retired,
after I saw your golf swing.

672
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,719
Hey. Secretariat.
Horse of the Year.

673
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,430
Fantastic.

674
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,864
Ronnie.

675
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,136
- Arnold Palmers for everyone.
- Oh, big spender.

676
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,408
Congratulations.

677
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,277
- Great riding, Ronnie.
- Good job.

678
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,814
- Look at this.
- Hey, Ronnie.

679
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:58,320
- Good job, man.
- Thank you, man.

680
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,625
To the greatest horse I ever rode.

681
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,925
And to its owner, who took
on the old boys and won.

682
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,794
But now that you've
gotten their attention,

683
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,164
you're going to have to take
them on in earnest next year.

684
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,795
- The races are longer.
- Much longer.

685
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,032
- The horses are faster.
- Much faster.

686
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,633
And every owner, every trainer,
every jockey out there

687
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,939
is going to be trying
to bring us down.

688
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:25,044
- I'll be ready.
- Salut.

689
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,219
Horse of the Year. We
have to celebrate.

690
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,858
Is this the article that's going
to be running across the country?

691
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,893
Did you hear?

692
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,759
It's your daddy, honey.

693
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,162
He's had a stroke.

694
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,794
Let's just go.

695
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,706
I don't think there's much
left unsaid between us, Daddy.

696
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,717
I always knew where you stood.

697
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,120
And I'm grateful... so grateful,

698
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,755
for the way you showed me

699
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,197
what it was to stand
up in the world and...

700
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,792
live the way you believe.

701
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:33,681
The big red colt won Horse
of the Year, Daddy.

702
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:37,980
I think he can go all the way.

703
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,620
And if he does...

704
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,985
I hope...

705
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,193
I hope...

706
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,929
I hope you could see it.

707
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:30,198
Jack, what are you doing here?
How did you get here so fast?

708
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,673
I'm so sorry about your father.

709
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,341
I was already on my way.

710
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,204
Already? Are the
children all right?

711
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,706
They're fine. I left Denver
before I heard the news.

712
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,087
Hollis had asked me to
study the tax issues

713
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,419
that would arise upon
your father's death.

714
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:51,723
Issues that now find
us totally unprepared.

715
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:55,026
So you've asked my husband
to become your ally in this?

716
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,896
It's family business.

717
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,652
And, last time I
checked, Jack and your

718
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:02,370
children were still
part of this family.

719
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,034
Hollis, you're my
brother and I love you,

720
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,874
but if you presume to judge my
fitness as a wife or mother

721
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,005
I will count you a stranger
for the rest of my life.

722
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,072
Penny, Hollis is only
trying to talk sense.

723
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,710
We need to regain
some perspective.

724
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,721
- Regain?
- Penny, it's just...

725
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,155
Let's not talk about
this right now.

726
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:27,228
No. No, no, no. She
needs to hear this.

727
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,788
She needs to hear what?

728
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,357
At the current value
of his estate,

729
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,962
the inheritance tax will be
at least six million dollars.

730
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,304
And neither of us has a
fraction of that money.

731
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,338
So we sell the mares
and the yearlings.

732
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:47,316
I had an appraisal done, and that
won't get us half of what we need.

733
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,410
But there is another option.

734
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,611
I'm not selling him.

735
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,147
Due to his outstanding
two-year-old season,

736
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:57,702
if he were sold today,
Secretariat would

737
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,151
bring a price of seven
million dollars.

738
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:02,630
But if he were to lose just
one of the Triple Crown races

739
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,794
that value would drop to three
million with no way to recover it.

740
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:07,666
So we sell Secretariat.

741
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,934
- You try and sell him and...
- We're out of time.

742
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,238
If we don't play this right,
it could amount to nothing.

743
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,744
Our father came from nothing.

744
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,441
And his legacy to me isn't money.

745
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:22,679
It's the will to win. If you can.
And live with it if you can't.

746
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,554
If I have to challenge you
in court on this, I will.

747
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,896
Miss Ham? Would you come
in here a moment, please?

748
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,700
Thank you, Miss Ham.

749
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,843
Would you tell Jack
and Hollis about

750
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:46,004
the document that
Daddy left for you.

751
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,800
Five years ago Mr Chenery had me

752
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:55,181
witness him signing
a provision that,

753
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,486
while both of you
are beneficiaries,

754
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,888
dispersal of the farm
would be left to Hollis.

755
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,519
Decisions regarding the horses
would be left to Penny.

756
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,899
We could argue he
already had dementia.

757
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,336
He was of sound mind
when he signed it.

758
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,331
I'd swear to it... in court.

759
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:22,968
Thank you, Miss Ham.

760
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,347
Great. I teach
economics at Harvard,

761
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,549
and I don't know a way to
conjure up six million dollars

762
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,888
before you race him again.
What makes you think you can?

763
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:41,327
I'll find a way. And if I
can't, I'll live with it.

764
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,460
Why? Why do you need
to live with it?

765
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:50,963
Make me, the whole family, live
with it for a past that is gone.

766
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:55,839
Our father was a great man,
but we can't bring him back.

767
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,744
This isn't about going back.

768
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,808
This is about life being ahead
of you and you run at it.

769
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:05,343
Because you never know how far
you can go unless you run.

770
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,253
That's great.

771
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,962
But if you stumble and fall,

772
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:18,022
you don't just make us
fools, you make us beggars.

773
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,175
When your horse people call the

774
00:52:23,176 --> 00:52:24,772
house, they don't
ask for Mrs Tweedy,

775
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,833
they ask for Miss Chenery.

776
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:30,505
- Is that who you've become?
- Jack...

777
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:36,347
Miss Chenery and Mrs Tweedy have
always been the same person.

778
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,512
I'm wondering how it is that Mr

779
00:52:38,513 --> 00:52:41,050
Tweedy could take
sides against me.

780
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:59,437
Trying to muscle me into
something. Can't do that.

781
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,172
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hi, ma'am.

782
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,216
How are you, Big Red?

783
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,881
- How's it going?
- Ma'am...

784
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,220
I reckon you heard about
Bull Hancock, ma'am?

785
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,856
No.

786
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,896
Well...

787
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,023
After your daddy's
funeral, they say

788
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:29,571
he went home and just fell dead.

789
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:35,177
Oh.

790
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,411
I don't know about the
ways of God, ma'am,

791
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:47,287
but... I know your daddy and
Mr Bull lifted each other up.

792
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:51,259
The way you lift me up and
the way you lift up Red.

793
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,285
Everything living
lives from its heart,

794
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:56,264
and I wish I can give you
something to lift yours up.

795
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,068
Well, thank you,
Eddie. You just did.

796
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,673
What does he see?

797
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:19,348
When he looks at me, I feel
like he looks right into me.

798
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:24,659
He sees what matters to him,
ma'am. What's immediate.

799
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:28,990
The clouds and stuff, they
don't mean nothing to a horse.

800
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,968
Lights, sounds,
flashes... intentions.

801
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:35,630
That's what a horse notices.

802
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,072
Especially one as smart
as Big Red here.

803
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,775
And they can tell when the horse
next to them or behind them

804
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:45,508
wants to be first to
the food. Or the mare.

805
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,675
Or the finish line.

806
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:51,278
That's what matters to them.

807
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,585
Ain't that right?

808
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:05,267
It's never been done. But that
doesn't mean it won't work.

809
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:10,136
We offer 32 shareholders
exclusive breeding rights.

810
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,138
We call it a select opportunity.

811
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:16,677
Father would've loved that
phrase. How much per?

812
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,237
190,000.

813
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,109
A hundred and ninety?

814
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,668
That's more than
anybody's ever paid

815
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:29,351
for a breeding share. Lot more.

816
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,373
That's what makes
it exciting, Seth.

817
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:34,528
Horse racing's all
about excitement.

818
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:40,349
He's been a great colt, but he's

819
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,803
completely untried
as a three-year-old.

820
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,176
And the sons of
Bold Ruler, they're

821
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:47,304
long on speed, but
short on stamina.

822
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,938
Yeah, and his mother
was old when she

823
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:50,574
had him and Ogden
Phipps knew all that

824
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,604
when he could have chosen my colt.

825
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,107
But he didn't. And now
I've got Secretariat.

826
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,019
And he's got a horse named
Missed Opportunity.

827
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,421
Daddy used to always say
that rich people are rich

828
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:03,357
because they're smart
with their money.

829
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,827
And they're going to insist
on a performance clause.

830
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,598
No son of Bold Ruler has ever
won a single Triple Crown race.

831
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,965
That's a mile-and-a-half distance

832
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,867
that Secretariat's never
come close to running.

833
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,396
You're going to lose the farm
and the horse, everything.

834
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:24,511
This is a big deal. I have never
done anything like this before.

835
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,242
Nobody has.

836
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,995
You mind if I ask
why you called me?

837
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:31,996
Well...

838
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,284
Your father, he really
helped me and...

839
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,254
and work is good for grief.

840
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,422
I'm in.

841
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,438
Howard Keck on line one,
Bunker Hunt on line two.

842
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,202
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

843
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,842
- Mr Hunt? Penny Chenery.
- Mr Keck, Seth Hancock.

844
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,346
I was calling about a select
opportunity on Secretariat.

845
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,215
No, sir, he's not for sale.

846
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:06,415
No, we are moving to syndicate
his breeding rights.

847
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,720
It's a select opportunity.
We have 32 shares...

848
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,522
Yes, sir. It's a
great opportunity.

849
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,621
I will head that way. I'll see you
in a bit. All right, bye-bye.

850
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,030
Look, Seth, I've been a part
of lots of these deals,

851
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,593
but I've never been asked to pay
190 grand for a breeding share.

852
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:22,103
Nobody has.

853
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,797
Tell Mr Chenery's little girl
that she's priced this colt

854
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,876
like he's already won
the Triple Crown.

855
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,493
I'm calling on behalf
of Penny Chenery.

856
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:33,075
We will call him back
later. Thank you.

857
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:37,152
Dr Todd, please.
It's Elizabeth Ham.

858
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:39,814
No disrespect, sir, but
if he gets any better,

859
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,376
you're going to want
to be in on this.

860
00:57:41,396 --> 00:57:43,202
All due respect,
but I got a pretty

861
00:57:43,203 --> 00:57:44,958
good handle on where I want to be.

862
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,275
You could have her give me a
call me later this afternoon.

863
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:48,774
Yes, Mr Cleaver,
it's lots of money.

864
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:49,956
But my father used to tell me

865
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:51,429
you got to spend money to make it.

866
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:53,107
I'll put some thought
into it, all righty.

867
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:54,127
Thank you, sir.

868
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,302
Jock Whitney's a no. And
Mr Mellon's on line two.

869
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,305
Mr Mellon, thank you for
getting back to me.

870
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:09,110
Of course, I
understand, Mr Mellon.

871
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:15,049
I'll hold a share for you in
case you reconsider. Thank you.

872
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:35,993
Have you ever seen that?

873
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:39,729
No, not me. That boy a whopper.

874
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:58,777
I don't care how many
times they say no.

875
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,575
I don't care how
many times they tell

876
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,955
us we can't do it. I
am not giving up.

877
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,862
I will not live the rest
of my life in regret.

878
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,493
We are going to see
that horse run and win.

879
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:18,939
And we are going to live
rejoicing. Every day.

880
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,207
Amen.

881
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,336
Ronnie. Going to have some lunch?

882
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:43,337
Mrs Tweedy.

883
01:01:43,338 --> 01:01:44,786
Yes, ma'am. Just
getting a bite to eat

884
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:46,385
before I go to the
ring. What about you?

885
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,269
I'm meeting somebody.
Hello, Mr Phipps,

886
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,305
- Thank you for coming.
- Miss Tweedy. My pleasure.

887
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:53,107
You know Ronnie
Turcotte, my rider?

888
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,108
Ronnie.

889
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:55,540
So, they call you Tiny?

890
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,777
- What?
- Mr Phipps...

891
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,254
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

892
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:09,957
Are we ready yet?

893
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,823
We're still thinking about it.

894
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,861
If I smell the air
correctly, Mrs Tweedy,

895
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,525
you're about to ask me
to spend a small fortune

896
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,137
to buy a share in a horse I
could've owned for nothing.

897
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,101
That's true, I am.

898
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,541
Nobody's buying yet, are they?

899
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:31,103
That's right. They need
someone to lead them.

900
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:36,184
You know that horse I chose
the day we flipped the coin?

901
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:39,085
She's the prettiest, best-tempered
horse in my whole stable.

902
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,257
And she couldn't
outrun my accountants.

903
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:45,850
So now you've got the Horse of
the Year, and I look foolish.

904
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,561
It's not foolish to be
unlucky, Mr Phipps.

905
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:53,098
Most men, if they had chosen
wrong and lost this horse

906
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:54,524
wouldn't think of investing in him

907
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:56,036
again, but you're
bigger than that.

908
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,131
And if you do invest in him

909
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,143
instead of being the man who
lost Secretariat in the past,

910
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,131
you'll be the one
who had the vision

911
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:04,874
to lead investors in his future.

912
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,894
His future is uncertain.
And I don't buy

913
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:10,511
shares in untested three-year-old.

914
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,420
But my accountants,

915
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,550
they may be slow afoot, but
they are quick to calculate

916
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,117
and they tell me that
you're in a rough spot.

917
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:21,925
So I'll buy that horse
of yours right now.

918
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,592
Seven million dollars. All cash.

919
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:30,897
I can't do that.

920
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,594
If he does what I
think he'll do, his

921
01:03:33,595 --> 01:03:35,968
value will double, if not triple.

922
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,077
You do know what you're saying.

923
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,645
You're guaranteeing
that this horse

924
01:03:43,646 --> 01:03:45,087
is going to win the Triple Crown.

925
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,318
The Derby, the Preakness
and the Belmont.

926
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:52,020
Three races, three states
in just five weeks.

927
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,130
Hasn't been done in 25 years.

928
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,327
There are a lot of good horsemen
think it can't be done any more.

929
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:01,601
Just understand, this
is what you're saying.

930
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,696
That is exactly what I'm saying.

931
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,443
Eight million.

932
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,710
No.

933
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,087
You're that stubborn?

934
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:22,318
I'm that right.

935
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,257
Have we made up our mind yet?

936
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:29,655
Yes, I think we have.

937
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,946
All this talk about
Secretariat. He

938
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:49,915
hasn't faced a horse
as good as Sham.

939
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,568
My horse is faster
and stronger. We're

940
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,183
not waiting for the
Derby to prove it.

941
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,122
We're going to the Wood Memorial.

942
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,388
And when Secretariat has to run
as far as my horse did today

943
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,691
he's going to fade
like the sunset.

944
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:03,425
- I guarantee it.
- He is ridiculous.

945
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,169
Well, Seth, what do
you make of that?

946
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,735
I think that fellow is going to
make Lucien say things in French

947
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,207
my mama would spank him for.

948
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:17,178
This guy will not shut his face.

949
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:22,207
Lucien Laurin cannot
train a winning horse.

950
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:27,086
Ok, so he's saying that I'm
incompetent. He never shuts up.

951
01:05:27,122 --> 01:05:31,115
This guy, he couldn't
train a flea to jump.

952
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,460
He couldn't train a monkey
to pick at his own butt.

953
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:38,330
- Step out here with me.
- He could not train...

954
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,336
The guy couldn't train
his own bowel movements.

955
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,703
The Wood is in New York. You're
going to need a new dress.

956
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:50,411
They say, Secretariat's owner
is striking and charismatic.

957
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,541
- Penny Tweedy.
- I saw the paper.

958
01:05:55,584 --> 01:06:01,523
- Yes. Didn't Seth do a great job?
- I'd like to say congratulations,

959
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:06,061
but I am a lawyer, and I know
what performance guarantees mean.

960
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:10,532
Jack, I don't know how to earn a
reward without taking a risk.

961
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:15,463
Is it really true Ogden Phipps
offered you eight million dollars?

962
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:20,334
It's true. He wouldn't
have made that offer

963
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,038
unless he thought Secretariat
would be worth twice that.

964
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,711
The richest man in the world can
take a risk like that, Penny.

965
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,510
- But I can't.
- You?

966
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,019
I just mean, do what you
want with your money.

967
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:36,252
But I can't spend my money
on a risk like that.

968
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:41,393
Don't worry. I understand.
Not a cent of your money.

969
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,263
I didn't mean it like
that. I just meant...

970
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,530
I understood how you
meant it, Jack.

971
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:49,269
Let's talk later.

972
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,636
There are words of wisdom
that have sustained me

973
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,808
throughout my darkest times.

974
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,545
If you don't mind, I'd like
to share them with you.

975
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:05,348
I'm all ears, Miss Ham.

976
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:09,255
Good evening, K-mart shoppers.

977
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,553
Fifteen minutes to
post. Fifteen minutes.

978
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,695
There he is.

979
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,830
Edward, it's big enough
for a Clydesdale.

980
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:25,968
It ain't big enough for Red. Maybe

981
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:28,434
he's still hiding fat
from the winter.

982
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:33,175
Does he look fat to you?

983
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,644
What are you doing?

984
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,481
The same thing I've done with
every belt I ever owned.

985
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,664
Come on, Red.

986
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,641
Miss Penny, look this way, please.

987
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,710
You ok, Miss Ham?

988
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,294
I hate what she's
having to go through,

989
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,342
and there's so little
I can do to help.

990
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,149
Someday I'd like to be
able to do for that horse

991
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:14,212
half of what you do for its owner.

992
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:20,890
Lucien, those are the grandest
words anyone's ever said to me.

993
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,631
- Lucien.
- Mr Phipps. How are you?

994
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,205
- Good morning.
- Best to you.

995
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,475
- Good luck today.
- Thank you.

996
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,447
The horses now being loaded in
for the big race of the day,

997
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:42,006
the match-up between
Secretariat and Sham.

998
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,847
You're going to eat
dirt today, Ronnie.

999
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,651
The final test before the
campaign for the Triple Crown,

1000
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,791
the first test of
whether the big horse

1001
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:52,786
from Virginia can
cover the distance.

1002
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:56,320
Time to see who's
got the real horse.

1003
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,265
The horses are in the gate.

1004
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:04,271
Secretariat a bit uneasy, but that
seems characteristic for him.

1005
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:11,537
- And they're off.
- Yeah, he goes right to the back.

1006
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,676
Horses breaking nicely. Angle
Light moving from the outside.

1007
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,549
Secretariat settling in
at the rear of the pack.

1008
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,847
- Ok. It's ok.
- Come on, Ronnie.

1009
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:25,382
Heading toward the rail.
Step Nicely in second.

1010
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,725
Sham in good position
running in third.

1011
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,256
Secretariat seems to be labouring.

1012
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:36,103
- Go, Red.
- He always does this. It's ok.

1013
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,487
Angle Light holds
the lead into the

1014
01:09:38,488 --> 01:09:40,575
turn. Sham in perfect position.

1015
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,338
Sham moves up. Secretariat
pressing forward.

1016
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:46,973
- Come on, Red.
- Go. Go.

1017
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:51,680
Come on, Red. Come on.

1018
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:57,887
Pincay's waiting for
Turcotte to move.

1019
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:05,656
Now, Red, now.

1020
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:15,941
Whoo.

1021
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,468
Come on.

1022
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,557
Angle Light and Sham
driving for home.

1023
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:29,354
Secretariat starting to challenge.

1024
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,757
They straighten away
in the stretch.

1025
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,125
Angle Light holding
on to the lead now.

1026
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:36,824
Sham second, far outside
is Secretariat.

1027
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:40,229
Coming on the 16th pole,
Angle Light in front

1028
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,829
by a length and a
quarter. Sham is second.

1029
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,032
- God.
- What's he doing?

1030
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:47,439
Angle Light in front.
Sham on the outside.

1031
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:50,912
Sham and Angle Light driving to
the wire. Secretariat fading.

1032
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:53,744
- No.
- Go. Go.

1033
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:57,513
It's Angle Light and Sham. Angle
Light and Sham at the wire.

1034
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,818
Secretariat a stunning
and distant third.

1035
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:04,724
All right, Sham. Way to go.

1036
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:13,177
You know I speak for
everyone. One loss

1037
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:15,467
can happen. Two is
non-performance.

1038
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:19,201
- I understand.
- I'm sure you do.

1039
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:22,699
Another son of Bold Ruler,
all speed and no distance.

1040
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:27,442
Magnificent. Magnificent.

1041
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:29,881
Next time we'll bury
him even worse.

1042
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:34,719
You cost me ten grand,
Turcotte. Hey, loser.

1043
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,954
Who are you calling a loser?
Think you can do any better?

1044
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,655
- Eddie.
- Ronnie. Ronnie.

1045
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,696
What was that?

1046
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,460
He didn't fire. He
didn't sound right.

1047
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,295
- What do you mean?
- In his other races

1048
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:49,168
- he sounded like a freight train.
- Come with me. Just go inside.

1049
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,736
Sit.

1050
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,535
We just lost a race that we
could not afford to lose.

1051
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,910
We finished third. Third.
In front of Ogden Phipps.

1052
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,369
I've got a slew of other investors

1053
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,041
here. What am I
supposed to tell them?

1054
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:06,877
Just tell them the truth.
The horse had a bad day.

1055
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,585
The horse? We're
blaming the horse now?

1056
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,580
And you? How could
you hold him back

1057
01:12:13,581 --> 01:12:15,427
that long? What were you thinking?

1058
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:18,297
I didn't hold him back. I rode
him the same way I always do.

1059
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,961
The only reason Sham didn't
beat us worse is because

1060
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,798
his jockey couldn't
believe what was

1061
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,495
happening. He was waiting for you.

1062
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,479
The only reason I
don't fire you both

1063
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,941
is we're leaving for
Kentucky tomorrow.

1064
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,673
Do what you think is right, ma'am.

1065
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:35,482
It's not Ronnie's fault. He
had him where he should be.

1066
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,312
Well, if it's not the
horse and it's not Ronnie

1067
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,412
then you had better figure
out what happened today

1068
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,423
and you had better fix it.

1069
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:44,779
Because if that is
the best he can do

1070
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,917
at this distance, we are finished.

1071
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,512
- Has he eaten anything?
- Nothing.

1072
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:41,812
And this a horse that's never
missed a meal in his life.

1073
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,717
How much oats you
usually give him?

1074
01:13:44,718 --> 01:13:45,718
Sixteen quarts.

1075
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:48,452
- Twenty-five pounds of hay.
- A day?

1076
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,122
That's more than a couple of
pregnant mares would put away.

1077
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:54,651
Yeah, well...

1078
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,931
ok, now. Easy. I'm not
going to hurt you.

1079
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:01,561
I don't think he the one
going to get hurt, Doc.

1080
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,135
Settle down.

1081
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:06,106
Lucien, you want to
give me a hand here?

1082
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,803
- No, thanks.
- You scared of him?

1083
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:11,249
This horse has been
waiting two years

1084
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,781
for me to put a hand
next to his mouth.

1085
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:15,146
I'm not going to do that.

1086
01:14:15,183 --> 01:14:17,947
Ooh.

1087
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,515
I think I got your
problem here, Lucien.

1088
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,483
He's got an abscess.

1089
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,808
Hello?

1090
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:52,342
I'm calling for Kate Tweedy,
please? It's her mother.

1091
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,753
Kate. Your mother's on the phone.

1092
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:58,449
Mum.

1093
01:14:59,427 --> 01:15:04,126
Oh, I just wanted
to see how you're doing.

1094
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,864
Hey, I'm kind of busy right now.
We're getting ready for a march.

1095
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:14,035
Mum? Are you ok with that?

1096
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,807
Oh...

1097
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,412
Kate...

1098
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:21,108
our political beliefs can change,

1099
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,180
but our need to do what
we believe is right...

1100
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:27,751
that doesn't.

1101
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,786
I'm proud of you.

1102
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,955
Thanks, Mum. Hey, I got
to go. Can we talk later?

1103
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:36,520
Sure.

1104
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,901
- Are you all right?
- Sure. Yeah, we'll talk later.

1105
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,167
Ok. Bye.

1106
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:03,716
Doc found a big
abscess in Red's lip.

1107
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:05,749
It probably hurt him all
the way around the track.

1108
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,490
Ain't nobody seen it
because Red won't

1109
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:09,230
soften up his mouth
for nobody but you.

1110
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,491
- Oh... Lucien...
- Forget it.

1111
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,593
Let's get him ready for the Derby.

1112
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:37,849
Ronnie.

1113
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,727
I am so sorry.

1114
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:48,065
I didn't know what happened
before. Apparently...

1115
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:57,444
In preparation for

1116
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:00,445
the 99th running of
the Kentucky Derby,

1117
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,315
please welcome Secretariat.

1118
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:05,444
We love you, Big Red.

1119
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,566
Story's over here.

1120
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:08,615
Do you think Secretariat is ready?

1121
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:09,681
We're very excited.

1122
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:11,445
Is Secretariat ready
for this race?

1123
01:17:11,446 --> 01:17:12,446
Yes, indeed.

1124
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,367
Listen, we'll take
care of the horse,

1125
01:17:16,368 --> 01:17:18,223
you take care of the reporters.

1126
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,130
I don't know what to say.

1127
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:23,103
You're as big a story
as the horse, ok.

1128
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,163
If you want him fit,
you take care of them.

1129
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,974
- Welcome to the Derby.
- Thank you.

1130
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,478
So that's Pancho over
there with Sham, right?

1131
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,811
Sure is.

1132
01:17:33,848 --> 01:17:37,306
Can't wait till you win this
Derby, so we can go home.

1133
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:01,566
I keep hearing rumours.

1134
01:18:01,609 --> 01:18:05,477
Secretariat's got bone chips,
bad ankles, bad knees.

1135
01:18:05,513 --> 01:18:08,916
Sham's burning up the track and
Secretariat has gone missing.

1136
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:09,917
So is his owner.

1137
01:18:09,961 --> 01:18:11,952
She'll be at the press conference.

1138
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,389
The only thing she
hates worse than

1139
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,907
talking about herself
is backing down.

1140
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,058
I can't wait much longer.

1141
01:18:24,799 --> 01:18:27,039
All right, gentlemen, I guess
we're going to get started.

1142
01:18:27,059 --> 01:18:29,220
Let's open it up for questions.

1143
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:33,640
Pancho, is it true you're
predicting Sham's victory?

1144
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,200
Lucien, there are rumours your
horse is hurt. Any comment?

1145
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,405
Pancho, how are you feeling
about Sham's readiness?

1146
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:40,117
Fantastic. You've all seen his

1147
01:18:40,118 --> 01:18:42,177
workouts. He's never
looked better.

1148
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:50,356
Penny, Sham's turning
in awesome workouts.

1149
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,293
- When will you work Secretariat?
- Soon.

1150
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,661
Any concern Secretariat will run
the same way he did his last race?

1151
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:59,294
Yes.

1152
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,945
Pancho, some people
think Secretariat

1153
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:02,132
didn't appear to be himself

1154
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,570
- in Wood Memorial.
- Didn't appear to be himself?

1155
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:08,440
Is that journalism-ese for
getting your butt whipped?

1156
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:16,351
Horse racing is unforgiving for
trainers, horses and housewives.

1157
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,852
Let me tell you

1158
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,378
what you're going to hear
from the Secretariat people.

1159
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,789
Excuses, excuses, excuses.

1160
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,386
Let me tell you what you're
going to hear from me.

1161
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,253
We beat Big Red at the Wood, and

1162
01:19:28,254 --> 01:19:30,364
we're going to beat
him here again.

1163
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,225
Any comment, Miss Tweedy?

1164
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:37,698
How much pressure are you feeling
from your investors right now?

1165
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,401
Well, it's like every
other all-or-nothing,

1166
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,741
multimillion-dollar gamble we
housewives make every day.

1167
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:49,575
Miss Tweedy didn't hear me, so
I'm going to make it very clear.

1168
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:52,452
Secretariat is going down.

1169
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,985
I guarantee it.

1170
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,925
Pancho's starting to
brag like a boxer.

1171
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,225
Maybe he plans on
taking up prizefighting

1172
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:03,628
after he finishes horse racing.

1173
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,136
Sham has about as much chance
of beating Secretariat

1174
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,764
as Pancho has of
beating Muhammad Ali.

1175
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,273
I know it hurt, but I
got to do it, Red.

1176
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,974
How's it look?

1177
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:23,074
Same. Still ain't ate.

1178
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:28,654
I'm going to have Ronnie
take him out in the morning.

1179
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:32,385
See how it goes.

1180
01:20:50,411 --> 01:20:52,436
It's nothing like
Sham's been running.

1181
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,382
Nothing like Secretariat's been
running. Penny's not talking.

1182
01:20:59,597 --> 01:21:00,597
Eddie?

1183
01:21:00,598 --> 01:21:03,523
No, ma'am. He's
still off his feed.

1184
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:11,222
Miss Tweedy? Miss Tweedy?
How's your horse doing?

1185
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:13,632
He'll answer that question
for himself on race day.

1186
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:17,204
- You're Bill... Nack, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1187
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,036
I've read you. You write like
a poet. Why do you do this?

1188
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:22,201
For years they had me
covering politicians.

1189
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:24,243
I wanted to write about the
other end of the horse.

1190
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,208
Why do you do this, Miss Penny?

1191
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:28,712
I'm his voice.

1192
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:59,274
Penny, we think the abscess is
gone, but he still hasn't eaten

1193
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,078
and Ronnie says his breathing
is still a little shallow.

1194
01:22:02,116 --> 01:22:05,483
I don't know. I don't know
if we should run him.

1195
01:22:08,122 --> 01:22:09,646
Can I have a moment with him?

1196
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:46,752
All right, then. I'll
see you in the morning.

1197
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,193
Ok, Eddie.

1198
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:54,594
Thank you.

1199
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,960
Hey, Kentucky.

1200
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:28,696
Big old Red done ate his
breakfast this morning.

1201
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:31,068
And you about to see something

1202
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:35,598
that you ain't never
even seen before.

1203
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,542
So get ready.

1204
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:43,046
Get ready.

1205
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:02,259
♪ We will sing one song ♪

1206
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:06,763
♪ For my old Kentucky home ♪

1207
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:10,141
♪ For my old Kentucky home ♪

1208
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,043
Do you think he'll be ok?

1209
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,382
He ate his food this morning.

1210
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:30,353
It's your day, baby.

1211
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,671
Excuse me.

1212
01:24:40,274 --> 01:24:41,468
Hold it.

1213
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,312
- He's posing again.
- This way.

1214
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,692
- Good luck today, Miss Penny.
- Thank you.

1215
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:26,845
- Go, Secretariat.
- Yeah.

1216
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,411
Easy, Red.

1217
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,544
Safe trip, boys.

1218
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,391
Bring it home, Red.

1219
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,497
Big day, Mrs Tweedy.

1220
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:24,635
Yeah.

1221
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:30,149
There you go, boy.

1222
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:33,745
Ok, get him in.

1223
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:39,984
Get him in there.

1224
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,465
Hold it, hold it.

1225
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:58,077
Come on now, Red, come on. Don't
get distracted. Focus. You got it.

1226
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,940
Go ahead. Hold up, now.

1227
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,145
Steady. All right.

1228
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:13,660
Come on, Big Red.

1229
01:27:13,694 --> 01:27:15,093
All right, let's go.

1230
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:40,514
They're at the post. Secretariat
throws his head just a bit.

1231
01:28:17,658 --> 01:28:21,185
And they're off in the 99th
running of the Kentucky Derby.

1232
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:23,225
Shecky Greene sprinting to the

1233
01:28:23,226 --> 01:28:25,688
front, Royal and
Regal just behind.

1234
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:27,826
Gold Bag quickly
moving into third.

1235
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:31,470
And Secretariat breaks
last from the gate.

1236
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:34,303
Sham moving up to
challenge for the lead.

1237
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:37,937
Royal and Regal now being moved
to the inside, looking for room.

1238
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,174
Gold Bag is up on the outside.

1239
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:42,944
Run them down, run them down, Red.
Run them down. Come on. Come on.

1240
01:28:46,687 --> 01:28:50,020
Sham and a dozen others moving
into striking position.

1241
01:28:50,057 --> 01:28:52,525
Secretariat is at the
back of the pack.

1242
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,723
I can't watch this.

1243
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,526
You have to stay here
and take this with me.

1244
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:04,502
Sham working into strong position.

1245
01:29:04,538 --> 01:29:07,507
Sham now third on the
outside by two lengths.

1246
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:09,873
Fast first quarter in 23.2.

1247
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,140
There you go. Come on.

1248
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:17,983
As they're heading into the
back straight Sham moving up,

1249
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,543
challenging for the lead.

1250
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:21,730
Navajo, Forego, and
Warbucks beginning

1251
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,819
to move up, followed
by My Gallant...

1252
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,622
- Come on.
- Run them down, Red.

1253
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,363
Sham moving up into third.

1254
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,893
Gold Bag just in front of him
as they clear the half mile.

1255
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:41,406
Secretariat still
lagging off the pace.

1256
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,307
I'm sick of this dirt.
Let's get rolling.

1257
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:48,111
Sham closing to the
rail. A speedy 1:11.4.

1258
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,709
- Gotta move him, Ronnie.
- Let's go.

1259
01:29:50,751 --> 01:29:53,584
- Come on, Ronnie, move.
- Sham has taken the lead.

1260
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,548
Secretariat well
back of the leaders

1261
01:29:55,549 --> 01:29:57,318
and failing to mount a challenge.

1262
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:04,242
Entering the final
turn, Secretariat

1263
01:30:04,243 --> 01:30:06,265
surging past Angle Light.

1264
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,862
- Come on, Red.
- Final quarter mile.

1265
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,901
Come on, Red. Pace yourself.
This yours. This yours.

1266
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,475
- Come on, Ronnie.
- Run.

1267
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:22,942
Go.

1268
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,585
They're at the head of the
stretch and Sham is the leader.

1269
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:31,989
He leads it by a length.

1270
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,428
Secretariat is in the centre
of the racetrack and driving.

1271
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,362
It's Sham and Secretariat,
neck and neck.

1272
01:30:44,905 --> 01:30:47,527
They're in the stretch.
It's Secretariat

1273
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,638
on the outside to take the lead.

1274
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,542
Sham holding in second.

1275
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,704
Run him, Ronnie.

1276
01:30:57,017 --> 01:31:01,386
It's Secretariat at the finish.
He wins it by two lengths.

1277
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:04,814
- Holy.
- Whoo.

1278
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:16,064
I knew he was going to do it.
I knew he was going to do it.

1279
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,435
Whoo. All right.

1280
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:23,910
We won. I knew you
could do it, Mum.

1281
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:32,413
Congratulations.

1282
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,382
- I can't believe it.
- You did it.

1283
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:41,007
Penny, it's been 25 years since

1284
01:31:41,008 --> 01:31:43,690
horse racing's had a
Triple Crown winner.

1285
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:46,495
Now, is this the horse that
finally breaks that streak?

1286
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,229
We still have a lot of work to do.

1287
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,499
But at least we've given
ourselves the chance.

1288
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:52,999
Congratulations, Penny
and Secretariat

1289
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,702
on the fastest Derby ever.

1290
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,975
Here's hoping we
see the same thing

1291
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:59,270
two weeks from now
at the Preakness.

1292
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:09,115
Girls. The race is about to start.

1293
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,556
The excitement over this
super-horse has captured

1294
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:13,287
the imaginations of Americans

1295
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:16,455
and brought together people across
great divisions of culture,

1296
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:18,556
politics and passion.

1297
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:23,332
Go, Secretariat, go.

1298
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,140
Of course he's the
favourite in this

1299
01:32:25,141 --> 01:32:26,862
race as we look at
him in his barn.

1300
01:32:26,907 --> 01:32:29,587
He's getting ready now to make the
walk across to the saddling area.

1301
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,680
I'm Jack Whitaker, along with
Heywood Hale Broun, Chic Anderson

1302
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,929
and Frank Wright.
We welcome you to

1303
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:38,083
the 98th running of the Preakness.

1304
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,254
- Hey, there's Mum.
- I can't believe that's Mum.

1305
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:47,226
- Wow. She looks awesome.
- I can't believe she's on TV.

1306
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:49,923
- That's amazing.
- So cool.

1307
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,765
With three horses in, I'm going
to give this to Chic Anderson

1308
01:32:53,785 --> 01:32:55,601
who will call the race for you.

1309
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:57,695
We're about ready to
go as Ecole Etage...

1310
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,706
Secretariat bobs his head.

1311
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,038
We're still looking...
And they're off.

1312
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:04,299
For the early lead, that's Deadly

1313
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,379
Dream. On the
outside, Ecole Etage.

1314
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:08,295
Settling into second,
Torsion. Sham

1315
01:33:08,296 --> 01:33:10,281
has good position,
third on the rail,

1316
01:33:10,317 --> 01:33:13,411
and Secretariat is last,
again, as they move...

1317
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:14,572
Red's last.

1318
01:33:14,573 --> 01:33:17,754
He's last. Why is he always last?

1319
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:20,917
But here comes
Secretariat. He's moving

1320
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:23,119
fast. And he's going
to the outside...

1321
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:26,064
He's going for the lead, and it
is right now he's looking for it.

1322
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,432
- See him right there?
- All right, Red.

1323
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,061
- Come on.
- Yes.

1324
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:38,075
Secretariat is right alongside.

1325
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:41,992
Sham now going to the
outside in third.

1326
01:33:41,993 --> 01:33:44,248
We're moving down the backstretch.

1327
01:33:44,985 --> 01:33:47,215
They're incredible. Look at them.

1328
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,245
Secretariat the leader by...

1329
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:51,281
- Dad, you seeing this?
- I see him.

1330
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:54,920
And it looks like Ecole Etage has
had it, dropping back in third.

1331
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:58,056
Here's the race, folks.
Secretariat trying to hold it.

1332
01:33:58,098 --> 01:33:59,793
Look at this.

1333
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,529
Head of the stretch,
Secretariat at two and a half.

1334
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:05,094
Sham under a strong
left-handed whip.

1335
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:08,438
Secretariat by two lengths.
Sham driving second.

1336
01:34:08,475 --> 01:34:10,648
It is Secretariat.
He's coming to the

1337
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:12,707
wire. He wins it
by two and a half,

1338
01:34:12,746 --> 01:34:14,373
almost three.

1339
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,506
I don't believe this.

1340
01:34:19,853 --> 01:34:24,290
And it was a powerhouse race again
by the big, strong Secretariat.

1341
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,158
Here is Mrs Tweedy,
who has just won

1342
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:30,061
the second of two very
important races to her.

1343
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,951
Secretariat has now
won the Kentucky

1344
01:34:31,952 --> 01:34:33,555
Derby and the Preakness Stakes,

1345
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:36,329
and this time he did
it the same way.

1346
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:42,873
What is it, Lucien? What's wrong?

1347
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,241
Nothing.

1348
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:49,508
He just won Preakness,
like he won the Derby.

1349
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:52,747
You keep staring into your coffee.
Are you worried about Red?

1350
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,850
Since Citation did it in 1948,

1351
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,620
seven horses have won the
Derby and then the Preakness.

1352
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,528
Every single one of them has
failed to win the Triple Crown.

1353
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:06,089
He just won the first
two in record time.

1354
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:09,330
Yeah, and the Belmont is the
graveyard of speed horses.

1355
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,565
It's the longest race
they'll ever run.

1356
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,773
What do you suggest?

1357
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:18,374
Normally we rest him, right?

1358
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:20,642
- Yeah. Sure.
- Let him recuperate.

1359
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:23,340
Yeah.

1360
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:25,977
But you don't want to back off.

1361
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:28,887
In all my years of training

1362
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:31,857
I've never had a horse who loves
to run the way this one does.

1363
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:35,225
You take that horse out one day,
he's going to run faster the next.

1364
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,456
My instinct?

1365
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:41,391
My instinct is to train him.
Hard. To stoke that fire.

1366
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:45,667
But if I'm wrong,
then they will say

1367
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:48,037
that not only did
we ruin the horse's

1368
01:35:48,038 --> 01:35:49,938
chances at the Triple Crown...

1369
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:53,008
they may say we ruined the horse.

1370
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:58,612
Red is not afraid.
And neither am I.

1371
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,513
Just remember, if we push
him instead of rest him...

1372
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,859
it could be dangerous.

1373
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:09,522
Nobody knows how much he can take.

1374
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:13,495
He does.

1375
01:36:14,968 --> 01:36:16,629
He knows.

1376
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:22,298
Mr Martin. Secretariat has
beaten your horse twice.

1377
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:23,639
What makes this race different?

1378
01:36:24,144 --> 01:36:26,421
Any good horseman will tell you

1379
01:36:26,422 --> 01:36:29,138
that Secretariat
is built for speed

1380
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:31,515
and Sham is built for distance.

1381
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:34,248
But, of course, Miss Tweedy
believes that her horse

1382
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:37,155
has somehow magically
inherited both.

1383
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,682
I believe that this
race is going to prove

1384
01:36:39,726 --> 01:36:43,218
that her woman's intuition
will only take her so far.

1385
01:36:43,263 --> 01:36:46,426
Penny. What about all the
attention Secretariat's getting?

1386
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,737
Covers of both Time and Newsweek.

1387
01:36:48,738 --> 01:36:49,738
Well...

1388
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:53,666
Let me tell you something about
all this talk about super-horse.

1389
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:56,232
Sham broke the Derby record, too.

1390
01:36:56,276 --> 01:36:58,820
He ran the second-fastest
Derby. He ran

1391
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:01,236
the second-fastest
Preakness... ever.

1392
01:37:01,748 --> 01:37:05,013
We were right there with the red
horse every step of the way.

1393
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:07,264
And now we're getting
ready to run the

1394
01:37:07,265 --> 01:37:09,250
longest of the Triple Crown races.

1395
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:12,258
When we're done, you'll be
calling Sham the super-horse.

1396
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:13,691
Any comment, Penny?

1397
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:16,753
Well, I'd have to say I agree
completely with Mr Martin.

1398
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:19,664
His horse did run the
second-fastest ever.

1399
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:25,029
I'm out of here.

1400
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:28,269
Where are you going? Come on.

1401
01:37:31,945 --> 01:37:35,676
That woman, she's so arrogant.

1402
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:37,861
Lucien will do
anything to prove he's

1403
01:37:37,862 --> 01:37:40,119
not a loser. That's
where they're weak.

1404
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,654
We rest our horse,
they push theirs.

1405
01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:44,167
On race day, we push
him even harder.

1406
01:37:44,168 --> 01:37:45,489
We push him until he comes apart.

1407
01:37:49,229 --> 01:37:51,993
1:12 and a fifth.

1408
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,761
Oh, that's good time.

1409
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:57,897
Sure you want to send him
a mile next time out?

1410
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:02,198
I'm just asking.

1411
01:38:05,445 --> 01:38:07,470
They think we're
training him too hard.

1412
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,013
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Belmont Ball.

1413
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,015
It's not bad.

1414
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:49,283
Your daddy would be so proud.

1415
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,321
Where did you find her?

1416
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:54,156
Told her I was taller when
I stood on my wallet.

1417
01:38:58,065 --> 01:38:59,396
Miss Chenery.

1418
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:03,096
Mr Laurin. You look
exceptionally handsome tonight.

1419
01:39:03,136 --> 01:39:07,163
Well, I wanted to go on record, I
left my hat at home, just for you.

1420
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:16,941
I brought you a little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

1421
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:20,162
I offered to give it
back to Seth, but

1422
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:23,014
he too thought you should have it.

1423
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:28,292
The tails side is very nice.

1424
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:33,432
Lucien, you know
you are absolutely

1425
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:36,832
the best trainer that
I could have ever...

1426
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,430
You're the best owner I ever saw.

1427
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:46,376
Turcotte and Edward say he's the
smartest horse they've ever seen.

1428
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,449
Maybe. I've trained
horses my whole life.

1429
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:51,453
I still don't have
the slightest idea

1430
01:39:51,454 --> 01:39:53,579
what they know and
what they don't know.

1431
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:56,595
Three years ago I
would've said that a

1432
01:39:56,596 --> 01:39:59,021
racehorse didn't care
who his owner was.

1433
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:00,959
But then he's not a racehorse.

1434
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:03,562
He's Secretariat.

1435
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:10,225
And I think tomorrow
he'll be wearing wings.

1436
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:31,112
- Mum. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Kate.

1437
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:32,182
Oh.

1438
01:40:32,225 --> 01:40:34,989
You're not late. You're
perfectly on time.

1439
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:40,092
Look at you. You're so beautiful.
And you're all grown up.

1440
01:40:40,133 --> 01:40:43,830
You look beautiful,
too, Mum. All grown up.

1441
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:48,200
I'm so proud of you.

1442
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:50,069
Thank you.

1443
01:40:51,144 --> 01:40:52,168
Oh.

1444
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:53,839
- I love you.
- I love you.

1445
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,748
- Mum.
- Come here.

1446
01:40:58,785 --> 01:41:00,082
Oh, Sarah.

1447
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,179
Oh, look at you.

1448
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:04,420
Missed you.

1449
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,618
- You're amazing.
- Look at what I've got.

1450
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:09,623
- Is that the coin?
- The coin?

1451
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:12,558
- The coin.
- Oh.

1452
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:14,430
Here. Go ahead. You can hold it.

1453
01:41:14,534 --> 01:41:18,300
You guys keep it safe. Don't
lose it tonight. It's important.

1454
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,098
Come on, boys. Let's go.

1455
01:41:27,814 --> 01:41:30,282
They are growing up. All of them.

1456
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:35,254
Kate is so beautiful in that
gown. And Sarah in hers.

1457
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:38,257
Yeah. Wish I'd bought
those gowns earlier.

1458
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,886
Something I need you to know.

1459
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:46,363
I want you to win.
And win or lose,

1460
01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:49,026
you've taught our children
what a real woman is.

1461
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,799
What it is to believe
in yourself, and I

1462
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,402
never could have
taught those things.

1463
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:55,234
And you've taught
me something, too.

1464
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:05,763
Come here.

1465
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,406
I realised something.

1466
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,081
I've already won.

1467
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:25,350
I made it here. I didn't quit.

1468
01:44:29,362 --> 01:44:31,262
I've run my race.

1469
01:44:34,634 --> 01:44:36,431
Now you run yours.

1470
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:43,934
A record crowd is expected today

1471
01:44:43,977 --> 01:44:47,378
as Secretariat makes his bid
for horse racing immortality.

1472
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:50,577
The race is scheduled for
5:38 this afternoon.

1473
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,609
Forecasters are predicting
temperatures in the mid-90s.

1474
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,857
- Easy. Easy, easy.
- Hold him, Eddie. Hold him.

1475
01:44:59,492 --> 01:45:02,552
- Easy, Red. Easy.
- Watch yourself.

1476
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:06,528
Calm yourself. Calm yourself.

1477
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,628
Let him walk. Walk off his nerves.

1478
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:14,205
Horse seems pretty fired up.

1479
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:16,801
He knows what's going on.

1480
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:34,919
- I saw Big Red.
- Good girl, sweetheart.

1481
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:42,602
- Is that the one?
- Oh yeah, right.

1482
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,596
I don't make a lot
of guarantees, but

1483
01:45:44,597 --> 01:45:46,299
listen, this one you can bet on.

1484
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:48,271
You're going to eat
dirt today, Ronnie.

1485
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:50,208
I don't think so.

1486
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:54,976
Go hard for the lead. Draw him up
close. If he comes, he's ours. Ok?

1487
01:45:55,749 --> 01:46:00,652
Lot of track today,
Red. A lot of track.

1488
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:04,404
Ok, Ronnie, don't
send him out, all

1489
01:46:04,405 --> 01:46:06,486
right? But don't
choke him, either.

1490
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:08,537
Remember, we have a
mile and a half to

1491
01:46:08,538 --> 01:46:10,394
cover. And one last
thing, don't...

1492
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,398
What? Burst his heart?

1493
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:16,430
Just bring him home, Ronnie.

1494
01:46:43,229 --> 01:46:44,253
Come on, Big Red.

1495
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,895
Go, Big Red.

1496
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:57,606
The eighth race,

1497
01:46:57,644 --> 01:47:00,670
the 105th running of
the Belmont Stakes.

1498
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:11,746
- Here we go.
- Oh, here he comes.

1499
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:26,532
- Big Red.
- Go, Big Red.

1500
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:29,406
Oh, I think he's coming. Oh.

1501
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:34,473
Big Red.

1502
01:47:48,027 --> 01:47:50,587
Very big day, Mrs Tweedy.

1503
01:47:58,905 --> 01:48:00,497
Ok, Big Red.

1504
01:48:01,174 --> 01:48:02,334
Come on, Sham.

1505
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:04,434
Hey. Hey.

1506
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:09,440
Ah, look at him.

1507
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:11,609
You got a couple
thousand I can borrow?

1508
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:16,982
Come on, Red.

1509
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,389
He looks fantastic.

1510
01:48:22,862 --> 01:48:26,320
Oh. I was afraid you
wouldn't show up.

1511
01:48:26,366 --> 01:48:29,426
Well... got a tip on a horse.

1512
01:48:32,872 --> 01:48:35,898
- Yeah.
- Where is Lucien?

1513
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,536
Oh.

1514
01:48:39,979 --> 01:48:42,675
Good luck.

1515
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:46,581
The remaining field,
now entering the gate.

1516
01:48:50,323 --> 01:48:52,291
Easy there, easy.

1517
01:48:54,627 --> 01:48:55,651
That's good.

1518
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:06,096
Only five horses in
the field today,

1519
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:07,572
many of the owners conceding that

1520
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:11,441
this is a match race between
Secretariat and Sham.

1521
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:25,088
The field is at the post.
Chic Anderson with the call.

1522
01:49:25,124 --> 01:49:26,989
Horses now loaded in.

1523
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:33,256
And they're off.

1524
01:49:33,466 --> 01:49:36,060
Secretariat surging from the gate.

1525
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:40,004
Secretariat away very well, has
good position on the rail.

1526
01:49:42,675 --> 01:49:45,838
Secretariat driving
immediately into the lead.

1527
01:49:47,413 --> 01:49:50,439
Secretariat and Sham off to
a surprisingly rapid pace.

1528
01:49:50,483 --> 01:49:52,075
He's going out too fast.

1529
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:55,110
Sham, on the outside, is
also moving along strongly.

1530
01:49:55,154 --> 01:49:57,520
Now it's Sham. Sham and
Secretariat are...

1531
01:49:57,557 --> 01:50:02,790
This is no good.

1532
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:06,094
- Why is he going to the lead?
- Because I don't know.

1533
01:50:06,132 --> 01:50:08,464
Go. Go.

1534
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:12,538
Sham pushing Secretariat
into an even faster pace.

1535
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,403
As they round the first turn...

1536
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:18,739
drawing away down
to the backstretch.

1537
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:22,647
Sham pressing Secretariat
even faster.

1538
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:27,384
Secretariat refusing to
yield. Driving forward.

1539
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:30,389
This is unbelievable. No
horse can take this pace.

1540
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,857
Sham pushes forward to
challenge for the rail.

1541
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:34,985
Come on, Ronnie. Come on.

1542
01:50:35,028 --> 01:50:38,088
Three quarters, a
blistering 1:09.4.

1543
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,065
There you go. There you go.

1544
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:44,433
Secretariat and Sham
locked in a deadly duel.

1545
01:50:50,009 --> 01:50:52,301
It's another eight
lengths to Private

1546
01:50:52,302 --> 01:50:54,412
Smiles, who is trailing the field.

1547
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,175
It's Secretariat and Sham.

1548
01:51:00,853 --> 01:51:04,254
- Oh, man. This is a catastrophe.
- It's too fast.

1549
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,320
Before the turn, it's Secretariat.

1550
01:51:06,321 --> 01:51:07,418
Come on, Big Red.

1551
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,792
Let him run, Ronnie. Let him run.

1552
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:14,523
Sham and Secretariat pulling
away at blazing speed.

1553
01:51:16,469 --> 01:51:20,496
With a half mile still to run,
Secretariat sprinting away.

1554
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:22,434
Four lengths.

1555
01:51:23,142 --> 01:51:24,234
Six.

1556
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:28,143
Nine. Eleven.

1557
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,062
Entering the final
turn, Secretariat

1558
01:51:32,063 --> 01:51:34,542
is moving like a
tremendous machine.

1559
01:51:38,091 --> 01:51:39,683
That's impossible.

1560
01:51:58,711 --> 01:52:01,339
He laughs at fear,
afraid of nothing.

1561
01:52:02,248 --> 01:52:04,273
He does not shy away
from the sword.

1562
01:52:05,418 --> 01:52:08,819
He cannot stand still
when the trumpet sounds.

1563
01:52:21,634 --> 01:52:24,068
Oh. Glory.

1564
01:52:24,103 --> 01:52:26,435
The lead is now 24 lengths.

1565
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:32,709
- Twenty-six lengths.
- Whoo-hoo.

1566
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:37,880
- Twenty-eight and still surging.
- Ride him, Ronnie. Ride him.

1567
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,475
- Go, Red.
- Go, Red.

1568
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,188
- Whoa.
- God.

1569
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:45,089
Ronnie.

1570
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:49,622
Ronnie, don't fall off.

1571
01:52:51,731 --> 01:52:53,096
There you go, Red.

1572
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:01,702
Secretariat by 30.

1573
01:53:05,745 --> 01:53:09,647
Secretariat wins.

1574
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:13,778
Secretariat wins by 31 lengths.

1575
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,833
You have a great horse.
