1
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,262
Are they wild horses, Dad?

2
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:24,130
<i>No, they're not brumbies.</i>

3
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,284
<i>Someone's gone to a lot of
trouble to put that mob together</i>

4
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,904
<i>You won't find better anywhere.</i>

5
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:34,232
<i>Ump... it's the man himself. Jim Craig.</i>

6
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,485
- <i>From Snowy River?</i>
- That's Him.

7
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,715
<i>A long way from home.</i>

8
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,629
<font color=#FF551>BOY:</font> I'll look after him.

9
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,390
<font color=#FF551>JIM:</font> Thanks, son.

10
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:02,427
You're cracking on the pace,
Jim. You going back for good?

11
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:08,174
- Yep. I've been away long enough.
- Yeah. I suppose so.

12
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:11,777
But still, you'll be missed in these parts, Jim.

13
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,239
Thanks, mate.

14
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:19,286
Well... I've got my stake together now.

15
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,623
Not a bad one, either.

16
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:24,883
They're the best I've seen.

17
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,428
For thousands of miles.

18
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:31,156
- You going to breed them?
- <i>Mmm. Eventually.</i>

19
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:32,534
See...

20
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:37,587
before I left home, I let that old wild
stallion and his mob loose again.

21
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:40,257
And now I'm going to let
him cover these mares.

22
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,142
Big plans.

23
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:44,770
Spare me that, mate.

24
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,973
Was it Denny that ran down
that stallion, Mr Craig?

25
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,325
Jim.

26
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:53,019
Yep. That's him, alright.

27
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,313
About due for a rest, I reckon.

28
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,918
Remember old, um... Harrison?
He had a daughter, didn't he?

29
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:03,597
- Jessica.
- <i>Right. Right.</i>

30
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:08,711
Well, I suppose that's as good a reason
as any for going home in a hurry.

31
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,370
<i><font color=#FF551>JIM:</font> What are you after, Seb?</i>

32
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:42,182
Rabbits? Or something bigger?

33
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,677
Depends.

34
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:57,805
I thought I'd come up and
see if the place was alright.

35
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,775
Thanks.

36
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,269
Why the rifle?

37
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,971
Insurance.

38
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:07,107
A few funny things have been
happening up here lately.

39
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:10,017
- Like what?
- Cattle and horses spooked.

40
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,429
They must reckon we've been poddy-dodging.

41
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,081
Stealing cattle? Surely not.

42
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:18,952
- Well, no more than usual.
- Only as much as you can eat, anyway.

43
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,028
- <i>That's right.</i>
- It's traditional.

44
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,706
No, it's more likely some big nobs down below

45
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:27,744
have finally woken up to this droughtproof
grazing up here and want to grab a bit.

46
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:31,505
- They've been serving us with papers.
- What, legal papers?

47
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:32,966
Oh, I don't know.

48
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,352
Found a good use for them, though.

49
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,640
Someone took a shot at
your old stallion last week.

50
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,694
- What?
- He's alright. Back with his mob.

51
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,979
- Who was it?
- We don't know.

52
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,823
It could've been anyone who's blamed him

53
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:59,484
<i>for every horse gone missing
over the past 20 years.</i>

54
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,495
That's just about everybody.

55
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,373
Yeah, well, he's not exactly
house-trained, is he?

56
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:09,461
- <i>Anyway, now you're back for a while...</i>
- Back for good, Seb.

57
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,851
Just one more thing to do.

58
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,481
Hope things go the way you
want them to down there, mate.

59
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:22,858
Mmm.

60
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:27,103
Well, let's get a fire going.

61
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,281
It's good to have you home!

62
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,121
Jessica!

63
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,435
Mr Simmons tells me you've
been riding that colt again.

64
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:27,497
- <i>Now, I employ a jockey to do that.</i>
- I know.

65
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:30,518
But... I get the faster times.

66
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,270
Is that true?

67
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,700
Where is this great jockey you
begged me to hire, Simmons?

68
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,945
He's off trying to lose some weight,

69
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,055
- Mr Harrison.
- Oh, I see... he gets fat off my beef,

70
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,525
<i>then I have to pay him while he
tries to lighten his carcass.</i>

71
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:49,227
Now, listen to me, Simmons.

72
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:53,189
I want that colt flying by this weekend.
Do you understand? Flying!

73
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,526
These are my home grounds.
I intend to win that race!

74
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,412
That's all.

75
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:01,290
Get that jockey into condition.

76
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,536
Lousy weather.

77
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:09,789
Old and cold, Jess.

78
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,534
Old and cold.

79
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:17,547
I want you to change into something
more feminine before lunch.

80
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,083
- We have guests.
- Oh? Who?

81
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,384
Patton.

82
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,003
Oh, Mr Patton. I should have
guessed that. I mean...

83
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:29,226
percentages and balance sheets and interest
rates make such fascinating conversation.

84
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,320
Oh, his son will be there too.

85
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:35,999
Well, good. Alistair should
liven things up a bit.

86
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,018
And when you're running this place,

87
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,039
<i>you'll be damn glad I made you sit in
on all these business meetings, lady.</i>

88
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,341
- Me?
- <i>Mmm.</i>

89
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:45,751
Run the place?

90
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:49,278
I thought all I had to do was...

91
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,325
...show a little bit of petticoat and snare
somebody eligible so he could run it.

92
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:56,937
- <i>Or think he does.</i>
- Yeah, like I think I do, right?

93
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:02,059
Now, listen, Jess. Wear plenty of frills.

94
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,098
If we're going to keep this place
growing, we're going to need Mr Patton.

95
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,777
And his loans.

96
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,537
<i>Good day, Denny.</i>

97
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,412
You have a rest, old mate.

98
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:35,175
Time to teach one of these
youngsters a thing or two, eh?

99
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,967
Well, this is a first-class turnout,
Harrison. Does you credit.

100
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,153
Thanks... Patton.

101
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:07,490
I was talking to some of
the other families just now.

102
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:10,285
We're all impressed. We must see more of you.

103
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:11,953
Well, I'll drink to that.

104
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:15,461
- I'll get it.
- I can get my own godda...

105
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,418
See to Mr Patton's glass...

106
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,838
You know, once the bank
has decided to back you...

107
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,608
and I'm sure my directors will
see that is a mere formality...

108
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,468
great things are possible.

109
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,140
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:37,353
Mind you, if our ties
extended beyond... mortgages,

111
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,847
<i>I would say the sky's the limit.</i>

112
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,909
<i>Well, it's an interesting proposition, Patton.</i>

113
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,178
But of course, that's up to Jessica.

114
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,789
Of course.

115
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,408
Oh, excuse me...

116
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:52,302
Uh, Colonel Hawker?

117
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,290
Someone I'd like you to meet.

118
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,101
Harrison, Colonel Hawker, Indian Army.

119
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:03,171
- Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Colonel.
- How do you do?

120
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,423
Colonel Hawker comes
down from India every year

121
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:08,118
and faithfully buys up the best
cavalry horses in the country.

122
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,278
<i>He means his own, of course.</i>

123
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,389
<i>Well, anyway, you'll be
pleased with this year's draft.</i>

124
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,659
<i>Despite the poor season,
I could still give you 500.</i>

125
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,094
- <i>Good.
- New lines coming through strongly.</i>

126
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:19,896
Excuse me.

127
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,207
Here, you. Look after the gentlemen.

128
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,570
Interesting man.

129
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:31,983
- Has he been here long?
- 20 years, more or less.

130
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,743
Don't know a lot about him.

131
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:37,622
<i>Yankee originally. Made a bit
of money on gold diggings.</i>

132
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:41,417
<i>Not exactly a first-class background!</i>

133
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:43,795
Not like us, eh?

134
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,296
No, indeed.

135
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:50,760
I believe your family came from
the Percys on the Scottish border.

136
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,262
They most certainly did.

137
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:54,356
- Mine were the Monmouths.
- Really?

138
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:57,767
Yes. My lot used to hang your lot.

139
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,520
As cattle thieves.

140
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:05,358
This, Mr Simmons, is the problem.

141
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,036
<i><font color=#FF551>HARRISON:</font> Jessica.</i>

142
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,572
You want the horse to win or not?

143
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,699
<i>Let the jockey handle it! Mr Simmons?</i>

144
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,954
Where is our fat jockey this morning?

145
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:21,674
Uh... he took some medicine,
so he had to go to the, um...

146
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,912
- But he'll be back in a minute.
- Oh, he should stay there,

147
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,864
- for all the bloody good he'll do.
- Ah. Miss Harrison.

148
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:30,843
Mr Patton! Hello.

149
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:36,673
Excuse me.

150
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:39,225
Charming girl.

151
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,145
Oh, she has a mind of her own.

152
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:43,855
The best sort, Harrison.

153
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:47,960
It's the high-stepping fillies
that make the best mares, eh?

154
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,488
<i>Harrison.</i>

155
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:53,999
Father.

156
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,529
Come on, Harrison. This is
going to be worth watching.

157
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,725
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

158
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:57,637
The regimental trophy
holder, Lieutenant Patton,

159
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:01,016
will now demonstrate the skill-at-arms course.

160
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,032
Yah!

161
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,832
- I'm awfully sorry.
- It's alright. You missed.

162
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,986
- I... take it you're looking for the stables?
- No.

163
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,464
<i>For Jessica Harrison. Have you seen her?</i>

164
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:50,732
- <i>Er... well, yes, but...
- Who would be asking for her?</i>

165
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:54,879
<i>Oh, that was good riding out there.</i>

166
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,714
My name's Jim Craig.

167
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:59,018
Oh, the one we've heard so much about.

168
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,804
Could be.

169
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:05,431
You were a bit lucky that day, Craig.

170
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:08,285
Mainly old stagers there, I hear.

171
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,655
Everyone was invited.

172
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,269
You're out of your class here, Craig.

173
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,448
<i><font color=#FF551>HAWKER:</font> Afternoon, Mr Patton.</i>

174
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:23,950
<i>Sir.</i>

175
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:26,979
- Mr Collins.
- <i>Good afternoon, sir.</i>

176
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,089
Harry Hawker.

177
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,842
Jim Craig.

178
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:38,490
Uh, could you spare me a minute, Jim?

179
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:46,815
<i>I noticed your horse.</i> I was
coming over for a closer look.

180
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:49,835
He's a good type. Learning quickly.

181
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,123
Just the one?

182
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:57,651
No, I've got about 100 of them.

183
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:00,945
Really?

184
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:04,992
Uh, will you excuse me, Harry?
It was good to meet you.

185
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,503
And you.

186
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:19,180
Where the devil is Summer Cloud?

187
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,049
Oh, already out there.

188
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,226
<i>Bit overanxious, eh?</i>

189
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:27,096
<i>Not a good sign.</i> Anyway,
I wouldn't fuss about that.

190
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:30,409
My Highland Laddie's obviously
got the edge on your fellow.

191
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,795
It's easy to say, Patton.

192
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:37,917
- I've got £100 to back that up, Harrison.
- £500.

193
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,170
Done.

194
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:18,749
Come on!

195
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:25,263
Damn it! What the hell's
that bloody jockey doing?!

196
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:35,974
- He's moving! What is that jockey doing?
- Come on! Come on!

197
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:47,286
<i>Come on!</i>

198
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,168
You lost.

199
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,299
Thank you.

200
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:13,152
Good horse, that.

201
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:16,456
Yeah, I know. I broke him in.

202
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:40,739
What the devil do you think you're doing
out there with professional jockeys?

203
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,483
- You might've been killed!
- The jockey was missing.

204
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:45,785
- What was th...
- Oh, and you just happened to be available?

205
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:47,287
Simmons!

206
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:51,991
- Simmons, where is that bloody jock...?
- He's here, Mr Harrison.

207
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:54,395
Som...somebody locked me in the outhouse!

208
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,891
Simmons...

209
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:04,129
You're sacked. You're both sacked.

210
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:06,264
<i><font color=#FF551>SIMMONS:</font> Suits me.</i>

211
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:09,860
<i>Working for you two's like
being caught in a meat grinder!</i>

212
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:16,992
Now, I want you to go in
the house and change.

213
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,703
Right now.

214
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:22,289
Jess?

215
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,545
Congratulations.

216
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,132
Thanks.

217
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:00,044
Hello, Jess.

218
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:13,623
Well, Craig. Been a long time.

219
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,801
G'day, Mr Harrison.

220
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:20,414
I don't recall having invited you today.

221
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:24,259
No, I came to see Jessica.

222
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,354
<i>Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.</i>

223
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:30,340
Well, you're not welcome here, Craig.

224
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,592
Today, tomorrow...

225
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:34,487
...any time.

226
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:37,206
Oh.

227
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,526
I'm sorry to hear that.

228
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,863
Tell me, do you still speak for Jessica too?

229
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:48,033
I don't argue with drifters.

230
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:51,087
Father... please.

231
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,994
Come with me, Jess.

232
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,814
Jess, I...

233
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,600
<i>...I know it's been a long time,</i>

234
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,261
but I've got a start for us.

235
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,869
Have you been thinking of me, then?

236
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,125
- That's good.
<i><font color=#FF551>- HARRISON:</font> Jess!</i>

237
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,096
Jessica!

238
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:46,591
I know you hicks are slow
on the uptake, Craig,

239
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,485
<i>but you're setting a record.</i>

240
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,945
<i>I don't know who you think</i> you are,

241
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:55,082
but you're not part of this,
so keep your mouth shut.

242
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:58,287
You've been away too long, Craig.

243
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:01,523
You don't know who's part of what.

244
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:04,235
Change your clothes, Jess.

245
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,862
<i>Get off this property.</i>

246
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,007
Now.

247
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:18,341
There are better ways to make your point, Jim.

248
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,731
Ya!

249
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:41,048
Get up!

250
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:14,731
I think you'd call that a live prisoner.

251
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,361
It was more than just a loutish display.

252
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:57,157
It was open contempt for the values
on which this community is based.

253
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:01,619
Perhaps now you'll understand why we
must get rid of that riffraff up there

254
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,616
and acquire the mountain grazing
areas for the benefit of the valley.

255
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:11,788
- It's easier said than done.
- Don't be too sure.

256
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:15,533
I aim to have a bill before
the House this session.

257
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:20,727
And in view of our undertakings,
I'm sure I can count on your support?

258
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:25,986
What you're saying is I support you
or I have problems with the bank.

259
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:27,687
Is that right, Patton?

260
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,990
Well... a fraction bold, old man,

261
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:33,560
I see you get the general drift.

262
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:43,174
Oh, blimey! You're enough
to make a saint swear.

263
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:44,575
There's no saints around here, Father.

264
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:47,395
Otherwise, you could do the loaves
and fishes thing with pound notes

265
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:49,565
and give me something decent to work with!

266
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:52,800
You miserable sinners.

267
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:55,729
When this is finished and any
of you come to confession,

268
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,940
you'll be laughing on the
other side of your faces.

269
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:02,068
When that's finished, we'll
be too old to commit sins.

270
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,646
Now, I'll give you all a fair choice.

271
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:06,740
Either get on about your business

272
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:10,678
or contribute to God's work
with your labour or your cash.

273
00:34:20,454 --> 00:34:23,048
Oh. You must be new around here.

274
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,591
Been away for a while.

275
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:27,877
But there used to be only a small mine here.

276
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,346
Yes.

277
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:34,768
Yes, an old fellow named Spur
grubbed most of his life away here.

278
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:39,773
<i>And after he died,</i> they
found it... 50ft from his shaft.

279
00:34:39,774 --> 00:34:43,693
- Found what?
- <i>The mother lode. 1,000ft down.</i>

280
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:47,189
Pity they don't dig as deep into their pockets.

281
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:18,635
- Jim!
- G'day, Seb.

282
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,138
Where the hell have you been?

283
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,357
I've been looking for you. Come have a beer.

284
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,942
<i><font color=#FF551>SEB:</font> G'day, Mrs Darcy.</i>

285
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:25,819
Hello, Sebastian.

286
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,904
<i>This is Jim Craig.</i>

287
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:29,957
- Hello, Jim.
- <i>Hello.</i>

288
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,574
So it didn't go too well down there?

289
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:44,053
I didn't think they'd put out the red carpet.

290
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:48,091
<i>With old Harrison, it was
more like a red rag to a bull.</i>

291
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,869
Well, we all know they'd like to run us

292
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,322
- right out of the High Country.
- Mmm.

293
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:56,758
What are the boys doing about that?

294
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,676
Nothing.

295
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:02,272
They reckon if you don't stir
the possum, it won't bite you.

296
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:04,867
What Can we do?

297
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:04,209
I'm glad to hear you're playing the piano again.

298
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,920
It's been too long.

299
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,276
Do you think, maybe, you
could play some other tune?

300
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:17,413
It's not a tune. It's a sonata.

301
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:20,401
Well, whatever the hell it is!

302
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:25,655
You're pining away over that drifter
Craig. You're just wasting your time.

303
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:28,649
- Jim isn't a drifter.
- What else would you call him?

304
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,361
The man disappears into the
mountains for months at a time.

305
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,873
No-one ever sees him or hears from him.

306
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:39,361
Whatever he is, he won't be back here, Jess.

307
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,157
Now, I thought you accepted that.

308
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:56,195
You haven't been outside this house in days.

309
00:37:57,263 --> 00:37:59,823
- Everyone's been asking for you.
- <i>Oh!</i>

310
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,510
I thought this is where you wanted me.

311
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:06,771
Looking decorative, waiting
for the suitors to call.

312
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,773
One has called.

313
00:38:08,774 --> 00:38:10,692
Alistair Patton.

314
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:13,937
Called every other day, and I'm
running out of excuses for him.

315
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:14,931
And then don't make excuses.

316
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:18,158
- Tell him I won't see him.
- Well, that's fine with me, Jess. Either way.

317
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,318
How you both treated Jim was disgraceful.

318
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:23,539
The subject is closed!
Now, I am sick to death...

319
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,149
- of hearing about Jim Craig.
- <i>Well, I am not</i>

320
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,969
Craig doesn't belong here, Jess.
He could never belong here. You do.

321
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,597
Oh. And so does Alistair Patton, I suppose?

322
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:34,684
Affections are all related
to houses and property,

323
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,391
- are they not?
- God, you can be most aggravating woman!

324
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:38,787
Obviously a chip off the old block!

325
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:43,432
Because I don't care a hoot in hell
about the Pattons, junior or senior!

326
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,285
- And you know it!
- Well, neither do I!

327
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:47,963
<i>Then what the hell are we arguing about?!</i>

328
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:08,091
<i><font color=#FF551>MRS DARCY:</font> Jim?</i>

329
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:11,311
<i><font color=#FF551>- JIM:</font> Morning.</i>
- Are you leaving today?

330
00:39:11,712 --> 00:39:13,896
No. Not Yet.

331
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:16,266
<i>I want to check into the
affairs of an old friend.</i>

332
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,719
Spur?

333
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:28,394
You know, I bet he's still
smiling away to himself up there.

334
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:29,696
<i>How's that?</i>

335
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:32,215
<i>He willed this place to all
the battlers and fossickers</i>

336
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:34,384
<i>that have ever grubbed around these hills.</i>

337
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:37,011
That's not playing the game by the rules.

338
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:38,855
Gets worse.

339
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:42,008
You see, none of these people work for bosses.

340
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:45,470
<i>And that's something the
landed gentry can't digest.</i>

341
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:49,258
Well... long live Eureka Creek.

342
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,174
Excuse me.

343
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,737
I came to talk to you.

344
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:25,351
Couldn't believe it when I saw you again.

345
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:26,987
It was like an illusion.

346
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:33,134
I want to know why you
were away for so long, Jim.

347
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:36,204
I told you. To get a start for us.

348
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:39,783
Why is accumulating things
so damned important?

349
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:44,730
Because I've seen the lack of it.
And I don't want that for you.

350
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,732
Things change.

351
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,992
Is there someone else?

352
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:10,146
They've all made plans for
me... with Alistair Patton.

353
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:12,249
I'm not going through with it.

354
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:16,670
But I can't come up here with you.

355
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:20,341
Why not?

356
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:25,054
My father.

357
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:29,433
He needs me now more
than he ever did before.

358
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:41,904
And... the Pattons are the most
powerful family in the district.

359
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:45,607
<i>If we were together, they would break him.</i>

360
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:48,893
<i>And then they'd come after
you and everybody up here.</i>

361
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:52,623
<i>Your own people</i> would turn against
you and I would be the cause.

362
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:58,203
You're taking too much on yourself, Jess.

363
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:01,832
No. I've given this a lot of thought.

364
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,971
It'd drive us apart, Jim.

365
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:10,700
<i><font color=#FF551>JESSICA'S VOICE:</font> "Dear Father,
I have to go and see Jim.</i>

366
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:14,838
<i>"Please don't be angry with
me. I must do this my own way."</i>

367
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:42,274
Are you just going to
stand there and let her go?

368
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:46,019
<i>Would you mind if I ask why?</i>

369
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,964
For a lot of reasons.

370
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:52,535
- Oh, really?
<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> It's better all round this way, Jim.</i>

371
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,111
<i>Better for whom, Jake?</i>

372
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:58,573
Why not just say it straight out?
Better for your own interests.

373
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:02,869
Oh, and better for Harrison's own selfish
interests too, no doubt you've been told.

374
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,798
Oh, yes, Jim. He was always very
good at looking after number one.

375
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:09,468
Just leave things as they are.

376
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:21,773
Broaden your minds. Have
another beer. Have two!

377
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:09,320
Yah! Hah! Hah!

378
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,340
Jess, I'm not going to let you go like this.

379
00:45:33,435 --> 00:45:37,255
We're not going to mess up our lives
doing what other people think is right.

380
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:39,248
Listen to me.

381
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:42,719
You've thought of me, your
father, almost everyone else.

382
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,647
Alright.

383
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:48,108
But what about you?

384
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,403
What do you want?

385
00:45:57,902 --> 00:45:59,662
I want you.

386
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:06,043
Alright. You two can head on back.

387
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:14,310
Let's go home, Jess.

388
00:46:15,303 --> 00:46:19,205
The time's passed for that,
Harrison. Let's talk straight.

389
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:22,383
Jessica, are you coming with me or not?

390
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:24,802
Father, please, don't do this.

391
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:28,324
<i>Now, you can't have it both
ways. Not this time, Jess.</i>

392
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,569
Either come with me now...

393
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:34,562
...or stay here with him.

394
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:37,524
Can't you understand I love you both?

395
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,410
It's me or him, Jess.

396
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:42,913
It doesn't have to be a choice.

397
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:47,334
Jess?

398
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:50,838
I want to be with Jim.

399
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,718
Alright.

400
00:46:57,552 --> 00:46:59,263
Alright, stay with him, then.

401
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,527
You're just like your mother.

402
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,935
Right, Jack.

403
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,882
Having a good time, love?

404
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:31,066
Well, look who's here!

405
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:37,856
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> Where's the bloody silver spoon?</i>

406
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:42,602
Well, what did Daddy give you
for Christmas this year, mate?

407
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:46,265
A healthy dislike for dimwits.

408
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:52,504
I'll shout for the bar.

409
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,600
What do you want?

410
00:50:57,284 --> 00:51:00,370
- What have you got?
- Everything.

411
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,623
Well, we'll start with a rum.

412
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,876
See where we go from there.

413
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:08,546
I've missed you.

414
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:11,348
- <i>Where have you been?</i>
- Don't worry about it.

415
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:14,384
<i>Just concentrate on what you know best.</i>

416
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,023
Haven't seen you around for a while.

417
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:31,534
Looks like I'd better buy a drink.

418
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:35,547
I might have something for you
that could triple that roll.

419
00:51:49,587 --> 00:51:54,156
I think we could count on bringing
down about 60 foals from those Walers.

420
00:51:54,157 --> 00:51:57,177
And there are eight good yearling
fillies in the brumby mobs.

421
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,285
Harry.

422
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,582
<i><font color=#FF551>HAWKER:</font> They're good. Very
good. Are they for sale?</i>

423
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:30,376
- 30 or 40 of them.
- We want to keep most for breeding.

424
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:35,265
Look, my job is to supply large
numbers of remounts every year,

425
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,966
regardless of conditions.

426
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:39,311
That's why I deal with people like the Pattons.

427
00:52:39,312 --> 00:52:41,638
They're big suppliers. They
have guaranteed numbers.

428
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,707
So you're not interested in small lots, then?

429
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:46,693
<i>Well, to put it bluntly, it's not worth my while.</i>

430
00:52:46,694 --> 00:52:48,122
As good as these are.

431
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,104
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

432
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:53,141
What if we're not talking about small lots?

433
00:52:53,742 --> 00:52:56,936
How about a guaranteed 100 a year?

434
00:52:57,337 --> 00:53:01,282
Every family up here can turn off half
dozen horses as good as these in a year.

435
00:53:01,283 --> 00:53:02,684
That'll bring the numbers up.

436
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,946
Yes, but I'm looking for quality.
I want better than stock horses.

437
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:08,498
Well, the mountain horse is
bred for quality has to be.

438
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:10,667
You won't find better doing horses anywhere.

439
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:15,272
Well, you'll need a lot of cooperation. The
people up here tend to go their own way.

440
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:17,073
You needn't worry about that.

441
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:20,603
Jim's very good at getting
people to see things his way.

442
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:24,013
Alright.

443
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:26,140
I'll be back in a week.

444
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:29,894
If you can show me the
numbers, we'll talk contracts.

445
00:53:29,895 --> 00:53:31,447
<i>Right.</i>

446
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:44,033
Here! Hey! Giddy-up, now. Whoa!

447
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:46,619
<i><font color=#FF551>- JIM:</font> Let's block them up here.
<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Hold them.</i></i>

448
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,014
Righto!

449
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:51,791
- That brown horse, Charlie.
- Yeah?

450
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:56,721
And, uh... the tall bay mare there should do.

451
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:59,132
<i>You certainly go for the best.</i>

452
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,718
- That's what I promised him.
- Hmm.

453
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,822
Well, you drop them off at the new yards
and I'll see you next week with a cheque.

454
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,733
Righto.

455
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:12,970
- Altogether, that's 74.
- Great.

456
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:15,616
We'll go over to Bryce's now.

457
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:37,054
Come on, darling. If you fall
asleep there, I'll never move you.

458
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,771
I never believed I could feel so tired
and so happy at the same time.

459
00:54:47,348 --> 00:54:49,358
You should take it a bit easier.

460
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:55,606
You know, all my life I've
been judged by who I am.

461
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:59,451
Up here, it's just what I am that matters.

462
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,604
You've always had that.

463
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:05,491
You know how good it feels.

464
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:09,086
You've earned it.

465
00:55:11,038 --> 00:55:13,215
I'll keep earning it.

466
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:48,177
Did you know that Craig is trying
to undercut us... with hawker?

467
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:51,736
Not afraid of a little competition, are we?

468
00:55:51,737 --> 00:55:53,688
He's a slimy bastard.

469
00:55:53,689 --> 00:55:56,675
He's got them all eating
out of his hand up there.

470
00:55:56,676 --> 00:55:59,503
<i>That's the first time I've heard
you pay him a compliment.</i>

471
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:01,805
<i>If you call it that, Collins.</i>

472
00:56:02,206 --> 00:56:04,892
Who'd want to be the leader
of the hairy unwashed?

473
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:10,648
- It's time we paid him a visit.
- <i>Why?</i>

474
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:15,027
Let him know we're serious.

475
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:20,991
People like that should not be allowed
to stand in the way of progress.

476
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:25,153
Have you spoken to your father about this?

477
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,664
I don't have to.

478
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,517
A nod's as good as a wink.

479
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:34,671
We're all looking for action, hmm? Right?

480
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:39,667
<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Yes.</i>
- This is stupid and it's wrong.

481
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:42,137
Worse, it'll bounce back on you.

482
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:45,933
Ask him about his real motive.

483
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:51,021
- Like Jessica Harrison.
<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Shut up, Collins.</i>

484
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:54,149
Yellow streak, Collins.

485
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:57,736
Gutless.

486
00:57:01,306 --> 00:57:04,159
If that's the way you want it, I'm waiting.

487
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:10,082
I'll save my energies for Craig.

488
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:23,095
I'll see you at the Debutante's Ball.

489
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:38,777
Whoa!

490
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:48,044
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> What is it?</i>

491
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:50,331
I heard something.

492
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,960
Settle them down!

493
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:15,439
There's nothing here.

494
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,234
Arrgh!

495
00:58:26,575 --> 00:58:28,494
Very funny.

496
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,972
Well, come on, let's go!

497
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:21,338
Come on! You've already
lost two hours of light.

498
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:36,845
- Did you hear about last night?
- No.

499
00:59:37,846 --> 00:59:42,359
<i>Alistair Patton and a mob of his
mates ran into that stallion of yours.</i>

500
00:59:43,785 --> 00:59:44,945
Oh, yeah?

501
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:48,741
Young McKay was killed.

502
00:59:53,979 --> 00:59:55,956
We'll talk to you alone, Jim.

503
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,951
We'll both hear what you have to say.

504
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:03,679
- You were warned this might happen.
- <i>What?</i>

505
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:06,315
Bringing her up here.

506
01:00:06,516 --> 01:00:08,485
<i>McKay's death is a consequence.</i>

507
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:13,823
- How do you figure that?
- It was bound to happen.

508
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:18,194
Now those rich bastards will use it
as another stick to beat us with.

509
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:20,588
You put it all on Jessica?

510
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:24,292
That's not right, Jake, and you know it.

511
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,196
We're being mindful of our families.

512
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,982
She should go back to where she belongs.

513
01:00:31,783 --> 01:00:33,869
We're staying here.

514
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:39,357
Well, it's your problem...
and you fix it on your own.

515
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:42,202
<i>And you shoot that stallion...</i>

516
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:45,588
...or I will.

517
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:17,580
I liked Jamie McKay.

518
01:01:18,906 --> 01:01:21,658
- And such a happy...
- Don't, Jess.

519
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:25,954
Now he's dead.

520
01:01:30,175 --> 01:01:32,760
You mustn't blame yourself.

521
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:37,916
Can't you see? It's turned out
exactly as I said it would.

522
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:40,185
No.

523
01:01:42,805 --> 01:01:45,682
It's got nothing to do with us.

524
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:48,426
They made their own decisions.

525
01:01:49,027 --> 01:01:50,728
Will you stop trying to tell me

526
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:54,149
that we are not responsible
for our own decisions?!

527
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,327
If you hadn't trying to stop me going home,

528
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:58,679
- now this wouldn't have happened!
- Jessica.

529
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:21,810
I'll be back in a while, alright?

530
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:07,133
- Do you want to earn some money?
- Depends.

531
01:05:07,334 --> 01:05:09,219
100 horses.

532
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,221
Yours...

533
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:13,732
<i>...when they're over the border.</i>

534
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,676
<i>Worth a fortune.</i>

535
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:19,496
Settling a score, are we?

536
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,773
Does it matter?

537
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:24,442
Yeah, I prefer straight-out business.

538
01:05:24,443 --> 01:05:27,037
If we start immediately, we can't fail.

539
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:31,324
<i>I'll need a token to convince the boys.</i>

540
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:34,428
Bullshit. You could buy them for a beer.

541
01:05:35,913 --> 01:05:38,799
But... to show you...

542
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:52,646
Done!

543
01:06:00,938 --> 01:06:04,241
- How far?
- About 10 minutes.

544
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,204
Jess...

545
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:20,057
She's not here, mate.

546
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:23,459
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

547
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,930
When I got here, the place was empty.

548
01:06:29,717 --> 01:06:32,510
- Where are you off to?
- To find her.

549
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:34,021
Where?

550
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:37,608
Back down, I think.

551
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:42,411
Hey, in case I'm wrong and she comes
back, will you stay here for a bit?

552
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:43,437
Sure.

553
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:46,014
Thanks. See you.

554
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:15,960
- You've got to help me with this, Harrison.
- Why don't you go to the police, Patton?

555
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:20,266
- That's what they're for.
- I don't want the police mixed up with this.

556
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:23,145
Uh, you know the country up there.

557
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:28,775
I want you to lead a party
and bring Alistair back.

558
01:07:28,776 --> 01:07:32,421
You mean you want me to stop
him from doing something stupid.

559
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,365
<i>Bring Alistair back</i>

560
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:38,935
<i>and I'll make sure that your
loan goes straight through.</i>

561
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:44,082
How is it every conversation with
you sooner or later turns to money?

562
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:45,667
None of this would've happened

563
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:48,745
if you'd been capable of
controlling your daughter!

564
01:07:48,746 --> 01:07:53,182
Oh, it's not Jessica who's rampaging
around like some spoiled child.

565
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:57,469
Your daughter is responsible
for Alistair's state of mind!

566
01:07:58,054 --> 01:08:02,274
<i>She lied to him. Led him on.
Played the coquette with him.</i>

567
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:10,025
You know, you're a very lucky man, Patton.

568
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:15,206
In another place and not so very
long ago, you'd be dead right now.

569
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:22,922
I'm going to make allowances because
of the worry your son has caused you.

570
01:08:27,626 --> 01:08:31,680
My daughter's been the only honest
person in this whole affair.

571
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:37,561
We're the ones who tried to
twist every advantage out of it.

572
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:41,982
And now, I've been patient
enough with you, Mr Patton.

573
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:46,419
Here's your loan application...

574
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:50,749
...and there's the door.

575
01:08:55,571 --> 01:08:57,974
Don't finished with the bank.

576
01:09:05,664 --> 01:09:08,084
That's a different story altogether.

577
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:23,389
I must love you.

578
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,402
Couldn't get any further than Eureka Creek.

579
01:09:40,241 --> 01:09:41,792
Ya!

580
01:09:48,466 --> 01:09:50,342
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> Someone get a doctor!</i>

581
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:02,595
Seb. Are you alright?

582
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:06,266
Nothing that a bit of horsehair
and green gum sapling won't fix.

583
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,767
What happened?

584
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:10,419
They were driving away your horses, mate.

585
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,031
- What?
- They ran straight over the top of me.

586
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:16,401
- Who?
- I recognised Alistair Patton.

587
01:10:16,402 --> 01:10:19,914
- There was a fair mob of them.
- Get him inside.

588
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:25,427
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> One, two, three.</i>

589
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:32,876
Now do we start to fight them?

590
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:36,571
The scores are even. One
of theirs for one of ours.

591
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:38,431
That's your own son!

592
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:41,726
I'm talking about all our
sons. All our women and kids.

593
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:43,437
Oh, no!

594
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:03,348
You can't let him go alone.

595
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:15,127
Whoa!

596
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:25,279
<i>Come on, Den.</i>

597
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,065
I need you for this one.

598
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:44,498
Right. Come on, Den.

599
01:11:51,413 --> 01:11:52,965
Get up!

600
01:12:08,222 --> 01:12:10,598
Tell them to ease up a bit.

601
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:13,911
Nobody's going to be troubling us out here.

602
01:12:18,616 --> 01:12:20,167
Ha!

603
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:26,916
Hess! Come on!

604
01:13:00,324 --> 01:13:02,076
Get up!

605
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:10,709
Come on, Den. That's it.

606
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:15,172
Whoa, lad.

607
01:13:24,381 --> 01:13:26,433
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> That's Craig.</i>

608
01:13:27,476 --> 01:13:29,645
<i><font color=#FF551>ALISTAIR:</font> He's outsmarted himself up there.</i>

609
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:36,068
- There's no way down.
- Hmm. Don't forget who he is.

610
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:39,822
Haaaa!

611
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:51,292
Ha!

612
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:01,654
You killed him.

613
01:15:02,613 --> 01:15:03,655
Maybe.

614
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,357
I want to make sure.

615
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:09,537
No bloody fear! Let's get out of it!

616
01:16:18,355 --> 01:16:20,482
Oh, no.

617
01:16:24,728 --> 01:16:26,280
Not you.

618
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:35,289
What have I done?

619
01:16:39,368 --> 01:16:40,920
What have I...?

620
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:05,361
I'm so sorry.

621
01:17:08,939 --> 01:17:11,242
My poor old friend.

622
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,980
Get back! Go on!

623
01:18:36,185 --> 01:18:38,120
Get back!

624
01:19:05,431 --> 01:19:07,691
Whoa, big man.

625
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:10,277
Whoa.

626
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,491
<i>Yeah, you know me, don't you?</i>

627
01:19:18,569 --> 01:19:22,913
Now... I need your help.

628
01:19:23,914 --> 01:19:25,333
<i>That's it.</i>

629
01:19:26,534 --> 01:19:28,203
<i>I'm not going to hurt you.</i>

630
01:19:29,204 --> 01:19:30,798
<i>Just stand.</i>

631
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:33,551
<i>That's it.</i>

632
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,516
<i>I'm going to touch you now.</i>

633
01:19:44,094 --> 01:19:46,647
Come on, you wild old thing.

634
01:19:51,393 --> 01:19:53,153
Good.

635
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,231
Good man.

636
01:19:56,532 --> 01:19:57,992
Whoa.

637
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:11,579
Whoa.

638
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,116
Look at this.

639
01:20:15,992 --> 01:20:17,636
Have a look at it.

640
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:21,656
Just have a look at it. Come on.

641
01:20:21,657 --> 01:20:23,350
It's alright.

642
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:36,280
<i>Good boy. Good.</i>

643
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:38,949
Whoa!

644
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,317
Steady. Steady, now.

645
01:20:41,318 --> 01:20:45,137
Steady, now. Steady, now.

646
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:47,448
Just stand.

647
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:50,127
Alright.

648
01:21:20,632 --> 01:21:21,825
Oh!

649
01:21:23,519 --> 01:21:25,638
<i>Get back here, you...</i>

650
01:23:33,824 --> 01:23:36,126
Easy, boy. Easy.

651
01:23:57,998 --> 01:24:00,734
- Well, let's go!
- Alright!

652
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:06,365
<i><font color=#FF551>ALL:</font> Ah!</i>

653
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:47,673
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> That's it!</i>

654
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,328
Right.

655
01:25:01,987 --> 01:25:04,173
Come on, hurry up.

656
01:25:14,684 --> 01:25:17,435
Yeah, yeah.

657
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:09,804
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> They're onto us.</i>

658
01:26:10,105 --> 01:26:11,866
<i>There's hundreds of the bastards.</i>

659
01:26:13,108 --> 01:26:16,337
- Ya! Get out of here.
<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Come on! Come on!</i>

660
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:23,836
Come on. Come on.

661
01:27:56,837 --> 01:27:58,389
Downriver!

662
01:28:09,266 --> 01:28:11,017
Wait! Split up!

663
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:13,512
We'll get round in front of them.

664
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,990
Let's get out of here!

665
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,179
Get around them!

666
01:29:05,614 --> 01:29:06,842
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> Get in there!</i>

667
01:29:09,785 --> 01:29:10,996
<i><font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> Look out!</i>

668
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:06,601
Ya!

669
01:30:14,892 --> 01:30:16,443
Ha!

670
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,626
Ya!

671
01:30:42,325 --> 01:30:43,569
Arggh!

672
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:48,885
Ya!

673
01:30:53,097 --> 01:30:54,148
Get up!

674
01:31:06,902 --> 01:31:07,953
Ooh!

675
01:32:37,035 --> 01:32:40,337
It's alright. Alright.

676
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:51,458
You're the best, old man.

677
01:33:53,652 --> 01:33:55,788
You should be free.

678
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,677
Off you go.

679
01:34:45,838 --> 01:34:48,332
It's alright now, Jess.

680
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:59,543
Oh, thank God.

681
01:35:03,555 --> 01:35:05,732
You know, I really missed you, Jess.

682
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,743
I missed you too.

683
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:10,496
I was wrong.

684
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:13,708
And I was stupid.

685
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:17,628
I'm sorry.

686
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:21,122
