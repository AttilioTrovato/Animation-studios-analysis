Nah, not really,

Have you ever tried talking to her?

64

How're you supposed to talk to girls?

65
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,531
It's impossible,

66

Well, you just have to try

That's a nice bike,

00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,717
<i>- Dad!
- David,,,</i>

173
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,211
David, wait a second!

174
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:53,273
<i>Well, I'm Detective Banks,
Juvenile Division, It seems that we,,,</i>

175
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,733
<i>David,,,</i>

176
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,649
Oh, my God!

177
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,331
<i>(laughing)</i>

178
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,630
- Oh!
- Thank God!

179
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:30,747
- Dr, Faraday,
- Any signs of life?

180
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:34,684
Not outside, But we haven't been
able to determine what's inside,

181
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:38,587
Well, something must have flown it,
This could be our first contact,

182
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,052
She's beautiful,

183
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,017
Sir, this is the night watchman
who found it, Ellis Brayton,

184
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,972
Says he hasn't told anyone
except the local authorities,

185
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,283
so what we have here is a controlled
situation,

186
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,950
Watch your step, Mr, Brayton,

187
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,207
- Hi,
- Hi,

188
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:56,682
- I'm Lewis Faraday, NASA,
- Sure is a pretty piece of spacelab,

189
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,803
It was flying along, then it
just smacked right into the tower

190
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:05,640
and dragged it about 100 yards,
Then it stopped and it's floating here,

191
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:10,590
Say, I don't suppose you gentlemen
could tell me how you do that?

192
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,521
No, Mr, Brayton,
it's a matter of national security,

193
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:19,846
- Any idea how we're gonna move it?
- Are you kidding? Watch this,

194
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,142
<i>- Uh, no,,,
- (ferocious barking)</i>

195
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,349
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

196
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:35,995
Who are you? What's happening?

197
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,075
- Just rest, David,
- I don't wanna rest!

198
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,511
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We're right here, sweetheart,

199
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,867
What's happening, Mom? I'm scared!

200
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,770
Don't be scared, honey,
We won't let anybody hurt you,

201
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,038
What happened to you, Mom?

202
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,267
You too, Dad?

203
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,147
Why were those people in our house?
Why?

204
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,310
David, we don't know
all the answers to all this yet,

205
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,451
but the main thing is you're alive,

206
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,399
David, where have you been all this time?

207
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,179
All this time?

208
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:16,513
I just went to get Jeff
at the Johnsons' a few hours ago,

209
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:18,846
Get Jeff, He'll tell you!

210
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:20,805
David?

211
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,955
Who's that?

212
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,377
That's your brother, Jeffrey,

213
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:32,793
What?

214
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,387
Mr, and Mrs, Freeman?

215
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,686
Could I see you outside
for a few minutes, please?

216
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,653
<i>(Mr. Freeman) Sure,</i>

217
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:44,005
Honey?

218
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,709
We'll be right back,

219
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,646
You look just like I remember you,

220
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:09,006
This is totally rad,
I mean, you're my big little brother,

221
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:13,371
You're not my brother,

222
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:17,809
<i>Listen,,, I'm sorry for scaring you like that,</i>

223
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,719
jumping out of the tree,

224
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,740
I felt rotten about it,

225
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,987
Anybody could know that,

226
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,219
Hey, you think it's easy for me
to believe that you're David?

227
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:31,457
I mean, you should be,
like, 20 years old now,

228
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,347
I'm not really sure why I kept this,

229
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:44,751
I guess I thought
maybe I'd be able to use it,

230
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,799
You know, kind of save the day,

231
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:52,955
Mom and Dad went nuts
when we couldn't find you,

232
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,860
They made me put those things up
on every telephone pole and tree for years,

233
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:00,677
Every Saturday,

234
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:07,536
You should've seen Mom,
She kept all the stuff in your room,

235
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,404
She refused to believe that you were dead,

236
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:19,761
It's 1986, man,
Eight years since that night,

237
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,570
You little weasel,

238
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,395
Dork,

239
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,923
Butt-face,

240
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,358
<i>- Scuzz-bucket,,,
- Bucket,</i>

241
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,684
<i>Jeff,,, I'm scared,</i>

242
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,122
We'll figure something out,

243
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:50,203
- Dad, I wanna go home,
- Yeah, I know, I know, David, We want you

244
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:52,729
to come home too but the doctor wants you
to stay in the hospital a couple of days,

245
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:55,192
No, Dad! Please don't make me stay,

246
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,563
We have to find out where you've been,

247
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,867
He wants to run a couple of tests
to help you remember,

248
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:04,137
and we thought that was important,
Davey, so we said OK,

249
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,203
Mom!

250
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,504
Oh, honey, one of us
will be with you around the clock,

251
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:15,399
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you,
I promise,

252
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,148
Now, um, you two guys,
you go get some sleep,

253
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,012
I'll stay with our guy tonight,

254
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:35,627
OK, right,
Well, we'll see you in a couple of hours,

255
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:37,499
Bye,

256
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:39,627
Be cool, dude,

257
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:46,757
<i>Mom,,, have I really
been gone eight years?</i>

258
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,901
Yeah,

259
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,122
It's like a bad dream,

260
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,877
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

261

262
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,316
He's hurt! He's calling me,

263
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:10,626
What is it?

264
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:16,293
- Nothing, Forget it,
- No! What?

265
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,531
Well, this voice keeps calling,

266
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:24,933
saying something over and over and over,

267
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,295
But I can't understand very much,

268
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:30,690
Well, what is it saying?

269
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,645
<i>Something,,,</i>

270
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:38,310
I can't explain it,

271
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,569
I knew you wouldn't believe me,

272
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:46,874
No, I believe you,

273
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:54,801
You don't think I'm going crazy, do you?

274
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:59,194
Are you kidding?
They've run a million tests on you,

275
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:04,132
In fact, you're probably
the only sane person in this place,

276
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:07,661
Don't worry about it,
It was just a bad dream,

277
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,500
Thanks,

278
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:39,902
- Have you tried everything?
- Everything, It's completely impregnable,

279
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:42,523
We must get inside,

280
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:48,497
For all we know, something may be
living, or perhaps even dying inside this,

281
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:52,118
It appears to be seamless -
no way in, no way out,

282
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:07,462
- David, what time did you enter the
woods? - Around 8:00,

283
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:09,978
Then you met your brother?

284
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:13,210
Yeah, The jerk jumped out
of a tree and scared me,

285
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,447
<i>He's lucky he's still alive.</i>

286
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,979
Then what happened?

287
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:22,041
<i>Well,,, I chased him for a while,</i>

288
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:27,706
Then I reached this cliff,

289
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:32,678
Jesus! He's transmitting in alpha waves
with complex frequency patterns in them,

290
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,634
- What's going on?
- I don't know,

291
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,626
I know I fell,

292
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:40,982
The alpha waves are coming in
at 12,78 cycles per second,

293
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:44,303
He's communicating directly
with the computer in binary code,

294
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:48,180
- How the hell is he doing that?
- I have no idea,

295
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:52,326
But then after you fell,
you went somewhere,

296
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:54,213
How did you get there?

297
00:24:57,118 --> 00:24:59,130
<i>(Mrs. Freeman) What is that?</i>

298
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,226
- Is that coming from David?
- I believe it is,

299
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:08,927
<i>(Mr. Freeman) Well, what is it?</i>

300
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:12,239
How did I get out of the ravine?

301
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:15,452
I crawled out,

302
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:37,761
<i>(man) Let's get the gas jets now,
CO2 sensors with the breakers,,,</i>

303
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:41,360
Dr, Faraday, I think you
should take a look at this,

304
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,537
- Where did this come from?
- From the mind of 12-year-old boy,

305
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,036
David, what do you think?

306
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,482
No way! I'm not going,

307
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:04,251
I don't think you understand
the importance of this situation,

308
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:08,950
I don't care if it's a matter of national
security, If David says no, then that's it,

309
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:13,339
But David would get treatment
from the best specialists in the country,

310
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:17,777
not to mention technical capabilities
this hospital is not prepared to offer,

311
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,355
- Am I correct, Doctor?
- It's true,

312
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,914
<i>We've done just about
everything we can for him,,,</i>

313
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:25,123
Excuse me, I know that all sounds great,
but the fact is David has to go on living,

314
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:27,354
and he can't do that in an institution,

315
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,381
So until you can tell me something
that makes one ounce of sense,

316
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,131
then we're all going home,
and that's all there is to it,

317
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,610
- Right on, Dad,
- Yeah,

318
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:39,004
Well, I'm sorry you don't
wanna know the truth,

319
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,023
What?

320
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:44,123
The truth about where David's been
for the last eight years,

321
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:49,653
Why he can't remember, What all
this unusual brain activity means,

322
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:54,132
<i>And most of all,,, why he hasn't aged,</i>

323
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:04,010
David, I can offer you the truth,

324
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,203
All I need is 48 hours,

325
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:12,336
Just two days at the base
with me and my staff, alone,

326
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:15,291
No confusion, no distraction,

327
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:20,389
And then, David, you can go home
and put all this behind you,

328
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,867
That's what you want, isn't it?

329
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:32,854
Yes,

330
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,692
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

331
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,229
- Who said that?
- Who said what?

332
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,964
Never mind,

333
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,022
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

334
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:17,354
Well, David, this will be your room for a
while, What do you think?

335
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:22,874
- Is this stuff for me?
- Yes, it is,

336
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,310
There's no phone in here, I thought I was
supposed to be able to call my parents,

337
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:29,604
We'll make that call together
first thing tomorrow from my office, OK?

338
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:34,698
Now, look, if you wanna watch TV,
this is a remote-control wand,

339
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,049
And we'll get you something
to eat right away, OK?

340
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:39,957
Now, here's a special gift just for you,

341
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,674
Tomorrow's gonna be very exciting,

342
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:48,043
So you enjoy yourself
and we'll see you in the morning,

343
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,458
Hey!

344
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,107
<i>(man on TV)... Americans out there
who need and want to lose weight.</i>

345
00:28:57,142 --> 00:29:00,745
<i>Let's constrain ourselves.
Let's get back to the basic subject.</i>

346
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,639
<i>What can your diet do for Americans?</i>

347
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,499
<i>("Lose Your Love" by Blancmange)</i>

348
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,579
<i>Pardon me. Coming through.</i>

349
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,996
Get away!

350
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,202
Hi, I'm Carolyn McAdams,

351
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:24,967
You gotta be real hungry
after your trip, right?

352
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:27,952
- What is this thing?
- That's RALF,

353
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:29,994
- RALF?
- Mm-hm,

354
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,926
Robotic Assistant Labor Facilitator,

355
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,217
Actually what he does here
is he delivers mail and supplies,

356
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:40,947
and he messes up a little bit
every now and then,

357
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:46,553
<i>So,,, who did you murder
to get put here in maximum security?</i>

358
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:49,403
No one, I'm a national security secret,

359
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:54,535
Oh, Well, in that case,
I shouldn't be talking to you at all,

360
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,425
<i>Wait a sec! Um, how come
Starsky and Hutch isn't on?</i>

361
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,786
That show was canceled
a long time ago,

362
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:05,382
That was my favorite show!
And what's this stuff?

363
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,973
You've never seen a music video before?

364
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:15,438
Uh-uh, I've been gone for eight years,

365
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,519
Gone where? Outer space?

366
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:24,453
- Could be,
- You know something? You're a weird kid,

367
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:28,218
Me? I'm not the one with the purple hair,

368
00:30:30,718 --> 00:30:35,202
Oh, yeah, I went to a concert
with some friends last night,

369
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:39,686
Really? My mom took me to see
the Bee Gees a couple months ago,

370
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,668
- Who'd you see?
- Twisted Sister,

371
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:45,616
- Never heard of her,
- It's a him,

372
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:49,752
- Oh,
- Actually, it's a them,

373
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:56,030
You're serious about being away,
aren't you?

374
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:59,363
What was it?
Like a coma or something?

375
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,801
I can't remember,

376
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,463
All right, listen, Um, I gotta go,

377
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:08,875
Um, is there anything else you want
when I come back?

378
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,355
How about a Big Mac,
large fries and a Coke?

379
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,484
- They're still around, I hope,
- Well, now, that all depends, Do you want

380
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,160
New Coke, Classic Coke, Cherry Coke,
Diet Coke or caffeine-free Coke?

381
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:20,978
- Huh?
- Nothing, Forget it,

382
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,387
If they're still around,
then I'll do my best, all right?

383
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,010
- OK, Bye,
- See ya,

384
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:30,177
Well, come on, RALF,
Come on, Ralfie baby,

385
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:32,443
You'll make it, Come on,

386
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:48,723
All right! Way to go,

387
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:53,995
Jeff! David's on the phone!

388
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,557
They gave me a NASA cap, and
there are robots here they call RALF,

389
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:02,078
And there's a nice lady
that brings me my food,

390
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:05,742
Oh, and another thing,
They locked me in my room,

391
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:09,371
Uh, the locks are there
for David's protection,

392
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:10,710
Don't take any shit, David,

393
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:14,983
Now, don't forget your promise, Doctor,
David has to be back in 48 hours,

394
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,242
<i>Don't worry, Mrs. Freeman.</i>

395
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:19,466
Hi, David, it's Dad again,

396
00:32:22,237 --> 00:32:23,261
Hi, Dad,

397
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:28,731
We're just here fixing up your room,
waiting for you for when you get back,

398
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,097
And we'll see you soon,

399
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,621
That's great, Thanks,

400
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:35,132
We sure do miss you, son,

401
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,882
I miss you, too, Dad,

402
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:41,375
<i>I miss all you guys,,, a whole lot,</i>

403
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,640
<i>Bye.</i>

404
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,086
Bye, Bye-bye,

405
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,084
Bye, David,

406
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:05,530
OK, now, David, if you can,

407
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:10,127
I'd like you to try and remember what
happened when you fell in the ravine,

408
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:17,382
<i>Well, I tried to stop myself, but the,,,</i>

409
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:23,408
OK, everybody, remain calm,
Try to bring it back up to speed,

410
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:26,660
- What's going on?
- It's all right, David, Everything's fine,

411
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:30,936
- We're ready, sir,
- OK,

412
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:33,759
Bring the computers up
to synchronization slowly,

413
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,578
Let's see if we can latch the data
at a higher rate,

414
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:42,118
Well, what is your name?

415
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,848
<i>(woman) We're in synch,</i>

416
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:48,763
Wait a sec! How'd that happen?
I didn't say a thing!

417
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,102
Next question,

418
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:53,601
David, where have you been
for the last eight years?

419
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:56,297
I've already told you, I don't know,

420
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:06,442
What powered the craft
that you were traveling in?

421
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:20,984
Oh, my God, This kid's head is full,

422
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,386
What language is that?

423
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:26,554
- Oh, who knows what's in this boy's head?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,753
- We can spend years trying to decipher it,
- Who's putting that stuff on the screen?

425
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:33,914
You are, David,

426
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,144
But that's impossible,

427
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:43,289
- How far is it from Earth to Phaelon?
- I've never heard of the place,

428
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:47,188
How long did it take you to get there?

429
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,414
- Light-speed theory,
- That's the only possible explanation,

430
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,613
Well, what's that?

431
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:59,798
David, if you were traveling
beyond the speed of light,

432
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,842
then you could've been
gone only 4,4 hours,

433
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:07,075
and the rest of us here on Earth
would've aged eight years,

434
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,497
Well, what does that mean?

435
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:12,648
Time slows down
as you approach the speed of light,

436
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:16,787
<i>- Speed of light?
- David,,, where is Phaelon?</i>

437
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,606
How am I supposed to know?

438
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,078
He's searching through star charts!

439
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:38,630
<i>- (woman) Sir, I think he's downloading,
- (David) Wait,,,</i>

440
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:41,466
<i>(man) My God,
These are uncharted systems,</i>

441
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:44,664
<i>(woman) Our computers
don't contain this information,</i>

442
00:35:59,644 --> 00:36:02,204
- David, is this Phaelon?
- I don't know!

443
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,858
Let me out of here!

444
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,938
David! David!

445
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,738
48 hours is not gonna be enough time,

446
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,147
<i>(RALF) Pardon me. Coming through.</i>

447
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,235
Hi, there,

448
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,927
Hi, Carolyn,

449
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,472
So, how's the testing going?

450
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:40,154
Terrible, But at least
I get to go home tomorrow,

451
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:43,480
They told you that
you're going home tomorrow?

452
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,545
That's right, Why?

453
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:50,710
<i>- Nothing,
- Carolyn,,,</i>

454
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:55,557
It's just I've seen the meal sheet for the
coming week and they've got you on it,

455
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,010
- Until when?
- All week,

456
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:00,378
But that's impossible!

457
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,898
They promised it would
only be 48 hours!

458
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:08,165
You guys hear me in there?
I want out of here right now!

459
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,548
You think I don't watch television?
Wake up!

460
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,778
Hey, Now, come on,
it's not as bad as it seems,

461
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:18,044
How would you know? You've never
been locked away from your family

462
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,122
and been put in some awful place you
hate!

463
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:25,823
Yes, every time my father got new orders,
I had to go and I had to start all over again,

464
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,938
Maybe you're right,

465
00:37:30,973 --> 00:37:33,669
<i>(whispering) Carolyn,
I've got to get outta here,</i>

466
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:36,154
<i>- David,,,
- Contact my parents,</i>

467
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:39,386

Did a girl ever tell you that before?

- Who's that?
- Sit down, Navigator,

00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:48,125
- Are you the one that's been calling me?
- Affirmative,

494

You have the information I require

I do not make mistakes,
Awaiting final vectors,

Vectors? I don't have any vectors,

Campbell!

506
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:35,897
Oh, my God,

507
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:38,457
Seal all doors,
Activate penetration recording,

508
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:41,484
Activate all radiation surveillance
consoles one through 20,

509
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,599
Switch control monitors to automatic,

510
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:58,576
Dr, Faraday, somebody
has penetrated security, sir,

511
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,249
<i>- They're in the hangar now?
- Yes, sir,,,</i>

512
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:02,548
<i>- When did this happen?
- We don't know yet, We're trying to get,,,</i>

513
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:09,443
<i>(sirens)</i>

514
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,073
- Can you tell what it is?
- No, I can't see a thing,

515
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:24,471
- Do you have radiation?
- Negative, We show a cold room,

516
00:46:24,506 --> 00:46:27,642
All right,
Get the goddamn door open, Now!

517
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:32,597
We still have containment, I want security
doubled immediately, You got that?

518
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:35,671
Navigator, I detect alien life forms
approaching,

519
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:38,810
- Aliens? Where?
- Observe,

520
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:46,158
Those aren't aliens,
They're human beings,

521
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:55,048
Uh-oh, I'm gonna get it for this,

522
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,843
- Holy shit, it's an alien,
- No, you idiot, It's the kid,

523
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:02,994
- David?
- Oh, great,

524
00:47:09,308 --> 00:47:13,176
- They've got guns,
- Protective hover is advised,

525
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,513
- Will that shut the door?
- Affirmative,

526
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:19,450
OK, let's do that, But if anybody asks,
you're the one that did it, OK?

527
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:21,721
Compliance,

528
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,623
Now, just get out of the ship, son,

529
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,961
Request initial maneuvers,

530
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:58,965
I don't have any maneuvers,
I just wanna get out of here,

531
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,433
You wish to depart
hostile alien environment?

532
00:48:01,468 --> 00:48:03,065
- Yes!
- Compliance,

533
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:11,225
Wow! Did you do that?

534
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,785
Elementary maneuver, I must complete
my mission and return to Phaelon,

535
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,345
But I don't wanna go to Phaelon,
I wanna go home,

536
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,492
Navigator, I'm awaiting your command,
We must act now,

537
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:22,604
Look, I gotta think,
Just take us 20 miles from here,

538
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:23,546
Compliance,

539
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,734
What are you doing?

540
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,311
Let's get over to tracking!

541
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,979
Stop!

542
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:40,558
<i>(David) Agh!</i>

543
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:42,369
Ohh!

544
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:46,887
- You requested this distance,
- I didn't mean straight up,

545
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:50,043
- I meant along the ground,
- Oh,

546
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,323
<i>Sir, it just shot straight up
at over mach ten,,,</i>

547
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:59,360
and stopped 20 miles up,

548
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:03,402
- Take me back!
- Compliance,

549
00:50:07,676 --> 00:50:09,200
Oh, no!

550
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:11,919
<i>(woman) It's heading back,</i>

551
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:22,617
There he is,

552
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,345
Wow! How did you do that?

553
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,937
That was a third-class maneuver,
Navigator,

554
00:50:30,972 --> 00:50:34,840
Well, if that was a third-class maneuver,
what's a first-class?

555
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:35,874
Observe,

556
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:51,545
Uh-oh,

557
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:04,484
This first-class maneuver lets me to slide
through your planet's thick atmosphere,

558
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,513
I can move at any speed,
I can speak thousands of languages,

559
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:10,642
I can analyze species from civilizations
light years beyond yours,

560
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:13,250
- Yeah, but can you fix this seat?
- Compliance,

561
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,641
That's great,

562
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:19,578
- Now could you slow down a little?
- Compliance,

563
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:21,704
Cool,

564
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,783
Would you like me
to adjust the temperature?

565
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:25,261
No,

566
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,873
<i>(moos)</i>

567
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:37,706
We are precisely 20 miles from
point of origin, as you requested,

568
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:40,185
You are wasting time,
Give me the star charts now,

569
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,817
Not now, I gotta go,

570
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,961
- Go? Where?
- To the bathroom,

571
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:47,454
- Do not know "bathroom,"
- Then open the door,

572
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:49,652
Request explanation,

573
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,916
Just do it or you'll be sorry,
I'll be right back, I promise,

574
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:55,879
Do not know "promise,"

575
00:51:57,628 --> 00:52:00,824
Damn! How did that kid get outside?

576
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:05,990
We had security everywhere,
Gotta get control of the situation,

577
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:07,843
Sir, over here,

578
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:11,983
There they are,
About 20 miles west of here,

579
00:52:12,018 --> 00:52:13,900
Get some choppers out there immediately,

580
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:18,947
<i>(mooing)</i>

581
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,129
What are you doing?

582
00:52:23,164 --> 00:52:27,294
- Can't I have a little privacy?
- Do not know "privacy,"

583
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:29,433
<i>(cow moos)</i>

584
00:52:29,468 --> 00:52:32,437
<i>(voice) Moo!</i>

585
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,992
What are you doing here anyway?

586
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,825
I have been sent from Phaelon
to borrow samples of life

587
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,805
from different galaxies for study,

588
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,287
On this planet, I chose you,

589
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,936
- Why me?
- Why not?

590
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:53,167
Back on Phaelon, we discovered
that your inferior species

591
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:55,353
uses only ten percent of your brain,

592
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:58,016
So we filled it all the way up with star
charts to see what would happen,

593
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:00,825
- What happened?
- It leaked,

594
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,351
<i>- Navigator,,,
- I am not a navigator!</i>

595
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,198
Yes, you are,

596
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:08,739
I crashed into electrical towers
and my star charts were erased,

597
00:53:08,774 --> 00:53:12,523
I need the ones in your head
to complete my mission,

598
00:53:12,558 --> 00:53:16,121
So you need me and my inferior brain
to fly that thing?

599
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:21,890
Correction, I need the superior information
in your inferior brain to fly this thing,

600
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:28,800
Well, if I'm so inferior, how come
you took eight years to bring me back?

601
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,777
Normally, I take my specimens
back in time

602
00:53:30,812 --> 00:53:33,645
to the exact moment
and place I collected them,

603
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,401
Come on!
You took me away from my family!

604
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:40,462
And when you returned me,
it was eight years later!

605
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:43,481
Everything's changed, except me!

606
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:46,647
Unfortunately, we discovered
it was too dangerous

607
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,656
for your fragile human body
to travel back in time,

608
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:55,061
OK, if I can't go back in time,
at least take me back to my family,

609
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:56,170
<i>(whirring)</i>

610
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,895
Come aboard quickly, Navigator,

611
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:01,561
Not until you promise to take me home!

612
00:54:01,596 --> 00:54:04,409
We've spotted 'em,
The boy's outside the ship,

613
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:07,161
<i>(Faraday) Can you keep them
on the ground?</i>

614
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:10,654
Very well, You give me the star chart
and I'll take you home,

615
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:13,995
Come on, Let's get outta here,

616
00:54:15,804 --> 00:54:19,865
<i>- He's gone back into the ship,
- (Faraday) Don't let them take off!</i>

617
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,393
- Request instructions,
- I don't know,

618
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:26,694
<i>- Just,,, just get us out of here!
- Compliance,</i>

619
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:38,016
My God, it changed shape,

620
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:42,260
Can you follow it?

621
00:54:42,268 --> 00:54:45,931
Follow it? I can't even see it,

622
00:54:50,812 --> 00:54:53,975
- Hey, this is fun,
- Fun, Navigator?

623
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,941
- My name's David,
- David?

624
00:54:57,564 --> 00:54:59,640
Yeah, So what do I call you, anyway?

625
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,632
<i>- I am a trimaxion drone ship from,,,
- Trimaxion?</i>

626
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:05,589
- Affirmative,
- OK, I'll call you Max, It's easier,

627
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:08,625
- Max?
- Right,

628
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,394
Just take me somewhere
where they can't find us,

629
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:24,923
Compliance,

630
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:30,151
What are you doing?

631
00:55:30,186 --> 00:55:31,629
Agh!

632
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:36,697
I didn't say take us under the ocean,

633
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:40,085
All I asked for was a place
they couldn't find us,

634
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,438
This was the first place
suggested by my data banks,

635
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:46,873
- Will this thing leak?
- Navigator, I do not leak,

636
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,938
You leak, Remember?

637
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:50,713
Hm,

638
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:55,082
I must program my circuitry
for the mind transfer,

639
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,209
<i>- (creatures make noise)
- Wow! What are these?</i>

640
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:05,044
Those are the other specimens
we studied on Phaelon,

641
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:07,308
- Where do they come from?
- Don't touch!

642
00:56:07,343 --> 00:56:09,537
That is a Garpuntle
from South Petrawlis,

643
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:11,865
Once he bites, he never lets go,

644
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,166
What's this?

645
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,241
That is a Feenastarus
from the Pixar Elliptic,

646
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:21,177
Weird, What are they doing here?

647
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,345
After I drop you off, I will travel back in time

648
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,817
and take them to their homes,
just as if they never left,

649
00:56:31,612 --> 00:56:35,878
- What's that?
- A very unpleasant little creature,

650
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:38,399
- What's his problem?
- He's got a cold,

651
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:41,401
Ew, gross,

652
00:56:45,723 --> 00:56:48,658
Don't get too close, David,
They're hungry,

653
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:56,888
That could've been your head, David,

654
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,443
<i>(belches)</i>

655
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:09,933
What's in here?

00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:13,941
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!

657
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,110
What's this one?

658
00:57:21,116 --> 00:57:23,744
That is a Puckmarin
from Binpuka Minor,

659
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:25,471
He's not dangerous,

660
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:39,506
- Can I hold him?
- Just keep him quiet, I'm concentrating,

661
00:57:42,779 --> 00:57:46,306
Hey, little Puckmarin,
how long have you been here?

662
00:57:48,476 --> 00:57:49,807
What's he saying?

663
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,187
He is angry because I won't take him
back to his home planet,

664
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:56,483
He does not know
it was destroyed by a comet,

665
00:57:57,468 --> 00:58:00,301
That makes him an orphan,

666
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:06,999
I wish I could take you home with me,
Jeff would really flip out,

667

668
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,048
Listen, He's laughing,

669
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:16,217
What is the purpose of laughing?

670
00:58:16,252 --> 00:58:19,187
The purpose?
I guess it makes you feel happy,

671
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:21,386
You should try it,

672
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:24,066
<i>Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha,,,</i>

673
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,712
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

674
00:58:26,747 --> 00:58:28,085
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha!

675
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:32,152
- Nothing, No sign of them at all,
- That's wonderful,

676
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:36,562
I just lost two of the most important
discoveries of the 20th century,

677
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:40,938
- What else could possibly go wrong?
- Sir, it's the kid's father,

678
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:44,856
Faraday,

679
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:48,123
Dr, Faraday, how's David?

680
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:53,560
Well, uh, actually, Bill, it's been
kind of a rough day for all of us here,

681
00:58:53,595 --> 00:58:55,288
Ah,

682
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,291
Well, is he there now? Can I talk to him?

683
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:05,035
Uh, well, he just seemed to want to have
some time to himself, Know what I mean?

684
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,660
Well, just tell him to call me
as soon as possible, Will you do that?

685
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:12,223
Sure, I will be glad to have him
call you as soon as I see him, OK?

686
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,233
OK, Bye-bye, Bill,

687
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:17,169
Who was the last person to see David?

688
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:22,623
- Carolyn McAdams, An intern on the base,
- Get her, I wanna talk to her right away,

689
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:26,925
- Her shift ended about an hour ago,
- Just find her!

690
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,212
Gotta keep a lid on this somehow,

691
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:38,264
I am ready to perform the mind transfer,
Sit here, Navigator,

692
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:41,913
- Will this hurt?
- You will feel nothing,

693
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:45,145
- Will I remember everything?
- You will retain all data,

694
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,882
How many times
have you done this thing?

695
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,553
- Zero,
- Zero? You mean never?

696
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:54,251
I'm not gonna let you try this out on me,
What if you fry my brain?

697
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:56,728
- I will not fry your brain,
- How do you know?

698
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:59,170
I have been programmed
with superior intelligence,

699
00:59:59,205 --> 01:00:01,726
- Lie down,
- OK,

700
01:00:14,651 --> 01:00:17,176
- That's it?
- That's it, Davey!

701
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,307
Davey?

702
01:00:18,332 --> 01:00:21,927
If you want to learn to swim, you gotta jump
in the water, Don't forget to feed Bruiser,

703
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:23,580
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,

704
01:00:23,611 --> 01:00:25,704
cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame-seed bun,

705
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:28,376
Whoa! Ha-ha! This can't be happening,

706
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:31,903
I think I've gotten stuff out of you that has
nothing to do with navigating this ship,

707
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,657
You sound just like a human,

708
01:00:33,692 --> 01:00:36,627
No! That dumb dog will
never learn to catch a Frisbee,

709
01:00:36,662 --> 01:00:39,166
You are an inferior species,
you dumb dork!

710
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,656
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket, Ha-ha!

711
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:45,460
Hey, well, if you're so perfect,
what are you still doing here?

712
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:49,080
I told you, I blew a fuse
when I totaled out that electrical tower,

713
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:53,575
- I was checking out some daisies,
- You crashed while looking at flowers?

714
01:00:54,235 --> 01:01:00,367
- Sounds like you're the inferior species,
- I'll show you who's inferior, Heads up!

715
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:05,819
- Hey, take it easy,
- Well, ex-cuuuuse me!

716
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:07,716
You OK?

717
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,329
Why are we going way up here,
you geek?

718
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:16,656
Geek?

719
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:20,467
I swear to God, if I was flying this thing,
we'd be home by now,

720
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,276
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,

721
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,050
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

722
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,713
OK, turkey, you fly it!

723
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:29,239
<i>(David) OK, quit fooling around,</i>

724
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:36,229
Come on, this isn't funny!

725
01:01:36,264 --> 01:01:37,815
Do something!

726
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:43,279
- I take it back, We're equal, OK?
- Equal? You called me a geek!

727
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:48,537
You're not a geek!

728
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:51,700
Max, I want you to turn on
all engines now!

729
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:53,838
That's an order from your navigator!

730
01:01:53,873 --> 01:01:55,879
Oh, now you're a navigator,

731
01:01:55,914 --> 01:01:57,785
So navigate already,

732
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,909
It looks like it's out of control and falling,

733
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:01,944
- Somebody shoot 'em down?
- I have no idea,

734
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,675
Better do something, big shot,
You aren't even trying,

735
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,127
Come on, one of these has to start it,

736
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:13,102
<i>(Scottish accent) Scotty to Bridge, she
can't take much more of this, Captain,</i>

737
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:17,976
20,000 feet and falling,

738
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,502
You're getting warmer, Boiling,

739
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,585
Scalding! Red-hot!

740
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,613
Uh-oh, Cooling down,
Arctic, Sub-zero, Freezing,

741
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:28,081
<i>(Puckmarin groans)</i>

742
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:31,709
Oh, real coordinated, You'd better hurry,

743
01:02:31,744 --> 01:02:34,998
- Pull up,
- Impact in less than 15 seconds,

744
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:38,252
You hockey puck,
it's right under your nose,

745
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,712
Yeah!

746
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,106
<i>(woman) He's pulled up,</i>

747
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:54,777
Now if I can only steer it,

748
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,215
No way, Jos, Ha-ha!

749
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:07,672
Wow!

750
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:11,097
- Lucky guess,
- You! You nearly killed me,

751
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:15,501
You're the one who almost crashed,
I just shut down to teach you to fly,

752
01:03:15,536 --> 01:03:17,592
- You liar!
- Am not,

753
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,289
You did it to get even
with me for what I said,

754
01:03:20,324 --> 01:03:22,296
Did not!

755
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,562
- You'll get yours!
- Oh, a threat,

756
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:30,749
Oh, I'm really scared,
Look, I'm shaking,

757
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:35,202
You know, it's not real hard
to fly this thing,

758
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:36,632
Duh!

759
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:41,263
The slightest little move of my hand,
and we go that way,

760
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:45,316
- OK, which way to Fort Lauderdale?
- I only know what's in your head,

761
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:48,185
and you don't know the way
from your house to a 7-11,

762
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,917
<i>- (David) I say we go right,
- You don't know your left from your right,</i>

763
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:54,497
- We go left,
- OK,

764
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:58,458
Dr, Faraday, we've located
the McAdams girl,

765
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:01,049
She's inside the boy's house
with his parents,

766
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,320
<i>Keep them in that house!</i>

767
01:04:03,355 --> 01:04:06,984
So right now he's up there somewhere,
flying around inside it,

768
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,361
- Inside a spaceship?
- Oh, my God,

769
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:12,517
Wow!

770
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:15,558
See, Faraday had the ship
inside a hangar at the base,

771
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:18,577
and all I know is that
it took off with David inside it,

772
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:20,391
Oh, Bill, what are we gonna do?

773
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,115
<i>Faraday, that bastard! That ba,,,
He's gonna wish he never met us,</i>

774
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:29,507
Dad, there's some guys
coming toward the house,

775
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:32,492
- Do you have a back door?
- Yes, it's back there,

776
01:04:34,043 --> 01:04:38,139
It was nice meeting you all,
and I'll call you if I hear anything,

777
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:40,684
- Hey, let go of me,
- Sorry, Miss McAdams,

778
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,932
I have to take you back to the base,

779
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:45,976
- Mr, Freeman,
- Yes?

780
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:49,708
Dr, Faraday has requested
that you remain confined to your house,

781
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,677
<i>(David) It's getting dark, That's not right,</i>

782
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,710
<i>(Max) No, it's left!</i>

783
01:05:06,588 --> 01:05:08,536
See? There's Miami!

784
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,972
- Come on, let's go lower,
- I told you so, I told you so,

785
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:17,462
That isn't Miami, It's Tokyo!

786
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,921
- How did we get here?
- Oops,

787
01:05:19,956 --> 01:05:21,816
OK, take us back up,

788
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:25,378
Yeah, I knew that,
I knew this was Tokyo,

789
01:05:25,915 --> 01:05:29,476
<i>(David) You are such a liar, I'm taking over,</i>

790
01:05:31,419 --> 01:05:34,445
Japanese air command reports
visual contact over Tokyo, sir,

791
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,455
- Tokyo?
- Sir, the target has left Japanese airspace,

792
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:40,167
Well, where is it going now?

793
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:45,348
<i>(David) Now we'll get home,
First we'll hit California, then we'll go,,,</i>

794
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:48,005
<i>(Max) Yeah, Mr, Know-it-all,
who got a D in Geography,</i>

795
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,361
- How'd you know that?
- Ha-ha!

796
01:05:50,396 --> 01:05:55,390
I've told you that I don't know anything,
I was just trying to be a friend to David,

797
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:57,656
I really hope you're not hiding
any information,

798
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:01,149
- I'm not hiding anything,
- We're just trying to bring him back,

799
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:04,772
- They're approaching the West Coast,
- Already?

800
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:08,360
- Where are they?
- Heading for San Francisco,

801
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:15,887
<i>- (David) Look, the Golden Gate Bridge,
- Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat</i>

01:06:15,922 --> 01:06:19,434
Ha-ha! Don't get too close
to those cables, Agh!

803
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:22,881
Be more careful, I'm a precise machine,

804
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,868
Relax, Max,

805
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:41,880
Are we there yet?
Where are we, anyway?

806
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:46,284
Jeez, I have no idea where we are,
Gotta get directions,

<i>(both) Hm,</i>

I wonder if that's that Twisted Sister
stuff Carolyn was talking about,

<i>- (boy) Come on,
- (David) Hi,</i>

811
01:07:14,491 --> 01:07:16,982
You wouldn't happen to know
the way to Fort Lauderdale, would you?

812
01:07:17,017 --> 01:07:19,549
Try to make your directions clear
because we get lost easy,

813
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:23,007
- Fly!
- Hey! Thanks for nothing!

814
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:30,597
- Were those geeks, David?
- Yes, Max, Those were geeks,

815
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,165
<i>(David) That looked kind of like Texas,</i>

<i>(Max in Southern accent) Well, pardner,
reckon we better head this wagon east,</i>

817
01:07:38,363 --> 01:07:40,568
David, what were
those strange sounds?

818
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:42,774
- Strange sounds?
- From the geeks' car,

- I wanna hear more music,
- Can you pick up radio waves?

822
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,753
I'm equipped to receive over two million

- Kind of like a hippo, but with feathers,
