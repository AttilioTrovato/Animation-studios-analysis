1
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:26,659
- Hey!
- All right, Mr. Benchley.

2
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,773
Thank you, Coslough.

3
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,760
- Noah Dugan?
- Yeah, what do you guys want?

4
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,336
Well, you owe a lot of money, Mr. Dugan,
and Mr. Parker wants it. Now.

5
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:47,148
You've got a hell of a nerve
barging in here like this.

6
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,996
Where have you guys been, anyway?
Parker owes me.

7
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,964
That red-hot parlay l've been driving
paid off in the ninth last night

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,316
when Attaboy Star got his nose
under the wire in front.

9
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,108
50,000 smackers. Fat city!

10
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:03,721
Fat nothing, Mr. Dugan.
Attaboy Star was disqualified in that race.

11
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,467
Set back to third.
Apparently he interfered in the stretch.

12
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,349
You got 24 hours to come up with 5,000.

13
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,798
Mr. Parker's willing to wait a week
for the rest.

14
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,432
Coslough.

15
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:23,534
- That's just a reminder, Mr. Dugan.
- (Dugan groans)

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,509
Mr. Dugan, 24 hours.

17
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,317
How many jobs did you have
in the last two years?

18
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:33,614
- Six.
- And on the last one?

19
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,583
- Well, there was a little turbulence.
- l'm sorry.

20
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:43,367
The word's out. Wherever you go,
there goes trouble. And l can't afford that.

21
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:51,400
Come on, Slabotsky, l broke both arms
flying stunts for you. l need a job.

22
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:55,184
l would if l could.
Hey, why don't you try Tallmantz?

23
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,250
They're supplying all the pilots
for a war movie over at 20th.

24
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:00,209
You can fly those crates
standing on your head.

25
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:02,444
Yeah, l saw 'em.
The picture's been cancelled.

26
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:05,296
War movies are out. Rocket ships are in.

27
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:08,975
l don't qualify.
All the pilots are made out of tin.

28
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:28,332
But l got that flight gassed up, ready to go.

29
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:32,113
Not with me. No. Uh-uh.
You couldn't pay me triple to take it up.

30
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,660
Dugan!

31
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:42,514
Oh, what a surprise.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,337
Here l was just thinking about you
and you pop up out of nowhere.

33
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:50,446
Stow it, Stoney.
l need a job or l wouldn't be here.

34
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:54,445
l thought you'd never ask.
Come, l'll show you.

35
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:57,713
This is your lucky day.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,392
This is the easiest money you ever made.
A straight hop to that Pacific island.

37
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:04,723
The flight plans have been cleared.
One passenger, a bit of cargo.

38
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,383
You drop them there. Refuel.

39
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,618
- What kind of plane is it?
- Back via Hawaii. Pick up another cargo.

40
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:13,482
While you're there, take yourself a few
days' vacation. Have yourself a time.

41
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:15,445
What kind of a plane is it?

42
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,451
The word is out, Dugan.
You're in big trouble.

43
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:21,868
You've been playing the horses
and without very much success.

44
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,316
Open the door.

45
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:27,027
No job, no family, no friends
with enough dinero to bail you out.

46
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:29,614
With one exception.
Your old buddy, Stoney.

47
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,661
Open the door. Will you open the door?

48
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,833
l know. l know you're a proud man, Dugan.

49
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:38,350
A man who hates to hang his head
like a whipped dog.

50
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,586
Therefore, l don't want you to feel that
you have to be excessively grateful to me

51
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,827
for giving you this rare opportunity.

52
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,197
- Open the door!
- You got it.

53
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:51,383
(animal noises. children's voices)

54
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,829
(woman) Children!

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,935
Close the door, Stoney.

56
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,661
- Did l just see what l think l saw?
- What do you think you saw?

57
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,606
Kids and animals and a moldy B-29.

58
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,161
The kids aren't going. They're here
to wave goodbye to the animals.

59
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,924
They were all brought up
at the orphanage.

60
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,335
- No, Stoney.
- No?

61
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,597
Animals and planes do not mix. You never
know what they'll do when you're in the air.

62
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,415
lt's a hazard. lt's dangerous.
And it ain't worth it.

63
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,645
- Wait! Those are religious animals.
- What?

64
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:38,128
They were brought up at the orphanage.
The lady in charge is a missionary.

65
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,341
She said prayers over them.

66
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,358
Oh...

67
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,344
There she is now.

68
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,047
Come here, my dear.
Come, my dear, my angel.

69
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:53,816
l'd like you to say hello to your pilot,
Captain Noah Dugan.

70
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,573
Hello, Captain Dugan.

71
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,846
May l present Miss Bernadette Lafleur?

72
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,566
- And Miss...?
- Charlotte Braithwaite.

73
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,766
Charlotte Braithwaite. Who isn't going.

74
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,843
l'm so happy to meet you, Captain.

75
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,914
l've been looking forward to this day
for such a long time.

76
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:12,402
l've been telling the Captain about
the wonderful work you've been doing

77
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:15,988
with those wonderful natives
on that wonderful island.

78
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,482
- What was the name of the island?
- Makuarana.

79
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,563
Makuarana.

80
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,003
But l haven't done anything yet.
This is my first mission.

81
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:26,614
- How soon can we leave, Captain?
- With me? Never.

82
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,960
l don't understand.

83
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,330
l'm not flying you and the Bronx Zoo
anywhere.

84
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,625
- But l've already paid.
- Well, get your money back. Fast.

85
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:38,777
lt's gone.
Well, you know, expense and...

86
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:43,449
Mr. Stoney, l hope
this doesn't mean you've cheated me.

87
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,746
Because if that's the case,
there will be retribution.

88
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,642
l'm a missionary but l am not a pushover.
l'll go to the police.

89
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,329
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, please.
Dugan...

90
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,761
- Dugan, l could go to jail.
- Maybe they'll give you your old cell back.

91
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,020
What are you trying to do to me? Please,
l'll make it worth your while. l swear it.

92
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:07,541
- How much?
- Two Gs upon your return.

93
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:11,443
- l need 5,000 now.
- 5,000? l haven't got it, l swear.

94
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:14,453
OK, l want a certified check for $3,000

95
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,251
waiting for me in Honolulu
on my way back.

96
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,206
Or l don't ship your return cargo.

97
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,540
3,000? You got it. lt's a deal.

98
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:22,363
OK, let me see the plane.

99
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,554
- (child) Brutus is very nice.
- Gangway, kids. Gangway.

100
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:29,273
Watch it, kid. Those things are dangerous.

101
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:31,895
Brutus isn't dangerous. He's a friend.

102
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:34,106
Does he know that?

103
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,563
Lady, you are past your prime.

104
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:51,323
- What?
- Huh?

105
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,280
Dugan, how about it?

106
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:57,719
- (child) Petey, come back.
- Stoney, l never saw anything...

107
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,054
- Petey, come back here.
- Bobby and Julie, what are you doing?

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,990
Petey went into this tunnel
and he'll hurt himself.

109
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,196
- Oh, her duck.
- (quacking)

110
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:10,461
lt's started already
and we're not even in the air.

111
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,115
Excuse me, lady. Come here, duck.

112
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,998
Here, duck, duck.

113
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,921
- Don't worry, children.
- Here, duck, duck.

114
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:21,848
- Be careful, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, l know what l'm doing.

115
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,955
You stupid duck. Come here. Yes.

116
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,546
Come here. Come here, ducky.

117
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:30,935
Come here. l got you.
l got you, you spatulated pigeon.

118
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:33,345
Try that again
and it'll be candied yams and apple sauce.

119
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,320
- Oh!
- (bangs head)

120
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,404
Coslough.

121
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:49,120
You don't suppose our friend Dugan
is trying to give us the slip here, do you?

122
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,943
Uh...

123
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,084
Yeah, that's what l thought.
Let's get over there.

124
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,530
Stoney, do yourself a favor

125
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,891
and set a fire to this bucket of bolts
and collect the insurance.

126
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:01,305
And while you're at it,
get yourself another pilot.

127
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,930
Mr. Stoney, if he goes, l go to the police.

128
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,517
Dugan, you can't walk out now.

129
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,760
That woman has the Lord's work to do.
She needs you.

130
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,097
You're right, Stoney, l'll do it,
but we gotta leave now.

131
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:21,113
Now?

132
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,418
See that car? Two guys in there want to
talk to me and l do not want to talk to them.

133
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:29,472
l don't care what you do.
l'll fly your plane, just get rid of them.

134
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,403
OK, let's get the rest
of the animals loaded.

135
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:41,439
- But, Mr. Dugan...
- Move it, lady. We'll talk later.

136
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,216
Dugan?

137
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,458
Oh... Yeah. l...

138
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,828
l... l think he's in my office.

139
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,956
Follow me.

140
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,612
This way.

141
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:58,556
All right, Mr. Dugan, will you take Agnes?

142
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,038
- All right. She won't hurt you.
- (pig squeals)

143
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,021
OK.

144
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:23,137
Yeah, he must've stepped out for a minute.
But he should be back shortly.

145
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,819
Oh, come in, come in,
let's sit down and wait for him here.

146
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:31,012
Yes, make yourselves comfortable,
gentlemen. Sit down. Sit down.

147
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,797
Come on, you mule-headed,
slab-sided tub of meat.

148
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,839
Get up here before l leave you behind.

149
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:37,919
- Hollering won't do any good.
- Yeah, who says?

150
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:42,434
My dad. He knew all about animals. He
said you gotta talk slow and easy to them.

151
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:46,150
- Let them know you wanna be their friend.
- Kid, l don't wanna be their friend.

152
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:49,795
l hate animals.
They stink, they're dirty and they're dumb

153
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,807
and they're dynamite
when they get scared.

154
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:55,809
Brutus isn't dirty and he isn't dumb.
Watch out, l'll do it.

155
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,696
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna do it, huh?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,038
Watch.

157
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:02,211
Here, Brutus, come on, boy.
Come on.

158
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,832
(lows)

159
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,121
See?

160
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,950
Well, you can put another bug
in his ear, kid.

161
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,952
Tell him if he raises any kind of a ruckus
while we're in the air,

162
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,066
he'll end up on a barbecue.

163
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:19,782
You're the one that belongs on a barbecue,
hollering at helpless creatures.

164
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:23,331
- Helpless?
- Come on, Brutus, this is no place for you.

165
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:27,843
Come here, kid, just watch yourself.
The ramp's going up.

166
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,080
He'll be back. He'll be right back.

167
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,293
- Jimmy...
- OK, kids, we're closing shop.

168
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:37,738
Everybody off.

169
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:43,205
Miss... uh... Come on, let's get
the little darlings off, we're closing shop.

170
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,013
Be careful.

171
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,320
Follow me, children.

172
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,616
- So long, Petey, l won't ever forget you.
- You really are my best buddy.

173
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:07,106
l'm gonna miss you a lot.

174
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:12,102
And you be careful
and you be a good boy, now.

175
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,234
Yeah.

176
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:34,954
Well...

177
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:38,339
Looks like the big day has finally arrived.

178
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,796
- We're gonna miss you something fierce.
- l'm gonna miss you too.

179
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:46,540
Why can't someone else go to that
old island? Why does it have to be you?

180
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,510
Because l'm a farm girl.

181
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:53,608
l can teach them what they ought to know.

182
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,893
l gotta go.

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,327
Come on, miss, we gotta pull out.

184
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,309
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

185
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,224
Up you go. There you are.

186
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:25,647
That captain guy doesn't like animals.

187
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:30,088
He said they're dirty and they're dumb.
And he'll barbecue Brutus.

188
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,748
She wouldn't let him.

189
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:35,949
She might need help.

190
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,865
- Are we ready to start?
- Just about.

191
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:13,873
- Julie, l'm going with them.
- They won't let you.

192
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,795
They'll never see me.
l'll crawl through that hole like the man did.

193
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:23,123
- But he's started the engines.
- l gotta hurry.

194
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:27,857
- Bye, Julie.
- Wait for me.

195
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,152
- Hurry, Julie.
- l'm up.

196
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,131
Hurry, Julie.

197
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:04,460
Julie, l can't make it.

198
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,443
Hurry!

199
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:09,323
Hurry!

200
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,108
- (he yells)
- Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

201
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:18,768
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

202
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:23,475
Here goes nothing.

203
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,590
(inaudible)

204
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,474
(inaudible)

205
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,086
- Who's in that plane?
- What plane?

206
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,300
- That plane!
- Oh... Uh...

207
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,279
lt's Dugan.

208
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,706
Coslough.

209
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,846
Come on, the car.

210
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,757
(laughs)

211
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,815
Look.

212
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,431
They're waving us goodbye.

213
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,953
(inaudible)

214
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:53,494
They aren't the only ones.
Hold onto your bloomers, honey.

215
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,541
Come on, Coslough. Step on it.

216
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:12,467
The car!

217
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,370
- Coslough, do something.
- All right, Mr. Benchley.

218
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,154
That'll fix him.

219
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,580
(Benchley yells)

220
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:30,937
(Dugan laughs)

221
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,110
- Yeah!
- Who was in the car?

222
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,182
Bill collectors.

223
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,839
- You owe them money?
- Not any more.

224
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,537
Must you pollute the entire cockpit,
Mr. Dugan?

225
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,810
Oh, l always smoke cigars
for takeoffs and landings.

226
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,366
That's the tough part.
You'll get used to them, Bernie.

227
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,629
- lt's Bernadette, Mr. Dugan.
- Oh, have it your own way, Reverend.

228
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,101
(Bernadette) Reverend!

229
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:23,159
<i> lf l were a star</i>

230
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:26,908
<i> A tiny star</i>

231
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:31,710
<i> You'd be my starlight</i>

232
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:37,657
<i> Half of me is me</i>

233
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:45,847
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

234
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,288
<i> lf l were a bird</i>

235
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,842
<i> A tiny bird</i>

236
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:58,296
<i> You'd be my wings</i>

237
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:05,407
<i> For only half of me is me</i>

238
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:14,017
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

239
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,952
<i> Reaching out</i>

240
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,988
<i> And touching hands</i>

241
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:27,933
<i> ls a way of sharing</i>

242
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:34,627
<i> Having faith and caring</i>

243
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:41,216
<i> Will always see us through</i>

244
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:47,963
<i> lf l were a tree</i>

245
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:51,233
<i> You'd be my roots</i>

246
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:57,727
<i> We'd grow together</i>

247
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:01,986
<i> Half of me is me</i>

248
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:11,459
<i> The other half is you</i>

249
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:25,915
(classical music plays)

250
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,300
Do we have to listen to that junk?

251
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,409
- Junk, Mr. Dugan?
- lt's boring, Bernie.

252
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,428
Bach was one of the greatest composers
who ever lived.

253
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,642
Don't you appreciate good music?

254
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:58,467
Tell you what, Bernie, l'll make you a deal.

255
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:02,147
You turn off that noise
and l won't smoke any more.

256
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:04,125
Agreed.

257
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,094
(music stops)

258
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:14,238
(she coughs)

259
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:35,910
Well, we're on course.

260
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,638
So...

261
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,520
l don't believe it.

262
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:51,881
- Thanks a load, Stoney. Thanks a lot.
- Are we on fire?

263
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:56,965
Like everything else in this scrap heap,
the automatic pilot is kaput. Finito, finish

264
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:58,889
Oh, that's all?

265
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:04,137
Mr. Dugan, don't worry. lf you're tired
and you want a little nap, l can manage.

266
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,057
- You?
- Yes.

267
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:08,163
- You can fly?
- Yes.

268
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:13,287
Well, l've had a few hours' instruction
on the Mission's Cessna.

269
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,479
This is a little bit bigger but with some help
from you, l'm sure l could cope.

270
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,041
- Cessna?
- Cessna.

271
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:22,891
Lady, you couldn't fly this crate with
a couple of hundred hours of instructions.

272
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:28,837
l wouldn't be so sure, Mr. Dugan. Anyhow,
do what you want. l was just offering.

273
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:32,770
All right, Amelia Earhart, be my guest.

274
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:35,778
Just keep your compass at 250 degrees.

275
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,636
That's very good, Bernie, l'm impressed.

276
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,807
You know, it's amazing what a couple
of hours of flight instructions can do.

277
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:49,132
- Aren't you gonna help me?
- You said you knew how to fly.

278
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,227
- Mr. Dugan.
- Pull up. Up, up!

279
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,762
- l'm pulling.
- Up, up, up, up!

280
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,453
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

281
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,507
(quacking)

282
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,237
What the hell is this duck doing in here?

283
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,506
Just leave him alone. l'll get him.

284
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:04,614
Bobby! Julie!

285
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:06,857
- What are you doing?
- Give me him.

286
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,381
We came here to make sure
the animals made the trip safely.

287
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,788
- How'd you get on board?
- Through the Bombay doors.

288
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,636
- What? You might've been killed.
- (lowing)

289
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:18,761
- lt's Melinda. She seems awfully upset.
- She probably heard about the barbecue.

290
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,798
- Melinda? There's more kids back there?
- No, no, no, Melinda's the cow.

291
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:26,278
- Brutus's girlfriend. She's getting sick.
- Oh, great, that's all we need.

292
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,318
- What the hell did l get into?
- You shouldn't curse in front of ladies.

293
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,757
- Look, kid, don't you tell me how to talk.
- l better go.

294
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:33,317
You stay there. l'll handle it.

295
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,757
Keep your hands steady on the wheel
and follow the compass.

296
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:39,140
- You can do that, can't you?
- Aye-aye, sir.

297
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,095
(whispers comfortingly)

298
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,614
(angry lowing)

299
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,448
Ah, shut up.
All we need is another one like you.

300
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:03,525
Mr. Dugan? Mr. Dugan, wake up!

301
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,034
Mr. Dugan, Brutus didn't mean it. lt's just
you shouldn't have yelled at him like that.

302
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,598
- (snorts)
- Mr. Dugan?

303
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,582
(classical music)

304
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:24,497
- Miss Lafleur! Miss Lafleur!
- What? What?

305
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:27,344
- There's been a little accident.
- l'm scared, Miss Lafleur.

306
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:30,758
- What?
- Brutus. Brutus knocked Mr. Dugan out.

307
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,037
Oh, no.

308
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:36,335
OK, OK, OK, children.
l'm sure he'll come out of it.

309
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:41,585
Just loosen his collar. Julie, perhaps you
can wet a cloth and put it on his forehead.

310
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,960
Let me know when he's OK.
And don't worry. God is my copilot.

311
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:48,882
l hope he flies better than you.

312
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:17,803
- Peace offering.
- Thank you.

313
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,909
You're not angry any more?

314
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,315
Ah, what the hell, Bernie. lt's a new day.

315
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,676
ln about a minute, you are gonna see the
most beautiful sunrise you've ever seen.

316
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:35,859
Keep your eye back there. Back there,
as far as you can toward the tail.

317
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:40,115
Keep watching. lt happens very fast,
like an explosion, all red and orange.

318
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:45,070
You've never really seen one
until you've seen one from up here.

319
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,721
- What is it doing over there?
- l don't know, l can't believe it.

320
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,692
lt's not supposed to come in off the wing.
lt's supposed to come off the tail.

321
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,140
Excuse me.

322
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:05,011
We're still on course.

323
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:14,702
- We've been flying the wrong course.
- What do you mean, the wrong course?

324
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:16,684
l mean the battery from this cassette player

325
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,280
has been interfering with the magnetic field
of the compass.

326
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,351
lt's been giving me a false reading.
How long was that hanging there?

327
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:23,700
l don't know, a long time.

328
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,768
Oh, great. We have a certain amount
of fuel to get us to your island.

329
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,590
We burnt that up flying in the wrong
direction for God knows how long.

330
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:31,925
- So what are you gonna do?
- What am l gonna do?

331
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:35,887
l'm gonna squeeze as much mileage
out of whatever fuel we have left.

332
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,059
- Turn back?
- No, we've gone too far.

333
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,763
(Dugan) Mayday. Mayday. Boeing B-29.

334
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:04,755
Zero November Niner. One Three
Two Niner. Mayday. Mayday.

335
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:11,701
Boeing B-29. Zero November Niner.
One Three Two Niner.

336
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,315
Do you read me? Can anyone read me?

337
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:18,769
Hello? Hello?

338
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:24,822
That's great. Even if l knew where we were
l couldn't tell anyone. Did you hear me?

339
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,159
Do you really think that'll do any good?

340
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:34,576
Do you think it can do any harm,
Mr. Dugan?

341
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:51,475
- Did you find any life jackets?
- Just one and that fell to pieces.

342
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:53,457
l'll kill Stoney.

343
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:56,179
(engines sloww)

344
00:26:56,252 --> 00:27:01,206
- What's that? What's happening?
- We're running out of gas.

345
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:16,604
- Are we gonna crash, Mr. Dugan?
- Don't worry, Julie, we'll make it.

346
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,058
Why don't we just land?

347
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:22,167
Just where would you suggest
l land, Mr. Know-lt-All?

348
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:23,896
Over there on that island.

349
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:30,614
Kid, you got the eyes of an eagle.
We're gonna do it, Bernie.

350
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:47,739
We're dropping.

351
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:51,866
That happens when you've only got two
engines holding up a four-engine plane.

352
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,749
- Can we make it?
- lt gets a lot more difficult with no engine.

353
00:27:54,815 --> 00:27:56,505
So you better start praying again, baby.

354
00:27:56,575 --> 00:28:02,522
Kids, get into that engineer's seat.
Strap yourselves in and hold on.

355
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,501
OK.

356
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,190
Thanks, Bernie.

357
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:23,157
Get behind that wheel.
l may need some help.

358
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,190
- Oh, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, kid.

359
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,024
(engines sloww)

360
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,682
There they go.

361
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:53,693
l'm gonna try and pancake her
into the beach from the water.

362
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,215
(Dugan) Hold on!

363
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:20,698
(animal noises)

364
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:24,514
Come on,
let's go see how the animals are.

365
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

366
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:39,425
Thank you, Mr. Dugan. You must be
the best pilot in the whole world.

367
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:42,361
Ah, out of the mouths of babes.

368
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:51,234
Well, l'm sorry l badmouthed you, old girl.

369
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:53,723
You did real good. Real good.

370
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:57,083
Hello.

371
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:13,122
(in Japanese) l don't believe it.
l just don't believe it.

372
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,099
You just sit here quietly, all right?

373
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:19,265
l'll get some bandages and a splint. You
might've sprained it. Gonna be all right.

374
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,243
l don't think it's serious.

375
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:30,466
Well, Mr. Dugan...

376
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,218
What does the situation look like?

377
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,724
Lonely.

378
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,254
l mean, what do you suggest we do?

379
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:43,327
l don't know.
But after that l'm gonna take a swim.

380
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,281
Oh, really, Mr. Dugan, God has given us
minds and we must use them.

381
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:51,938
Positive thinking is the key.

382
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:55,837
We have been spared
and we will be rescued, l'm sure of it.

383
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:59,174
But God helps those who help themselves.

384
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,175
We must search
for any inhabitants of this place.

385
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,802
We must look for food and water.

386
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:12,735
But first we must
prepare ourselves for the night.

387
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:18,308
The corral must be built,
the animals taken out and placed there,

388
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,693
the plane interior must be cleaned so that
we can use it for sleeping quarters.

389
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:23,874
Oh, and some partition
must be put up for privacy.

390
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:27,262
- Oh, of course.
- Well, let's get on with it.

391
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:31,589
A little honest work never hurt anyone.

392
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:36,263
There's an axe in the plane. We'll use
that to cut palms to make fences.

393
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,096
Wanna bet she's also an Eagle Scout?

394
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,649
- Not bad, huh?
- (groans)

395
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:51,235
- What'd you do?
- l'm afraid l've gotten some blisters.

396
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:55,169
Oh, well, a little honest work
never hurt anybody.

397
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:01,960
- Bobby, come on, bring 'em in.
- All right.

398
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,181
Well, here we go again.

399
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:14,052
Come on. Come on, you stubborn thing.

400
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:27,715
Now the pigs.

401
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:31,882
- (laughter)
- l don't know how to grab one.

402
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:36,098
Come here, you. Come on, get back here.

403
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:39,811
(Julie) l got one!

404
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:48,227
(speaks Japanese)

405
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:54,083
(speaks Japanese)

406
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:57,445
- We'll be back.
- Well, can' t we come?

407
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,447
Absolutely not. There's no telling
what's in that jungle. You stay put here.

408
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,428
(children) Aw...

409
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,516
Come on, Julie, let's go to the corral.

410
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,169
Come on, Brutus. Come on.

411
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,085
l wonder if there are people here.

412
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:30,981
Ah, there's probably a Hilton hotel
just around the corner. Don't worry.

413
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:34,634
- l hope they're friendly.
- Bernie, l'm surprised at you.

414
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:37,573
Your religion dictates positive thinking,
remember?

415
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,607
Brutus! Brutus!

416
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,364
- Brutus!
- Brutus, come back here.

417
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:48,646
Brutus!

418
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,270
- Brutus!
- Stop!

419
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:58,663
Brutus, come back.

420
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,919
Brutus!

421
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:20,745
Brutus, you're a naughty boy, now.
Come along before l get mad at you.

422
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:24,236
- That isn't the way.
- Sure it is.

423
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,990
- Brutus knows.
- l wish l had Petey with me.

424
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:31,401
Ducks know their ways better than bulls.
This is not the way, either.

425
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,613
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

426
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:34,796
You'll see.

427
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:38,160
Tell me something.

428
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:42,351
What made you become a missionary?
l didn't think people did that any more.

429
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:46,794
- Mr. Dugan, do you really want to know?
- Of course l do.

430
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,874
Well...

431
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:52,241
l come from a big family.

432
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:55,722
My mother died.

433
00:34:56,788 --> 00:35:02,539
l was the oldest so l pretty much
raised my brothers and sister.

434
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:05,711
When they were ready to leave home,
l was out of a job.

435
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,196
The only thing l knew was helping people.

436
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:13,514
l tried nursing for a while
but that wasn't quite what l wanted,

437
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,306
so then l thought of missionary work.

438
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:20,170
Why didn't you just get married
and start your own family?

439
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:22,580
Oh, well...

440
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:26,028
l believe that wasn't the way for me.

441
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:31,918
Anyway, the welfare of others matters
more to me than my personal desires.

442
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,602
- Some guy let you down, huh?
- Mr. Dugan, you have no right...

443
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,393
l got as much right as you,

444
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:40,691
walking around with your nose in the air
like you know more than anybody else.

445
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,995
l guess when you spend
your life bossing kids around,

446
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:45,429
you think you can do it with
grown-ups too.

447
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:48,244
Who do you think you are, talking to me
like that, you insensitive...?

448
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,962
Uh-uh-uh! Don't say it, Bernie.

449
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:54,097
Listen, stop calling me Bernie.

450
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:57,135
Whatever you say, Miss Lafleur.

451
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:04,341
Come on, boy. Come on.

452
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,513
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

453
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:11,054
Look.

454
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,793
Come on, let's go tell Mr. Dugan
what we've found.

455
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:26,064
(Dugan) Must've been
a military outpost during the war.

456
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:28,887
(Bernadette) These men are behaving
as if the war's still going on.

457
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,742
lt may be they don't know it's over.

458
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,045
l read where the news
never reached some of them.

459
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:34,423
What war?

460
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,784
Well, we'll just go right down there
and disabuse them of that notion.

461
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,297
Are you outta your mind? They'd cut
you down before you opened your mouth.

462
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:44,369
- We don't even know how many there are.
- We've got to do something.

463
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:46,229
Yeah, beat a hasty retreat back to the plane

464
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:48,600
where there's a little armor
between them and us.

465
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,292
Come on.

466
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:05,904
Watch it, Bobby.

467
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:15,925
Are we supposed to hide in here forever,
Mr. Dugan?

468
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,035
What's the matter with you people?
This is no joke.

469
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:21,620
They're out there waiting for us.
They have real guns with real bullets.

470
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:23,000
l'll help you, Mr. Dugan.

471
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,239
Thanks, but that doesn't
make me feel a whole lot better.

472
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:28,025
- What would?
- A machine gun.

473
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:30,328
Well, it seems to me
you might have a better plan.

474
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:33,211
lf l had a plan, lady, l would've
kept going the first time l saw you.

475
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:37,073
- My dad could've figured out a strategy.
- Hey, how about playing General Custer?

476
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,482
We could send Brutus out there
on a cavalry charge.

477
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,817
- He might get shot.
- Yeah.

478
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:46,234
Hey, the war is over. Now, why can't
we go out there and explain it to them?

479
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:48,308
l'm sure we could resolve this amicably.

480
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:51,545
Amicably? We just crashed on their
island in an air force bomber.

481
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,882
What makes you think they'd believe you?

482
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,146
- l never lie, Mr. Dugan.
- Can you say that in Japanese?

483
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,538
Hey, l don't care what you say.
l have a job to do and l'm going to do it.

484
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,515
Look!

485
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:17,787
(they speak Japanese)

486
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:21,661
You come out! Surrender!

487
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,661
Be prisoner of war or die!

488
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:27,931
Friends, huh? Those aren't
exactly peashooters they're holding.

489
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,006
(speaks Japanese)

490
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,014
l don't believe it.

491
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,989
(speaks Japanese)

492
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,965
Last chance. l count to five.

493
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,620
One.

494
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,898
Four.

495
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,309
Three.

496
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:47,514
Five.

497
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,493
(yells)

498
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,866
Petey!

499
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,166
Petey, get away from there! Petey!

500
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:06,299
- Petey!
- Julie, stay calm. The grenade's a dud too.

501
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:09,915
Just stay where you are. Here goes.
Geronimo!

502
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,689
(yells)

503
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:24,377
- Get out of here.
- (they shout in Japanese)

504
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:42,209
And don't ever come back.
Do you hear me?

505
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,307
l guess we showed 'em, huh?

506
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:48,247
You were terrific. Wasn't he, Bobby?

507
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,072
- He was OK.
- Well, thanks a lot, kid.

508
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,302
- Those poor men. They were humiliated.
- Humiliated?

509
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:56,227
l guess you'd have liked it
if they'd shot me.

510
00:39:56,292 --> 00:40:00,089
- l did not say that, Mr. Dugan.
- Well, then stop feeling sorry for them.

511
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,230
l still think we should make friends
with them. Your way isn't the answer.

512
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,729
l don't believe you, lady.

513
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,578
We nearly get killed and you wanna
open a Sunday school for the enemy.

514
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:13,215
You listen and you listen good. l'm in
command here and l say that nobody,

515
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:17,278
but nobody's, gonna open peace
negotiations with those guys until l say so.

516
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:18,810
Understand?

517
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,339
Now, we'll have to stand watch
throughout the night.

518
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:24,259
You take the kids back to the plane.
l'll take the first half.

519
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:26,234
Move it!

520
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,858
Let's go.

521
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,383
(Julie) Good night.

522
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,364
Good night.

523
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,495
Mr. Dugan was very brave today,
Bobby.

524
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:14,972
l still don't like him.

525
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:47,044
l thought you only smoked
on takeoffs and landings.

526
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:49,218
Yeah, but tonight's special.

527
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:53,347
l figure if l'm gonna go,
l wanna be doing something l like.

528
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,970
- l wanna talk to you.
- What about?

529
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:05,572
Well, if l have been less than considerate
to your feelings,

530
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:07,878
l'd like to apologize.

531
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:13,668
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

532
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,455
l just think that l may have said some
things to you that l shouldn't have.

533
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:24,936
l guess that goes for me too, Bernie.

534
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:30,633
l think we share a common problem.

535
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:34,660
We both seem to have a certain difficulty
with relationships.

536
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:39,171
l just want to say
that l'd like to try and get along better.

537
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,129
All right?

538
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:51,137
OK.

539
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:57,158
lt's my turn on guard.

540
00:42:57,228 --> 00:42:59,138
Yeah...

541
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:03,557
Well, if you hear anything, holler.

542
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,865
Be careful of that.

543
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:11,106
lt would be the Christian thing to do to
make friends with them if they come back.

544
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,548
Wouldn't it?

545
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:15,849
Don't forget to holler.

546
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,073
Hey, kids, did you see Bernie?

547
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:38,052
No, why?

548
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:46,884
- Where are you going?
- To find Bernie.

549
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,347
She's probably started
World War lll by now.

550
00:43:49,423 --> 00:43:51,845
He really is a pain.

551
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:55,530
Come on, let's go swimming.
l'm gonna beat you.

552
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,503
Hello, in there.

553
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,638
l come in peace.

554
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:08,591
Anybody home?

555
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:21,873
Don't be afraid. l'm a friend.

556
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:30,536
Hello?

557
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:05,330
(men speaking in Japanese)

558
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:08,849
(yelling in Japanese)

559
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,827
No, wait!

560
00:46:12,245 --> 00:46:14,385
Please.

561
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:19,156
l come in peace. ln the name
of the Universe Society of Quebec.

562
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:22,092
We're a friendly mission.
We wish you no harm.

563
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:25,068
- Go on.
- Non.

564
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:28,852
l must speak with you. lt's very important.

565
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:33,043
lt's about the war with America.

566
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:35,571
The war is over.

567
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,645
Bernie?

568
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:49,422
(insects buzz. he groans)

569
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:56,310
Bulls and ducks, a cow, kids.
What'd l ever do to deserve this?

570
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,319
Bernie?

571
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:00,172
Mmm!

572
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:02,157
- Mmm?
- Hmm-hmm!

573
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:08,721
- Dozo.
- No, thank you, l can't eat another thing.

574
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,160
- Thank you.
- You like?

575
00:47:11,225 --> 00:47:13,876
l like. Too much.

576
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:19,313
You lucky. Today me cook.
Tomorrow Commander Hiro.

577
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:21,108
Hiro! Hiro!

578
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:23,087
Him not so good.

579
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:26,094
(they laugh)

580
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:36,271
(distant Japanese)

581
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:52,187
- (soldier) Take that.
- (Bernadette) No, please, no more.

582
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:55,928
- l've had enough.
- (the men laugh)

583
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:06,872
(Hiro yells)

584
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,194
Stop!

585
00:48:11,227 --> 00:48:14,839
Hiro, Cleveland, stop.
Mr. Dugan's a friend.

586
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:17,210
(Cleveland speaks Japanese)

587
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:21,238
- What's going on?
- Look what you've done.

588
00:48:21,308 --> 00:48:24,472
- You've ruined everything.
- l ruined...?

589
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:28,180
You mean they weren't torturing you?

590
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:31,286
l'm perfectly fine. Can't you see that?

591
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:33,593
The war is over, Mr. Dugan.

592
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:42,619
And now l would like to introduce,
from the lmperial Japanese Navy,

593
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:44,857
Commander Hiro.

594
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,867
Hiro.

595
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:49,146
- And Lieutenant...
- Kurishima.

596
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:51,221
Known as Cleveland.

597
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:55,155
- Captain Dugan.
- (Cleveland speaks Japanese)

598
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:01,144
- Cleveland?
- Mm. My mother visit America in 1 924.

599
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:04,281
Her favorite city, Cleveland.

600
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:06,772
Name me for that.

601
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,880
Teach me first-class Eng-rish.

602
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,828
Yes...

603
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:20,052
They have been here for 35 years with
no contact with the world, not even a radio.

604
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:25,179
But they know now we are going to be
very good friends. Aren't we?

605
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,957
(speaks Japanese)

606
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,236
(Cleveland) Yes. Friends.

607
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:37,118
Now, everyone clasp hands.

608
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,695
(Cleveland speaks Japanese)

609
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:45,782
(Bernadette) Mr. Dugan.

610
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,521
Friends.

611
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:56,502
(Japanese)

612
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:04,992
That's when they lost their comrades,
the radio.

613
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:12,475
They spent years transporting
what they had left up to the hill.

614
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:16,321
l mean, what courage.

615
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:18,905
What perseverance.

616
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:23,997
- You're very quiet, Mr. Dugan.
- l told you not to leave.

617
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:29,816
That's it. Your pride's hurt.
l was dictated by a higher authority.

618
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,646
Huh? Oh...

619
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:34,976
Yeah, well, l was worried about you
and l thought you might need my help.

620
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,279
l can take care of myself
just fine, thank you.

621
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:39,552
You don't give an inch, do you?
What if they'd hurt you?

622
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,213
- But they didn't.
- How was l to know?

623
00:50:41,284 --> 00:50:45,310
So you came charging in
like a bull in a china shop.

624
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,867
Well, Mr. Dugan,
you, like the rest of the world,

625
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:52,446
must learn that violence
is not the only solution to problems.

626
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,217
Well, enough of that.
Let's get the food ready.

627
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,772
You get it ready. l'm not hungry.

628
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,059
l'm sorry.

629
00:51:30,246 --> 00:51:32,100
l said l was sorry.

630
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:38,301
- You'll wake the children.
- Well, we can go outside.

631
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:03,654
- Julie, come on.
- OK, l'm coming.

632
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:14,242
- l don't want to fight any more.
- Neither do l.

633
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:19,299
Look, l may do things differently than
what you like but l was trying to save you.

634
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:23,045
- l know that now, Mr. Dugan.
- Would you please stop with this Mr. stuff?

635
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:26,723
You only make me feel like my old man.
Dugan. Just Dugan. That's enough.

636
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:28,319
Right, Dugan.

637
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:35,104
Look, Bernie, l must've walked five miles
tonight trying to figure out what l'm feeling.

638
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:39,334
What hit me is... l care about you.

639
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:53,254
- l'm sorry.
- Shh.

640
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,486
- Good night.
- Good night.

641
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,421
- (Bobby) Look out.
- 'Night, kids.

642
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:09,956
- How can she like him?
- Well, he's kinda cute.

643
00:53:10,027 --> 00:53:11,936
Cute?

644
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:14,662
Well, you know, Bobby, he's really funny.

645
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:17,481
He reminds me of Petey
when l first got him,

646
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:22,336
always squawking and trying to peck
people, but he didn't mean it.

647
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:26,345
l'm right about him. You'll see.

648
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,419
Pull!

649
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:31,787
- We won't make it, Dugan.
- We'll make it.

650
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:33,924
These extra fuel tanks
are made out of rubber.

651
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:37,542
We can make a raft out of them
and we can float off this mud pile.

652
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,270
- lt'll never work.
- Why not?

653
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,788
All you did as a pilot was get us
crashed on a desert island.

654
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,769
So how come you think
you can be a sea pilot?

655
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:49,384
Robert, the fact that we were off course
was not Mr. Dugan's fault.

656
00:53:49,453 --> 00:53:52,235
Kid, when your muscles are as big
as your mouth you'll be a real help,

657
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,243
so shut up and pull.

658
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:56,139
Come on, pull.

659
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,348
- (they speak Japanese)
- Pull!

660
00:54:04,365 --> 00:54:06,276
Make raft.

661
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:09,546
Sail away.

662
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:12,297
Go home. Be happy.

663
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,703
(they speak Japanese)

664
00:54:34,094 --> 00:54:36,266
Raft idea, no good.

665
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:38,636
On ocean, you die quick.

666
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:41,801
Well, if you've got a better idea, let's hear it.

667
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:45,646
(he speaks Japanese)

668
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:55,500
(they speak Japanese)

669
00:55:09,777 --> 00:55:12,395
Commander, number one officer.

670
00:55:12,465 --> 00:55:15,694
Him idea, number one.

671
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:18,696
No make raft. Make boat.

672
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:21,737
- Make a boat out of what?
- Out of prane.

673
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,192
- Prane?
- l have problem with Rs.

674
00:55:25,265 --> 00:55:27,883
You'll have a lot more trouble
making a boat out of that plane.

675
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:31,499
But prane already is boat.
Just wrong side up.

676
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,847
- What?
- (they speak Japanese)

677
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:39,304
You see, turn prane over. What you got?

678
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:43,656
- An upside-down plane.
- No!

679
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,323
You got boat.

680
00:55:45,394 --> 00:55:47,304
Look see. Look see.

681
00:55:47,634 --> 00:55:51,278
Tail become a rudder.

682
00:55:52,146 --> 00:55:53,575
Rudder, huh?

683
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:58,285
And wings inside empty. Float good.

684
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,137
- Better than raft.
- Better than raft, huh?

685
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:04,552
Make big sail. Have good power.

686
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,602
You'll still have
one wing bigger than the other.

687
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:08,463
That's gonna put you off balance.

688
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,498
Then the engines are gonna pull you down
in the water. No, l don't think so.

689
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,058
Oh, easy fix. No problem.

690
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:16,040
You like idea?

691
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:21,198
- l guess you think it's a great idea, huh?
- Yeah, l like it.

692
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:24,650
Well, l don't. l'm not so sure
l want anyone chopping up my plane.

693
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:27,953
Oh, believe me, it no fly again.

694
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,922
You want stay here
until someone find you?

695
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:37,161
- Well, a couple of days, a few weeks.
- How about... 35 years?

696
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:48,848
That's great. l'm proud of you.

697
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:53,259
- (Hiro laughs)
- l'm really proud. That's pretty great.

698
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,980
Why didn't l think of this?

699
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,603
Huh?

700
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:06,386
(Cleveland) Pull! Pull! Everybody pull!

701
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:21,870
OK!

702
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,116
(they yell)

703
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,924
lt's going.

704
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:41,237
Hey, those guys really know
what they're doing.

705
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,604
(they argue in Japanese)

706
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:42,360
We're ready now. Turn over.

707
00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:37,139
(motor)

708
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:40,568
OK?

709
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:42,547
(speaks Japanese)

710
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:51,542
(they speak Japanese)

711
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:00,854
Oh...

712
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:06,337
l need a very large piece
to put in the center.

713
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:09,624
(speaks Japanese)

714
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:24,760
(speaks Japanese)

715
01:01:28,738 --> 01:01:30,648
(speaks Japanese)

716
01:01:34,242 --> 01:01:39,261
Our flag strong. Make good sail. You use.

717
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:42,398
Thank you. Very much.

718
01:01:43,236 --> 01:01:46,051
l'll put it at the top of the sail.

719
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:48,571
A place of honor.

720
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:51,513
(speaks Japanese)

721
01:02:08,772 --> 01:02:11,772
- What you doing?
- Getting the animals on board.

722
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:13,568
The animals can't come.

723
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:19,326
What?

724
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:23,740
Well, it's dangerous enough without them.
We gotta save ourselves.

725
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:25,820
You mean
you're just gonna leave them here?

726
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:29,538
Well, they're only animals.
They'll be fine.

727
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:33,309
- Look, l know you like them.
- l love them.

728
01:02:33,381 --> 01:02:35,389
They trust us to take care of them.

729
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:38,146
- Yeah, l understand...
- (Bobby) You don't understand.

730
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:41,313
You don't know about loving them
because you don't even like them.

731
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:44,994
Julie told me you were just teasing
about Brutus but you really meant it.

732
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:47,451
- This proves it.
- Now, wait a minute.

733
01:02:47,526 --> 01:02:51,716
You be quiet. You got stuck with all of us
and now you want to get rid of us.

734
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:55,079
Julie told me you were really nice
underneath and you just talk grouchy,

735
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:58,591
and she said she was
gonna still love you anyway.

736
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:03,073
Well...

737
01:03:03,143 --> 01:03:07,616
- Look, Julie, you have to understand...
- You still think he's so great, after all?

738
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:11,299
He's gonna leave the animals here to die.
Do you?

739
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:25,790
Julie...

740
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:30,311
lf we're gonna take the animals with us,

741
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:34,054
we'd better make them
comfortable beds to sleep in. OK?

742
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:38,110
OK.

743
01:03:38,186 --> 01:03:40,128
l love you, Mr. Dugan.

744
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:43,263
Bobby! Bobby!

745
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:48,225
Bobby, the animals
can come on the plane with us.

746
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:50,402
Bobby?

747
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:56,263
What's this?

748
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:01,249
- Do you like it?
- Well, l hate the name Noah.

749
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:02,599
Oh...

750
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:05,033
l'm sorry. l didn't know.

751
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,734
No, wait a second. lt could be worse.

752
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:12,673
- l guess we could leave it.
- Yes?

753
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,657
Yeah.

754
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:35,841
(inaudible)

755
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:53,195
Bernie! Bernie!

756
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:55,202
Any sign of them?

757
01:04:55,949 --> 01:04:59,397
- Have you seen them? Where are they?
- l don't know.

758
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:02,764
lt's almost high tide. lf they don't get her
soon, we've blown a whole day.

759
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:04,585
- Are the supplies loaded?
- All loaded.

760
01:05:04,653 --> 01:05:09,225
Well, we gotta go now.
Bobby, are the animals secure?

761
01:05:09,294 --> 01:05:10,722
They're OK.

762
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:14,789
lf that plane sinks because of those
animals, l'm gonna cut my throat.

763
01:05:14,862 --> 01:05:16,684
- Get ready.
- We can't leave without them.

764
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,433
lt's OK, they'll swim out after us.

765
01:05:59,696 --> 01:06:01,605
(shouted Japanese)

766
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:05,355
Yes, wait for us!

767
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:08,589
- You wait! Wait! Wait!
- Come on.

768
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:12,235
- OK, we're coming, we're coming. Wait.
- Come on!

769
01:06:12,304 --> 01:06:14,214
(Cleveland) OK, wait!

770
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,988
- What kept you guys?
- We take care of business. Hurry.

771
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:41,677
But l thought you told me
high tide was at 1 1 .00.

772
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:44,911
Yes, 1 1 . Hurry, hurry.

773
01:06:44,979 --> 01:06:46,954
Of course. 1 1 .

774
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:51,663
Please, you hurry, hurry. Get plane to sea.

775
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,738
Well, OK, OK, but you're the one...

776
01:06:53,811 --> 01:06:55,720
(explosion)

777
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:16,333
- l don't believe it.
- Orders.

778
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:19,306
Leave island, leave nothing.

779
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:25,261
Well, what if we're not ready? lf the plane
breaks up, if we gotta go back for repairs?

780
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,715
All of your equipment, nothing left?

781
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:32,651
- Commander Hiro very efficient.
- Hiro.

782
01:07:32,725 --> 01:07:34,318
Nothing.

783
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:41,836
Well, everybody, you know what
you have to do. Take up your positions.

784
01:07:43,638 --> 01:07:48,656
<i> lf l were a star</i>

785
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:51,791
<i> A tiny star</i>

786
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:56,651
<i> You'd be my starlight</i>

787
01:07:56,726 --> 01:08:00,687
<i> Half of me is me</i>

788
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:08,242
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

789
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:14,420
<i> lf l were a bird</i>

790
01:08:14,486 --> 01:08:17,520
<i> A tiny bird</i>

791
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:20,723
<i> You'd be my wings</i>

792
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:27,153
<i> For only half of me is me</i>

793
01:08:27,223 --> 01:08:34,130
<i> The other half of me is you...</i>

794
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,270
Good work, you guys.

795
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:52,912
Well, Bernie, next stop, Hawaii.

796
01:08:52,984 --> 01:08:54,894
God willing.

797
01:09:00,985 --> 01:09:05,841
<i> lf l were a tree</i>

798
01:09:05,914 --> 01:09:09,045
<i> You'd be my roots</i>

799
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:12,495
<i> We'd grow together</i>

800
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:18,709
<i> Half of me is me</i>

801
01:09:18,778 --> 01:09:27,540
<i> The other half is you</i>

802
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:10,936
- Dugan.
- What is it?

803
01:10:11,005 --> 01:10:13,208
l'm sorry, l had to wake you. lt's important.

804
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:17,073
l was reading the Bible and l got
an idea about sending a message.

805
01:10:17,149 --> 01:10:19,124
Oh, is there a chapter on radio repair?

806
01:10:19,197 --> 01:10:20,920
Genesis 8:8.

807
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:23,804
And Noah sent forth a dove from him

808
01:10:23,869 --> 01:10:27,218
to see if the waters were abated
off the face of the ground.

809
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:30,643
Only one thing, Bernie.
We don't have a dove.

810
01:10:30,718 --> 01:10:33,019
We're counting on you
to deliver this message, Petey.

811
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:37,276
So keep heading that way
until you get there. Got it?

812
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:40,157
(shouted Japanese)

813
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:51,157
Be careful, Petey.

814
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,445
- ls he gonna make it?
- lf he does, he'd better speak Chinese.

815
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,421
Hawaii's the other way.

816
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:07,582
Maybe lucky tomorrow. Catch fish.

817
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:10,943
Oh, yeah, we could use some.

818
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,261
Julie.

819
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,240
Dear Lord,
thank you for what we are about to eat

820
01:11:21,312 --> 01:11:23,995
and let us be truly thankful.

821
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:30,495
And if you have an extra minute,
give Petey a little push towards Hawaii.

822
01:11:31,105 --> 01:11:33,014
Please.

823
01:11:57,442 --> 01:12:00,409
Good girl, Melinda, you're doing just fine.

824
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,898
Here, Brutus. Here. Here.

825
01:12:04,515 --> 01:12:08,312
Brutus, you have to try and eat something
or you'll starve.

826
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:11,386
Good thing you're not seasick, Melinda.

827
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:14,045
Any eggs in the chicken coops, Bobby?

828
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:16,351
l'm going to check now.

829
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,192
Still no luck, huh?

830
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:27,259
Yes, no fish.

831
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:29,665
Well, maybe you're using
the wrong kind of bait.

832
01:12:29,732 --> 01:12:31,641
(speaks Japanese)

833
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:36,345
(Hiro speaks Japanese)

834
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:43,036
Commander Hiro say,
something wrong, not our fault.

835
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:53,376
- l got five, Julie.
- (sighs) Well, that's better than four.

836
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:56,128
l'll take them to the kitchen.

837
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:17,601
Hey, Brutus, try this.
lt's real good for you.

838
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:22,307
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- l'm trying to make Brutus better.

839
01:13:22,374 --> 01:13:24,382
Not any more you're not.

840
01:13:24,454 --> 01:13:27,422
That's our food supply
and l won't have you throwing it away.

841
01:13:27,495 --> 01:13:29,218
- lt's only a little bit.
- Look, kid.

842
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:33,148
Our rations aren't gonna last forever
so let's get one thing straight.

843
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:36,353
Animals get animal food, not people food.

844
01:13:45,831 --> 01:13:48,963
You dish that out. l'll take care of this.

845
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:52,514
Oh...

846
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:55,201
Share this with Hiro and Cleveland.

847
01:13:55,271 --> 01:13:57,182
- OK. Thank you.
- OK?

848
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,404
- For you, sir.
- ls this mine?

849
01:14:02,473 --> 01:14:05,124
- Yes.
- l can do whatever l want with it, right?

850
01:14:05,193 --> 01:14:08,095
- Oh, yes.
- Then l'm gonna give it to Brutus.

851
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:11,235
Now l know why he likes animals.
He's as stubborn as a mule.

852
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:14,239
Mules aren't stubborn.
lt's just that some people are too dumb

853
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:16,996
to get 'em to do
what they want 'em to do.

854
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:20,775
- He doesn't mean to be rude.
- Don't give me any of that orphan boy flak.

855
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:22,751
He'll make out OK. l did.

856
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:41,927
l'm sorry, Miss Lafleur. We checked
every coop. There aren't any eggs.

857
01:14:44,298 --> 01:14:47,714
All right, Bobby. Thank you.

858
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:57,289
Well, if our friends
don't come up with some fish soon,

859
01:14:57,355 --> 01:14:59,940
we're down to emergency rations.

860
01:15:00,715 --> 01:15:02,788
The hens aren't laying any more.

861
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:04,964
Melinda, she doesn't want
to give any more milk.

862
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:07,686
Yeah, l know. And l'm sick of rice.

863
01:15:07,756 --> 01:15:09,698
Well,
if the chickens aren't laying any more.

864
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,904
- Yes, that's what l had on my mind.
- No.

865
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:17,128
Bobby, l know how you feel
but l'm afraid we're gonna have to.

866
01:15:17,196 --> 01:15:20,360
We wouldn't have to if Hiro and Cleveland
knew how to catch fish.

867
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:24,357
The Japanese invented fishing, kid.
lf they can't catch them, nobody can.

868
01:15:24,428 --> 01:15:26,184
- l bet l can.
- Sure...

869
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:28,673
Sure. What are you gonna do,
talk them into taking the bait?

870
01:15:28,748 --> 01:15:32,710
Now, you look. Me and Frankie used to
catch a lot of fish back at the orphanage.

871
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:34,690
l'm not in the mood
for a kid story right now.

872
01:15:34,765 --> 01:15:37,285
l may be a kid
but that doesn't mean l'm stupid.

873
01:15:37,357 --> 01:15:39,561
Bobby, that's enough.
Captain Dugan just can't...

874
01:15:39,629 --> 01:15:42,182
Bernie, he's right.

875
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:44,678
Let's hear him out.

876
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:49,355
Well, you see, there was a stream
where we used to catch catfish.

877
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:53,994
You see, what we'd do is hang a lantern
over the side of our rowboat at night.

878
01:15:54,062 --> 01:15:57,510
And then, you see, the fish would swim up
to the lantern to see what it was.

879
01:15:57,582 --> 01:16:00,930
So, why couldn't we
fix up some kind of light here?

880
01:16:01,006 --> 01:16:03,210
Bobby, you're a genius.

881
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:07,173
We've got the biggest lanterns you could
want. Come on, kid, let's go fishing.

882
01:16:08,014 --> 01:16:09,924
(motor)

883
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:18,413
OK!

884
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:21,542
- OK!
- OK!

885
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:27,783
- OK.
- Right.

886
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,913
Not bad, eh?

887
01:16:43,984 --> 01:16:46,089
Very nice, nice.

888
01:16:49,233 --> 01:16:54,153
- Look, Miss Lafleur.
- l know. lt's like our private aquarium.

889
01:16:54,224 --> 01:16:58,250
Come. Let's tell the others to start fishing.
There's a lot.

890
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,997
- Can't l stay and watch?
- You can watch later. Come on.

891
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:05,065
- The more lines out, the better.
- All right.

892
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,359
(she hums Frre Jacques)

893
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:33,739
(stops humming)

894
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:38,920
(she screams)

895
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:44,881
Julie?

896
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:46,857
Julie?

897
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,976
Julie!

898
01:17:49,811 --> 01:17:52,146
Take it easy, Julie. What's the matter?

899
01:17:52,212 --> 01:17:55,954
Out there. l saw a shark.

900
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:58,986
- Why, Julie, it's all right.
- He came at me.

901
01:17:59,059 --> 01:18:01,777
Yes, yes, but it's all right now. OK, OK.

902
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:05,259
Commander say, shark reason no fish.

903
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:07,056
Then we gotta get rid of the shark.

904
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:11,697
- Ah, dangerous at night.
- Well, it's now or no more fish.

905
01:18:11,765 --> 01:18:13,521
- Are you with me?
- l'm with you.

906
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,498
(speaks Japanese)

907
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,053
OK.

908
01:18:19,124 --> 01:18:20,652
OK, we catch.

909
01:18:22,517 --> 01:18:24,427
(speaks Japanese)

910
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,541
That's all we have left.

911
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,713
Well, we can't help it, Bernie.
We gotta use it.

912
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:45,557
Cast thy bread upon the waters
for thou shalt find it after many days.

913
01:18:45,623 --> 01:18:47,565
- Dugan.
- Ecclesiastes.

914
01:18:47,638 --> 01:18:50,027
Stick around, Bernadette,
l'm full of surprises.

915
01:18:50,102 --> 01:18:52,012
Tell the kids to stay below,
it could get rough.

916
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:55,218
- All right.
- (speaks Japanese)

917
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:58,517
- Put it in.
- (speaks Japanese)

918
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:12,204
Shark! Shark!

919
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:37,907
Come on! Come on! Get the rope!

920
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:42,451
(they speak Japanese)

921
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:49,616
(Dugan) Hold on. Tie it down.

922
01:19:51,097 --> 01:19:53,967
Hold on. Hold on.

923
01:19:55,867 --> 01:19:59,215
Be careful. Just hold on. Keep holding.

924
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,264
(Dugan) Hold on.

925
01:20:06,746 --> 01:20:11,831
Just keep holding on with all your might.
Keep pulling on it. Pull!

926
01:20:16,731 --> 01:20:22,744
- What happened? l thought you had him.
- Hey, you, get off of there, just get off!

927
01:20:26,395 --> 01:20:28,217
Bobby!

928
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:32,503
- Mr. Dugan!
- No, Dugan! No, no! No, Dugan!

929
01:20:32,571 --> 01:20:35,190
- (Cleveland) No, don't jump.
- (Bobby) Mr. Dugan!

930
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,464
(Cleveland) Come back, Dugan!

931
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:41,722
- (splutters)
- Don't worry. Come on. Let's get out.

932
01:20:41,788 --> 01:20:43,698
Please, God, help him.

933
01:20:51,773 --> 01:20:53,660
The shark! The shark, Dugan!

934
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:58,707
Dugan, come back! Hurry! Hurry!

935
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,260
Come on, Dugan! Hurry! Hurry!

936
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,641
Hurry! Come on, come on, Dugan! Hurry!

937
01:21:49,632 --> 01:21:51,355
(Julie) Bobby! Bobby!

938
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:53,146
You OK?

939
01:21:59,072 --> 01:22:02,519
l... l was wrong about you, Mr. Dugan.

940
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:05,243
- l'm sorry.
- You're sorry, huh?

941
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:09,372
When the hell are you gonna get it through
that skull of yours to do what you're told?

942
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:13,881
You nearly got yourself killed.
You nearly got me killed.

943
01:22:14,913 --> 01:22:18,557
Cleveland, take him downstairs
and get him changed.

944
01:22:18,624 --> 01:22:20,861
Right, OK. Here we go.

945
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:30,006
That was a very good shot.

946
01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:38,110
Drink, drink.

947
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:40,087
ls hot.

948
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,902
ls good for you.

949
01:22:48,963 --> 01:22:50,588
Julie. Cleveland.

950
01:22:50,658 --> 01:22:53,113
Could you leave us alone
just for a minute, please?

951
01:22:53,186 --> 01:22:55,096
(speaks Japanese)

952
01:23:02,626 --> 01:23:04,634
Well, how are you feeling?

953
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:07,321
l'm OK.

954
01:23:10,723 --> 01:23:13,145
l'm sorry
l had to come down on you so hard.

955
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,347
But you were right.
lt was a dumb thing to do.

956
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:19,484
l won't ever do anything like it again.

957
01:23:19,555 --> 01:23:23,550
Well, everybody does a dumb thing
every once in a while.

958
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,530
Friends?

959
01:23:30,276 --> 01:23:32,186
Friends.

960
01:23:47,494 --> 01:23:50,177
Well, we're on our way again.

961
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:55,203
What's the matter?

962
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,987
Come on, what's up?

963
01:23:58,054 --> 01:24:01,852
lt's funny. We're floating around
in the middle of nowhere

964
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:05,342
and this morning it hit me, it's all my faul

965
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:08,349
- Oh, Bernie!
- lt's my fault.

966
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:13,827
l dream up this idea
of making farmers out of Makuaranas.

967
01:24:13,894 --> 01:24:18,466
l bet they're quite happy as they are.
l force my society into letting me go.

968
01:24:18,534 --> 01:24:21,121
l convince you and Stoney
to fly me in a plane

969
01:24:21,192 --> 01:24:23,101
that no sensible person should get into.

970
01:24:23,175 --> 01:24:26,917
l put a spell on the compass. lf it weren't
for me, those children wouldn't be here.

971
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:29,220
What have l been doing?

972
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,516
Listen, Bernie, you kept those kids going
when they had no reason to.

973
01:24:35,592 --> 01:24:37,796
You kept me going, too.

974
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,512
- Are we gonna make it?
- You bet we are.

975
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:44,414
Petey's out there right now, flying his little
heart out. lf he hasn't already reached land.

976
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:47,969
And l'm sure they sent word
when we didn't get to your island.

977
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,691
Planes are probably
looking for us right now.

978
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,549
And we're not far from shipping lanes.
A freighter could come.

979
01:24:59,337 --> 01:25:01,443
l love you.

980
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,423
l love you too.

981
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:43,010
Big wind.

982
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:46,214
- We'd better take the sail in.
- Mm-hm.

983
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,193
(speaks Japanese)

984
01:25:55,596 --> 01:25:58,378
Will it be a bad storm, Miss Lafleur?

985
01:25:59,532 --> 01:26:01,953
l'm afraid it will be, Julie.

986
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:33,827
(speaks Japanese)

987
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,275
(speaks Japanese)

988
01:27:10,384 --> 01:27:12,293
(clunking)

989
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:22,764
(Brutus snorts)

990
01:27:25,168 --> 01:27:27,078
(speaks Japanese)

991
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,121
(crack)

992
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:41,005
Hurry up. Come on, Hiro.

993
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:44,838
Come on. Whoa.

994
01:28:19,283 --> 01:28:21,192
lt's over!

995
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:26,189
We made it.

996
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,169
We made it.

997
01:28:37,907 --> 01:28:42,315
For somebody past her prime, you are
just amazing, old lady, just amazing.

998
01:28:42,387 --> 01:28:44,493
lt'd take more than a storm to sink you.

999
01:28:44,564 --> 01:28:46,768
Dugan! Dugan!

1000
01:28:46,836 --> 01:28:48,909
Oh, you come quickly.

1001
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:50,988
He fall down. Very bad.

1002
01:28:51,061 --> 01:28:53,297
l think he dying.

1003
01:28:56,565 --> 01:28:58,474
Easy, Brutus...

1004
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:06,125
(Brutus groans)

1005
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:09,329
He... He is gonna be OK.
lsn't he, Miss Lafleur?

1006
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,360
Bobby, he isn't.

1007
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:17,300
He is gonna be OK. You'll see.

1008
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:19,600
Mr. Dugan?

1009
01:29:23,062 --> 01:29:26,161
He is gonna be OK. Please.

1010
01:29:40,406 --> 01:29:41,422
No!

1011
01:29:41,496 --> 01:29:45,522
lt has to be done, Bobby. You don't wanna
see Brutus go on suffering like this?

1012
01:29:45,592 --> 01:29:48,243
No, stay back. Stay away from him.

1013
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:54,832
What would your dad want you to do now,
Bobby?

1014
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:59,060
l never knew my dad. He left me at
the orphanage and then he went away.

1015
01:29:59,128 --> 01:30:01,398
They didn't care.

1016
01:30:01,464 --> 01:30:05,293
Well, that was then and this is now and
there are people here who do care, Bobby.

1017
01:30:05,368 --> 01:30:09,012
- Like who?
- All of us care. We care about Brutus too.

1018
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:11,863
Stay back! Stay away from him!

1019
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:18,767
No!

1020
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:35,027
No!

1021
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:36,504
(speaks Japanese)

1022
01:30:39,162 --> 01:30:41,071
(speaks Japanese)

1023
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,905
Goodbye, Brutus.

1024
01:31:17,948 --> 01:31:19,803
(ship's horn)

1025
01:31:20,828 --> 01:31:22,421
Dugan...

1026
01:31:25,884 --> 01:31:29,048
- (cheering)
- Now hear this. Now hear this.

1027
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:31,702
All hands fore and aft.

1028
01:31:31,772 --> 01:31:33,299
l don't believe it.

1029
01:31:33,372 --> 01:31:35,380
Believe, Dugan. Believe.

1030
01:31:38,909 --> 01:31:43,481

to be your lawfully wedded wife.
