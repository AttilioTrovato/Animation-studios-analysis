1
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,544
Okay, Wood. In position.

2
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,584
Get ready.

3
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,387
Right.

4
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:17,553
Who can save Princess Juliet, held captive by the evil Count Lorka?

5
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,230
Who can save the city? Who?

6
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,021
Who...?

7
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,696
This is a job for Condorman!

8
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,257
Aah!

9
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,115
Harry!

10
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:04,775
Flap, Woody!

11
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,177
- Flap!
- Aaah!

12
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,195
It should've worked.

13
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,898
- Here. Drink this.
- I can't understand it.

14
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:17,031
- Drink this and calm down.
- I am calm!

15
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,736
I am calm.

16
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:23,125
Those wings were foolproof, Harry.
They were foolproof.

17
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,743
Woody, you're a great cartoonist,
and you're a great comic book writer...

18
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:30,434
...but you're a lousy bird.
I mean, you could've got yourself killled.

19
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,682
That's the way I create. You know that.

20
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:38,228
If Condorman can't do something in real life,
then I won't have him do it in one of my comic books.

21
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,235
Kids all over the world read my stuff.

22
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:43,952
They trust me. They know if I fake it.

23
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:48,185
Condorman's American. His word is his bond.

24
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,148
Well, hooray for the Red, White and Blue.

25
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,737
Woody, we've been buddies for a long time.

26
00:05:53,954 --> 00:06:00,554
Now, I respect you, I admire you. You're sincere,
you're conscientious, but sometimes you go too far.

27
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,649
- How so?
- Well, take now.

28
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,151
Okay, so Condorman's first assignment
is to help the French government.

29
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,970
And you come here to Paris and stay with me
to get the feel of things.

30
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:13,003
Well, fine. But did you have to try to fly off the Eiffel Tower
and nearly drown?

31
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:19,367
Come on, Woody. You're so wrapped up in your characaters
that you're losing sight of reality.

32
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:23,502
Go home. New England's nice this time of year.
Relax, take it easy.

33
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,350
Condorman would find enough excitement
in New York City to last a lifetime.

34
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,170
No, no, no, no, no.
Besides, Superman's got the Big Apple sewn up.

35
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,934
No, Condorman's gotta be international.

36
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,039
And as for reality and fantasy,
look what you do for a living.

37
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,430
Huh? What a fantastic life, huh? To be a spy.

38
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,994
I am not a spy, Woody.

39
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:56,411
CIA, huh? Cloak and dagger, secret missions.
Parachuting behind enemy lines, memorizing code words.

40
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,537
Oh, that has to be the greatest, Harry!

41
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,040
Woody, not everybody at the Agency is Robert Redford.

42
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,373
- Oh, come on! When you went to Bangkok--
- Read my lips...

43
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,690
I am a file clerk. Nothing more, nothing less.

44
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,460
You have my notes. Prepare the Benson file for an audit,
and then contact our people in Geneva.

45
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,451
Oh, there's Harry now.

46
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:24,372
Morning, Richard.

47
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:26,374
- How's it going, Harry?
- Late again. Bus strike.

48
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,491
- Harry?
- Sir?

49
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,367
What's up, Russ?

50
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,669
The Geneva meeting. I'm going to be gone for two days.
I want you to keep an eye on things for me.

51
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,646
Right. Uh, what about the Istanbul papers?
The exchange takes place the day after tomorrow.

52
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,980
You can handle that, Harry. They're not important anyway.

53
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,097
But Harrington won't be back from Rio 'til the weekend.

54
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,000
We're not sending Harrington. Our Russian friends insist
the exchange be handled by civilians.

55
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:53,678
Huh, civilians? What are the Ruskies worried about?
That the Chinese'll find out they got spies in Turkey?

56
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:55,771
Exactly.

57
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,659
- Have you recruited the civilian?
- That's where you come in. Just pick someone suitable.

58
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,852
Wh-- uh, me? But Russ... but Russ... Russ?

59
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:11,202
- Russ, I don't think I can handle this.
- You're always asking for more authority. This is your big chance.

60
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:15,508
What do I do? Stop the first American tourist I see and say,
"Hey, mister, how would you like to do your country a favor...

61
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,800
"... and drop of some secret papers
to a Russian in Istanbul?"

62
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,831
Something like that, yes. Now you're learning!

63
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,077
But, Ru---

64
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:25,022
Russ, what if I need to get ahold of you on the--?

65
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,529
Hey, Woody? Harry.

66
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,518
Remember how I saved your life this morning?

67
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,007
Well, I got a big favor to ask.

68
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,839
You like trains?

69
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,424
What's with the outfit?

70
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:21,072
<i>[Imitating Humphrey Bogart:]</i>
"Of all the stations... in all the world..."

71
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,064
- You like?
- I hate.

72
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,425
Give me the hat and trenchcoat.

73
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,899
- What? No!
- Woody, you were hired because you're a civilian.

74
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:32,118
I mean, take it easy with the Bogart schtick.

75
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,463
All right, but leave me the coat, please.
It gives me confidence.

76
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,666
Okay, okay. But remember you're supposed to blend in.

77
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,871
I got it. I got it.

78
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,531
Yeah, that's you. Give me your wrist.

79
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:45,193
Oh!

80
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,266
Oh, I like that. I like it!

81
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,940
I knew you would. Here's the key.
Don't lose it!

82
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,903
Thanks, Harry. And don't worry...

83
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,607
I won't let the organization down.

84
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,339
Do me a favor, buddy.

85
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,939
When you get on board the train, just have a couple of stiff drinks,
go to sleep and stay out of trouble.

86
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:07,446
Hey... you're talking to Woody, right? Right?

87
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,881
Sure. Now get on board.

88
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,830
Harry. when do I get off again?

89
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,591
At the end of the line, Woody.

90
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:19,512
Istanbul.

91
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:23,985
Istanbul.

92
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:53,681
Whoa!

93
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,671
Oh, I'm so sorry.

94
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,274
I'm a bit unsteady. It was jet lag.

95
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,207
No, train lag. Whatever.

96
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,569
Now you be carful!

97
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:08,815
Excuse me.

98
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,502
No... it was my faul... fault, I...

99
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:18,112
I tripped you with a purpose.

100
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,315
I thought it was you.

101
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:24,018
I believe we have something we can give each other?

102
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,480
Oh, absolutely.

103
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:30,998
I mean, I'm a man...

104
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:34,932
- ...you're a woman.
- I speak of documents.

105
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,794
Papers.

106
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,026
Papers?

107
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:44,488
Ah, papers! Yes, papers.

108
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,422
Istanbul, right?

109
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,513
Exchange must be discreet.

110
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:53,976
Of course.

111
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:58,323
Your order, sir?

112
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:03,313
- I'll have one of those.
- One Istanbul Express?

113
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,717
Yes, a double.

114
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,377
A double? Nobody orders it a double, sir.

115
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,796
Okay.

116
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,641
Make it a triple.

117
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,195
What's your name?

118
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:23,398
Natalia.

119
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,716
"Natalia."

120
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,135
I need your papers.

121
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,988
Is something wrong?

122
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:40,162
It's just that you're so beautiful.

123
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,281
- For a spy.
- Spy?!

124
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,885
But we are both civilians.

125
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:54,306
Everything may not be quite as it seems.

126
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,156
You are not a civilian?

127
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,423
In point of fact, no.

128
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:05,584
I'm working as a top-level operative in
international espionage.

129
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,589
Just passing through, doing a favor for a civilian.

130
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,326
Is that so?

131
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:15,572
Yes.

132
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,048
One triple Istanbul Express.

133
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,344
So, do you have a code name?

134
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:34,593
Does the name "Condorman" mean anything to you?

135
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:57,193
- Condorman, eh?
- Yes, Condorman.

136
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,870
"Vulture of the Western World."

137
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,528
I must go.

138
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:25,418
Please don--

139
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:29,537
<i>[ Muffled: ]</i>
Please don't go.

140
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,039
Those men over by the door, they're after me. I must go.

141
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,472
Oh, why don't we leave together?
If you're with me, maybe they won't try anything.

142
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,292
Nothing will stop them.

143
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:43,995
Aren't you forgetting Condorman, "Vulture of the" etc., etc.?

144
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,930
We are in great danger.

145
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,675
Danger? I laugh at danger.

146
00:14:58,777 --> 00:14:59,877
Step aside.

147
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:03,137
You step aside or you will die.

148
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:04,697
I'm sorry I had to get so violent,
but it was the only language they understood.

149
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:09,361
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine apart from a large dry cleaning bill.

150
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:14,738
I'll tell you one thing: if I ever come back to Istanbul,
I'm gonna put this place on my "try to avoid" list.

151
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Are you okay?

152
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,619
I was afraid for you.

153
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,679
You were?

154
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,097
That's very nice.

155
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:26,873
Well...

156
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,262
Oh! I believe these are for you.

157
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,970
The Istanbul papers?

158
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:40,044
Thank you... for everything.

159
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:46,208
It was nothing. I do this two or three times a week.

160
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,321
Natalia...

161
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:55,896
I--

162
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:59,571
<i>Do svidaniya,</i> Condorman!

163
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,685
Hello, Natalia.

164
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,318
Welcome home.

165
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:17,468
Oh, Sergei. I did not expect you.

166
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:25,504
I am sure you didn't, my dear, any more than I expected
you would go to Istanbul.

167
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:30,428
I had to go there.
We cannot trust the Americans, as I found out.

168
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:34,563
Really? And what did you find out, my little dove?

169
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:45,961
I must go and change. The journey, it was very long.

170
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:52,443
The exchange was supposed to be a civilian operation, eh?

171
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,034
I anticipated them and I was right.

172
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,495
They sent a top agent.

173
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,071
I had the office check him but there is no file on this man.

174
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,633
He was good.

175
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:08,522
Very smooth and very tough.

176
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,514
Perhaps even as good as you, Sergei.

177
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:14,604
And his name?

178
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:21,106
Surely when you were finding out how tough and how smooth
he was, you found out his name, no?

179
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
He called himself Condorman.

180
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,419
Condorman?

181
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,710
How quaint.

182
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:36,056
But he is good.
The way he handled those three Turks was impressive.

183
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,321
If they got hold of you who knows what would have happened.

184
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:44,126
But you were stupid to be seen by a Chinese agent.

185
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:48,144
And I am not one to let anybody jeopardize my position, am I?

186
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:50,035
Oh, my dear Natalia.

187
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,109
That is why I have changed my mind about bringing you with me...

188
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:57,444
to Monte Carlo to act as hostess
to the oil meetings with our Arabian friends.

189
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:04,091
You see, you need a little re-education
to remind you of the teachings of our masters.

190
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,699
Harry, my Laser Lady.

191
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,650
Isn't she beautiful?

192
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,933
Who is Condorman?

193
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,564
- "Condorman"?
- Condorman.

194
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:30,788
Well, uh... Condorman is what we call a comic hero,
in a comic book.

195
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,921
A comic book?

196
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:35,681
Yeah, you know, like Donald Duck, Popeye, Superman.

197
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,225
He's not a real person?

198
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,571
- Who, Condorman?
- Yes, Condorman.

199
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:42,738
No, Russ, comic book characters aren't real people.

200
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:46,408
Not as a rule, anyway. I mean, uh, Donald Duck for example...

201
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,022
...he's not a real duck.

202
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:49,608
Just a drawing.

203
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:51,266
Hmm.

204
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,103
Interesting.

205
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Well, I don't know how interesting it is.
I mean, every kid knows that. I've known it all my life.

206
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,890
Haven't you ever read a comic book?

207
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:04,628
Harry, Condorman is a real person.

208
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Well, if you say so, Russ. I always thought it's a cartoon.

209
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,541
Uh, is that all you wanted to talk to me about?

210
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:15,934
Listen, Harry, we have a Russian agent who wants to defect.

211
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,340
Now, this Russian insists that we use one particular agent
of ours to facilitate the defection.

212
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:23,766
Apparently they have some kind of rapport.

213
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:28,379
Now, we have been given the code name of the agent wanted,
but we've never heard of it.

214
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:33,214
Now it's vital that we find this man
and use him to handle this operation.

215
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:39,521
I want you to go through every file we've got
and find out who has been using the code name "Condorman".

216
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,518
What's the matter?

217
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:49,448
I think I know who's been using that name.

218
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Are you serious?!

219
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,214
- Very.
- I could get killed!

220
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:56,329
It's not a dangerious operation, buddy.
It's just a simple defection.

221
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:58,383
Simple defection for you, maybe.

222
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:02,985
I delievered "simple" papers in Istanbul,
and nearly got shish-kabobbed by three Turkish behemoths.

223
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:07,364
Every precaution is going to be taken for your safety.
The Bear is very important to us--

224
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:08,572
Bear? What bear?

225
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,639
The Bear is the code name for the Russian spy
who wants to defect.

226
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:18,215
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas. I refuse to place my fragile life in jeopardy
over anybody who goes under the name of "The Bear".

227
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:21,142
Ah, come on, Woody. A little cloak, a little dagger.

228
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:24,536
Mr. Wilkins, I feel certain that patriotism
counts for something with a matter--

229
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:27,774
Patriotism? Forget patriotism.
I have a family to think of.

230
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:28,394
Family?

231
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Yes, Gopher Boys, Spongeman, deadlines and things.

232
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,808
Condorman and Laser Lady make their debut next week.

233
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,912
Do you realize that we are talking about
the most important defection in this decade?

234
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,619
I'm not a spy!

235
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,207
I'm sorry.

236
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,629
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

237
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:04,843
Come on, Woody. You know yourself that you won't even put
anything in the comics unless it's been tested and proven.

238
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,654
Well, now here's your chance.
Out of the ink well and into real life!

239
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,370
It's the chance of a lifetime.

240
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:15,471
Whatever you're dreaming up for Condorman or Spongeman,
all you have to do is draw us the plans and we'll do the rest.

241
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:18,776
We can build anything you need and deliver it
anywhere in the world at our expense.

242
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:19,781
Right, Russ?

243
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,008
Right... Russ?

244
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:24,924
You know, Mr. Wilkins, we wouldn't be asking you to do this...

245
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:29,744
if it weren't for the fact that the Bear
insisted upon you being the escort.

246
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,890
Well, how could the Bear know about me?

247
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,012
Because you've already met her in Istanbul.

248
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:40,038
Natalia Rambova of the KGB.

249
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,398
Natalia!

250
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,988
Impossible.

251
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,988
No. No, impossible.
Absolutely out of the question.

252
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:59,866
Now hang on a minute!
You said you'd do this in my way with my designs.

253
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,070
But this is going to cost us a fortune!

254
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:08,025
Look, it's a tricky transfer, I grant you,
but can't you... simplify a little bit?

255
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:12,332
Uh, Russ has a point, Wood.
See, he wants you to bring him the Bear, not a comic book.

256
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,649
Yeah, okay. Okay.

257
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:17,637
If I don't get the equipment, I don't get the Bear.

258
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,990
Over to you, Russ.

259
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,711
Well, I don't know. I...

260
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:26,481
Of course, if all else fails, we are prepared, Russ.

261
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,703
Uh, we could always go to Plan B.

262
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:33,357
Okay.

263
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:36,811
Get Fabrication on it immediately.

264
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:37,722
Right, Russ.

265
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,006
I want you there yesterday.

266
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:42,944
Plan B.

267
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,999
What's Plan B, Harry?

268
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:49,745
I don't know.

269
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,998
But I hope to have it ready
by the time you get to Yugoslavia.

270
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,430
Natalia?

271
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,301
Ah!

272
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,418
- Natalia!
- Yes? Yes?

273
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,370
Condorman?

274
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:23,254
Who else?

275
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:25,505
I knew you would come.

276
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,311
I hope you didn't mind the gypsy disguise.

277
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,460
I figured you'd look good in anything.

278
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:36,003
- We must hurry before we're discovered.
- You're right. Come on.

279
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:46,301
Come on.

280
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:57,188
Take your time. Everything's ready.

281
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:59,823
We should be able to leave the country.
Oh, problem!

282
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:10,048
An escape as gypsies. How very romantic, comrade.

283
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,591
And who is your American friend?

284
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,010
Put up your hands and move over there!

285
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:23,017
You don't understand. I'm really on your side.

286
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:27,226
I'm a double agent. I was delivering
some secret information to the Bear, here.

287
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:29,645
We're old comrades from Istanbul.

288
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,819
Is that your story, comrade?

289
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,569
- Yes.
- Really?

290
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:35,802
Krokov would be most interested.

291
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:39,009
He has suspected your defection for some time.

292
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,300
Boris.

293
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,006
Hand over your weapons.

294
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:49,035
I don't have one. Condorman does not carry a gun.
It is against my code.

295
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:50,105
What?!

296
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:52,913
Guns scare me. The noise.

297
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:56,139
All I carry is my trusty old cane.

298
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:30,004
- You are all right?
- That's a hair trigger!

299
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:32,713
- Fastest cane in the West!
- Watch out!

300
00:29:38,997 --> 00:29:40,497
Multi-purpose!

301
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Come on!

302
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:44,084
Right through here.

303
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,855
You are not nervous, eh?

304
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:14,462
Me, Condorman, nervous? No.

305
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:16,064
Watch out!

306
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:23,637
It's okay. It's nothing to worry about.
Just testing the steering mechanism.

307
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:26,253
So...

308
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:29,011
you decided to defect?

309
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:32,769
Oh, life has not been very easy for me at home.

310
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,981
It's been on my mind for some time now.

311
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:36,992
Well, why didn't you do it from Istanbul?

312
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:41,667
Something happened between Krokov and me
when I got back to Russia that made my decision.

313
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:44,427
I realized it was now or never.

314
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:47,537
- Krokov?
- The man those agents talked about back there.

315
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,861
This Krokov...

316
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:53,389
he isn't your husband by any chance, is he?

317
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:56,004
No. I am single woman.

318
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,305
Free, single woman.

319
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,809
Well, I'm very glad to hear that.

320
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:07,008
I was thinking... America is so far away, you know.

321
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:09,016
Oh, but you'll love it when you get there.

322
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:14,713
Fall in New England, the Grand Canyon, New York, those buildings!

323
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:21,915
Thanksgiving, toasted marshmallows, Sunday Funnies,
the Senior Prom, baseball, you'd be crazy not to...

324
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,106
But how did that happen?!

325
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,456
Look, I had two men following them.

326
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:51,951
What?

327
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:54,616
No, no, no, absolutely not.
I want her alive.

328
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:57,809
That is far too good for that little traitor.

329
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,651
What?

330
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,976
No, the man is expendable.

331
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Well, send out the Brocknoviach.

332
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:09,463
And make sure that Morovich is personally in charge.

333
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:18,237
<i>(In Russian:)
Morovich speaking.</i>

334
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:22,564
<i>I need the Brocknoviach.</i>

335
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,126
Brocknoviach!

336
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:56,937
<i>(Speaking commands in Russian)</i>

337
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,241
<i>съезжать!
(Move out!)</i>

338
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:34,034
It's like a storybook town.

339
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:37,437
Just look at it. So quiet.

340
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,201
It's too quiet.

341
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,528
What do you mean?

342
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:44,727
The people. Where are the people?

343
00:35:56,355 --> 00:36:01,255
Natalia, you gotta learn to lighten up. Relax!

344
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,825
Something is wrong.

345
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:10,576
<i>съезжать!
(Move out!)</i>

346
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:45,973
- Krokov will do anything to get me back.
- Forget Krokov. You're with me now.

347
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:11,212
- Natalia!
- What is it?

348
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,910
You tell me.

349
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,013
The Brocknoviach!

350
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,229
- We cannot outrun them in this old truck!
- You have a point there.

351
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,000
But...

352
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,037
Incredible!

353
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:14,531
Fantastic!

354
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,130
- What are we going to do now?
- Well...

355
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:37,984
we push another button.

356
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:53,712
I don't believe it!

357
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:13,391
- Who are those guys?
- The Brocknoviach is the KGB pursuit squadron.

358
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,639
Superb drivers and each one is a dedicated killer.

359
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:34,741
Look out!

360
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,606
Okay, okay.

361
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,721
Let's warm things up a bit.

362
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:32,214
- Do something!
- There's nothing left to do.

363
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:36,541
Stop!

364
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:40,203
- He's crazy! He will kill us!
- Stop, nothing. That's what he wants.

365
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:16,541
It's Morovich!

366
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,315
- You know that guy?
- He is homicidal maniac.

367
00:42:30,762 --> 00:42:34,562
- You've got to stop him.
- Of course, I've got to stop him. The trick is how!

368
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:49,806
Whoa!

369
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:48,706
Escaped?!

370
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,219
- And in a gypsy truck?!
- The gyspy truck turned into a racecar.

371
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,630
- But you had the Brocknoviach!
- Before my eye, the racecar turned into a hydrofoil!

372
00:43:56,644 --> 00:44:00,244
Have you seen this report on this Condorman?
On this man Wilkins?

373
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:07,398
He is an amateur, do you hear? He is NOT an agent of the CIA!
He is a writer of comic books!

374
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:09,793
We shall be a laughing stock back home.

375
00:44:20,013 --> 00:44:21,513
Comrade, please.

376
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,600
All I ask is one more chance to get this Condorman.

377
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,353
All right, my dear Morovich.

378
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:38,105
You will get that chance.

379
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:42,572
According to my calculations...

380
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,998
he should land somehwere...

381
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,892
in north coast of Italy.

382
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:10,849
Roundabout there should be the place.

383
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:14,582
- Vito?
- Yes, Comrade Kommisar?

384
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:21,007
Contact Barotsini. We are collecting an old debt.

385
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:23,416
Tell him what we want.

386
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:28,065
Not far to go.

387
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:31,169
Where are we?

388
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:36,163
I don't know, but don't worry. We're safe and clear now.

389
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:38,791
How can you say that?

390
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:45,597
It's logic. If we don't know where we are,
it stands to reason Krokov doesn't know, either.

391
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:48,254
I doubt whether he'd have us followed into Italy.

392
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:52,157
- Hey.
- You don't know Krokov.

393
00:45:53,457 --> 00:45:55,057
Hey, that will be perfect!

394
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:57,175
Come on.

395
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,150
Ah, this'll be fine.
We'll sleep here and get an early start in the morning.

396
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:16,508
Tomorrow I'll find a telephone, call Harry,
and we'll be home in no time.

397
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:51,596
<i>Polizia!</i>

398
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:54,122
On your feet! You are under arrest.

399
00:46:55,463 --> 00:47:02,563
<i>Uh, signore... uh, scusi... </i>uh, there's been a mistake.
You have got the wrong couple.

400
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,429
<i>- Comprende?</i>
- Woody, you must do something!

401
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:09,238
How can I do something?
Obviously he's got us mixed up with another couple?

402
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:19,806
It said we killed a man in Monte Carlo.

403
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,130
"In Monte Carlo"? We've never even been to Monte Carlo!

404
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:25,581
Krokov is behind this.

405
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:27,778
Guard...

406
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:32,285
Guard, you really are making a big mistake.

407
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:35,301
The authorities from Monte Carlo are on their way.

408
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,186
Krokov's men.

409
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,830
- You know what I think?
- What?

410
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:42,837
I think we're in serious trouble.

411
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,494
Oh, Gopher Boy, what would you do now?

412
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,656
What?

413
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:51,019
Oh, nothing.

414
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:53,593
Nothing.

415
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:09,050
J'essuie Inspector Jamoe, Police, Monaco.

416
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:14,874
Wake up!

417
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:18,549
Bring your thing.

418
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:33,859
Hey, fella. You think this is it? Do you think you got us licked?
Huh? The world isn't a vacuum, you know.

419
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:36,406
You mark this: I'm an American citizen.

420
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:41,784
You don't speakity English, huh? <i>No understando... mio?</i>

421
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:45,475
What language do they speak in Monaco?

422
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:50,438
Hey, ugly American, remember Plan B? This is it.

423
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:53,224
Harry?!

424
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:03,062
This?

425
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:04,497
Get in.

426
00:49:07,617 --> 00:49:09,317
Have you got the key?

427
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:12,394
Not now. We're being watched by you-know-who!

428
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:15,288
Besides, the Ruskies can't be far behind.

429
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,521
You're all over the front page.

430
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:22,468
- Does Russ know about this?
- He's working on the rest of the plan.

431
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:27,244
- "Bazooka Boy meets Hannibal Smith".
- Great! One of my favorites!

432
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:48,556
- Okay, Harry, give me the keys.
- Let's get out of here first.

433
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:51,048
Stop! It's Morovich.

434
00:49:56,548 --> 00:49:58,648
Get out of here! Fast!

435
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:38,722
There!

436
00:50:45,615 --> 00:50:46,415
Down there!

437
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:54,323
Harry! The keys!

438
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,842
- Okay.
- Come on!

439
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:09,484
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

440
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,282
I wish to speak!

441
00:51:57,665 --> 00:51:58,565
Yes?

442
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:03,513
This man is already married!

443
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:06,339
To who is this man married?

444
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:08,097
To me.

445
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,940
What is this? I never saw her before!

446
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:17,926
Come home, Pietro, please, for the sake of the children.

447
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:22,782
You are lying! She is nothing but a liar. She is crazy.

448
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:27,311
I wish I was, but Pietro Jr. cry for his father.

449
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,551
- You will leave her at once.
- I will not.

450
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:33,453
Uncle Luigi and I have come to take you home.

451
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:36,003
I will throw her out myself.

452
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:39,731
- Don't you lay a hand on me!
- Who will stop me?

453
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:41,747
Uncle Luigi!

454
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:45,424
I will squeeze the truth of this Uncle Luigi.

455
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:21,368
- We believe they are headed in the direction of--
- The Alps.

456
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:28,322
That's what we suspect.
In which case, they could cross at any one of a number of places:

457
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,760
Near Mont Blanc, through Simplon Pass, below--

458
00:53:32,785 --> 00:53:35,985
I know exactly where they will cross.

459
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:37,362
You do?

460
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:46,356
The best-kept secrets of Woodrow Wilkins can be found by
any small child for the price of a tiny coin.

461
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:52,982
Here is a truck that turns into a racing car.

462
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:57,324
Here, a car that turns into a hovercraft.

463
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:00,289
Genius weapons,

464
00:54:00,843 --> 00:54:02,843
exploding rockets,

465
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:07,131
it's all here, including, my friend...

466
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,719
"Bazooka Boy meets Hannibal Smith"?

467
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:18,121
Where they will cross the Alps.

468
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,677
Whoa.

469
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:43,691
Well, here it is. We made it.

470
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:47,412
- At last, a real inn with hot water.
- And food!

471
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:51,526
Well, we'll stay here tonight, but in one room.
We mustn't separate.

472
00:54:51,578 --> 00:54:52,478
Right.

473
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,621
What is this? Why are all these children looking at us?

474
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:06,051
Uh, it's out of season. Maybe they're just glad to see tourists.

475
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,679
- Hi there.
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>

476
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,990
That's your room. I hope you are very happy.

477
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:17,704
- But, meant for two.
- Two people? Yes, sir.

478
00:55:17,727 --> 00:55:20,427
- Two people.
<i>- Arrivederci.</i> Bye.

479
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,658
- Two peoples!
- Two peoples!

480
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,261
Oh, I can feel that hot water from that shower already.

481
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:32,176
Uh... unless, uh...
well, I can feel it later if, uh...

482
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,204
- Be my guest.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

483
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:31,215
You are her, aren't you?

484
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,318
Of course it's her.

485
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,010
- It is.
- It isn't.

486
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:36,148
It is.

487
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:40,096
What is this? Why are you children staring at me?

488
00:56:40,749 --> 00:56:45,149
"The Empress of Space, Time, and Beauty."

489
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,971
Laser Lady.

490
00:56:59,006 --> 00:57:01,606
How did you get to be Laser Lady?

491
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:13,771
You scared the dickens out of me.

492
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:17,393
I turned around and you're gone,
Woody's out like a light.

493
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:21,994
I figured, "Boom, that's it!"
They heard the shower running and they... grabbed you.

494
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:25,962
Natalia? You all right?

495
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,434
Yes, yes, I'm all right.

496
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:31,744
Harry, who are you?

497
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:34,667
What do you mean?

498
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:40,034
Woody is Condorman, I am Laser Lady, who are you?

499
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:43,929
How'd you find out?

500
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,728
The children here read comic books, too.

501
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,909
Let's take a little walk.

502
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:02,616
I knew you'd find out sooner or later,
but I held my peace because of Woody.

503
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:04,482
It's all my fault.

504
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:57,545
Wow!

505
00:58:58,286 --> 00:58:59,986
No wonder they can eat so much pasta.

506
00:59:00,681 --> 00:59:01,981
Harry!

507
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:04,393
<i>Va en primo. Baillamo.</i>
(Come now. Dance with me. Let's go.)

508
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:06,437
- Listen, I--
<i>-  Adiamo subito.</i>

509
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:08,346
When you got it, you got it.

510
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:26,252
A ruble for your thoughts.

511
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:43,278
When I parted from Krokov, I promised myself
I would never love again a man who lived a life of deception.

512
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,383
But now...

513
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:53,247
now I think there's deception and exception.

514
00:59:55,122 --> 00:59:56,522
I don't understand.

515
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,370
But I do.

516
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:09,121
When I go to America, and start reading the Sunday funnies,
and eating my Big Mac, and planning for the senior prom--

517
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,852
You may have missed the prom.

518
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:19,103
I would like it very much if I could pick up my American telephone,
call my friend Woody and say,

519
01:00:19,142 --> 01:00:22,042
"Come over and be democratic with me."

520
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:26,021
I'll bring the dip if you bring the Dostoyevski.

521
01:00:28,568 --> 01:00:29,868
That's a yes.

522
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,372
What are we doing up here?

523
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:57,032
You see that? That's our first-class ticket to freedom.

524
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:03,355
This is it!

525
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:09,278
Oh, good old Russ. He got it exactly right.

526
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,794
- He did?
- What is it?

527
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:16,715
They're jet rods. And as with the other one,
you just hook it up there on the cable...

528
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,165
like so...

529
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:23,991
Then you open up the stirrups...

530
01:01:24,498 --> 01:01:26,398
climb aboard...

531
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:31,332
and when youre ready to go,
pull that lever and zowie! Right up the mountain.

532
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:33,502
Whoa. Hold on.

533
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:35,814
Harry, there's nothing to be afraid of.

534
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,825
Uh, Woody... I can't handle heights.

535
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:41,537
Okay, you climb on with me. And hold on.

536
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:44,287
Whoa.

537
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:47,694
Ready?

538
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:52,739
Okay!

539
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
Morovich...

540
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:12,566
<i>- you see them?</i>
<i>- Da.</i>

541
01:03:26,018 --> 01:03:26,918
Shoot.

542
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,180
Woody!

543
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,943
Woody!

544
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:51,023
Don't you touch me!

545
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:00,285
Don't!

546
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:44,889
I think they're gone.

547
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,796
We can move now.

548
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:57,025
I... may... never... move... again!

549
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,590
Good morning, Natalia.

550
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:17,729
I trust you slept well.

551
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:22,499
Surely you don't think I'd let you get away
after all you've meant to me.

552
01:05:22,995 --> 01:05:23,995
I hate you.

553
01:05:26,383 --> 01:05:29,583
And I wish to kill you.

554
01:05:32,655 --> 01:05:34,555
You don't know how tempted I was.

555
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:37,106
I wish you would have.

556
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:39,885
Anything would have been better than this.

557
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:44,031
Save your tears. I am going to save your life.

558
01:05:45,422 --> 01:05:50,022
Our story will be that you pretended to defect
in order to kidnap this Condorman.

559
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:54,155
I shall lay the blame on Morovich for failing this mission.

560
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:00,919
Of course, he will have to be killed.
We can't have the Party hearing his side of the story, can we?

561
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,169
You pig.

562
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,030
Do you really think that things will be the same between us?

563
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,300
For the moment, I don't care.

564
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:16,810
But remember, Natalia, whatever happens in the future
is better than a slow death in a Siberian slave hut, no?

565
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,473
Don't touch me.

566
01:06:20,049 --> 01:06:21,149
Very well.

567
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:26,611
But, for the moment, things will have
to appear as normal between ourselves.

568
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:31,782
You will have to play the role of perfect hostess,
a role you were born for.

569
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:37,940
And if you have any design on escape,
this comfortable villa is an impregnable fortress.

570
01:06:38,389 --> 01:06:40,089
Your every move would be watched.

571
01:06:40,713 --> 01:06:44,413
The oil ministers arrive tomorrow.
I want you up and about, looking your best.

572
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:48,158
Laughing and ensuring they are happy, hmm?

573
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:50,543
Get out of here!

574
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:52,804
That's better.

575
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:54,591
That's the spirit.

576
01:06:55,995 --> 01:07:02,495
I will leave you now for a moment
to get your redemption into your head.

577
01:07:09,103 --> 01:07:10,303
And, Natalia...

578
01:07:11,148 --> 01:07:15,348
remember, any more trouble from you
and I shall personally kill you immediately.

579
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,800
Woody?

580
01:07:29,163 --> 01:07:31,663
- I just talked to Russ.
- Natalia?

581
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:34,767
Krokov's got her at the Russian villa in Monte Carlo.

582
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,481
- We gotta get her out of there.
- Woody...

583
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:42,411
we've been ordered back to Paris.
Our mission's considered a bust.

584
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:46,345
I can't go back. Not without Natalia.

585
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,216
I love her, Harry.

586
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
I know.

587
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:57,262
Look, I still have Top Red clearance.
That gives me anything I need, including Fort Knox, right?

588
01:07:57,709 --> 01:08:00,609
Now, wait a minute.
That was before we were ordered back to Paris, Woody.

589
01:08:00,787 --> 01:08:04,187
Forget orders. Tell them you didn't see me in time,
that it was too late.

590
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,105
I can't do that, Woody--

591
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,869
Harry, two days. That's all I ask.

592
01:08:09,914 --> 01:08:11,114
Two days.

593
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,160
Please.

594
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:18,005
Okay, buddy. You got it.

595
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:22,926
- Harry, you're beautiful!
- Will you stop? People will talk!

596
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:25,071
Now here's what I have in mind...

597
01:08:57,576 --> 01:09:00,976
- Oh, hello, Sergei.
- Hello, Ori. What's happened?

598
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:05,499
Oh, amazing, Sergei. Amazing.
This Arab, he took the house to the limit.

599
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,241
- What is that?
- 5 million Francs.

600
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:24,049
Who is that man?

601
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:27,969
I called in to the Underground.
He was nothing more than another Bedouin.

602
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:33,130
Then, several months ago, he struck oil and now...

603
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,410
Now he's the seventh richest man in the world.

604
01:09:36,747 --> 01:09:38,747
Make sure he is at tomorrow's party.

605
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:13,317
But the question remains: can we produce it in sufficient quantity?

606
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:17,598
Now, do you... do you see that as a problem in the long run?

607
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,697
That all depends.

608
01:10:21,268 --> 01:10:23,668
What was your question again, huh?

609
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:28,303
Well, actually what I said was,
"Do you think our North Sea will produce enough oil?"

610
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:32,236
North Sea? Ha! A Caesar salad's worth!

611
01:10:32,956 --> 01:10:34,256
Pardon me, please.

612
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:39,523
Business. I have to close a deal for Rhode Island.

613
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:41,706
Huh.

614
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,469
Amazing.

615
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:55,908
So?

616
01:10:57,065 --> 01:10:57,965
Everything's "go".

617
01:10:58,381 --> 01:10:59,481
You talk to her yet?

618
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:01,098
I can't get near her.

619
01:11:01,164 --> 01:11:03,864
Every time I turn around, someone tries to sell me something.

620
01:11:03,905 --> 01:11:05,605
Well, whatever you do, don't buy.

621
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:07,707
When are you gonna make your move?

622
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:08,531
Hey!

623
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:15,384
Right. I'm gonna try and get to her now.

624
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:18,544
You give me five minutes, then let it go.

625
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,675
- Okay?
- Okay. Five minutes.

626
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,490
Don't worry about me.

627
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:35,366
Hmmph.

628
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:00,961
Enchanting.

629
01:12:04,298 --> 01:12:06,698
A beautiful place, Monaco.

630
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:10,786
Yes, it is. I do not believe we have met.

631
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:12,281
Natalia Rambova.

632
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:16,569
Don't scream out, the Cavalry's here.

633
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:18,095
- Woo--
- No!

634
01:12:18,537 --> 01:12:19,537
Woody!

635
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,220
They told me you were dead.

636
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,538
I've come to get you. Come on!

637
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,490
No.

638
01:12:27,856 --> 01:12:29,056
I cannot go with you.

639
01:12:30,724 --> 01:12:31,824
What do you mean?

640
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:40,238
I'm sorry...

641
01:12:40,627 --> 01:12:42,127
but I've changed my mind.

642
01:12:42,594 --> 01:12:44,394
You've changed your mind?!

643
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:50,198
Are you crazy? This isn't like deciding what restaurant you're
going to eat in. This is a defection!

644
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:52,073
It's Krokov.

645
01:12:52,377 --> 01:12:54,977
Krokov? Forget Krokov! Now come with me.

646
01:12:54,986 --> 01:12:56,386
No, no, Krokov--

647
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:05,834
Krokov had a plan. It was a plan. Don't be stupid.

648
01:13:07,202 --> 01:13:09,602
Krokov thought you were a top American agent.

649
01:13:10,206 --> 01:13:13,406
My defection was a ruse to kidnap you.

650
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:20,363
But now we know you're nothing more than a foolish dreamer
who draws comic books, not worth the bullet to kill you.

651
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,660
So go now, please, and don't try to do anyth--

652
01:13:25,661 --> 01:13:27,661
I see you've already met the Sheik.

653
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:29,086
Yes.

654
01:13:30,231 --> 01:13:32,231
He thought we had met before.

655
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,800
Is that so?

656
01:13:36,755 --> 01:13:39,655
But I was... mistaken.

657
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:44,291
A foolish dream, perhaps.

658
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:55,384
It was a pleasure meeting you.

659
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:57,507
I'm sorry we did not have more time.

660
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,351
Some other day, perhaps.

661
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,592
If you bring the dip, I'll bring the Dostoyevski.

662
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:24,599
"I'll bring the dip..."

663
01:14:28,192 --> 01:14:29,992
"I'll bring the dip!"

664
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:33,189
Natalia!

665
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:39,498
Three... two... one...

666
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:52,001
Come on! This way!

667
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:08,443
Natalia!

668
01:15:12,497 --> 01:15:13,397
After them.

669
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:19,766
Downstairs, quick!

670
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:32,292
Good, Harry. Good.

671
01:15:46,816 --> 01:15:47,816
- Nein!
- Halt!

672
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,459
Coming through!

673
01:15:56,153 --> 01:15:58,653
Oh, Russ, if you could see me now!

674
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:20,396
There's no key!

675
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,480
Quick! Give me a hand!

676
01:16:39,866 --> 01:16:41,166
We're trapped!

677
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:43,182
Don't you believe it!

678
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,510
Woody, I'm frightened!

679
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:47,422
Don't worry.

680
01:16:48,242 --> 01:16:50,242
Condorman has it all figured out.

681
01:16:51,803 --> 01:16:53,803
But how can we escape? Fly?

682
01:17:00,489 --> 01:17:01,989
You are not serious.

683
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:03,613
You want out?

684
01:17:09,217 --> 01:17:10,817
I want you.

685
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:15,006
Then get behind me and hold on tight!

686
01:17:47,112 --> 01:17:50,212
Morovich... prepare them.

687
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:14,910
Uh-oh.

688
01:18:42,558 --> 01:18:45,358
Woody, I can't hold on much longer.

689
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,354
When are we going to land?

690
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:49,692
As soon as I see Harry at the rendezvous.

691
01:19:12,578 --> 01:19:14,378
Oh, you beauty, you doll.

692
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:15,761
We made it.

693
01:19:27,003 --> 01:19:28,503
Oh, no!

694
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:33,999
Somebody stop that car!

695
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,720
Ooh, I got... I got... I got... oh!

696
01:19:43,391 --> 01:19:44,391
Aah!

697
01:19:53,103 --> 01:19:54,203
Well, Russ...

698
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:57,543
easy come, easy go.

699
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:13,357
Okay.

700
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:14,707
Here we go.

701
01:20:29,605 --> 01:20:30,205
Yeah...

702
01:20:31,183 --> 01:20:31,883
eh...

703
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:37,571
yeah, yeah...

704
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:45,378
On the boat, Natalia.

705
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:50,247
Let's go!

706
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:58,755
Why did you come and get me? You could have left me at the villa.

707
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,300
Why did you pretend you didn't want to come?

708
01:21:01,866 --> 01:21:07,566
I could not let you be discovered and killed. If I had tried to
ask you to help me you would have done something stupid.

709
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,579
Instead of the sane and sensible thing we're doing now.

710
01:21:10,152 --> 01:21:15,152
Yeah, but how do you feel about my being
"a foolish dreamer who draws comic books", huh?

711
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,270
- Did I say that?
- Uh-huh.

712
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:21,285
Laser Lady would say anything to save the man she loves.

713
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:25,817
Will you two come on?!

714
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:31,399
Come on, down!

715
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:07,750
Now.

716
01:22:11,617 --> 01:22:12,517
<i>съезжать!
(Move out!)</i>

717
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:24,874
- Harry, change places!
- Right!

718
01:23:31,988 --> 01:23:34,388
I thought I'd never get to use you, baby.

719
01:23:49,932 --> 01:23:51,832
- Hit the smoke!-
- Gotcha!

720
01:25:49,826 --> 01:25:51,226
Let's head for home!

721
01:25:51,703 --> 01:25:53,003
Nice shootin', Woody!

722
01:26:19,733 --> 01:26:23,533
I hate to say this, but we're in serious trouble!

723
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,280
Head for skylift!

724
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:31,349
Return to base.

725
01:27:32,816 --> 01:27:33,716
Return to base!

726
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,990
He's gonna ram us!

727
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:45,291
Take it up!

728
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,100
<i>There's a long, high drive into deep left field.
Back goes Nelson to the track, to the wall, it's gone!</i>

729
01:28:24,919 --> 01:28:28,119
Natalia, you brought us luck. I could kiss you!

730
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:43,103
- Not bad, Condorman. We should go to more baseball games.
- Yeah, I'll get us season tickets!

731
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:47,142
Hey, you two lovebirds. Do you mind?
I'm trying to watch the ball game.

732
01:28:50,277 --> 01:28:53,077
Um, Natalia, look up.

733
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,272
It's a little American present to you.

734
01:29:06,459 --> 01:29:09,459
Oh, my own airship!

735
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:10,814
Harry...

736
01:29:12,276 --> 01:29:13,076
thank you.

737
01:29:18,303 --> 01:29:19,703
So that's them, huh?

738
01:29:20,066 --> 01:29:21,066
Yes, sir. That's them.

739
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:24,536
But this is nothing but trouble. If you want my advice--

740
01:29:24,547 --> 01:29:28,447
This assignment is very delicate.
It needs handling with the greatest of finesse.

741
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:31,652
But that's exactly what I mean, sir.
I don't think this man is qualified.

742
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:33,572
Nonsense. He got the girl out, didn't he?

743
01:29:34,338 --> 01:29:35,038
Do it.

744
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:36,019
Right away.

745
01:29:38,984 --> 01:29:39,584
Set it up.

746
01:29:40,962 --> 01:29:42,162
I'll get right on it.

747
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:50,901
Hey, Woody, you're a good old boy
and I've got a wonderful proposition for you.

748
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:54,093
Have you ever thought of taking Condorman to...
