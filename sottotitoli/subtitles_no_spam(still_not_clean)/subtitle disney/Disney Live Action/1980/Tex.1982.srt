1
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:20,881
Hey, boy.

2
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:51,781
All right.

3
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:57,945
Come on, Rowdy.

4
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:07,294
Whoa! Think that's a bear in there?

5
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:14,965
It's only a rabbit.
You ain't never even seen a bear.

6
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,477
Whoa. You got some imagination
on you for a horse. Come on.

7
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:55,429
"Total points each varsity season."

8
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:59,466
"Greatest strength."

9
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,104
"Most memorable game."

10
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,288
"200-word essay"?

11
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:22,096
Bridle itches you, huh, boy?

12
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,297
Hungry, huh?

13
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,895
Look, I don't got any carrots.

14
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,008
I said, I don't got any.

15
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:39,012
You got that carrot detector
working full blast, don't you?

16
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,074
Here.

17
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,956
Way you're jumping these days, nobody'd
ever believe you were a cow horse.

18
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:48,993
We'll ride some more
when I get back from school, OK?

19
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,601
- Hey, Mace?
- Yeah, here.

20
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:12,811
Hey, Mace, what happened
to your 50 points before breakfast, man?

21
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,715
I got to do this instead today.

22
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,880
You'd better get changed for school
if you're gonna make it.

23
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,447
Doing what instead?

24
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:26,628
It's a questionnaire for...
I ain't gonna shout, you come in here.

25
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:29,462
I'm changing. You told me to change.

26
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:32,469
Well, when you're done changing, genius.

27
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,337
That's changed?

28
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:40,343
Can't you tell school pants
from riding pants?

29
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:44,541
- You'd better get yourself washed, Tex.
- Yeah, yeah.

30
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:56,859
What do you want to go
to Indiana for, anyway?

31
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:02,662
One, they got the best basketball team
in their conference, if not the Midwest.

32
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,760
Number two, it's not in Oklahoma.

33
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,705
And number three,
I got a shot at a full scholarship.

34
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:13,232
- Are we defrosting?
- Just broke.

35
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,711
It's cold in here, too.

36
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,840
It's turned off.
I haven't paid the gas bill in a while.

37
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:22,114
What happened
to all that money we made last summer?

38
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:25,678
Oh, I blew it all
on a fun-filled week in Acapulco!

39
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,226
What the hell do you think happened to it?

40
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:32,229
Food for us, food for Rowdy and Toyota,
electric bill.

41
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,095
How far do you think a couple
of hundred bucks is gonna stretch?

42
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:40,536
Well, Pop's coming back soon,
now the rodeo season's almost over.

43
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,473
Well, that's been another big help, Pop
sending home all that fabulous money.

44
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,443
- He did, Mace.
- Four months ago.

45
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:51,175
That's not so long ago.
He's only been gone for five.

46
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:56,276
You'd better go
if you're gonna make the bus.

47
00:05:56,354 --> 00:06:01,792
I'm gonna ride with Johnny. Don't worry,
Pop's coming back. See you in school.

48
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:07,226
Hello, Tex.

49
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,457
Go! Let's move it!

50
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,773
You're supposed to meet me out on
the road. I'd like breakfast too, you know.

51
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,174
Let's go.

52
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:57,074
- Tex, you left your books behind.
- Hey, there's your sister.

53
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,375
Cole said to tell you to be home by four
to help him flush his radiator.

54
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:05,752
I was gonna go out to the gravel pits today.

55
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,291
I'll flush out your radiator, baby!

56
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,350
Hey, Tex.

57
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,956
Ugh, I think his horse needs a bath again.

58
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:19,095
Oh, no, see, that's just me.
I'm a quarter horse by birth.

59
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,638
Yeah? I know which part, too.

60
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,939
See ya.

61
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,206
That sister of yours is pretty.

62
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,474
She must be a pain
to have around the house though.

63
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:34,007
We was all thinking of pitchin' in
and buying her a dog to be mean to.

64
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,485
<i>Tomorrow we'll be talking about Paterson.</i>

65
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:39,751
the epic poem Williams
wrote about his hometown in New Jersey.

66
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:43,021
Which, who knows, may inspire one of you
to write an epic about Bixby.

67
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,654
Now, before you all race away for lunch,

68
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,131
let me remind you that your book reports
are due on Friday.

69
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,603
<i>And Tex McCormick, I don't want to see
another report on Smokey The Cowhorse.</i>

70
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,504
- You've done it twice already.
- Yeah, but I read it both times.

71
00:07:56,574 --> 00:08:01,102
- Read another book by the same author.
- You mean that guy wrote another book?

72
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,080
- In the library.
- Oh, wow.

73
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,758
See you later.

74
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,298
Way to go, man!

75
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,542
Hey, Mace.

76
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:47,656
- Ah, the heat's back on.
- I went down and took care of it.

77
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:52,219
Good. Sure wasn't looking forward
to burning up the furniture.

78
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,356
Food!

79
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:02,098
You left school early today, huh?
You feel all right?

80
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,232
Yeah. I just cut the afternoon.

81
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,833
Mr. Supergrand cut a day's school?

82
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,345
I guess that makes it OK for me to cut,
huh?

83
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:12,143
I guess it don't.

84
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,519
So, did you go fishing?

85
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,749
No, I didn't go fishing.

86
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,187
I'm gonna go out the back
and get Rowdy and Toyota some oats.

87
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,357
If they don't get fed pretty soon,
they're gonna tear down the fence.

88
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,195
They ain't there.

89
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,828
If they're out in the pasture,
I'd better get 'em in.

90
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:37,204
- I sold 'em.
- No, you didn't.

91
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,005
Yeah, I did,
and I got a good price for 'em, too.

92
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,016
I'm gonna give you another chance,
Mason. Where are them horses?

93
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,578
I told you. I sold 'em.

94
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:29,251
I don't know why you think I'd start
lying to you this late in life.

95
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,852
Ever close doors?
No wonder I can't pay the gas bill.

96
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:35,456
- Who'd you sell 'em to?
- I ain't gonna tell you.

97
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:41,028
Those people didn't pay
to have some kid come bothering them.

98
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:44,905
Mace, Rowdy's mine. You just can't sell
something that isn't yours.

99
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,011
You can't live on no money, either.

100
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,314
They got a good home. I made sure of that.

101
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:56,012
- They're gone, so shut up about it.
- You'd just better get those horses back.

102
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:59,818
I ain't getting them back. We couldn't
have kept feeding them much longer.

103
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,053
Either they would have starved
or we would. So shut up about it.

104
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:07,723
- You get those horses back.
- I ain't getting them back.

105
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,558
Tex, you better quit it.

106
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:42,025
You're strong, Tex,
but you never could fight worth a damn.

107
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,090
Come on.

108
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,397
- I'm gonna get my horse.
- You ain't gonna find him.

109
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:49,166
Pop wouldn't have let you sell them.

110
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,176
If Pop was here, I wouldn't have had to.
That's the point.

111
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:12,385
<i>Hello, Tex.
Hey, where you going? Hey!</i>

112
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:19,128
What happened to you?

113
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,071
Rowdy.

114
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,630
What happened? You get hurt?

115
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:30,641
Mace sold him.
He sold him and he sold Toyota.

116
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,310
I'm gonna find him and get him back.

117
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,150
Well, were you going home later?

118
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,183
Not until I've found my horse.

119
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,390
- Tex, that's nuts.
- He's my horse.

120
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:52,198
I know, but he could be anywhere
and you can't just sleep on the road.

121
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:57,639
Why don't I take Jamie home and then
I'll come back and take you? OK?

122
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,109
Look, don't you two understand English?

123
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:04,443
He's my horse and I'm gonna find him.

124
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,211
I ain't going back until I find him.

125
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:13,554
- No, Tex, wait up.
- Get lost!

126
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,348
Get in the truck.

127
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,416
No.

128
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,320
Damn it, I've had enough with you tonight.

129
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:57,390
I got a rope here. I'll tie you up
and drag you home if I have to.

130
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:03,703
He's right around here, isn't he?
That's why you want to stop me, right?

131
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:07,073
Yeah, he's right around here
and you're gonna find him.

132
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:11,308
Then he won't be sold any more.
Pop'll come home and we'll all be happy.

133
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:15,682
And we won't have to brush our teeth
or go to school ever again.

134
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,721
Christ, you're dumb.

135
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,380
Come on, get in the truck, OK?

136
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,148
- Hey, man.
- Hi, Robert.

137
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,123
Johnny and sis told me what happened.

138
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,557
- How's Texas doing?
- All right.

139
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,824
- Heard you two had...
- Just short of a major war, yeah.

140
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,322
<i>Come on in.</i>

141
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,635
You know, Cole could have bought
those horses for Johnny or Jamie.

142
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,545
Yeah, that would have completed
the Collins' vast empire pretty good.

143
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:21,745
Johnny's got enough for Tex
to be jealous of already, don't you think?

144
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,549
Can't see where Tex'd get jealous.

145
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:29,650
Johnny's always following him around
like some kinda puppy dog.

146
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:34,289
- Yeah, like a rich puppy dog.
- Kids don't think about money that much.

147
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,129
They do when you gotta sell their horse.

148
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:43,162
I didn't mean to hit him like that,
though. It's not like it was his fault.

149
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,868
- It wasn't anybody's fault.
- It sure as hell was.

150
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,470
It was my pop's fault. He ditched us here.

151
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:53,250
You know, I almost quit school
last quarter to get a job.

152
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:57,481
They might have let you quit school.
They'll never let you quit basketball.

153
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:01,924
I can't play basketball
if I gotta get a job to take care of Tex.

154
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:08,589
Coach Jackson's
got me in for a scholarship at Indiana.

155
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:13,330
Scouts don't even come to Bixby.
He's gotta send them a film of me playing.

156
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,770
If I make it through this season,

157
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,502
I'm gonna get out of Bixby
and I ain't coming back.

158
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:45,501
- Did we get any mail today?
- Couple more bills.

159
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:50,339
If you're hot to pay them,
it's OK with me.

160
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,401
Nothing from Pop, huh?

161
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,075
Pop would send us bills
if he thought we'd pay 'em.

162
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,109
I think he's hoping we'll forget
we got a father out there.

163
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:10,149
Yeah. Well, he's gotta come back,
specially if you're going off to college.

164
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,958
Hey, it's Lem.

165
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,334
Hey, Lem.

166
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,106
Hey!

167
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,978
T for Texas! How you doing, man?

168
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,751
Finally got us a man from the big city.

169
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,724
When did they let you out of Tulsa?
Where's Connie?

170
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:46,923
Oh, Connie's back in Tulsa.
She's with another man.

171
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:50,433
- What do you boys feel like doing?
- Another man?

172
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:56,337
Yeah. They're in bed together.
Course, guy's only a couple of hours old.

173
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:06,278
- You mean you had your baby?
- No, Connie did all the having.

174
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,377
- I just paced a hole in the damn floor.
- Tell your folks yet?

175
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:14,788
No, Mason, we figured we ought to wait
till we'd been married nine months.

176
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:19,761
Come on, guys, get your coats.
Let's go tell some people.

177
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,863
I can just see Cole
breaking out the champagne.

178
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,529
Cole don't have to know about it.

179
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:32,234
I been in Cole's house a thousand times
without him knowing about it.

180
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,801
Yeah, well, I guess you do have to have
a few more people congratulate you.

181
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:39,576
- Getting an entire woman pregnant.
- I like how you put that.

182
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,518
Johnny says Cole's been on the warpath
all week.

183
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,120
- Hurry up, it's Cole.
- Ssh!

184
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,713
Open up!

185
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,521
What the hell's going on?

186
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:28,258
Will you guys be a little more hospitable
here? We got our common law articles.

187
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,596
- Hey, boy or girl?
- Boy.

188
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:34,403
- What does he weigh?
- I don't know what he weighs.

189
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:37,872
Kid just got born, man.
We put him on a diet already?

190
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:41,900
- How about a little celebration?
- Yeah! Give me that!

191
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,670
I'm gonna go get Jamie.

192
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,808
- Keep it down. My Dad's still up.
- Oh, I ain't scared of Cole.

193
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,877
Well, good, Mace.
I'll tell him you're here.

194
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,486
<i>Hey, Jamie.</i>

195
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:35,662
- Oh, I thought you were Johnny.
- Well, I ain't.

196
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,596
- Jamie, are you in bed?
- Cut it out.

197
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,399
Get in the closet.

198
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,462
Yes, Dad?

199
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:48,073
Jamie, what was that noise?

200
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,477
I think the wind blew the door shut.

201
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:54,779
- I told you to leave the window closed.
- I can't sleep when it's closed.

202
00:20:55,652 --> 00:21:01,147
Well, you won't be able to sit if you
don't. You leave this shut, you hear?

203
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,716
I'm not deaf, Cole.

204
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,496
Good night.

205
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:24,941
Hey, you do have a reason for being
in my bedroom in the middle of the night?

206
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,812
I... Well...

207
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:30,115
Don't look so scared. I got my nightgown.

208
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:32,348
I'm not scared. Scared of what?

209
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,285
Getting what you came for.

210
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:40,888
Oh, no, no. See, Lem showed up.
He's over in Johnny and Bob's room.

211
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:42,989
Oh, yeah? Boy or girl?

212
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:46,263
- It's a boy.
- Ah!

213
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:59,181
I'm sitting there and this nurse comes in.

214
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:03,845
She goes, "Hey, are you gonna be
like her coach in there?"

215
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:07,322
And I says, "Her coach? What is this now?
A sport or something?"

216
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:10,383
"Compete against the other moms,
who can have their kid first?"

217
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,054
I said, "I'm sitting in that waiting room,

218
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,725
<i>and I'm gonna read some old Time
magazine 20 times before I go in there."</i>

219
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,234
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hey, Lem. Congratulations.

220
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,863
- Thank you.
- You get caught in a storm on the way?

221
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:24,134
You're just lucky she didn't have it
loaded with ink this time.

222
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:27,438
No, what he's lucky
is that I didn't have my BB gun with me.

223
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,241
No, where I'm really lucky
is Cole didn't catch me over there.

224
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:32,680
Whoa! Instant death.

225
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,843
You are a little young
to be hiding men in closets.

226
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,911
I wouldn't mind
if most of them stayed hid.

227
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,321
- So, you had a boy?
- You're damn straight.

228
00:22:41,391 --> 00:22:45,521
If it'd been a girl, you could have kept
on trying till you got what you wanted.

229
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:50,055
Oh, Jesus! Don't get her started
on that femalism stuff.

230
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,828
Feminism.

231
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:54,462
Boy, I'm glad
Connie don't mess around with that stuff.

232
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,733
Jamie, you're a real good kid,

233
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:01,437
but you don't know nothing about being
a wife and a mother, so cool out, little girl.

234
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:05,607
Well, good luck, but personally I don't
think the two of you could raise a cat.

235
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,775
You got a kind word for everybody,
don't you?

236
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,944
Lay off, Mace.

237
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,750
Kid's only five hours old, for God's sake!

238
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:17,726
Yeah, and probably smarter
than the both of you put together.

239
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,854
<i>- Hey, Jamie!
- Sorry.</i>

240
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,764
Tell Connie I'll baby-sit
as soon as I learn how to drive.

241
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:28,396
<i>- Sure, I'll tell her.
- What's all that noise up there?</i>

242
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,375
- Hey, congratulations.
- Hit that light.

243
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:40,148
Hi, Dad.

244
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:55,964
I'm telling you, Cole jumps on those guys
like a duck on a June bug.

245
00:23:56,033 --> 00:24:00,629
I'd be a little bit uptight too,
if I was 48 before I threw my first kid.

246
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:03,138
- It's too late for you, Lem.
- Yeah, right!

247
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:07,108
Hey, listen, you boys got to come by
and see Connie and the kid, all right?

248
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:12,809
Oh, I almost forgot.
Pass around the cigars, huh?

249
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:14,510
No, not for me. I'm in training.

250
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:17,348
You're gonna have to teach my kid
to fast break.

251
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:21,289
Listen, the next time you farm boys
hit the big city, come on by.

252
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:24,691
- Sure.
- See you at the fair. OK, Tex?

253
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:27,161
- Not me, but say hi to Connie.
- OK, buddy.

254
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,824
Take care, Lem.

255
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:40,638
If you smoke that thing,
don't come hollering to me in the night.

256
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,410
I won't. Last time I smoked one of these,
I damn near fell off my horse.

257
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:49,543
Hey, you're not going to the fair?

258
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,952
lt'd just be the same thing as last year.
Waste of money.

259
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,048
I'm going, and I'm taking the pickup.

260
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,721
No way. The way you drive,
you wouldn't last ten minutes in Tulsa.

261
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:04,130
You haven't got a licence, anyway.
I will drive you and I'll give you five bucks.

262
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:07,227
Don't bother asking for any more.

263
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:18,376
It's pretty neat about Lem, huh?

264
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:20,575
Don't see what's so neat about it.

265
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,484
When Connie got pregnant, everybody
acted like it was the end of the damn world.

266
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:28,115
- I thought you were happy for them.
- Oh, yeah, I'm delighted

267
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,216
Man gets to pump gas all day.

268
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:34,229
He's married to a girl he could half-stand
when he was going out with her.

269
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,458
He gets to scramble around for money.

270
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:40,663
You and Jamie, both. I don't see why
the guy can't have a baby if he wants to.

271
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:44,366
Yeah? Well, it looks like he can,
even if he doesn't want to.

272
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:50,743
Jamie's smartass enough to make you
crazy, but at least she ain't dumb.

273
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,185
Night.

274
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,765
You want to see the horses?

275
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,899
No, I don't feel like
checking out any horses.

276
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:26,245
You wanna hit Bill's?

277
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,741
Yeah, why not?

278
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,965
Yeehaa!

279
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,735
If we fall out,
I hope we land in the girlie show.

280
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,777
We can't, man. You have to be 18.

281
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:05,111
Knock off rocking the car. You hear me?

282
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:13,196
You morons!
Wait till you get down out of the car!

283
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:14,992
You idiots!

284
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:19,297
They don't care how bad
they louse up the ride for everybody else.

285
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:29,672
If you're gonna kill yourself, you can go
to the Mad Mouse as far as I'm concerned.

286
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:42,419
We burned him!
Either that or he had a seizure.

287
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:45,825
You kids came from a sideshow
or something?

288
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:47,157
- How you doing?
- Hi.

289
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,996
We just made a jailbreak
off that Ferris wheel over there.

290
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:55,871
- You guys been to the fortune teller?
- I'm not wasting my money on that junk.

291
00:27:55,939 --> 00:28:00,000
He's afraid she's gonna tell him
something he doesn't want to hear.

292
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,842
- I'll pay for it.
- I'll pay. It's my own damn fortune.

293
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,369
Sit down, please.

294
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,946
Cross my palm with silver.

295
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:48,383
Oh, you want me to pay you?

296
00:28:55,965 --> 00:29:01,426
- When is your birthday?
- October 22nd. I'll be sweet 16.

297
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,703
Give me your palm.

298
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,041
Your far past.

299
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:20,282
You are a fourth-generation cowboy.

300
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:27,024
Your next year. Change.

301
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:31,994
don't change.

302
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,961
Your future.

303
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:39,898
There are people who go, people who stay.

304
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:43,036
You, you will stay.

305
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:49,441
"Change" and "don't change"?
What do you mean?

306
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:56,457
You may think to yourself
one yes-or-no question.

307
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:07,565
- OK, yeah.
- I am sorry.

308
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:12,003
The answer is no.

309
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:35,961
Good night, then, Tex. Go to bed, man.

310
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,727
Tex, where in the heck you been?

311
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:08,958
<i>Just went down to this party.
Friend of Bob's.</i>

312
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,758
Only stayed for a few minutes.

313
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:19,704
- I think I'm sick.
- I think you're drunk.

314
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:24,069
Good night.

315
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:43,332
Remember that last fight
Mom and Pop had? Before she died?

316
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,562
She ended up walking out there
in the snow.

317
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,334
I could hear 'em shouting at each other.

318
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,810
You couldn't remember that.
You weren't even three years old.

319
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:02,180
I remember it anyway,
or I sort of remember.

320
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:06,154
Everybody was so tall.

321
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:11,387
I wanted to go out there and stop it,
but I couldn't reach up to the door knob.

322
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:15,661
And after that, I don't remember it all.

323
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,627
There's not much to remember.

324
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:24,105
She stayed out there a couple of hours
and came back in.

325
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:30,442
A few days later, the doctor said she had
pneumonia and put her in the hospital.

326
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,038
A few more days and that was it.

327
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,812
I'm gonna get some sleep.

328
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,019
- Can you get undressed by yourself?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

329
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:40,346
Oh, my head!

330
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:46,817
Hi, Cole.

331
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:51,383
Mace, Bob and Johnny
both came home drunk last night.

332
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:53,429
Oh, no.

333
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:55,987
I'd like to know why.

334
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:59,364
Well, they were drinking, I imagine.

335
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:04,839
I know Bob, and I'm not sending him
to college to be an idiot.

336
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,307
Now, we've got that straight.

337
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:10,369
Bob wouldn't get drunk,
and if he did, he wouldn't drive.

338
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:13,313
And he sure as hell
wouldn't let Johnny drink.

339
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:16,546
Well, except for them coming home drunk,
that sounds fine.

340
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:19,281
- Somebody got 'em drunk.
- Wasn't me.

341
00:34:19,355 --> 00:34:23,655
I happen to be in training, which means
I'm in bed every night by 10 o'clock.

342
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:28,823
I wouldn't touch a beer if I was dying
of thirst. Why don't you ask Robert?

343
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:33,528
I did. He said it was his fault. Says he
took them over to some party somewhere.

344
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:38,233
Maybe he's telling the truth. He does
that sometimes. Keeps you guessing.

345
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,741
Now, don't you get smart with me, Mace.

346
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,075
I'd like to talk to Tex,
if you don't mind.

347
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:48,174
Yeah, well, I do mind.
I mind a lot, as a matter of fact.

348
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,914
Don't you have enough kids of your own
to hassle?

349
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:55,480
- How old are you, Mason?
- 18. I'll be 19 this summer.

350
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:58,322
I haven't seen your Pop
around here much this year.

351
00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:03,058
His work requires him to travel.
What is this call? The census?

352
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:07,034
Two boys living out here alone
without the sign of an adult.

353
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,367
Now, that's really something.

354
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:12,966
I bet the state welfare people
would like to know about this.

355
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:16,569
And if anybody was to call
at County Juvenile Bureau...

356
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:20,138
If everybody was to mind their own
business, we'd be doing just fine.

357
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:24,915
I would appreciate it if the two of you
didn't associate with my kids.

358
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:27,888
Well, you tell that to them.

359
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,327
I don't believe that stuff.
Not associate with his kids!

360
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:39,732
Probably afraid
we're gonna corrupt 'em all.

361
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,828
After Bob Collins shoving everything

362
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:47,171
from dirty magazines to 3.2% beer
in my face my whole life!

363
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:52,304
Tex?

364
00:35:56,686 --> 00:36:00,645
- You lose something?
- It's sorta nice down here.

365
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,622
Cool and quiet.

366
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:07,663
Come and have breakfast
under the kitchen table,

367
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,063
so you'll be on time
to get under the school bus.

368
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:13,295
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

369
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,308
Anyway, I can't make it to school today.

370
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:29,442
I woke up sick. I think I got
a 24-hour virus or something.

371
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,714
An 80-proof hangover, that's what you got.

372
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:36,157
I can't make it through a day of school.
Everything's spinning around.

373
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:38,591
Then maybe you'll sit still for once.

374
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:42,256
Tex, I don't want you
missing any more school.

375
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:48,361
Hear what Cole said about that Juvenile
Authority? Think that ain't for real?

376
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:51,133
You're a minor without a guardian,
remember?

377
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,937
I thought you were my guardian.

378
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,606
As far as the damned court is concerned,
I'm as underage as you are.

379
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,080
How about if we go to Indiana, then?

380
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,984
<i>Nobody said nothing
about we going to Indiana.</i>

381
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,185
I don't even know if I'm going.

382
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:12,716
Coach sent them that film
and I haven't heard a damn thing.

383
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,195
They're gonna want you, though.
I know that.

384
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:18,199
You're probably the best
high school basketball player...

385
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:23,034
Tex, I'm trying to explain to you.
We are not both going to Indiana.

386
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:27,098
- Why can't I come?
- What do I with you when I'm at college?

387
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:31,474
Where are you gonna live? In my locker?

388
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,208
So you're gonna go
and I'm gonna stay here?

389
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:40,278
Nobody's going nowhere if you bring
social workers down on our necks.

390
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,551
Grow some brains, will ya?

391
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:47,692
You want to stay off some youth farm?
Start thinking ahead five minutes.

392
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:53,099
All you care about is going off
and being a big basketball star.

393
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:56,661
Well, it beats staying here
and being a screwup.

394
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:33,303
OK, guys, that's it.

395
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,801
OK, I like it.

396
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,640
Oh, you added some colour to it, I see.
Good.

397
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:17,813
Be careful when you're gluing it.

398
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:22,318
Nice. Nice texture.
Oh, yeah, I like it a lot.

399
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,290
Smooth that out a little bit.

400
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,352
- How's this coming?
- Fine.

401
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,024
That's good. Very good design.

402
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:51,046
Good. I really like how it's taking
shape. That's just fine.

403
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,533
Grade it, quick!

404
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:11,664
It's going fast. You'd better grade it.

405
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:22,283
Tex, setting fire to school property
is not a little joke.

406
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,546
I don't care
what that property happens to be.

407
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,989
Now, what if something on that desk had
caught on fire, or somebody's clothes?

408
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:31,049
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:35,988
Were you angry with Mrs. Germanie
because you couldn't do a good sculpture?

410
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:40,593
I don't think there was any psychology
involved, if that's what you're asking.

411
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,637
My sculpture looked better on fire.

412
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,866
- Tex...
- No, ma'am, really.

413
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,034
If you'd had seen it,
you'd probably agree with me.

414
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:56,641
- Are you and your brother getting along?
- We're doing great.

415
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,988
Mason, he's always after me about
eating right and studying and everything.

416
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:06,825
- Have you heard from your dad?
- Oh, Pop, yeah.

417
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:10,332
When he goes away on one of his trips,
he doesn't go for long.

418
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,060
But when he does go away,

419
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:15,900
he always makes sure he sticks a little
note in with the cheque that he sends us,

420
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,202
just to let us know how he's doing.

421
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,177
I could suspend you for this.

422
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:23,768
I'm gonna let it pass,

423
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:28,306
but please do not let me see you
in this office again this quarter.

424
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:31,012
I'll probably be in there again this week.

425
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,783
Yeah, well, good for you.

426
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:36,654
- Here.
- What do you mean?

427
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:42,059
Well, seems I can catch enough hell as it
is, without going round looking for more.

428
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:45,828
- You're starting to sound like Cole.
- And what's wrong with that?

429
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,734
You're the one who goes round
griping about him all the time.

430
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:52,740
Now you sound like you believe him
about me and Mace being so bad.

431
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:55,072
Tex, you leave Cole out of this, you hear?

432
00:41:55,144 --> 00:41:57,612
He's my father
and I can bitch about him if I want to.

433
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,013
Bitch about your own,
if you ever see him again.

434
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,633
I want to talk to you.

435
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:30,543
- Sure.
- No, some place a little more quiet.

436
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:42,546
When are you and Johnny gonna stop
being so stupid and start talking again?

437
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,685
People thought we sounded stupid
even when we were talking.

438
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:48,958
Yeah, well, this is ridiculous.
It's been two weeks.

439
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:52,592
I wouldn't let a little argument
get between Linda Murphy and me.

440
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:55,933
I thought your best friend was Marcie.

441
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:57,939
That was last month.

442
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:01,773
If I switched best friends every month,
I guess it wouldn't matter.

443
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:06,474
- But this matters to me.
- You think it doesn't matter to Johnny?

444
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:09,313
Look, he's gonna be out dirt-biking
after school today.

445
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:13,321
If you two don't stop being so asinine,
I'm not gonna speak to either of you.

446
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,847
Oh, why,
that just might put me off my feed!

447
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,952
You know, Tex, you really are cute.

448
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,864
- Oh, Tex, you're so cute.
- Shut up.

449
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:28,293
- You're so cute.
- He's so cute.

450
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,192
Hey, Mike. How are you ropers doing?

451
00:44:18,387 --> 00:44:21,481
- Tex, do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

452
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:36,370
How come none of us was round
when you jumped the creek?

453
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,929
Not my fault. Must have been Sunday.

454
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:45,074
He was crazy, man.
That little dirt bike of his?

455
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:48,947
- He'd need a 350, at least.
- Fergus can't ride.

456
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:51,384
Well, I'd do it now,
except I'm low on gas.

457
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:55,082
Your bike couldn't make it
across the creek if it had wings on it.

458
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:57,648
What the hell are you saying?

459
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,401
Hey, Johnny!

460
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:26,545
Hey! Johnny!

461
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:44,767
Anything broken?

462
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,401
- I don't think so.
- Man, you could've been killed.

463
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:52,208
- What happened? Run out of gas?
- He hit a bump. Anybody can hit a bump.

464
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:56,581
- Bike looks all right.
- What's the matter? Too cold to swim?

465
00:45:57,953 --> 00:45:59,944
Let me give that bike a try.

466
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,753
Clear a path.

467
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,541
Come on, Rowdy!

468
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:41,986
Man...

469
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,360
Are you all right, Tex?

470
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:52,897
Yeah, I'm all right.

471
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:02,040
Boy, you're crazy! Are you OK?

472
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:05,314
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at that.

473
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:11,553
- I made it. I didn't do it with wings either.
- That was great, man.

474
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:14,919
Here you go.

475
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:45,885
Um... I'm going in to Tulsa.
You wanna come?

476
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:48,953
Yeah. You think we can go see a movie?

477
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:51,022
Yeah, maybe.

478
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:00,401
You can go while I'm at the hospital
if you want.

479
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:03,775
- Hospital?
- Yeah, I got to get some tests.

480
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:07,772
Drop you off at the mall.

481
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:24,324
What's with you?

482
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:28,235
It's not cancer or anything, is it?

483
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:33,738
Cancer? Think that's all people
go to hospitals for, is cancer?

484
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:39,145
- Well, then, what is it?
- Probably nothing serious. Don't worry.

485
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:43,207
If I thought it was some kind
of big deal, I would've told you.

486
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:45,776
I don't lie to you, remember?

487
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,190
Tex!

488
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:02,661
Hey, Tex!

489
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:07,197
Are you deaf, or just dumb?

490
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:11,007
- Hi.
- Hi, yourself. Bargain hunting?

491
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,981
Naah. So, what's happening?

492
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,417
Going to a movie.
Cole's gonna pick us up later.

493
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:23,322
- Is it a good movie?
- I don't know. I haven't seen it yet.

494
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:26,520
- That's right.
- Yeah.

495
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:30,789
What are you doing here, anyway?

496
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:32,959
I'm just killing time.

497
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:36,368
Hey, Jamie, come on. We're already late.

498
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:41,068
Yeah, well, it certainly was interesting
talking to you. I gotta go.

499
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,576
See you later.

500
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:46,009
God, he is so cute!

501
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:54,153
- So, what'd they say?
- Got an ulcer.

502
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,525
Ulcer? Is that serious?

503
00:49:57,593 --> 00:50:02,553
Well, it could get serious.
Could get pretty goddamn serious, yeah.

504
00:50:02,631 --> 00:50:06,123
- How'd you get an ulcer?
- I don't know how I got it.

505
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:11,165
Doctor said I'm not supposed
to let things get to me.

506
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:13,207
However you do that.

507
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:18,069
- And I take these.
- What are they?

508
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:20,637
For pain.

509
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:24,413
- You getting pains?
- Yeah, I got pains.

510
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:27,717
Last week after practice,
I was spitting up blood.

511
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:30,883
Oh, no, man.
Are you gonna be able to play?

512
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,593
Yeah, for the time being.

513
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,248
Oh, hi, Mace!
God, I haven't seen you since forever.

514
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:01,789
Hey, Tex! How you doing?

515
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:06,851
Oh, you guys haven't seen the baby yet.
Just let me tell Lem you're here, OK?

516
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:08,953
Lem!

517
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:13,229
- It's OK, it's just Tex and Mace.
- Oh, great!

518
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:17,761
Hey, fellas, how you doing? I didn't
think you guys would ever come visit me.

519
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,273
- How you doing?
- Just great, man.

520
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,537
What do you think?

521
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:25,739
Yeah! These are Daddy's old friends, yeah.

522
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:31,949
This is Tex and this is Mason. They came
all the way from Bixby just to see you.

523
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,580
Yeah, how about that?

524
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,593
Yeah, they did.
Hey, Tex, you wanna hold him?

525
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,029
- Well, I never held one before.
- Go ahead, he won't bite. Here.

526
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:46,898
- Be careful.
- Hey, Lukie! Hey!

527
00:51:49,905 --> 00:51:52,203
It's kinda like holding a puppy.

528
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:54,674
Ain't much heavier than a basketball,
is he?

529
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:58,804
- He's almost as round.
- Don't dribble him though, OK?

530
00:51:59,114 --> 00:52:01,207
He's the one doing all the dribbling.

531
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:08,683
It's all right, sweetie.

532
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,591
Is he house-broken yet?
Must be fun training him, huh?

533
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:14,993
Tex, he's not a horse, OK?

534
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,964
Oh, yeah, by the way, guys,
I wanna show you something else.

535
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,469
- We'll be right back, honey.
- See you later, Luke.

536
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:23,766
- See you, Connie.
- Say bye, Lukie.

537
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,808
Say bye. Say bye.

538
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,672
Yeah, it's all right.

539
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,037
Da da da-da da-daaa!

540
00:52:33,014 --> 00:52:34,675
When'd you get it, man?

541
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,218
Couple of weeks ago.
What do you think, man?

542
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:40,379
Gas jockeys must be getting better wages
these days.

543
00:52:40,455 --> 00:52:41,615
Good enough, man.

544
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,683
I had an eight-track in there.
Got ripped off the day I got it, though.

545
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:47,524
Yeah? Where?

546
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:50,861
Over at ORU stadium.
Should have known better.

547
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:53,457
Lem, how much you been dealing?

548
00:52:58,306 --> 00:53:01,002
I'm not dealing, man.

549
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:05,479
I'm just helping some friends get hold
of a little grass and speed. No big deal.

550
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:10,780
- Yeah, right.
- Don't get high and mighty with me.

551
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:14,948
I'm just a go-between. It's not like
I'm out selling it on Peoria Avenue.

552
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:17,787
And I reckon you don't use it much, either.

553
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:21,521
Oh, yeah. I'm real hooked, you know.

554
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:24,895
Next thing you know,
I'll be stealing car stereos.

555
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:28,800
Come on, man. Hey, I've seen you
about as high as anybody else.

556
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,465
How about Joe Ray's party.
You remember that, man?

557
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:36,405
Look, when my kid gets older,
I'll cool it.

558
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,702
Oh. Uh-huh.

559
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:42,549
Yeah, well, maybe
it's a little bit easier on you, buddy.

560
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:47,111
You ain't got a wife and kid to feed.
You don't have people depending on you.

561
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:50,625
- Come on, let's go for a ride.
- What do you think he is, a baboon?

562
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:51,784
Who? Me?

563
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,727
It ain't a big deal, Mason.

564
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:59,597
- Come on, let's go get some pizza.
- No, we'd better get going back.

565
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:04,765
- You wanna drive?
- Yeah. All right!

566
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,434
Come on, let's say goodbye to Connie.

567
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:15,473
When you're, like, making out with a girl,

568
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:18,915
how do you know
when it's OK to go any further?

569
00:54:18,984 --> 00:54:21,953
How much further you been going?

570
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:26,788
I didn't do it going anywhere yet.
But I'm just thinking, just in case.

571
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:34,129
Uh-huh. Well, don't worry about it. You
keep going, she'll tell you when to stop.

572
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,533
You planning on being the school stud
or something?

573
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,734
You've been going all the way, right?

574
00:54:45,611 --> 00:54:48,102
No, I never done that.

575
00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:57,288
- Don't tell anyone.
- But I thought you and Bobby...

576
00:54:57,356 --> 00:55:00,621
Bobby hasn't gone any further than I have.

577
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:03,161
Everybody talks.

578
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:08,361
If you believe everything you hear
in a locker room, you'll never wise up.

579
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:10,800
Probably had a lot of chances, though.
Right?

580
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:14,805
Yeah, I've had plenty of chances
to end up like Lem.

581
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:22,509
If you're thinking about Jamie,
you might as well forget it.

582
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:26,950
Why? Just 'cause they got money
and we don't? What's the difference?

583
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,579
You know, money isn't everything.

584
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:34,115
It ain't the money.
Because you're Tex and she's Jamie.

585
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:40,026
Thanks a whole goddamn lot.

586
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:49,367
You wanna pick up this kid?

587
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,090
We're headed for Bixby.

588
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,830
Step in the right direction, anyway.

589
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:21,805
- How about yourself?
- Going to the state line.

590
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:24,775
Had all the 3.2% beer you can take, huh?

591
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:28,244
Yeah, that's right.
I want me some full-proof Budweiser,

592
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:31,147
so how about we just keep going
to that state line?

593
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,782
Let's all take it easy, huh?

594
00:56:44,129 --> 00:56:47,223
Isn't this kind of extreme?

595
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:50,234
Sooner or later, somebody
would've been going to the state line.

596
00:56:50,302 --> 00:56:53,703
When you got people looking for you,
you can't really wait till then,

597
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:56,263
so I decided to make it sooner.

598
00:56:57,209 --> 00:57:00,110
<i>This sucker is loaded,
in case you're wondering.</i>

599
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:02,238
No doubt in my mind.

600
00:57:13,158 --> 00:57:15,422
- Hey, man, you OK?
- He's great.

601
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:19,726
You just keep driving at the speed limit,
he's gonna be fantastic.

602
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:32,101
- Nobody said let's go cruising for a pizza.
- Nobody saw you.

603
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:35,711
Roll up that window.

604
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:43,084
I could've been in East Texas by now,

605
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:45,623
except I had some business to take care of.

606
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:48,649
I thought I did, anyhow.

607
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:52,720
Guy keeps telling you
you're just like a brother to him.

608
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:55,062
Finds out you sell enough speed
to make lunch money,

609
00:57:55,134 --> 00:58:00,128
and he drops it down on you
for five years' worth, no time off.

610
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:04,769
Somebody screws you like that,
you screw 'em right back.

611
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:07,141
Right, cowboy?

612
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:13,749
Came time to do it and somehow it just
didn't seem like it was worth the effort.

613
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:19,185
He's lying there, going,
"Go on, finish it off."

614
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:25,219
Let him walk around with a hole in him.
He can whistle through it, all I care.

615
00:58:31,103 --> 00:58:35,096
One more mile an hour
and Stretch here gets dead.

616
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:05,393
Throw down your weapon.

617
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:13,835
Tex, duck!

618
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:41,269
- The guy had a gun on my brother.
- You guys all right?

619
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:44,607
Been an APB out on that guy.

620
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:49,010
Someone saw you drive through Bixby
with him and called it in.

621
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:50,844
He just escaped from McAllister now.

622
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:54,977
I tell you what, that punk would have
killed you all if he'd had the chance.

623
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:59,285
You're either real brave,
real stupid or real lucky.

624
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:02,526
I've been hearing that all my life.

625
01:00:09,301 --> 01:00:11,963
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

626
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:29,083
- Hey, man, are you OK?
- Oh, yeah, I never felt better.

627
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:39,424
<i>... shootout. leaving Mark Jennings.
the escapee. dead from police gunfire.</i>

628
01:00:39,498 --> 01:00:43,434
<i>The drug dealer killed a trustee during
his escape and wounded another man.</i>

629
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:46,869
<i>before kidnapping twwo local teenagers.
Tex and Mason McCormick.</i>

630
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,998
<i>demanding to be driven to the state line.</i>

631
01:00:49,074 --> 01:00:53,010
<i>Police caught up with them when Tex
McCormick drove his truck into a ditch.</i>

632
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:57,047
<i>... he was shot. fleeing the truck...</i>

633
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:59,583
<i>If it's The Clarion.
tell 'em to forget it.</i>

634
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:03,619
Hello? Hey, Johnny, pretty slick, huh?

635
01:01:04,823 --> 01:01:06,688
No, no, no, I'm on now.

636
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:10,091
Get off the phone and watch.
See you later.

637
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:12,961
Hey, that's us.

638
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:15,158
Take it easy,
you don't have your own show yet.

639
01:01:15,233 --> 01:01:18,634
<i>So why did you pull off
the side of the road here?</i>

640
01:01:18,704 --> 01:01:22,970
<i>He had this gun on my brother. I thought
he was gonna shoot him or something.</i>

641
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:26,772
<i>- Were you scared?
- Yeah. I was scared! I was...</i>

642
01:01:26,878 --> 01:01:29,176
<i>I was really scared. Were you scared?</i>

643
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,011
<i>No. I wasn't scared.
What a stupid question!</i>

644
01:01:34,419 --> 01:01:36,512
<i>Will you ever pick up a hitchhiker again?</i>

645
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:42,549
<i>I don't know. I don't think they're
all bad. you know. I hitchhike sometimes.</i>

646
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:47,322
You look pretty cool.
I sound funny, though.

647
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,165
<i>Tex. one final question.</i>

648
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:52,726
<i>Where'd you get those dimples?</i>

649
01:01:52,804 --> 01:01:57,969
<i>Well. God gave me my face
but he let me pick my nose.</i>

650
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:01,768
I can't believe you said that.

651
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:07,114
<i>And one bright note. Mace McCormick.
the Bixby High School basketball star.</i>

652
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:11,053
<i>no injuries for Mace. he'll be able
to suit up for the game against Eastmont.</i>

653
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:14,684
- I bet you liked that, huh?
- What's the difference?

654
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,621
Tex!

655
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,658
Hello?

656
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,360
Hey! Hey, Pop!

657
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:29,399
It's Pop. He saw us on TV.

658
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:31,465
Pop?

659
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:38,805
Hey, Mace, I think it's him.

660
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:44,413
It's not him. If he left at six o'clock
in the morning, he wouldn't even be here.

661
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:49,852
Hey, Pop! You look great.

662
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:53,658
Boy, have you grown!
Either that or I've shrunk.

663
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,668
- So how's the rodeo season?
- Aw, heck, I'm too old for rodeo.

664
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:05,638
- So what you been doing?
- Oh, just... messing around.

665
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:11,639
Howdy, Mace. Nice to see
you're mad at me as usual.

666
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,615
Now, why don't we just have the explosion
now and clear the air?

667
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:18,884
All right, I've been known to explode.

668
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:23,053
Like when we hadn't heard from you
and all the money was gone,

669
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:25,688
and the gas got shut off
and I had to sell the horses.

670
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:30,064
- Sold your horse?
- Yeah, I sold my horse, and Tex's, too.

671
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,504
Oh, Mace, I'm sorry.

672
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:37,099
I would have thought about the money
but I didn't figure on being gone so long.

673
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:39,405
I'd like to know
how long you're planning on staying.

674
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:42,641
- You're not giving him any reason to stay.
- You just shut up.

675
01:03:42,714 --> 01:03:46,206
Well, I reckon there ain't much I can say.

676
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:51,849
I quit the rodeo.
All I can say is I'll be staying.

677
01:03:51,923 --> 01:03:55,120
And all you can do
is give me a chance to prove it.

678
01:03:55,193 --> 01:03:59,254
I'll tell you what. Let's start off
by getting those horses back.

679
01:03:59,331 --> 01:04:01,663
All right!

680
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:06,670
Well, I don't want mine back,
but you can get Rowdy back for Tex.

681
01:04:06,738 --> 01:04:09,332
That's a promise, son. Come on.

682
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:21,819
<i>You made sure
I wouldn't find them, huh?</i>

683
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:26,790
That's all I would've needed,
you getting busted for horse theft.

684
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:43,937
- I want to see my horse.
- Yeah, you go say hi to Rusty.

685
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,340
Rowdy.

686
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:50,973
Me and your brother are gonna talk the
universal language to the gentleman here.

687
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:36,150
Hey, Rowdy.

688
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:43,865
They got you jumping barrels
and everything out here.

689
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:47,895
I'm gonna take you home.

690
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:53,676
- Hi. Who are you?
- Well, this used to be my horse.

691
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:57,579
You're not the boy we bought him from.

692
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:01,608
Yeah, I know. That was my brother.
See, it was an accident.

693
01:06:01,686 --> 01:06:04,553
He wasn't supposed to sell it,
but he didn't know.

694
01:06:04,623 --> 01:06:06,716
Well, we knew we were buying him.

695
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,527
My dad paid for him fair and square.

696
01:06:11,196 --> 01:06:13,187
I know.

697
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:21,902
So he's my horse now.

698
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:26,801
- Did you used to ride him western?
- Yeah.

699
01:06:26,878 --> 01:06:30,143
I ride him jumping.
He really seems to like it.

700
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:33,316
I used to jump him.

701
01:06:33,385 --> 01:06:37,583
We used to go out in the fields though.
We used to jump big logs.

702
01:06:37,656 --> 01:06:39,954
I showed him at a show
a couple of weeks ago.

703
01:06:40,025 --> 01:06:43,825
- Yeah? How'd he do?
- He took a third.

704
01:06:45,463 --> 01:06:48,057
I had a pony before, but he died.

705
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,864
He's really been a good horse,

706
01:06:51,937 --> 01:06:55,896
once we got a little weight off him
and we got his coat in shape.

707
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,943
He's real smart for his age.

708
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:04,882
Never did much show riding with him.

709
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,044
I didn't think I'd want another horse
until I got him.

710
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:10,417
- Right, Gentleman?
- Gentleman?

711
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:12,820
He likes you.

712
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:18,686
Yeah, I know.

713
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:44,251
I guess you heard too.
They don't want to sell him.

714
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:47,485
Save your damn breath.

715
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:49,424
Where's Pop? Let's get outta here.

716
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:54,056
Still saying goodbye.
Turns out the guy's a real rodeo fan.

717
01:07:54,132 --> 01:07:56,123
Great.

718
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:02,433
I'm gonna get you for this. I hate you.

719
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:05,738
<i>- Let's go, boys.
- I'm gonna get you back for this.</i>

720
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,268
I haven't been this mad at anyone
in my whole life.

721
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:12,282
- Yeah, well, you're young yet.
- Shut up.

722
01:10:54,913 --> 01:10:57,814
- You get him out of there!
- We got him.

723
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,577
I gotta see how he is.

724
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,681
Bixby Spartans!

725
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,651
Bixby Spartans!

726
01:11:12,597 --> 01:11:14,189
You OK, boy?

727
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:16,665
It's a miracle you stayed in there
as long as you did.

728
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:19,328
Those guys wanted to hang your head
in the hunting lodge.

729
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,497
Try bending it now. Slow.

730
01:11:22,707 --> 01:11:26,108
- They gonna bench that damn clown?
- Yeah. And you too, I guess.

731
01:11:26,177 --> 01:11:28,270
- It's not too serious.
- Can I go back in?

732
01:11:28,346 --> 01:11:32,612
No way, Mason. I'm sorry, you won't be
playing again for a couple of weeks.

733
01:11:32,684 --> 01:11:35,517
It doesn't matter.
Indiana never sent that application.

734
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:37,782
Yep. Deadline's next week.

735
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:42,087
I'm sorry, Mace.
You deserved it if anyone did.

736
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:47,359
Yeah, well, I guess a full grant was
a pretty steep order for a Bixby farm boy.

737
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:50,629
Hey, Tex, wanna trade clothes
and shoot a few baskets?

738
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:51,828
Sure, Mace.

739
01:11:51,903 --> 01:11:55,862
Take it easy now. You're no good
to anybody with a messed-up right arm.

740
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,532
Is this your boy?

741
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,840
Don't know yet.
Don't know how much he's gonna cost me.

742
01:12:00,912 --> 01:12:04,313
I didn't know a quarter horse like
you'd come up with such a lanky racer.

743
01:12:04,382 --> 01:12:05,940
His momma was a thoroughbred.

744
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:10,613
That's it. Just keep it in.
Hold it right like that.

745
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:14,317
Tighten up here.

746
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,463
What time are you meeting
Johnny and Bob?

747
01:12:22,533 --> 01:12:24,694
In an hour at the carwash.

748
01:12:28,773 --> 01:12:31,037
We got time for a Coke or something.

749
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:34,434
They sell Cokes round here?

750
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:51,288
Well, you had a Coke at the game,
and I ain't thirsty.

751
01:13:19,424 --> 01:13:21,858
What are you if you aren't thirsty?

752
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,021
Um...

753
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:31,562
I don't know. It feels kinda weird.

754
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,761
Yeah.

755
01:13:38,876 --> 01:13:40,867
Hey, Jamie...

756
01:13:42,847 --> 01:13:44,838
I think I love you.

757
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:47,783
I think me too.

758
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:11,164
- What's the matter?
- I'm not ready for that. I mean it.

759
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,437
What did you let me get started for, then?

760
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:16,503
How was I supposed to know
you were gonna be in such a hurry?

761
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:20,574
- I was curious.
- Curious? I'm burning up over here.

762
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:23,017
You're curious.

763
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:27,023
Tex, right now I think you're the only
boy I'll ever feel this way about.

764
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:30,083
But how am I supposed to know?

765
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:32,686
This last year has been so crazy.

766
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:36,725
One minute I hate everybody and if they
don't like me, they can just go jump.

767
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:43,297
The next minute, I love everybody and
I'm scared maybe they don't love me back.

768
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:46,571
Maybe Cole's right. Maybe I am too young
to get messed around.

769
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:50,603
But I tell you, I'm confused enough these
days without throwing sex in the deal.

770
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:53,582
I wasn't thinking of this as just sex.

771
01:15:08,499 --> 01:15:13,869
How about when we get older?
Maybe we could get married or something.

772
01:15:13,938 --> 01:15:18,034
- I can see me marrying you.
- You could?

773
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:20,043
<i>Yeah.</i>

774
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:22,306
It would last about a year.

775
01:15:31,956 --> 01:15:34,322
Guess old Mason was right.

776
01:15:34,392 --> 01:15:37,452
- What?
- It's like that fortune teller said.

777
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,762
You're one of the ones that's going.

778
01:15:53,144 --> 01:15:56,739
Yo, Tex, do you think this is worth it?

779
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:02,750
They're not gonna find out who did it.
Even if they do, what are they gonna do?

780
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,153
Send us down the principal's office
for a lecture?

781
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:10,757
<i>There, that's the last one.</i>

782
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:13,763
<i>Come on, I don't want
to miss the fireworks.</i>

783
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:16,891
OK, folks, let's get it together here.

784
01:16:16,968 --> 01:16:21,667
I know everybody's a little nutty
this week, but there is life after finals.

785
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:23,764
So let's get everything off our desks

786
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:28,175
except for pen or pencil,
and two pieces of loose-leaf paper.

787
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:47,528
Cathy, somebody has put caps
in the typewriters.

788
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:54,330
And you two were laughing
just a little bit too early, weren't you?

789
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:58,664
Who, me?

790
01:17:04,615 --> 01:17:07,584
Well, you boys must think
it was so nice of the county

791
01:17:07,652 --> 01:17:13,750
to build this school just so you could
have your fun, play your little jokes.

792
01:17:13,824 --> 01:17:17,021
- Hello, Mr. Collins.
- Mrs. Johnson.

793
01:17:17,995 --> 01:17:20,691
I might have known you'd be behind this.

794
01:17:20,765 --> 01:17:25,634
Ever since the first day you came round,
I knew you'd be trouble for Johnny.

795
01:17:25,703 --> 01:17:29,332
And I've been getting awful sick
of you getting Johnny in all these messes.

796
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:33,571
You ought to be just as sick of Johnny
getting Tex into 'em. I'd say it's 50-50.

797
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:36,636
Well, hello, Mason. I don't recall
inviting you to this meeting.

798
01:17:36,714 --> 01:17:38,306
Don't you have a class now?

799
01:17:38,382 --> 01:17:41,943
- I didn't know if my dad was coming.
- She called him. He'll be here.

800
01:17:42,019 --> 01:17:45,113
Tell me the truth.
Was this your idea or Johnny's?

801
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:47,248
It was my idea.

802
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:51,523
And the time they threw that shopping cart
off that roof into that pool,

803
01:17:51,596 --> 01:17:53,928
that was Johnny's idea, as I recall.

804
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:59,431
I told you this friendship
was just gonna keep lousing you up.

805
01:17:59,503 --> 01:18:03,564
Now, I want you to promise me
that you'll end it right now.

806
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:05,871
- No.
- What?

807
01:18:05,943 --> 01:18:07,205
No, sir.

808
01:18:07,278 --> 01:18:09,974
Mr. Collins, just so you'll know.

809
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:13,278
I'm gonna suspend both of these boys
for the next three days.

810
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:15,319
They can make up their quarter finals,

811
01:18:15,386 --> 01:18:18,753
but I'm gonna take 10 points
off each of the tests,

812
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:22,850
and I'm gonna recommend that the
high school put them in separate classes.

813
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:26,522
Well, I would think
that's the least you'd want to do.

814
01:18:26,597 --> 01:18:32,263
When I get this one home, I'm taking a lot
more off of him than 10 points on a test.

815
01:18:32,336 --> 01:18:34,896
You come with me.

816
01:18:44,348 --> 01:18:48,114
Hey, Cole Collins,
where you been keeping yourself?

817
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:51,120
I been keeping myself at home,
taking care of my family.

818
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,383
You ought to try that sometime,

819
01:18:53,457 --> 01:18:57,018
if the demand for rodeo clowns slows up.

820
01:18:57,094 --> 01:18:59,085
Come on.

821
01:19:01,799 --> 01:19:05,257
Appreciate your coming down, Mace,
and I really do think...

822
01:19:05,336 --> 01:19:11,036
Hey, everybody. What seems to be
the charges against this here outlaw?

823
01:19:11,108 --> 01:19:16,671
Well, what we did was, we put some
of those caps on some typewriter keys.

824
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:19,841
Start the day off with a bang, huh?

825
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:23,284
That sounds like one of them crazy things
I used to do when I was a kid.

826
01:19:23,354 --> 01:19:26,448
- You were the one that told me about it.
- That's right.

827
01:19:26,524 --> 01:19:31,791
If you'll excuse me, Mr. McCormick,
I think I'd like to talk to Tex in private.

828
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:40,798
I'm sorry. I didn't think
this would cause this much trouble.

829
01:19:40,871 --> 01:19:44,307
You'd better start thinking,
because there are no more free chances.

830
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:47,902
- You know I almost expelled you today?
- Really?

831
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:53,006
I've considered it before,
but I haven't done it because I like you.

832
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,416
But I also like having
a halfway decent school.

833
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:59,013
If you make me choose,
I'm gonna choose the school, aren't I?

834
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:01,081
Yeah.

835
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:07,396
- I want to talk to you about a job.
- Huh?

836
01:20:08,032 --> 01:20:11,297
Mr. Kencaide,
over at the Kencaide Quarter Horse Ranch,

837
01:20:11,368 --> 01:20:15,634
he called, asking about hiring some kids
for summers and after school.

838
01:20:15,706 --> 01:20:17,469
Does that interest you?

839
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:24,379
He's not looking for any bronco busters,
just somebody to look after the horses.

840
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:26,313
And for some godforsaken reason,

841
01:20:26,383 --> 01:20:30,786
I thought you might behave responsibly
in a job like that. What do you think?

842
01:20:30,855 --> 01:20:33,517
Yeah, it might be all right.

843
01:20:33,591 --> 01:20:36,458
Just don't make me sorry
I recommended you.

844
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:39,690
Well, I take horses real serious.

845
01:20:40,598 --> 01:20:44,329
I hope so, Tex. I hope
there's something you take seriously.

846
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:47,370
Because it may be
the only thing that'll save you.

847
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:56,911
OK, you heard my punishment. You can go
on home now. Take your family with you.

848
01:21:02,052 --> 01:21:06,113
<i>You know better than that.
I was never one to go to PTA meetings.</i>

849
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,284
<i>So you can't take Tex serious,
you don't care what happens to him.</i>

850
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,486
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

851
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:14,657
<i>How do you think I feel when I see
you be nice to him like he's some puppy?</i>

852
01:21:14,732 --> 01:21:17,792
I'm the one that's gotta look after him.
What's gonna happen when I go away?

853
01:21:17,868 --> 01:21:21,895
Make it easier on me, at least!
He's my brother, even if he's not your son.

854
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:27,100
Who told you that?

855
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:29,271
Nobody had to tell me.

856
01:21:29,346 --> 01:21:32,804
I know when you went to prison
and I know when Tex's birthday is.

857
01:21:34,418 --> 01:21:36,511
- Is that true, Pop?
- Tex, listen...

858
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:39,181
<i>Tex, I didn't mean it like that.</i>

859
01:21:39,256 --> 01:21:42,089
I'm gonna split. I'll see you guys later.

860
01:21:46,797 --> 01:21:49,129
Jesus, Mace!

861
01:21:55,906 --> 01:21:59,034
Hey, Tex! Tex! Hey, kid!

862
01:21:59,109 --> 01:22:01,100
Hey!

863
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:08,183
- Man, where are you going to?
- Wherever you're going, Lem.

864
01:22:08,252 --> 01:22:12,746
Well, that's OK by me 'cause I'm bored,
man. Let's get out of here.

865
01:22:31,475 --> 01:22:34,239
Can't you make this thing go any faster?

866
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:38,210
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

867
01:22:42,753 --> 01:22:45,586
Back there, I was looking
for Dwayne Kirkpatrick,

868
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:49,524
trying to buy some of that third-generation
homegrown he's got.

869
01:22:49,593 --> 01:22:52,494
- You seen him?
- No.

870
01:22:52,563 --> 01:22:56,397
I get a hundred bucks a lid
for that stuff in Tulsa, man.

871
01:22:56,467 --> 01:23:00,301
- Hey, I gotta make a stop here.
- Make it.

872
01:23:00,371 --> 01:23:03,898
Actually, I'd kinda like it
if you went in there with me.

873
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,876
A couple of deliveries got switched
and I got to go explain to these guys.

874
01:23:07,945 --> 01:23:12,609
And I think it would be smart
if I didn't go in there by myself.

875
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:17,279
- I don't care.
- Be nice if you looked a little meaner!

876
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:23,385
I think it's gonna work out OK.
If there's any hassle, we'll just split.

877
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,485
You must have burned
these guys pretty bad?

878
01:23:25,562 --> 01:23:30,932
Burned them? Who do you think
you're talking to, man? A nice guy like me?

879
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:35,529
It's just a mix-up, like when a computer
sends you a bill by mistake.

880
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:37,301
I'll work it out.

881
01:23:37,374 --> 01:23:42,903
If there is any hassle, they'll be sorry.
I really feel like making somebody sorry.

882
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:45,448
Kid, I like your attitude.

883
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,509
Hey, man.

884
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:16,171
I was starting to wonder about you.
Who's your friend?

885
01:24:16,246 --> 01:24:19,841
He's a connection from out in Dixie, man.
He's cool.

886
01:24:21,485 --> 01:24:24,716
Tex, this is Kelly. Kelly, Tex.

887
01:24:24,788 --> 01:24:26,779
Tex.

888
01:24:28,525 --> 01:24:30,823
Would you excuse us?

889
01:24:30,894 --> 01:24:33,727
Why don't you just make yourself at home?

890
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:36,291
I'm really sorry about this mix-up.

891
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:42,772
Mix-up? Hey, man, don't come in here
talking about any mix-up. You owe us.

892
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,368
- Man, I thought we were pretty square.
- I don't know how you got that.

893
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:51,039
I don't think you're quite aware
how things are done around here.

894
01:24:51,115 --> 01:24:55,882
Now, you're not hanging out
in some schoolyard out in cowtown.

895
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:57,978
Now, those kids out there, man,

896
01:24:58,055 --> 01:25:00,819
you give them something gives them
a headache and they think they're high.

897
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:04,054
But this is Tulsa
and we got ways of doing things.

898
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,789
I know that.

899
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:10,357
You come into town and ten minutes later,
you're everybody's best friend.

900
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:14,962
And then ten minutes after that,
you're pulling a burn. I don't like it.

901
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,669
Kelly, I admire the sense of high drama
you have in your life, but you're crazy.

902
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:24,043
I didn't expect you to come without
a couple of ounces of clean crystal,

903
01:25:24,114 --> 01:25:26,605
and not some garbage about a mix-up.

904
01:25:26,683 --> 01:25:28,583
An honest mistake. Look...

905
01:25:28,652 --> 01:25:32,816
You come around here with some samples
and then you come back with the delivery.

906
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:37,554
And that delivery is crap.
Now, that is no mix-up, man. That's a burn.

907
01:25:37,628 --> 01:25:40,654
- What do you think we are? Stupid?
- Now you just wait one minute.

908
01:25:40,731 --> 01:25:44,599
- We have been waiting a week, man.
- Keep it down, man.

909
01:25:44,668 --> 01:25:47,933
Listen, I'm getting out of here.
This guy's nuts.

910
01:25:48,005 --> 01:25:51,839
- What do you think you're doing?
- I told you already. I'm leaving.

911
01:25:51,909 --> 01:25:54,139
Then he's gonna narc! He's gonna narc!

912
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:56,975
- He's not a narc, Kelly!
- You're not going nowhere, pal.

913
01:25:57,047 --> 01:26:01,211
<i>Hey, Kelly, it's cool.
Really. Come on, man.</i>

914
01:26:01,285 --> 01:26:03,150
Hold it right there.

915
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:08,381
Jesus Christ, man.

916
01:26:21,405 --> 01:26:26,468
<i>OK, look, man. It's cool, OK?
Everything's cool.</i>

917
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:30,912
We'll be cool, and you be cool.
Just leave, OK?

918
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,582
I'm gonna kill him.

919
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:37,848
Tex, you don't want to kill him.
Let's split, let's get outta here.

920
01:26:37,921 --> 01:26:41,914
- Not till I settle up with him.
- You have settled up, Tex.

921
01:26:41,992 --> 01:26:44,483
Texas, come on, man, let's go.

922
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:02,009
OK, we're leaving.

923
01:27:10,154 --> 01:27:13,487
You wanna stop us, you're both dead.

924
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,719
It's OK, it's cool. Everything's OK.

925
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:24,827
That's a nice bunch of friends
you hang out with.

926
01:27:24,902 --> 01:27:29,430
- Jesus, what if he hadn't missed you?
- But he didn't.

927
01:27:34,645 --> 01:27:37,136
Oh, my God, man!

928
01:27:55,832 --> 01:27:59,666
<i>Great, man! This is fantastic.
What am I gonna do?</i>

929
01:28:01,672 --> 01:28:04,368
What do you got to be mad about, Lem?

930
01:28:04,441 --> 01:28:07,410
Man, I got to get you to a hospital.

931
01:28:07,477 --> 01:28:10,708
They're gonna ask all kinds of questions,
call the cops.

932
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:20,590
What if they want to look in the car,
man? I got stuff in the trunk.

933
01:28:21,325 --> 01:28:25,455
- Get the hell outta here.
- Hey, what are you doing, Tex?

934
01:28:25,529 --> 01:28:27,520
Tex, what are you doing, man?

935
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,657
Get outta here!

936
01:29:08,105 --> 01:29:13,668
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Jamie. It's Tex.</i>

937
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:17,003
<i>Yes?</i>

938
01:29:21,151 --> 01:29:26,088
I can't remember my phone number.
Do you... I don't know my own number.

939
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:33,354
Do you... Do you know my number?

940
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:36,126
<i>Tex. are you drunk or something?</i>

941
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:41,835
No, I just got shot.
Listen, I gotta talk to Mace.

942
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:47,434
<i>- Did you say you got shot?
- Yeah, one of Lem's doper friends.</i>

943
01:29:47,511 --> 01:29:50,674
<i>Tex. is this
some kind of a joke or something?</i>

944
01:29:50,747 --> 01:29:54,581
No, sir. Listen, can I talk to Jamie?

945
01:29:55,852 --> 01:29:58,150
<i>Tex. where are you?</i>

946
01:30:02,559 --> 01:30:07,997
Um... I'm over at the shopping centre,
across the street from...

947
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:13,830
It's the hotel that looks like
the castle, you know?

948
01:30:15,405 --> 01:30:17,896
<i>Tex. hang up the phone.</i>

949
01:30:59,316 --> 01:31:01,307
Tex, come on, man.

950
01:31:02,753 --> 01:31:05,415
Come on, let's get you to a doctor, man.

951
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:09,115
Come on.

952
01:31:27,277 --> 01:31:29,745
Is Tex McCormick here?

953
01:31:42,793 --> 01:31:46,024
- How much blood has he had?
- 1500cc.

954
01:31:46,096 --> 01:31:48,530
We're taking the x-rays to surgery, doctor.

955
01:31:48,598 --> 01:31:51,829
- Surgery ready?
- Yeah, they just called.

956
01:31:53,303 --> 01:31:55,294
Hey, Mace.

957
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:01,033
I don't hate you, man.

958
01:32:03,914 --> 01:32:05,905
I don't hate you.

959
01:32:08,185 --> 01:32:09,516
I...

960
01:32:39,049 --> 01:32:42,018
We got some signs of life here, Mace.

961
01:32:42,085 --> 01:32:45,316
- Hey, I want a Coke.
- He's OK.

962
01:32:45,388 --> 01:32:49,222
- Don't move your arm.
You're gonna pull that thing loose.

963
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:51,726
- What is this?
- That's to help you grow more blood.

964
01:32:51,795 --> 01:32:54,559
Just lay it down and be still now. Relax.

965
01:32:57,901 --> 01:33:03,498
Hey, look, Tex. I'm gonna hold off
on that college stuff for a while.

966
01:33:04,341 --> 01:33:07,401
A year or two, maybe.

967
01:33:07,477 --> 01:33:09,911
Pop's got a lot of travelling to do,

968
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,417
and I can't exactly see leaving you
while you're still in high school.

969
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:17,180
So you're gonna be stuck with me
for a little while longer.

970
01:33:17,254 --> 01:33:22,317
Mace, how about giving me and Tex
a little time here, will you?

971
01:33:22,392 --> 01:33:24,383
Yeah, I'll get you that Coke.

972
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:31,562
- I want to tell you about your momma.
- Look, you don't have to, Pop.

973
01:33:31,635 --> 01:33:35,935
Be still. I figure the truth will be
better than what you might be thinking.

974
01:33:37,007 --> 01:33:42,502
Now, it's not just the bootlegging
business I got mixed up with.

975
01:33:42,579 --> 01:33:44,979
Clare never wanted
anything to do with that.

976
01:33:45,048 --> 01:33:49,178
She'd just say, "Sooner or later,
sure as hell, you're gonna get caught."

977
01:33:49,252 --> 01:33:51,812
She was right.

978
01:33:51,888 --> 01:33:54,789
They busted me
when Mace was just about two.

979
01:33:54,858 --> 01:33:58,089
So when you were in prison
she was out screwing around?

980
01:33:58,161 --> 01:34:01,096
Don't talk about your momma
that way, boy.

981
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:07,964
She was 19, she was alone. I was sitting
in prison with my back to the wall.

982
01:34:08,038 --> 01:34:10,734
That was real smart, wasn't it?

983
01:34:11,575 --> 01:34:15,170
Anyway, she told me
she was gonna have a kid.

984
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:19,773
And when I got out,
I wanted her back anyway.

985
01:34:19,849 --> 01:34:24,343
She never cared anything about that guy.
She was just trying to get even with me.

986
01:34:24,421 --> 01:34:26,480
She was sorry for it later.

987
01:34:26,556 --> 01:34:31,357
- Sorry for it, huh?
- I don't mean for having you.

988
01:34:32,295 --> 01:34:35,753
She always loved you
just like she did Mace.

989
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:40,129
You paid more attention to Mace than me.
Was that why?

990
01:34:41,871 --> 01:34:43,862
I reckon.

991
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:50,903
You look plum tuckered out there, Tex.
You get some rest, boy. Get some sleep.

992
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:53,745
Mason's gonna come by
and see you tomorrow.

993
01:34:54,284 --> 01:34:59,278
He ain't going nowhere now, so he'll have
a lot of time to come and see you.

994
01:35:00,423 --> 01:35:02,687
Behave yourself, boy.

995
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,056
This where they keep the bodies?

996
01:35:44,267 --> 01:35:46,258
Hey, Tex.

997
01:37:18,728 --> 01:37:21,196
- Hey, Mace.
- Sir.

998
01:37:21,264 --> 01:37:25,064
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. For what?

999
01:37:25,135 --> 01:37:29,902
- Indiana want you. Full scholarship.
- What are you talking about?

1000
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:33,634
You don't look very pleased.
They only gave you the red carpet.

1001
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:37,646
But I never even applied.
They didn't even send me an application.

1002
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:40,547
Well, you got in. I presume you are going?

1003
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:46,285
- Well, yeah.
- Congratulations. You deserved it.

1004
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:53,088
That guy I talked to in admissions
says you've got good taste in reading.

1005
01:37:53,229 --> 01:37:56,756
<i>Smokey The Cowhorse
is his favourite book, too.</i>

1006
01:38:28,498 --> 01:38:33,526
Hey, there, long, tall Mace.
What brings you out to the old spread?

1007
01:38:33,603 --> 01:38:37,095
Thought the country air
might clear my head.

1008
01:38:37,173 --> 01:38:41,200
I keep doing things
and then plumb forgetting about 'em.

1009
01:38:41,277 --> 01:38:43,745
Seems I wrote myself an application
a while back

1010
01:38:43,813 --> 01:38:48,147
to go to some fancy university-type
college back east in Indiana.

1011
01:38:48,218 --> 01:38:50,209
What did they say?

1012
01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:54,680
It seems I'm in!

1013
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,384
Great.

1014
01:38:58,461 --> 01:39:02,329
The only thing I can't figure out
is how I got through the essay part.

1015
01:39:02,398 --> 01:39:05,299
Well, like you said,
Jamie Collins, she ain't dumb.

1016
01:39:06,069 --> 01:39:08,867
You guys gonna
take the classes for me, too?

1017
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:15,577
I'm sorry, Mace. I guess I could
have screwed you up pretty good.

1018
01:39:15,645 --> 01:39:19,046
Yeah, well, you had reason
to be mad at me.

1019
01:39:19,682 --> 01:39:25,484
I don't know. I think I was mostly scared.
I mean, running off and everything.

1020
01:39:25,555 --> 01:39:29,548
I thought I'd stay around here
and go to JC a while.

1021
01:39:29,626 --> 01:39:32,186
Then it wouldn't matter
if Pop evaporated again.

1022
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:36,665
- He's not a bad person, Mace.
- Yeah, well, he ain't much of a father.

1023
01:39:36,733 --> 01:39:40,726
Well, you ain't, either,
and you've been trying longer.

1024
01:39:43,072 --> 01:39:48,374
No, you gotta go. If you stay,
you'll hate me in a couple of years.

1025
01:39:51,381 --> 01:39:53,849
Well, listen, I gotta get back to work.

1026
01:39:54,784 --> 01:39:56,775
Take care.

1027
01:39:58,688 --> 01:40:01,054
Hey!

1028
01:40:01,124 --> 01:40:02,887
Want to go fishing tomorrow?

1029
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:06,486
Nah. You'd better practise.
It's rough where you're going.

1030
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:09,826
Yeah, well, it's pretty rough
where you're staying.

1031
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,398
But I'll make it.
