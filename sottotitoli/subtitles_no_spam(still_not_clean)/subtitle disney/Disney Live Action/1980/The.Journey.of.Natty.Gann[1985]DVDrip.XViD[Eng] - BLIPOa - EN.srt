1
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,750
- Calm down!
- What do you mean, calm down?

2
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:21,358
Shut up!

3
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:33,475
It ain't fair--25 cents a day.
That's slave wages!

4
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:37,310
They said there'd be work!
They're lyin'to us again.

5
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,976
Get in there, Dad.

6
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,389
Hey, Sol!

7
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,726
What the hell's goin' on?

8
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,728
Sol, tell us what you know.

9
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,924
Well, we talked to 'em.
But they won't give an inch.

10
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,433
Fact is, they're talkin'
about layin' off more guys.

11
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,830
Hey, Louie!

12
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:04,238
Frankie!

13
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,282
Shut up!

14
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,788
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

15
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:22,519
- Let's see it.
- Hey! She got it!

16
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,584
I said I would.

17
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,274
Shh. Hold your ears.

18
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,443
- What?
- Don't listen.

19
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,452
Don't be dumb.
I've heard a man pee before.

20
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,545
- Yeah? Where?
- None of your business.

21
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,556
We want to work.

22
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:56,092
We need to work.
We have a right to work.

23
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,253
That's what I told 'em.

24
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:02,960
- Your dad sure is
givin' 'em hell up there.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,003
- My dad says he's a Red.
- Huh?

26
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,470
He says they ought to ship him back
to Russia 'cause he's a Commie.

27
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,473
- He is not.
- Well, my dad says he is.

28
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,702
- Well, your dad's as dumb as you are.
- Are you callin' my dad dumb?

29
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,768
- You callin' my dad a Commie?
- Yeah. You want to make
something out of it?

30
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,814
- Yeah!
- Well, come on. Try it!

31
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,782
Hey! Frankie!
Natty!

32
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,085
Stop it, you guys.
Quit fightin'!

33
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,288
Well, I think you'll live.

34
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,961
Dad?
What's a Commie?

35
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,866
Is that what the fight
was about?

36
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:42,337
Frankie's dad says you'll go
to Russia 'cause you're a Commie.

37
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,739
- Are you?
- Goin'to Russia?

38
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,743
You know what I mean.
Are you?

39
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,145
No. I'm no Red.

40
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:54,810
- I just fight for what I believe in.
- Me too.

41
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,514
- In the men's room?
- It's as good a place as any.

42
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,955
I don't think your mother
would have approved very much.

43
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,862
- Are you sorry you got stuck with me?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,866
- What?
- Sorriest damn day in my life.

45
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,664
- Yeah.
- That's it.

46
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:15,228
Keep that left up.

47
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:18,508
That a girl.

48
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,423
Natty.

49
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:37,222
Go to sleep.

50
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,860
- Collar.
- Right.

51
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,299
- Mornin', Sol.
- Mornin', Connie.

52
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,826
Got the want ads?
Thanks.

53
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,033
Hey, Sol. Did you hear
about this golfer?

54
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,042
- Just came on the radio?
- Mmm.

55
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,978
Lightning strikes his
metal shoes and kills him.

56
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:01,815
Shocking, huh?

57
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:10,251
- She's disgusting.
- No worse than some.

58
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,660
- Mornin', Sam.
- Yeah.

59
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:28,305
Same old story.

60
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,745
Somethin's bound
to break soon.

61
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,181
Got to.

62
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,515
- Right?
- Right.

63
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:39,818
See? Now, go on.
Get outta here.

64
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,451
- You stay outta trouble. Hear me?
- Okay.

65
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,165
Any more back home?

66
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,932
just her and me.

67
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:57,998
No ma.
That's tough, huh?

68
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,669
just the way it is.

69
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:15,222
Someone's comin'.

70
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:40,215
You, you, you and you.
Come here.

71
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:44,576
Oh,yeah. And you.

72
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:52,022
Blankets!

73
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,403
Lady, I'm not in the business
of givin'things away.

74
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:07,376
This is quality merchandise.
You can't get it anymore.

75
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,005
Fifteen cents is as low as I go.
That's rock bottom.

76
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,015
Well, ten cents is as far as I go.

77
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,551
- I'll give 15 cents for it, mister.
- Wait a minute, kid!

78
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,645
This is my pot, right?
Fifteen cents?

79
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:21,214
She was here first.
I'm sorry. Fifteen cents.

80
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,226
Here.

81
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,022
Nice move, kid.

82
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, no, Natty.

83
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:34,629
- Do I look like an animal shelter?
- Don't worry, I'll keep this one.

84
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,435
- That's what you said the last time.
- My dad'll let me.

85
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:40,443
just look at this mug.

86
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:44,845
- Yeah. But what is he
gonna be when he grows up?
- A dog.

87
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:48,544
You never know, kid. He might
grow up to be a lion or a tiger.

88
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:51,588
- Maybe one of them great big walruses.
- Walrus.

89
00:08:56,861 --> 00:09:00,058
- Something wrong?
- Yeah, you're payin' them guys
half what they're worth.

90
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:03,931
- I didn't hear them complain.
- 'Cause they're scared.

91
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,834
You're a troublemaker, Gann.

92
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,668
But I've got something for you.

93
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:17,947
Hey, wait.
This here says Washington state.

94
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,712
- That's clear across country!
- Steady work, Gann. A real break.

95
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:23,720
Bus leaves today, 6:00.

96
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:29,516
- I got a kid, now. What about my kid?
- That's not my problem, buddy.

97
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:34,553
I got one seat on a company bus.
Take it or leave it.

98
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:37,897
Well?

99
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:42,268
Hey, what are you, nuts? You walk
outta here, you don't work. Ever!

100
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,398
You in a position
to do that, Gann?

101
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,111
Apples, here.

102
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:27,116
Apple, lady?

103
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,818
- Hey, Louie!
- Yeah?

104
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,982
- You seen Natty?
- Not since morning.

105
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:36,959
- You know where she is?
- No idea.

106
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,155
- Seen Natty?
- No.
- No.

107
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:44,167
- Seen Natty?
- Uh-uh.

108
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:47,966
-Ah,Jimmy. Have you seen Natty?
- No.

109
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,007
Don't worry, Sol.
She'll turn up.

110
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:55,239
-She always does.
- Yeah, but I only got an hour left.

111
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:58,110
I don't know, Sherman.
I just don't know.

112
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:04,547
Sol, you got no choice.
It's a job.

113
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,557
Yeah.

114
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,558
It's not gonna be that hard,
Connie.

115
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,070
She's a good kid.
She practically takes care of herself.

116
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,038
All you got to do is just make
sure that she's eatin' right...

117
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:26,099
and that she's getting to sleep
at night--just look after her.

118
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:29,544
- Okay.
- Just watch out for her, okay?

119
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:33,709
After I get some money,
I'll send it to you first thing.

120
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,947
And all you gotta do is just buy her
a ticket and put her on the train.

121
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,512
It'll be extra for
takin' her to the station.

122
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,117
And if you're not payin' me in advance,
Sol, it's gonna be nine bucks,
not seven.

123
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:45,185
Okay, okay. Anything you say.
It's a deal, Connie.

124
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:49,722
- You'll do it.
- Sol, I said I'd do it.

125
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:54,871
I'll do it.

126
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,876
Thanks... Connie.

127
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:40,614
Okay, buddy. You comin'or not?

128
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,824
Hey!

129
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,899
Hey, kid, come here.

130
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:07,466
I got somethin' for you.
Sol give it to me before he left.

131
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:10,707
- Left?
- Yeah, left. Gone.

132
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:14,842
Arrivederci.
Left.

133
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:19,951
What was that?

134
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,958
Nothin'.

135
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,529
Dear Natty. I got a job...

136
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,122
at a lumber camp
in Washington state.

137
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,965
They're shippin'me out today.
I wanted to see you first.

138
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,971
But maybe that would
have been tougher.

139
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,303
You mind Connie.

140
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:41,208
I'll send for you
as soon as I can.

141
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,045
Love, Dad.
P.S. This was your mom's.

142
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,084
I think you should have it.

143
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:08,898
Anything for me?

144
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,335
No. Nothing.

145
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:32,445
" You're mean to me "

146
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:35,321
" Why must you be mean-- "

147
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:48,330
" You love to see me cryin' "

148
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,912
- Where the hell
do you think you're going?
- Out.

149
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,949
- Oh, at this hour.
- Just for a walk.

150
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,850
You stop right where
you are, young lady.

151
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,480
Upstairs, that's where you're goin',
Miss Smarty-pants.

152
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,354
Come on. Maybe he lets
you run wild, but not me.

153
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,394
Understand? It's different with me.
Go on, move it!

154
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:16,263
- You're not the boss of me.
- Bull crackers!
Now get upstairs. Move it.

155
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,358
What am I gonna do?

156
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,927
What if he never sends for her?
What if...

157
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,371
he just leaves her here
with me?

158
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,808
Oh... God.

159
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,558
You ever ride the rails,
Sherman?

160
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,357
- What you say, girl?
- You ever ride the rails?

161
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,864
Girl, what are you
thinkin' about?

162
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:51,230
Nothin'.

163
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,998
Good. Because it's hell
out there on them rails.

164
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:58,735
Fats Chessman got both of his legs
chopped off under the iron wheel.

165
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,267
Oklahoma Slim got
a big scar on his throat...

166
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:05,008
where someone tried
to cut him for his shoes.

167
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:08,950
You can get your guts spilled out there
if you don't know what you're doin'.

168
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:13,513
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

169
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,036
- What's goin'on?
- Another eviction.

170
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,041
Another family out on the street.

171
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:38,604
Frankie!

172
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,617
- Come on, come on!
- Get your hands off my dad!

173
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,416
Come on! Get outta here, kid.

174
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:49,619
Let go of my family!

175
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,605
-Yeah?
-Lady, are you responsible for this kid?

176
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:11,307
Because if you are, the judge'll want
to see you and the kid in the morning.

177
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,147
Natty. That is it.
I've had it.

178
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,382
I won't stand for another thing
from you, young lady. You hear me?

179
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:21,822
I'm drawing the line
right now!

180
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,918
And that thing better
be gone by morning.

181
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,896
Do you hear me?

182
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,729
You listen to me,
you little twerp!

183
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:33,599
just one more thing from you,
just one, and I guarantee...

184
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,036
you'll be sorry you ever
laid your eyes on me!

185
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,041
You understand me? I'll have you so
scared you're gonna pee in your pants.

186
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,441
You'll crawl on the floor,
begging me for mercy.

187
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,537
So don't push me!
You got it?

188
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,724
For crying out loud, I am not
the kid's goddamn mother!

189
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,989
Why the hell should
I get stuck, huh?

190
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,226
Hello? Look, I want
to report an abandoned kid.

191
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,798
Yeah, she's alone.

192
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,099
You better send somebody
right away.

193
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:45,164
It's the San Marco Hotel.

194
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:19,269
I'm coming!

195
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,277
Ah.

196
00:20:54,444 --> 00:21:00,212
You stay here.
I can't take you with me, understand?

197
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:04,145
You gotta stay with Sherman.

198
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,690
You'll be okay.

199
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:16,350
Oh!

200
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:20,590
You know, uh,
you can get hurt that way.

201
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:24,191
- I thought that one was a goner.
- Rail meat.

202
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:28,795
- Little bits of blood and busted--
- Leave the kid alone.

203
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:58,157
- Bar tree?
- Yeah, you get up on top.

204
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:01,671
Fire in the hole!

205
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:42,138
That was nice.

206
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:47,543
- Where'd the others go?
- I dunno.

207
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:50,950
- Where are you goin'?
- West.

208
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:53,148
Me too.
My dad's out west.

209
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,885
- Yeah?
- Yeah. In Washington state.

210
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,052
What part?

211
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:01,620
The middle... part.

212
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,394
You're runnin' away, huh?

213
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:07,561
What makes you say that?
I didn't say that.

214
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:09,867
You didn't have to.

215
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,972
You better wise up if you
expect to make it, kid.

216
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,775
Oh, I'll do all right,
Mr. Know-it-all.

217
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:32,120
- Don't let the bulls get you.
- The what?

218
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:35,756
- Railroad cops.
- Think I don't know that?

219
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:38,323
- Jump with the train,
and you'll be all right.
- Natch.

220
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,673
- Good luck, kid.
- Yeah.

221
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,275
Stop!

222
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,721
I'll get you, tramp!

223
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:28,543
Break his legs!

224
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,654
All right, pull your animal back!
Get him off!

225
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:16,055
Get back!
Keep 'em apart.

226
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:19,061
Let 'em go!
Pit to die!

227
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:32,237
Get him! Get him!

228
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,227
Stop that animal!
Don't let him get away.

229
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,533
Cut him off!

230
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:12,981
Stay put!

231
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:27,122
Let go, you son of a--

232
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:42,540
- You dumb kid!
- Agh!

233
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:21,268
Connie. Sol.

234
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,370
Connie, you gotta talk louder.
Where's Natty?

235
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,541
Is she there?
Can I talk to her?

236
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,017
Did she get my letter?

237
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,020
Connie, I can't hear you.
You have to talk louder.

238
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:34,522
I'm through waitin'on you!

239
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:40,718
Wha-- She-- She wouldn't
just run away like that.

240
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,357
What the hell happened
back there, Connie?

241
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,266
Well, they better find her!
They damn well better find her!

242
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:53,501
'Cause if they don't--
You just make sure they do.

243
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:56,704
I said you make sure they do!

244
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,737
Let's get outta here
before this thing blows!

245
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:11,382
jesus, let's go!

246
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,943
- Timber!
- Timber!

247
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:42,758
Ugh!

248
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,544
I ain't goin' out there.

249
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:12,137
I don't give a damn
what you do.

250
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:29,020
I'm comin'!

251
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,364
Slow down, will you?

252
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,370
Wait for me.

253
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,741
Oh, shit.

254
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,699
What is it?

255
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:26,240
Okay.

256
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:03,242
I bet you were scared out
in the woods all by yourself.

257
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,719
Yeah. I had a friend,
though, kind of.

258
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,722
- You said you was alone!
- Friend?

259
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,056
- It was only a wolf.
- Wolf? Wolf ain't nobody's friend.

260
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:14,891
- You must be seein' things.
- It's true.

261
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:17,159
- You're a liar, kid.
- I am not.

262
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:21,669
- Leave her be, Al.
- Wolf.

263
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:30,076
Hyah. Hyah.

264
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:35,105
Hey, go on. Go on!

265
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:39,153
- Oh!
- What's wrong?

266
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:41,382
- Take the mule!
- Is she okay?

267
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,893
Get the damn mule! Come on.

268
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:48,987
Stop!

269
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:52,295
You'll be fine.

270
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,766
Come on in.

271
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:02,834
Are you okay?

272
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:06,472
Come here.
It's moving.

273
00:42:06,548 --> 00:42:11,212
Feel it. Come on.
Don't be scared.

274
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,259
Is that it?

275
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,319
- Is that the baby?
- That's his foot.

276
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:25,333
Must hurt getting kicked like that.

277
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:28,837
No. It's the losin' that hurts,
not the bearin'.

278
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:31,839
We had another one.
She died.

279
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,745
My mama died
when I was a kid.

280
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,747
Can't hardly remember her.

281
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:43,050
There. That's her.

282
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:46,246
She was pretty, huh?

283
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:49,188
Yeah. Real pretty.

284
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,454
I look like my dad.

285
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,962
He's in Washington,
where I'm goin'.

286
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,828
Does he know you're comin'?

287
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,768
He was gonna send for me,
but I couldn't wait.

288
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,926
Run!

289
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:38,666
- Damn kid!
- Oww!

290
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:43,075
Go on! Run! Go!

291
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:52,420
Connie. Sol.
Now, listen hard, Connie.

292
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:55,423
I'm coming back there
to find her myself.

293
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:58,426
The boss give me
a week off.

294
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:00,428
W-What?

295
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:04,023
Connie! Will you tell me
what the hell's goin' on?

296
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,704
Where?

297
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,709
Yeah.

298
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,878
Yeah.

299
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,050
What's the matter, Gann?

300
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,557
They found my kid's wallet
buried under a train in Colorado.

301
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,559
Oh, no.

302
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,898
What the hell was she doin'
in Colorado?

303
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,253
What's the matter?

304
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:36,490
Come on.

305
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:40,861
Come on.

306
00:46:08,523 --> 00:46:10,457
Excuse me, mister.

307
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:15,019
- I wonder if you could--
- Uh-uh. I'm sick of you kids
panhandlin'. Sick, ya hear me?

308
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:20,034
- But I just want a little--
- No! Now you beat it
before I call a cop. Git!

309
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:33,447
Uh, excuse me, miss,
but, uh, that was wrong.

310
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:35,449
That was all wrong.

311
00:46:35,517 --> 00:46:39,248
- What's wrong?
- Well, I mean your, uh, your line.

312
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:41,221
The way you hit on him.

313
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,781
- You know a better way?
- You'd be surprised.

314
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,555
- Not by you, ringworm.
- Hey!

315
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:49,222
You're askin'for it, kid.

316
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:54,898
That's a... nice dog.

317
00:46:57,005 --> 00:47:00,441
- He's a wolf.
- Oh,yeah?

318
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:02,943
He's a wolf.

319
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:06,447
Well, you know, there's a bounty
on wolves around here.

320
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:09,507
- That's too bad.
- What are you talkin' about?

321
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:11,609
Well, uh, they
shoot wolves, stupid.

322
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:15,179
- Don't call me stupid.
- Hey, hey. Take it easy.

323
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:18,420
Take it easy-- easy, easy.

324
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:22,623
Look, we're not the enemy. That's him.
I mean, maybe we can help you.

325
00:47:22,698 --> 00:47:24,859
Yeah.

326
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:29,199
There's a group of us. What we're
doing is, we're trampin' together.

327
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,501
You hungry?

328
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,438
Maybe.

329
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:36,443
Okay,you wanna get
some food?

330
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:39,537
Well, you can, uh,
bring your wolf and, uh,

331
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:41,514
get him some food too.

332
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,056
So, you're lookin' for
your old man, huh?

333
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:51,558
- He's waitin' for me.
- Yeah, sure.

334
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:53,560
And my name's
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

335
00:47:53,628 --> 00:47:56,563
I haven't seen my old man
in three years.

336
00:47:56,631 --> 00:48:00,294
Took off. Killed him seein' my old lady
make one potato go seven ways.

337
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:05,500
Hell, all my pa did was beat on me.
I was glad when he left.

338
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:11,274
You know, once your folks are gone,
they may think that they're comin'back,

339
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:15,305
but they figure it out pretty quickly
that they're better off where they are.

340
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:17,818
Well, so are we.

341
00:48:17,886 --> 00:48:20,821
You think that we need
them anymore?

342
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:23,824
No. We got each other.

343
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:26,053
We're our own family.

344
00:48:26,128 --> 00:48:29,586
- Oh, yeah.
-And, uh, everybody here...

345
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:32,064
carries their share.

346
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:34,329
- Am I right?
- Right.

347
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:36,337
Right.

348
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,374
Hey.

349
00:48:42,577 --> 00:48:44,511
You'll be all right.

350
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:06,467
That's him.

351
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:11,404
- That's one big bull.
- We oughta get a lot for him.

352
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:13,407
- You ready?
- I don't know.

353
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:16,410
- You don't know?
- I don't know. It's stealin'.

354
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:18,412
Now, you listen to me,
little girl.

355
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,415
The way I see it is,
the rich just keep gettin' richer.

356
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:24,418
If you're with us, you chip in just like
everybody else. If not, get lost.

357
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:26,420
-She's just yellow.
- Hell if I am.

358
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:28,422
Well, then shut up
and let's go.

359
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,424
- You three take the chute.
- The chute?

360
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:32,926
Yeah, the chute, dummy.

361
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:35,656
Leon, Davey,
you two get the far gate.

362
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,631
We're gonna get him
in the trailer and we're off.

363
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,294
- Real easy.
- Yeah, easy. A snatch.

364
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:45,305
You take Mr. Bulldog there
and you push from behind, okay?

365
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:49,537
- Where you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be in the truck.
I'm the driver, okay?

366
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,512
I mean, you don't mind,
do ya?

367
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:54,515
Okay, let's go.

368
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,517
Go, go, go, go.

369
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,892
Come on, wolf.

370
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,130
Go on.

371
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:19,901
- Where the hell's the chute?
- Up behind the truck, stupid!

372
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:24,674
Just remember, he's more scared
of you than you are of him.

373
00:50:24,746 --> 00:50:27,306
You wanna bet?
Go on!

374
00:50:27,382 --> 00:50:30,374
Move it, bull!

375
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:33,046
Shoo!

376
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:35,419
What are you lookin'at?

00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:08,848
Go on, bull! Go on!

381
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:32,045
Come on, wolf!

382
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,407
Where are you going?
Come on!

383
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:46,894
- You know how to drive this thing?
- Get off my back.

384
00:51:46,962 --> 00:51:50,398
- All right, get behind and push,
all of ya!
- Let's get goin'!

385
00:51:53,468 --> 00:51:56,904
Come on, baby.

00:51:56,972 --> 00:51:59,907
- Come on, Parker, move this thing!
- Come on, baby.

387
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:02,569
What the hell you think I'm
trying to do? Come on, baby.

388
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:04,578
Let's go!

389
00:52:04,646 --> 00:52:08,275
- Uh-oh. Come on, Parker!
- Get this thing goin'!

390
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,284
Come on, wolf!

391

Let's go!

392
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:14,955
Go!

393
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:19,991
Wait for us!

394
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,328
Wait!

395
00:52:34,976 --> 00:52:37,410
Full name. Speak up.

396
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:39,413
Natalie Sue Gann.

397
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:41,915
Natalie Sue Gann.
Where do you live?

398
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:44,918
- I-- I'm not--
- Vagrant. Where are your folks?

399
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:48,422
- I'm not sure,
but I'm looking for my dad--
- Orphan.

400
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,924
- I'm not an orphan.
- Put her in number one.

401
00:52:50,992 --> 00:52:53,085
- I'm no orphan!
-Sure, kid, sure.

402
00:52:54,195 --> 00:52:56,629
Go on, get in here.

403
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,767
Over here.

404
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:05,272
Okay, this is your bed.

405
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,776
No talkin' after 8:00,
and up at 5:00.

406
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:10,777
All right, lights out.

407
00:53:10,845 --> 00:53:12,779
No talkin'!

408
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:15,782
Quiet!

409
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,266
One. Two.

410
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,501
One. Two.

411
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:42,600
One. Two.

412
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,805
Hands on hips.
One. Two.

413
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,815
- That's where the boys sleep.
- One. Two.

414
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:52,819
- Billy Lang's a real dream.
- Okay, Twinkie, 15 laps. In silence.

415
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:56,254
And take your friend.
The rest of you, fall out.

416
00:53:56,324 --> 00:53:58,258
Sorry.

417
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:00,260
Go on. Get goin'.

418
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,605
- Let's get him over here.
- I got my side.

419
00:54:11,673 --> 00:54:13,607
Come on, boy.

420
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,311
Hey, hey!
Hold him! Hold him!

421
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,904
Let him go!

422
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:22,279
- Pull him over there!
- Let go of him!

423
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,377
- Don't hurt him!
- Hold him down!

424
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,388
Stop it!

425
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:33,055
He's all yours, Charlie.

426
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:35,062
- Get rid of him.
- No!

427
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,224
- I said keep movin', sister!
- No! No!

428
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,508
- You're hurting me.
- Shut up!

429
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,048
Get in there!

430
00:54:55,116 --> 00:54:58,051
Let me out of here now!

431
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:01,247
Somebody let me out!

432
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,382
We were going to send it on,

433
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,386
but the lady said to keep it,
so we just hung on to it.

434
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,745
They went over this with a
fine-toothed comb. Didn't find nothin'.

435
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:01,680
Maybe she wasn't even on your
goddamned train, all right?

436
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:03,683
Maybe somebody
stole her wallet!

437
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,686
Don't get mad at me!
It's not my fault!

438
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:17,723
- You okay?
- I'm gettin' out of here, Twinkie.

439
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:20,392
Me too, three years,
five months and 17 days.

440
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,867
- I can't wait that long.
- There's nothing else you can do.

441
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:15,186
You won't squeal,
will ya?

442
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:49,118
Here, put this on. It's mine.
Maybe they won't recognize you.

443
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,817
Thanks.

444
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:54,827
Go on.

445
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:47,167
What's goin'on in there?

446
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:23,503
Excuse me. Which way to
Charlie Rindfield's blacksmith's shop?

447
01:00:23,577 --> 01:00:27,673
- Oh, it's up at the other end of town.
Top of the hill.
- Thanks.

448
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:32,117
You're welcome.

449
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:04,349
- Where's the wolf?
- Huh?

450
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:08,047
- If you've done anything to him, I'll--
- You'll what?

451
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:14,658
- He's mine.
- Wolves ain't nobody's.
He belongs out there.

452
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:17,959
- You let him go?
- Well,

453
01:01:18,031 --> 01:01:20,898
I didn't need him.

454
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:25,003
Maybe I should have.

455
01:01:55,369 --> 01:01:58,429
They'll be lookin' for ya.

456
01:01:58,505 --> 01:02:00,905
I know.

457
01:02:00,974 --> 01:02:03,966
You could always
turn yourself in.

458
01:02:04,044 --> 01:02:06,638
I'm goin' to Seattle.

459
01:02:12,686 --> 01:02:15,348
I'll give you a ride
to Riverbend.

460
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,101
Ah. There's food in here
and money for a ticket.

461
01:02:29,169 --> 01:02:31,137
No, Charlie.

462
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:34,230
Don't tell me no,
Natty Gann.

463
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,342
Go on, get outta here!

464
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:49,955
Wolf. You take care
of her now,ya hear?

465
01:02:58,131 --> 01:03:00,065
Excuse me.

466
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:03,568
- How much to Seattle?
- Seattle?

467
01:03:03,637 --> 01:03:07,073
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah... Seattle.

468
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,802
Ten dollars
and 50 cents.

469
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:13,246
Hey!

470
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:16,976
- Oh, he's okay.
- Yeah, well, tell him
to get off my counter.

471
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,984
Okay.

472
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:28,860
Wait here.
I gotta check the schedule.

473
01:03:35,302 --> 01:03:38,794
Get me, uh,
Greely Industrial.

474
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:42,799
Yeah, it's Hector
at the station.

475
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:46,937
That girl you're lookin' for,
I got her.

476
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:52,649
Okay.

477
01:03:53,987 --> 01:03:58,549
You'll have to wait until, uh--
Hello, girl?

478
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:28,819
Hey, Gann. Any luck?

479
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:33,792
Yeah, she's standin' right here
next to me. You still got my job?

480
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,328
Yeah, I got your job.

481
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:40,360
Well, can I
get back to it?

482
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:42,561
Sure, go ahead.

483
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:04,423
- Want a lift?
- Thanks.

484
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:08,552
- Hop in. Put the animal in the back.
- We're gettin' in. Okay?

485
01:05:16,436 --> 01:05:20,998
Whew!
That sure is one fine-lookin' animal.
I could use a strong thing like that.

486
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:24,601
I got a big yard, ya know,
where I keep my trucks,
and I had one stolen last month.

487
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:28,079
Need a watch dog.
Would you be interested in sellin' him?

488
01:05:28,148 --> 01:05:30,776
- Selling him?
- Sure.

489
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:35,311
I'll give you cash money. I'll bet you
could use it wherever you're headed.

490
01:05:35,388 --> 01:05:38,516
- Yeah. But I can't sell him.
- Are you sure?

491
01:05:39,726 --> 01:05:42,286
Okay.

492
01:05:50,637 --> 01:05:53,902
You're a pretty thing,
you know that?

493
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:57,034
- Are you sure this is the right road?
- Yeah.

494
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:01,046
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry. I'm just bein' friendly.

495
01:06:01,114 --> 01:06:03,912
I like you. You're a good girl.
Oh, come on.

496
01:06:03,984 --> 01:06:06,782
- Let's have a little fun.
Come on over here.
- Get off of me! No!

497
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:08,286
- Come over here!
- Don't touch me!

498
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:10,414
- You're gonna like this!
- Get your hands off me!

499
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:12,856
- You'll see.
- Stop it!

500
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,428
Help!

501
01:06:23,937 --> 01:06:26,963
Come on!

502
01:06:28,008 --> 01:06:30,272
Come on!

503
01:06:47,427 --> 01:06:51,989
Coming down!
Oh, God, she split! Oh! Oh!

504
01:06:59,072 --> 01:07:01,734
- Oh, Lord!
- Get him outta there!

505
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:04,140
We're comin'!

506
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:07,408
- Ah,jeez.
- You'll be all right, O'Reilley.
You'll be all right.

507
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,008
Come on, gimme a hand! Get 'em down
here! Come on! Easy with him. Easy.

508
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,818
Atta boy.
Get' em down.

509
01:07:15,889 --> 01:07:19,484
All right, come on,
the rest of you, go back to work!

510
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,119
There's nothin'
you can do for him.

511
01:07:31,304 --> 01:07:34,000
- Too bad.
- Uh-huh.

512
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:38,141
- Guess you'll be needin'
a new topper now?
- Right.

513
01:07:38,211 --> 01:07:39,872
- Well?
- Well what?

514
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:43,109
- Well, how 'bout me?
- It's widow's work.

515
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:45,777
I ain't married.

516
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:50,221
- What are you trying to pull, Gann?
- Just gimme the damn job.

517
01:07:52,392 --> 01:07:55,020
Okay, wise guy.
It's yours.

518
01:07:57,464 --> 01:08:00,365
Hey, Gann!

519
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,368
It won't bring her back.

520
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:47,839
Yeah? I'm gonna
cut your nose off!

521
01:08:47,914 --> 01:08:50,815
Come on! Get it movin'!
Let's go!

522
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:12,501
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

523
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:15,040
That's mine.

524
01:09:19,212 --> 01:09:23,114
I know you.
You helped me... in Chicago.

525
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:25,651
Nice way of payin' me back.

526
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:38,623
I wouldn't try it. Steal their food,
and they're gonna eat you up.

527
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,064
Got a spoon?

528
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:52,206
Go on.

529
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:54,974
What do I have to
do for it?

530
01:09:56,082 --> 01:09:58,846
just eat the damn beans, kid.

531
01:10:18,138 --> 01:10:20,265
Uh-oh.

532
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,240
Where'd ya go?

533
01:10:22,308 --> 01:10:25,641
- Is that a friend of yours?
- We're travelin' together.

534
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:28,272
- It's hard enough without packin' a dog.
- He's a wolf.

535
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:30,475
That's even better.

536
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,041
- We can take care of ourselves.
- Yeah, I bet.

537
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:40,684
- That ain't dog food.
- Oh, yeah?

538
01:10:42,762 --> 01:10:45,287
Look, I go alone.
I don't take no partners.

539
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:47,299
- Especially not a girl.
- Well, nobody asked ya.

540
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:50,131
- Good, don't.
- I won't.

541
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:03,540
- Somethin' ain't right.
- What?

542
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:06,278
Something's wrong. He always knows.

543
01:11:14,727 --> 01:11:18,891
Let's beat it, kid!

544
01:11:30,176 --> 01:11:32,110
Who are those guys?

545
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:35,011
Main Streeters.
Good law-abidin' citizens.

546
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:38,312
They don't like the way we live.

547
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:40,318
- You comin'?
- But I thought--

548
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,980
Make up your mind, kid.

549
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:31,963
Comin' down!

550
01:13:04,938 --> 01:13:06,735
She's comin'.

551
01:13:12,879 --> 01:13:16,212
Ah, it's gonna be a good one, kid.
That's a through freight.

552
01:13:20,286 --> 01:13:22,516
It's the right train.

553
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:24,523
The right speed.

554
01:13:24,591 --> 01:13:28,186
Perfect.

555
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:34,433
What are ya doin'?

556
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,799
Hey, come on, kid, get set.

557
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,100
Come back!

558
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:42,869
Come back here!

559
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:47,606
Hey! Come on, now!
You can't wait for him. Let's go!

560
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:04,223
- We gotta wait for him!
- Forget it. That was
a she-wolf callin'. He's gone.

561
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:05,889
- He wouldn't do that!
- Get on!

562
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:09,093
- He's gonna come, I know it.
- Gimme your hand, damn it!

563
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:12,435
Swing.

564
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:28,512
There he is! Look!

565
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:32,852
Come on! Run!

566
01:14:32,925 --> 01:14:37,487
- Mm-mm.
- Faster!

567
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:40,657
- Come on! Come on!
- He ain't gonna make it.
He's never gonna make it.

568
01:14:45,038 --> 01:14:48,007
Come on!

569
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:50,042
- Jump!
- Never make it!

570
01:14:56,182 --> 01:14:59,618
- He won't make it.
- Jump!

571
01:15:03,089 --> 01:15:07,219
He made it.

572
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:52,861
- Hey, get outta there!
- What is it? Shh.

573
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:56,306
Come on.
Out, out, out.

574
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,674
Come on.

575
01:15:58,745 --> 01:16:01,077
Come on.

576
01:16:04,884 --> 01:16:07,011
Get down.

577
01:16:16,763 --> 01:16:20,290
Come here! Hey, Tom!

578
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:23,028
- What was that?
- Look in here.
I think I heard something.

579
01:16:33,312 --> 01:16:38,545
Ha! It's a damn dog.

580
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:41,212
Let's go.

581
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:50,961
- Are they gone?
- What?

582
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,396
Are they gone?

583
01:16:55,868 --> 01:16:58,462
Yeah.

584
01:16:58,538 --> 01:17:01,473
Come on, kid.
Quit slowin' me down.

585
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,475
Yeah.

586
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,476
I'm hungry.

587
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,008
- You got no business
bein' on the road, kid.
- As much as you've got.

588
01:17:14,086 --> 01:17:16,213
Sure.

589
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:28,766
Aw, they won't refuse a kid. Here.
Stick your thumb up, be cute, smile.

590
01:17:32,738 --> 01:17:37,107
- That was a swell idea.
- Thanks. Keep walkin'.

591
01:17:37,176 --> 01:17:39,167
- Ya know, it's snowin'.
- Really?

592
01:17:39,245 --> 01:17:41,372
Really.

593
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:49,751
- I'm cold.
- Buck up, kid, will ya?

594
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:53,189
I'm buckin'!
I'm buckin', right?

595
01:17:53,259 --> 01:17:55,193
Hey!

596
01:17:59,832 --> 01:18:04,292
I tell you, this is great.
We got the mountains, we got the lakes.

597
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:08,397
Lakes? This is nothin'. We've got a lake
five times this size in Chicago.

598
01:18:08,474 --> 01:18:13,537
And the weather, the wind is so strong,
my dad can lean like this
and not fall over.

599
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:16,309
- That's weather.
- In Chicago, really?

600
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:19,647
- Yeah.
- I passed through Chicago once.
I didn't see much.

601
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:23,712
- A lot of lights.
- You ain't seen Chicago,
you ain't seen nothin'.

602
01:18:23,789 --> 01:18:27,452
You're a real woman of the world, kid.

603
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,761
It looks safe. Come on.
Come on! It's empty!

604
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:42,007
Nothin' in here but a pig,
and he sure don't care.

605
01:18:57,323 --> 01:18:59,553
- Harry?
- Huh?

606
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:04,255
- You awake?
- No, kid, I'm talkin' in my sleep.

607
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:10,733
Harry,

608
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:14,398
what are you gonna do
when we get there, to Seattle?

609
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,208
I'm gonna look for work.

610
01:19:22,448 --> 01:19:25,042
Have you ever been there,
to the coast?

611
01:19:27,219 --> 01:19:29,153
Four years ago.

612
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:31,781
Frisco.
Me and my old man.

613
01:19:32,692 --> 01:19:35,058
Your dad?

614
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:41,156
We was outside this refinery
lookin' for work.

615
01:19:41,233 --> 01:19:43,394
Hundreds of us guys.

616
01:19:43,469 --> 01:19:46,870
And this foreman comes out with
Pinkerton cops on each side and he says,

617
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:51,342
"I need two guys for the bull gang
and I need two guys for the hole.''

618
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:55,176
He had four jobs.
Four lousy jobs.

619
01:19:56,882 --> 01:20:00,318
And everybody started
pushin' and shovin'.

620
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:03,184
And my old man,
he got knocked down.

621
01:20:03,255 --> 01:20:07,089
There was so many guys
I couldn't get to him.

622
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:10,128
He never got up.

623
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:14,024
I'm sorry, Harry.

624
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,500
Me too.

625
01:20:20,606 --> 01:20:25,168
- I'll check the barn. Maybe I left 'em in there.
- Come on!

626
01:20:42,495 --> 01:20:45,225
- What are we doin'?
- We gotta go up.

627
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:48,366
Stay close.

628
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,139
Keep comin'.

629
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,153
Be careful.

630
01:21:44,123 --> 01:21:48,958
All right, Natty.
Now walk down the arm very slowly!

631
01:21:49,028 --> 01:21:52,395
- The arm?
- Right. Come on. One step at a time.

632
01:21:52,465 --> 01:21:54,933
You can do it.

633
01:22:02,141 --> 01:22:06,043
Let go of that wire.
Eyes straight ahead.

634
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:08,637
Don't look down!

635
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:15,676
No, no, let go of that.
No, no, don't hold that wire!

636
01:22:15,755 --> 01:22:18,588
Aw, shit!

637
01:22:22,962 --> 01:22:25,522
- Come on.
- Come on!Jump!

638
01:22:25,598 --> 01:22:28,897
Come on. Go, now!

639
01:22:31,971 --> 01:22:34,633
All right!

640
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:13,444
All right!

641
01:23:17,316 --> 01:23:20,046
Yeah!

642
01:23:24,256 --> 01:23:27,783
You got yourself a job.

643
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,090
Good luck, kid.

644
01:23:30,162 --> 01:23:32,221
- Thank you.
- Next!

645
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,024
Name?

646
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:40,895
Harry.
Harry, look at this?

647
01:23:42,508 --> 01:23:45,500
- What're ya starin' at?
- Nothin'.

648
01:23:45,578 --> 01:23:49,014
- Then look at this.
It's a W.P.A. Project. A lumber camp.
- Listen.

649
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:51,515
I got us a ride over
to the mill and everything.

650
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:56,886
- The mill?
- Don't you get it?
My dad's probably up there.

651
01:23:56,956 --> 01:23:58,924
- So what?
- Hmm?

652
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:01,516
So what?
What if he is?

653
01:24:01,594 --> 01:24:04,427
- I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.
- He ran out on you, Natty.

654
01:24:04,496 --> 01:24:06,828
No!

655
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:10,130
No, he didn't.
You're wrong.

656
01:24:10,202 --> 01:24:12,670
Am I?

657
01:24:15,608 --> 01:24:18,441
Listen, Natty.
I got work.

658
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:23,106
- That's great.
- In California. I leave today.

659
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:28,486
I want you to come with.
You and me, we'll go together.

660
01:24:28,554 --> 01:24:32,354
We'll go in style. We'll take the bus.
What do ya think?

661
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:42,861
Well, it's no skin off of my back
either way. I just thought--

662
01:24:42,935 --> 01:24:47,395
I gotta find him first...
before I can do anything.

663
01:24:47,473 --> 01:24:50,533
I just can't go
with you now.

664
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:53,203
Understand?

665
01:24:56,248 --> 01:24:58,216
Yeah, sure.

666
01:25:19,071 --> 01:25:23,269
- I guess you better get on.
- Yeah.

667
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:26,800
- Don't want 'em to leave without you.
- Don't want that.

668
01:25:30,616 --> 01:25:34,575
- I guess it's really good-bye, huh?
- Yeah, I guess it is.

669
01:25:39,692 --> 01:25:43,219
Well, uh... bye.

670
01:25:44,296 --> 01:25:46,230
Bye.

671
01:25:49,702 --> 01:25:51,636
Here you go.

672
01:25:54,974 --> 01:25:58,535
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- Yeah.

673
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,635
Harry?

674
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:06,269
Are we taking off?
Shipping 'em out today.

675
01:27:06,345 --> 01:27:08,438
Hey, Charlie, wait up!

676
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:13,041
- Yeah, what do you want?
- I'm lookin' for someone. My dad.

677
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:16,645
- He's at the mill?
- I think so. Sol Gann.

678
01:27:21,393 --> 01:27:23,623
- G-A-N-N?
- Yeah.

679
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,292
- There's no Gann.
- He's gotta be here!

680
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:35,329
They move a lot of guys through here.
It's almost impossible to keep track.

681
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:39,002
Half the time we don't know who's here,
who's at base camp, who's anywhere.

682
01:27:39,078 --> 01:27:42,809
- Base camp? What's that?
- Forget it, kid. You can't go up there.

683
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:45,850
- But I gotta find him!
-Sorry, there's nothin'
I can do for you.

684
01:27:47,286 --> 01:27:49,948
What's that animal doing here?
Is he yours?

685
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:53,480
Get him outta here!
You too! Get!

686
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:00,759
All right, listen up, men!

687
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:04,132
- When we gettin' outta here?
- We're finished on the mountain, right?

688
01:28:04,203 --> 01:28:06,797
Can't keep the ladies
waitin' much longer.

689
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:08,806
They're sending
a few of us back up.

690
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:11,138
Ah, hell, they can't do that.
We've just come down.

691
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:14,236
What about Alaska?
When do we go?

692
01:28:14,313 --> 01:28:17,180
That's a good question.

693
01:28:17,249 --> 01:28:20,912
One more job, and then we're
outta here for good, men.

694
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:25,013
Now, I don't blame ya.
Now, it's gonna be tricky.

695
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:29,186
Double wages for the lead men.
Any volunteers?

696
01:28:37,736 --> 01:28:41,331
How come I always have to drive
this damn thing up the mountain?

697
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:11,933
Right in there. All the way in.
Easy, easy, now, easy.

698
01:29:12,004 --> 01:29:14,768
Nice and easy.
That's it.

699
01:29:27,953 --> 01:29:30,353
All right, take it up!

700
01:29:51,376 --> 01:29:53,606
You got everything?

701
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:17,835
- Do you know this man? It's my father.
- Nope.

702
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,702
- Do you know this man?
- Uh-uh.

703
01:30:28,814 --> 01:30:31,977
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm lookin'--

704
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:36,578
This country's for him,
not for a girl. You're goin'
back down first truck I line up.

705
01:30:41,627 --> 01:30:46,655
"Dear Harry.
I'm okay, I guess. So's the wolf.

706
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:55,370
"I haven't found him yet.

707
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,069
I miss you.''

708
01:31:08,153 --> 01:31:10,314
Love. No.

709
01:31:12,057 --> 01:31:15,493
Sincerely--
Oh, shit.

710
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,529
Natty.
just plain Natty.

711
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:34,871
Hey!

712
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:44,211
Wait! Stop!

713
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:15,980
Go on.
There's where you belong.

714
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:19,657
Go!

715
01:32:30,602 --> 01:32:33,332
Go.

716
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:13,640
Hey,you in there?

717
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:17,580
I think I might have found him. Don't
get your hopes up, but is this you?

718
01:33:17,649 --> 01:33:20,846
It was in
with the dead letters.

719
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:30,160
Dear Natty. Leavin'
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

720
01:33:30,228 --> 01:33:33,197
It tears at my guts
to think I've let you down.

721
01:33:33,265 --> 01:33:37,565
I hope you can forgive me.
I love you.

722
01:33:37,636 --> 01:33:41,163
Come right away.
Dad.

723
01:33:45,944 --> 01:33:50,540
- Where is he?
- With "D'' group,
if they're still up there?

724
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:53,379
- Where?
- At the top. Got you a ride up.

725
01:34:17,309 --> 01:34:21,109
Hey, mister. Can't this thing
go any faster? Come on!

726
01:34:35,894 --> 01:34:40,661
- Can you fix it?
- I don't know.
I think the axle's busted.

727
01:34:40,732 --> 01:34:43,166
Thanks anyway, mister.

728
01:35:03,522 --> 01:35:05,683
Oh, my God!

729
01:35:09,694 --> 01:35:13,425
Get 'em down! Get 'em down, now!
Come on, move!

730
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:26,671
- Got him.
- All right, get 'em down!
Let's get 'em down!

731
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:53,394
Dad! Dad!

732
01:35:56,408 --> 01:35:58,876
Slow up!

733
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:06,244
Dad!

734
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:40,850
No!

735
01:36:43,855 --> 01:36:45,789
No!

736
01:36:51,196 --> 01:36:53,130
Natty?
