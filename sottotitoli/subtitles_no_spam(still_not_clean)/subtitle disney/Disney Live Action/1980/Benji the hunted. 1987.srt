1
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:45,147
So many yesterdays

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,159
Haunting my soul today

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,096
Now time is standing still

4
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:05,605
In the tears and rain

5
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:11,845
I'll find another spring

6
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:18,686
No doubt the birds will sing

7
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:24,959
But I will never shine

8
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:30,025
So very bright again

9
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:34,338
Okay, stand by.
Tell Mary Beth we're coming up.

10
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:37,104
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds, Mary Beth.

11
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,407
Jack, I need a minute.
Take a commercial.

12
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,572
Can't. We're at six seconds.
Count it.

13
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,640
Four, three, two, cue her.

14
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,088
Less than 24 hours ago, I reported
to you from the shooting location...

15
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,853
of a new movie being
filmed here in Oregon.

16
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:56,487
It was a happy report because
it featured one of America's...

17
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:00,659
most huggable heroes,
the cuddly canine superstar, Benji.

18
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,601
Tonight Benji is missing at sea.

19
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,834
He was with his trainer, Frank Inn,
in a small, open fishing boat...

20
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,605
just off the coast
when the boat capsized.

21
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:14,306
Mr. Inn was rescued.
He was taken here...

22
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,315
to the Coast Guard station in Newport...

23
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:19,045
where he apparently
is in good condition.

24
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,212
But Benji is still missing.

25
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,820
Mr. Inn, I know this is
a terrible time for you.

26
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:30,659
- But can you tell us what happened
- I don"t know.

27
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,167
It happened so fast.
One moment it was sunny and calm...

28
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,396
and the next was...

29
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,066
At what point did
you lose sight of Benji?

30
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:45,578
I never saw Benji
after the boat turned over.

31
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,579
We searched for him for a while.

32
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:50,207
I wanted to stay longer,
but the captain said...

33
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:53,514
that I had to get in
for medical attention.

34
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:57,546
Benji likes to bark at the fish
when I catch 'em.

35
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,390
They flop around the boat,
you know, and he barks.

36
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:05,557
We had this big snapper.
He'd never seen a fish that big before.

37
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:09,261
It was his first time
on the ocean.

38
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:12,737
Is there any chance that Benji
could make it to shore on his own?

39
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:17,004
It was so rough.
All of a sudden, it was so rough!

40
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,104
He's a good swimmer,
but it was so rough.

41
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:25,982
Thank you, Mr. Inn.
We'll all be hoping for the best.

42
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:30,184
Benji's producer told us
a few moments ago...

43
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:33,886
that he has definitely not given up hope
that the floppy-eared star...

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,258
might have made it back
to shore on his own.

45
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,627
He plans to begin a helicopter search...

46
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:42,099
first thing in the morning,
weather permitting.

47
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,932
In 1906,Joseph Conrad wrote...

48
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:48,133
"The sea has no generosity.

49
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,804
"For all the celebrations it has been
the object of in prose and song...

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,145
the sea has never
been friendly to man."

51
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,880
Nor, it seems tonight,
to man's best friend.

52
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,481
This is Mary Beth McLaulin
for Channel Eight News.

53
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,834
Hey! Get outta here!

54
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,326
Hold it, pal.

55
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,128
Thought so. You know, they got
a reward out for you.

56
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,613
It won't be long now.

57
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,308
Now you stay put.

58
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,364
Hey!

59
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:02,833
Sure don't wanna turn
you loose in the house.

60
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,811
You wanna show me
how you did this?

61
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,746
Now you stay put
till I get this mess sorted out.

62
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,619
You better be still, or that
whole thing's gonna collapse with you.

63
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,635
Hey!

64
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:16,239
Benji!

65
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,877
Benji!

66
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:27,019
Benji, Benji!
