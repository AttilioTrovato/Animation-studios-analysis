1
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:20,747

2
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:31,774
<i>Long, long ago,
in a faraway land across the sea,</i>

3
00:53:31,982 --> 00:53:34,621
<i>there lived a little boy
who considered himself</i>

4
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:38,458
<i>quite an authority on brave,
fearless knights.</i>

5
00:53:38,623 --> 00:53:42,742
<i>And their mortal enemies,
those horrible fire-breathing dragons</i>

6
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:45,702
<i>that daily terrorize the countryside.</i>

7
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:51,337
<i>One afternoon as the boy sat
deeply engrossed in his favourite su...</i>

8
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:01,744
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Oh, son, I seen it.

9
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:05,502
Up on the bounds it was,
all covered with scales and such.

10
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:07,624
And a tail with a sort of a hook on it.

11
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:09,460
Now wait until I catch my breath.

12
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:12,461
It's horrible. That's what it is, horrible.

13
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,426
It's only a dragon, Father.

14
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:17,781
Only a dragon?!

15
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:19,986
Oh, the village!

16
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:24,302
Help! There's a dragon coming! Help!

17
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,429
Don't worry, Father.
I'll have a look at him.

18
00:55:13,078 --> 00:55:14,113
Hello, Dragon.

19
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,475
Oh, now, boy. Don't you throw stones
at me or squirt water or anything

20
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:19,953
I won't have it.

21
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,116
Oh, I just came for a friendly chat.
But if I'm not wanted...

22
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,715
Oh, well, do be seated.

23
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:31,118
- Well, thank you.
- But if you don't mind...

24
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,353
...the other way, please?

25
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:39,992
I'll only be a minute.

26
00:55:41,723 --> 00:55:43,839
Have you had any nice battles lately?

27
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:45,278
Battle?

28
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:48,561
Oh, no, no. No battles. No.

29
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:53,119
Oh, probably too busy
scourging our countryside

30
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:54,718
and devouring fair damsels, then.

31
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:59,922
Scourging, devouring?
Good heavens, no.

32
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,034
But don't you ever
do anything desperate?

33
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:06,001
Well, yes, I...

34
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:10,204
I do make up poetry.

35
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:11,960
Poetry?

36
00:56:12,128 --> 00:56:13,481
Verses, you know.

37
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:15,602
Care to hear my latest sonnet?

38
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:18,237
- Well, I...
- Oh, you'll love this.

39
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:21,560
I call it "Just A-Drifting."

40
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:26,283
<i>Just a-drifting o'er the leaves
Like a dewdrop, fancy-free</i>

41
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,126
<i>Playing with the gentle breezes
Romping with the bumblebeeses</i>

42
00:56:30,531 --> 00:56:34,127
<i>Oh, what fun,
Joy never ceases</i>

43
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:37,125
<i>Just a-drifting</i>

44
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:40,241
Very nice.
But you're in for trouble, you know.

45
00:56:40,413 --> 00:56:42,927
- Trouble?
- My father's arousing the village.

46
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:45,971
And they'll be here with spears
and things to exterminate you.

47
00:56:46,174 --> 00:56:48,130
You're an enemy of the human race.

48
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:51,172
Oh, I haven't an enemy in the world.

49
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,644
Too nice to make them.

50
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:57,127
<i>Prancing, dancing to and fro
Not too fast, not too slow</i>

51
00:56:57,295 --> 00:57:01,687
<i>Where the early birds are seeking
Early worms are slyly peeking</i>

52
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:08,047
<i>Hear the night owls softly squeaking
Just a-drifting</i>

53
00:57:15,938 --> 00:57:17,611
Hey, what's all the excitement?

54
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:20,175
It's Sir Giles, stupid.

55
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,534
Sir Giles?

56
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,378
Hooray for Sir Giles.

57
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,618
Hooray for Sir Giles.

58
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,853
Hooray for the dragon-killer.

59
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:37,092
Hooray for the dra...

60
00:57:37,262 --> 00:57:38,661
Dragon-killer.

61
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,096
Oh, gosh.

62
00:57:58,465 --> 00:58:00,104
It's all out, Dragon.

63
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:01,301
He's coming.

64
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:03,263
- He's here now.
- Now, boy.

65
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,417
It's impolite to interrupt a person.

66
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:13,016
- Who's coming?
- Sir Giles.

67
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:15,827
On a big horse
with a long sword and spear.

68
00:58:16,108 --> 00:58:18,384
You'll have to fight him.

69
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:21,786
Oh, I never fight. I never did.

70
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,706
- Doesn't agree with me.
- But... But... But...

71
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,338
Now, boy, now, boy. Just run along.

72
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,024
Tell Sir Giles to go home.

73
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:32,182
I'm sure you can arrange it.

74
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:33,943
Toodle-loo.

75
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:42,905
All right, now. All right, off you go.

76
00:58:43,073 --> 00:58:44,870
Sir Giles can't be disturbed.

77
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,751
Sure, he's in conference, he is.

78
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:50,907
There ain't no one, absolutely no one,
can see Sir Giles.

79
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:54,471
Now off you go. Off you go.
Away with you.

80
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:15,508
Excuse me, sir. I've come to...

81
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,270
Sir Giles, I presume?

82
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:25,750
Come, come, come, lad.
Stop mumbling.

83
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,153
- I came to talk about the Dragon.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

84
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,757
Another tale of woe and misery,
I suppose.

85
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:35,754
Devoured your flocks, no doubt.

86
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:38,154
Oh, no, sir. He...

87
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:40,353
Made off with your loving parents,
has he?

88
00:59:40,522 --> 00:59:43,879
Well, they shall be avenged.

89
00:59:46,403 --> 00:59:48,553
- You don't understand.
- What?

90
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:52,763
Don't tell me
he's kidnapped some fair damsel.

91
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:59,034
With flaxen hair and ruby lips
and form divine.

92
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,036
Why, he can't do that to her.

93
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:05,004
He shall pay dearly
on the field of battle.

94
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,282
But that's just it. He won't fight.

95
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:08,846
Yes, he...

96
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:11,396
He won't fight?

97
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:16,517
Preposterous.
The fellow must be an infernal cad.

98
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:18,440
Bit of a rotter, what?

99
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:22,597
He is not. He's a nice old dragon
who likes to write poetry.

100
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:24,248
Poetry?

101
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:25,637
Yes, you know, verses?

102
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,524
How jolly.

103
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm a bit of a bard myself, you know.

104
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,605
- You a poet too?
- Yes.

105
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:38,047
No doubt you heard
of my "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"?

106
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:40,607
<i>- Well, I...
- Oh, fleecy cloud</i>

107
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,650
<i>O cloud of fleece</i>

108
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:46,368
<i>Up in the sky so high</i>

109
01:00:47,453 --> 01:00:48,488
Oh, my.

110
01:00:49,053 --> 01:00:50,327
Oh, my.

111
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,691
But come, come. Let's not dilly-dally.

112
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:56,414
We must meet this fine fellow at once.

113
01:00:56,574 --> 01:00:59,169
Then you'll explain to the Dragon
about the fight?

114
01:00:59,335 --> 01:01:00,529
Yes, quite right. Quite right.

115
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:02,615
Of course, of course, of course.
Quite, quite, quite.

116
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:07,654
<i>I'm the reluctant dragon</i>

117
01:01:07,856 --> 01:01:09,654
<i>What ho!
Quite so</i>

118
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:11,296
<i>The very reluctant dragon</i>

119
01:01:11,457 --> 01:01:13,607
<i>Oh, very, very
Don't you know</i>

120
01:01:13,777 --> 01:01:15,814
<i>They call me the timid dragon</i>

121
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:17,536
<i>What rot!
I'm not!</i>

122
01:01:17,698 --> 01:01:19,734
<i>I just won't fight
I'd rather play</i>

123
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:22,493
<i>- I know I shan't get hurt that way
- Hello, Dragon.</i>

124
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:25,896
Oh, hello, boy.
I'm having a picnic.

125
01:01:26,299 --> 01:01:29,019
- I brought a friend to explain about...
- Oh, well, well, splendid.

126
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,332
The more, the merrier. Now, boy,
you sit here and your friend can sit there.

127
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:34,854
- Thank you.
- Now, let's see now.

128
01:01:35,021 --> 01:01:38,252
Pickles, jam, muffins, tea. Oh, yes.

129
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:42,540
Here, do have a jam sandwich, sir...?

130
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:44,897
Sir...?

131
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,533
What did you say
your friend's name was?

132
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,375
Oh, that's Sir Giles.

133
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,739
Sir Giles. Well, well.

134
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:55,055
Yes, you know, the dragon-killer.

135
01:02:03,665 --> 01:02:06,305
Sir Giles,
you better tell the Dragon, quick.

136
01:02:06,466 --> 01:02:08,457
Oh, yes, of course.

137
01:02:08,626 --> 01:02:10,777
Hey, you know,

138
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:14,021
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

139
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:19,662
The boy here tells me
you're quite an accomplished poet.

140
01:02:20,628 --> 01:02:23,746
- Oh, he did, really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

141
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:29,820
And if it's not too much bother,
I'd be pleased to hear you recite.

142
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:34,347
Oh, my dear, dear fellow, no bother.
No bother at all.

143
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:37,380
Would you care for a sandwich?

144
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:40,182
Thank you. Jam.

145
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:41,751
Here. Do have another sandwich

146
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:45,143
and a piece of cake and a crumpet
and a lolly and a spot of tea.

147
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:49,146
Thank you.

148
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:54,784
This... This is called
"To An Upside-down Cake".

149
01:02:56,834 --> 01:02:58,552
<i>Sweet little upside-down cake</i>

150
01:02:58,754 --> 01:03:01,667
<i>Cares and woes, you've got them.</i>

151
01:03:01,835 --> 01:03:05,067
<i>Poor little upside-down cake</i>

152
01:03:05,236 --> 01:03:07,386
<i>Your top is on your bottom.</i>

153
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:10,151
<i>Alas, little upside-down cake</i>

154
01:03:10,316 --> 01:03:12,626
<i>Your troubles never stop</i>

155
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:16,632
<i>Because, little upside-down cake</i>

156
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:24,477
<i>Your bottom's on your top</i>

157
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,157
Bravo. Quite interesting. Extraordinary.

158
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,153
Now, Sir Giles. Tell the Dragon now.

159
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,878
Oh, yes, of course.

160
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,831
You know, I am a bit of a bard myself.

161
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:40,596
Really? Oh, how nice.

162
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:42,992
Yes, yes, yes. Quite, quite.

163
01:03:43,522 --> 01:03:45,592
<i>Radish so red</i>

164
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:48,596
<i>Radish so red</i>

165
01:03:48,803 --> 01:03:50,759
<i>Plucked from the heart</i>

166
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:53,391
<i>Of your warm little bed</i>

167
01:03:53,803 --> 01:03:55,522
<i>Sprinkled with salt</i>

168
01:03:55,684 --> 01:03:58,596
<i>On the top of your head</i>

169
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:04,600
<i>Delicious</i>

170
01:04:04,765 --> 01:04:08,759
Oh, that's exquisite. Simply exquisite.

171
01:04:08,926 --> 01:04:10,882
Yes, of course. You're quite right.

172
01:04:11,086 --> 01:04:13,317
Do you mind if I recite a poem?

173
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:16,604
You, boy? Why... Oh, not at all.

174
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:20,283
Oh, of course, of course.
Rather, rather.

175
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,286
<i>'Tis evening</i>

176
01:04:22,488 --> 01:04:23,887
<i>From the stars above</i>

177
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:27,162
<i>A soft mysterious light</i>

178
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:29,638
<i>Brings thoughts of friendship</i>

179
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,926
<i>Joy and love</i>

180
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,728
Now how about that fight?!

181
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,083
Splendid. Quite.

182
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,969
Fight? Fight?

183
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:41,919
There's nothing to fight about.
Besides, I don't believe in it.

184
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,164
But dragons and knights always fight.

185
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:47,165
- That's right, by Jove.
- You can't disappoint the whole village.

186
01:04:47,332 --> 01:04:50,484
- Not cricket, you know.
- Please, I...

187
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,725
I do not wish to discuss it further.

188
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:56,084
I refuse to listen.

189
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:59,531
I absolutely will not fight.

190
01:04:59,894 --> 01:05:01,886
Good night.

191
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:08,894
Well, you know, it's a shame.

192
01:05:09,056 --> 01:05:10,614
It doesn't seem right.

193
01:05:11,136 --> 01:05:13,013
This is really a beautiful spot.

194
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:16,852
- For a fight.
- Yes, quite right.

195
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:19,851
Why, I can almost see it.
The flags are waving.

196
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:21,497
The people are cheering.

197
01:05:21,658 --> 01:05:23,933
- Bands are playing.
- The Dragon appears.

198
01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:26,613
What a beautiful sight,

199
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:28,815
with his scales all agleam

200
01:05:28,979 --> 01:05:31,368
in the dawn's early light.

201
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,937
You're just flattering me.

202
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,375
Oh, no, fellow. It's true.

203
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,977
That beautiful damsel
throws flowers at you.

204
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:42,092
- At me?
- At you.

205
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:45,180
As I ramp and I roar, I cut quite a figure.

206
01:05:45,382 --> 01:05:48,374
Sir Giles has a spear just like this,
only bigger.

207
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:51,262
I get set for the charge and...

208
01:05:51,423 --> 01:05:52,822
Did you say spear?

209
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:54,382
Yes, spear.

210
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,177
Oh, dear.

211
01:05:57,384 --> 01:06:00,057
No. I'll get hurt. I won't do it. Good day.

212
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:02,580
Just a second, old chap.

213
01:06:02,745 --> 01:06:04,736
We might fix it this way.

214
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:11,381
You mean:

215
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,417
Quite so.

216
01:06:18,787 --> 01:06:20,619
But are you sure it's quite honest?

217
01:06:20,788 --> 01:06:22,301
Just a second, we'll look.

218
01:06:24,628 --> 01:06:26,779
Nothing against it here in the book.

219
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,827
No, nothing against it here in the book.

220
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,668
If it looks like a battle,
I'm sure it's all right.

221
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:35,788
Very well, then, it's settled.
Tomorrow, we fight.

222
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,225
- Good night.
- Good night.

223
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,709
- Good night.
- Good night.

224
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,748
- Good night.
- Good night.

225
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:44,267
<i>There's going to be a fight
There's going to be a fight</i>

226
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:45,860
A fight.

227
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:51,863
Boy. Sir Giles. Wait a minute.
Oh, wait, please.

228
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:56,267
Oh, why don't
I keep my big mouth shut?

229
01:06:57,914 --> 01:07:02,271
<i>So the next day, the villagers gathered
to see the valiant knight</i>

230
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:08,266
<i>engage the bloodthirsty Dragon
in a battle to the finish.</i>

231
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:11,868
- So I am getting 20-to-1 on Sir Giles.
- That's twopence on the Dragon.

232
01:07:12,076 --> 01:07:13,987
All right, on the Dragon.
Twopence on the Dragon.

233
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:15,795
You're a smart one.

234
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:20,314
Balloons. Only a bit for a balloon.
They're amusing, inexpensive.

235
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:23,595
A nice side seat and a nice side spot.

236
01:07:23,758 --> 01:07:26,192
Here now, mind your step, lady.
Mind your step.

237
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:28,919
Look, the Dragon ain't got a chance.

238
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,070
Aye, he'll do the Dragon in.

239
01:07:40,881 --> 01:07:45,318
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!</i>

240
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,519
It's no use.

241
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:15,563
You might as well
tell the people to go away.

242
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,365
I can't do it.

243
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:21,361
- Oh, but try again.
- You've got to be mad to breathe fire.

244
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:23,564
But I'm not mad at anybody.

245
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:27,126
But try real hard. Concentrate.

246
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,409
Not very good, is it?

247
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:47,647
Nope. Too bad you're not a real dragon
instead of a punk poet.

248
01:08:48,372 --> 01:08:50,363
Punk poet?!

249
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:52,161
Oh, say that again.

250
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:54,045
- Punk poet.
- Again.

251
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,362
- Punk poet!
- Again.

252
01:08:55,573 --> 01:08:56,892
Punk poet!

253
01:08:57,053 --> 01:09:00,683
- Oh, I'm mad, I'm mad!
- Punk poet! Punk poet! Punk poet!

254
01:09:00,854 --> 01:09:02,082
Punk poet!

255
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:03,573
Oh, again, again!

256
01:09:03,734 --> 01:09:05,565
Punk poet!

257
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:09,489
By Jove.

258
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,972
<i>Hooray for the Dragon!</i>

259
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:47,771
<i>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</i>

260
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:13,625
Dragon.

261
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:15,458
Dragon.

262
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:16,901
Extraordinary.

263
01:10:17,066 --> 01:10:18,624
Why, he's disappeared.

264
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:22,460
- Here I am.
- Oh, so you are.

265
01:10:22,627 --> 01:10:25,016
- Am I doing all right?
- I say, old boy.

266
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:28,857
Stop acting the silly ass, will you?

267
01:10:29,988 --> 01:10:31,581
Help! Oh, no!

268
01:10:32,309 --> 01:10:34,186
Oh, help!

269
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,948
- I say, you hack...!
- No, no stop it!

270
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,829
- Oh, no, stop! Stop it! Oh, no, you can't!
- That's it. Steady now.

271
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,630
- You can't do that!
- Raise the gate. Raise the gate. Hey.

272
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,463
No, no, no. No, fire.

273
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:50,469
It's horrible, ain't it?

274
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:53,506
- Oh, no!
- Help, please.

275
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,704
One lump or two? Help!

276
01:10:55,873 --> 01:10:56,908
Don't mind if I do.

277
01:10:57,073 --> 01:11:00,827
- Hey, you vulgar...!
- Help! Help!

278
01:11:00,993 --> 01:11:02,905
Now I'll chase you.

279
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:07,589
- Help! Oh, no, no, no.
- Hey!

280
01:11:07,754 --> 01:11:09,074
- Help!
- Steady now.

281
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:10,344
Hey, Sir Giles.

282
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,707
Egad.

283
01:11:16,716 --> 01:11:19,150
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!</i>

284
01:11:19,356 --> 01:11:22,588
<i>Hooray, Dragon! Hooray!</i>

285
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:25,755
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles!</i>

286
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:27,510
<i>Hooray, Dragon!</i>

287
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:29,794
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!</i>

288
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,914
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!</i>

289
01:11:32,078 --> 01:11:33,512
<i>Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!</i>

290
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:40,475
- Help!
- Take that!

291
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,791
- Horrible!
- Hey, cut it out! No, no, no.

292
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,397
- Help!
- Take that!

293
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:49,953
- Stop it. Oh, no.
- Stay the game.

294
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:51,840
The time has come, you know.

295
01:11:52,202 --> 01:11:55,194
- You mean I die now?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

296
01:11:55,362 --> 01:11:59,436
As per agreed,
we'll seal our pact, old thing.

297
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:01,442
Take that!

298
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:22,045
<i>- Hooray!
- Hooray for Sir Giles!</i>

299
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,637
<i>And so as per agreed,</i>

300
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:29,403
<i>Sir Giles completely reformed
this ferocious dragon,</i>

301
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:34,160
<i>whereupon the satisfied villagers
welcomed him into society.</i>

302
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,320
<i>Speech, speech, speech!</i>

303
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:39,687
I promise not to rant or roar

304
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:45,043
and scourge the countryside anymore.

305
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:52,325
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow.</i>

306
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,045
