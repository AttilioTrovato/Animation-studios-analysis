1
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,670
Melody Time

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,670
Melody Time

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,390
Melody Time

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,190
It's time to swing along

5
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,350
To a happy land of sound

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,870
Where love is the thing

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,910
Melody Time

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,830
It's time for sweet romance

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,870
Won't you give your heart a chance

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,310
To join in and sing?

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,070
Take a tip from the birds
You don't need words

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
For music has charm

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,710
It's the language of love

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,590
When your love's in your arms

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,310
Rhythm and rhyme

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,950
Sure help a heart along

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,830
So come on and sing a song

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,470
It's Melody Time

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,150
It's Melody Time

20
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,360
It's Melody Time,
time to hitch your wagon to a song,

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,270
as a song is the one and only thing

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,910
that will take you to the land
where music is king.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,070
So join in the fun.
There's something here for everyone.

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,190
You'll find rhythm, romance,
reason, rhyme,

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,550
something ridiculous.
Something sublime!

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,910
You can't go wrong if you swing along
Come to the jubilee

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,990
It's Melody Time

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,740
The memory of wintertime long ago,

29
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,870
of clear, crisp air
and new-fallen snow,

30
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,870
of frost on a windowpane,
of sleigh-bells heard from the lane.

31
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,710
In this wonderland,
romance is the theme,

32
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,150
for this is the story
of love's young dream.

33
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,660
Don't you kind of love December

34
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,980
When the merry snowbells chime?

35
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,220
We're together

36
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,100
Once upon a wintertime

37
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,260
Every single snowflake falling

38
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,420
Plays a jingle down your spine

39
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,980
Lovely weather

40
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,030
Once upon a wintertime

41
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,340
On the frozen pond,
folks are swaying

42
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,190
Sweetheart, who cares?

43
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,140
We'll have more fun sleighing

44
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,540
Behind two chestnut mares

45
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,420
When we say,
''Goodbye, December, ''

46
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,270
Merry bells no longer chime

47
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,790
We'll remember

48
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,340
Once upon a wintertime

49
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,550
Don't you kind of love December

50
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,830
When the merry snowbells chime?

51
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,350
We're together
Once upon a wintertime

52
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,900
Every single snowflake falling

53
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,740
Plays a jingle down your spine

54
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,030
Here we are together, lovely weather
Once upon a wintertime

55
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,070
Jingle bells, jingle all the way

56
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,830
On the frozen pond,
folks are swaying

57
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,220
Sweetheart, who cares?

58
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,190
We'll have more sleighing

59
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,740
Behind two chestnut mares

60
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,710
When we say, ''Goodbye, December, ''

61
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,460
Merry bells no longer chime

62
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,260
We'll remember
Once upon a wintertime

63
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,180
Remember December
Once upon a wintertime

64
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,230
On the frozen pond,
folks are swaying

65
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,540
Sweetheart, who cares?

66
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,780
We'll have more fun sleighing

67
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,660
Behind two chestnut mares

68
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,110
When we say, "Goodbye, December,"

69
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,900
Merry bells no longer chime

70
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,350
We'll remember

71
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,780
Once upon a wintertime

72
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,860
Freddy Martin,
an admirer of the classics,

73
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,820
inspired by Rimsky-Korsakov's
Flight of the Bumble Bee,

74
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,870
interprets this fantasy
in his unique style.

75
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,180
In a furious flight,
a confused character tries to escape

76
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,140
from the hectic harmony
of an instrumental nightmare.

77
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,990
In American folklore, mighty men have
left the symbols of their greatness.

78
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,350
There was Paul Bunyan's axe.

79
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,340
John Henry's hammer.

80
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,420
Davy Crockett's rifle.

81
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,100
Then, unexpectedly,
one comes upon a tinpot hat,

82
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,580
a bag of appleseed and a holy book.

83
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,870
These are the symbols
of one of the mightiest men of all,

84
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,900
John Chapman, a real-life pioneer.

85
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,660
However, reality has given way
to legend.

86
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,380
Today, we know him simply
as Johnny Appleseed.

87
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,500
This is his story, told by
an old settler who knew Johnny well.

88
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,860
Listen.

89
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,470
Every time I see an apple-blossom
sky, I think of Johnny Appleseed.

90
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,990
Them clouds up there
ain't really clouds at all, no, sir!

91
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,350
There wouldn't be no apple-blossom
sky if it weren't for...

92
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,540
But now, hold on here.
I'd better start at the beginning.

93
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,220
Johnny lived on a farm
near Pittsburgh.

94
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,940
The year was 1 806 or there around.

95
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,820
You'd say Johnny Appleseed
never would make a pioneer,

96
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,900
he was such a scrawny little fellow.

97
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,460
That didn't faze Johnny.

98
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,180
He had his apple trees, the
morning sun and the evening breeze.

99
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,220
The Lord is good to me

100
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,380
So I thank the Lord
For giving me the things I need

101
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,700
The sun and rain and apple seed

102
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,750
Yes, he's been good to me

103
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,740
I owe the Lord so much
For everything I see

104
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,140
If it weren't for him
There'd be no apples on this limb

105
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,740
He's been good to me

106
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,190
Here am I 'neath the blue sky
Doing as I please

107
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,940
Singing with my feathered friends

108
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,300
Humming with the bees

109
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,420
I wake up every day
As happy as can be

110
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,540
Because, with his care,
My apple trees will still be there

111
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,380
The Lord is good to me

112
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,420
Working, singing, carefree and gay,
that's how Johnny spent each day,

113
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,980
attending to his apple trees.

114
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,910
But, lately,Johnny would feel
a stir in the air.

115
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:26,180
The rumbling, rolling beat
of restless men with restless feet.

116
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,180
Get on a wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown

117
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,020
Get on a wagon rolling west
Or you'll be left alone

118
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,580
We've made a home before
We're starting now again

119
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,260
We ain't a feared of man or beast
We're strong and hardy men

120
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,630
So, get on a wagon rolling west
Seeking a land that's new

121
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,540
So, get on a wagon rolling west
There's plenty of room for you

122
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,220
Get on a wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown

123
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,900
Get on a wagon rolling west
Or you'll be left alone

124
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,950
The rivers may be wide
The mountains may be tall

125
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,580
But nothing stops the pioneer
We're trailblazers all

126
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,660
Get on a wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown,,,

127
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,580
Get on a wagon rolling west

128
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,900
Or you'll be left alone

129
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,790
Poor Johnny. He weren't no pioneer
and he knowed it.

130
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,830
It was all just pretend.

131
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,940
Those going west to build this nation
made picking apples look useless.

132
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,380
Well, that's when a miracle happened.

133
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,220
- What's holding you?...
- ..Says a voice.

134
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,750
Go on. Go on out west
if that's your choice.

135
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,060
Well, it was an angel,
Johnny's own private guardian angel.

136
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,030
He looks mighty queer to you and me,

137
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,180
but that's just the way
John figured he'd be.

138
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,820
Well, speak up, boy.
Don't stand there gawking.

139
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,660
- Unlock your jaw and get talking.
- Yes, sir!

140
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,260
Why don't I go west?

141
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,790
I ain't got the muscle
or the breadth of chest.

142
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:23,980
There it's the strong men who survive
and I'm the puniest fella alive.

143
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,580
Shame to you,Johnny!

144
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,580
You've got faith, courage
and a level head.

145
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:39,190
But shucks. You see, sir,
all I know is apple trees.

146
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,710
What's wrong with apples, if you
please? Ain't they the finest fruit?

147
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,910
Shoot, man! They take the cake!

148
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,300
Just think of all the things
that apples make.

149
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,740
There's apple pickles...

150
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,870
Tasty apple tarts, apple pastry,
apple dumplings

151
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,100
- Not to mention,,,
-Apple sass?

152
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,740
Apple fritters light as thistle

153
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,420
And for folks to wet their whistle
Tangy apple cider

154
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,100
- Stew, fry, boil, bake 'em
-Apple pie and apple cake 'em

155
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,460
You can cook them any way

156
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,620
Apple this, apple that
Recipes to fill your hat

157
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,670
I could carry on like this all day

158
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,300
So pack your stuff and get going
Get them apple trees growing

159
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,620
There's a lot of work out there
to do

160
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,020
There's a lot of work to do

161
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,990
Yes, sir! I mean, no, sir.

162
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,700
You see, sir, I ain't got none
of the things I'll need out there.

163
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,860
You ain't got...?

164
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,940
Boy, I'm ashamed of you! You've got
the stuff to see you through.

165
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,710
You've got the seeds you're needing,
and for good reading,

166
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,380
there ain't nothing finer
than your book

167
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,180
Here's a handy bonnet,
even got a handle on it.

168
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,340
Turn it upside down
and you can cook

169
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,630
So, come on, get going
Get them apple trees growing

170
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,180
There's a lot of work out there
to do

171
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,310
There's a lot of work to do!

172
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,020
Well, that's how it all began.

173
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,420
That's how Johnny, all alone,
set out to meet the great unknown.

174
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,980
It was a mighty big, fierce place
for a man to face.

175
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,700
A little man, and all alone,

176
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,990
without no knife, without no gun.

177
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,580
Though the forest is dark and wide,

178
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,260
with fearsome critters on every side,

179
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,900
Johnny just kept walking on.

180
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,060
He walked until he found
a spot of open ground

181
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,830
with fertile soil and warm breeze,
a likely place for apple trees.

182
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,060
The varmints couldn't know
if John was friend or foe.

183
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,790
Some took off in sudden flight.

184
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,020
And some got set to claw and bite.

185
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,740
If Johnny saw them, he paid no heed,
just got busy planting apple seed.

186
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,260
Varmints came from everywhere
to watch him digging there.

187
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:24,660
Didn't like what they were seeing,
didn't trust no human being.

188
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,460
That ornery human had to go.
But who was going to tell him so?

189
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:44,340
Not a soul could answer that till
there came a black and white cat.

190
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,940
He weren't too bright
but he didn't care.

191
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,700
He knowed he had a certain air
about him.

192
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,660
Well, sir, that done it.

193
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:08,620
The critters had never seen that,
the likes of a human liking that cat.

194
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,420
Why, this little man had busted
every precedent.

195
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,700
He was the very first to come
without no knife, without no gun.

196
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:28,190
And so it was, from that time on,
every varmint was a friend to John.

197
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,780
They surely was.

198
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,020
The Lord is good to me

199
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,260
And so I thank the Lord
For giving me the things I need

200
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,740
The sun and rain and apple seed
Yes, he is good to me

201
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,020
As time went by,
Johnny kept planting his apple trees

202
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,990
and making friends everywhere.

203
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,980
His best friends were the pioneers,
for he was planting more than trees.

204
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,380
He was planting
his own boundless faith and courage.

205
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,340
That gave folks new heart,
new hope in the job they had to do.

206
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,180
As more pioneers came
to push back the forest,

207
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,070
the kindly deeds
of Johnny Appleseed

208
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,420
spread throughout the land.

209
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,420
More than once, with a good jubilee,

210
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,390
folks would honour
Johnny Appleseed

211
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,580
and the fruit of the apple tree.

212
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,950
Come out to the right of the ring.
Inside arch.

213
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,180
Ain't gonna rain, got no thunder.

214
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,260
First and third, follow swing.
Come out of the ring.

215
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,260
I'll swing yours and you swing mine.
I'll swing my girl.

216
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,500
Go straight to a do-si-do
kicking out dough.

217
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,390
A little bit of roll, home we go.

218
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:16,460
If John was passing, he'd mosey over
and look in on the doings.

219
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,260
It tickled him how the fruit of
his labours brought folks together.

220
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,150
Now, duck for the apple.

221
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,820
Thank you, son. Apple core!

222
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,190
Bite that apple to the core.

223
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,540
Ready now.
Men left with the left hand.

224
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,270
Back to your partner

225
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:46,580
Whirl them right, whirl them wrong,
right then left. Apple core!

226
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,340
Look at the pretty girl's eye
once more.

227
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,870
Come and get it! The table's set!

228
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,230
It's all waiting to be ate.
Come and get it!

229
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,580
- Apple pickle.
- Mighty tasty.

230
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,740
- Apple butter.
- Apple pastry.

231
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,790
- Apple dumplings.
- Like some apple sass?

232
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,900
Johnny brought folks
a heap of happiness.

233
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,460
He wasn't looking for thanks.
Didn't have time for it.

234
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,020
He knowed a man can't rest

235
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,140
if he aims to plant the wilderness
in apple trees.

236
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:45,620
So for more than 40 years,John
walked and planted that old frontier.

237
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,220
40 years of walking and planting.

238
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,270
In that space of two score year,

239
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,740
this little man throwed his shadow
clear across the land,

240
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,260
across 1 00,000 miles square.

241
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:19,180
In that shadow everywhere,
he left his blessings three.

242
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,460
God and faith

243
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,780
And the apple tree

244
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,580
For sleeping,
you take the cake. Get up.

245
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,430
- We've a long trip to make.
- Why, Mr Angel, howdy do?

246
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,700
- I'm fine. And how be you?
- I'm fine. Just feeling...

247
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,540
Who's that, sleeping in the dusk?

248
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,780
- That's just your mortal husk.
- My husk?

249
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,950
You mean to say I'm...
I'm passed away?

250
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,980
I just can't go!
Got crops to harvest, seeds to sow.

251
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,870
Now, now, now, hold on, boy!

252
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,070
Down here on earth,
your work is through.

253
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,660
But yonder, well,
we need you,Johnny.

254
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,820
Yep, we sure do.

255
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,260
You think we have
most all we please, but we ain't.

256
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,100
We're kind of short on apple trees.

257
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,500
Well, I swan!

258
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,900
I didn't know. What are we waiting
for? Come on, let's go!

259
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,540
We're wasting time, let's get going
Get them apple trees growing

260
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,300
There's a lot of work up there to do

261
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,460
There's a lot of work to do!

262
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,460
Now you know why,
whenever I see that certain sky,

263
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,620
I think of little John.

264
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:09,780
If you recall, them clouds
ain't really clouds at all.

265
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,380
They're apple blossoms if you please

266
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,860
from John's heavenly orchard
of apple trees.

267
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,420
And some day
there'll be apples there

268
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,380
For everyone in the world to share

269
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,980
The Lord is good to me!

270
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,830
There's drama, excitement
and harmony for three

271
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,820
in this story of adventure
on the sea.

272
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,020
Featured in this epic
is a ship of proud design.

273
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,390
It's not this ocean liner,
we take a different line.

274
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,780
With a huff, a puff, a chug-chug-chug
and a perky little hoot,

275
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,860
we introduce our hero,
the tugboat, Little Toot.

276
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,940
Little Toot was just a tug
A happy harbour tug

277
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,550
He came from a line
of tugboats fine and brave

278
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,260
But it seems that Little Toot
Simply didn't give a hoot

279
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,220
Though he tried to be good
He never could behave

280
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,780
Heave-ho, my lad!
I'm a big toot just like my dad

281
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,460
Pull big boats with a yo-heave-ho
And away we go

282
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,460
Chug-a-chug-chug-chug

283
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:10,350
He made the ocean liners wait
While he made a figure 8

284
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,140
With the greatest of ease
He cut through the seas

285
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,780
He went too far one day
He slid in Big Toot's way

286
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,150
And it wasn't a joke
For it nearly broke Big Toot's pride

287
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,300
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

288
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,300
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

289
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,260
When there's work to be done
All you think of is fun

290
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,870
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

291
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,260
Little Toot had quite a scare

292
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,180
He decided then and there

293
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,060
That he'd try to be good
As good as he could be

294
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:25,300
So when his dad came puffing slow

295
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,110
With a mighty ship in tow

296
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,940
Little Toot went to help him
Take it out to sea

297
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,470
Heave-ho, my lad!
I'm a big toot just like my dad

298
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,940
Push big boats with a yo-heave-ho!
And away we go!

299
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,180
Chug-a-chug-chug-chug

300
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,980
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

301
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,990
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

302
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,180
When you get into trouble

303
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,980
You get into it double

304
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:53,780
Won't you ever grow up, Little Toot?

305
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,870
What a shame, what a shame

306
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,310
You've disgraced your father's name

307
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,500
Won't you ever grow up

308
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,470
Little Toot?

309
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,340
1 2 MILE LIMIT

310
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,470
Bad boy!

311
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,580
Shame!

312
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,260
Too bad!

313
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,100
He was drifting all around
When a storm came crashing down

314
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,820
In the billowing sea he tossed

315
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,780
He was filled with fear
He knew the rocks were near

316
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,540
With the waves in pursuit
Little Toot knew all was lost

317
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,700
Then he saw a rocket's flare
Bursting in the air

318
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,940
And he suddenly knew
That he must do or die

319
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,230
A ship was in distress
As he puffed an SOS

320
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,270
He raced to the rescue
Of the ship nearby

321
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,270
Try!

322
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,660
Do or die!

323
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,180
It seems you've grown up, Little Toot
Toot toot!

324
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,390
You're a brave
You're a brave Little Toot

325
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,580
Can't you hear that cheering crowd?
You have made your daddy proud

326
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,660
You are now a big toot, Little Toot

327
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,980
Yes, you're now
a great big toot, Little Toot!

328
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,400
There's poetry in trees.
Then one day a poet found it.

329
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,410
Then a music master
wove around it a melody.

330
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:44,360
An artist touched it, gave it form
in colours rich and warm.

331
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:50,890
Now we bring to you these three,
poem, picture, melody.

332
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,040
A simple tribute to a tree.

333
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:12,000
I think that I shall never see

334
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:19,610
A poem lovely as a tree

335
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:29,560
A tree whose hungry mouth
is pressed

336
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:37,920
Against the earth 's
sweet flowing breast

337
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:48,050
A tree that looks at God all day

338
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:59,520
And lifts her leafy arms to pray

339
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,370
A tree that may in summer wear

340
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:38,490
A nest of robins in her hair

341
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:46,640
Upon whose bosom snow has lain

342
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:55,640
Who intimately lives with rain

343
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,690
Poems are made

344
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,530
By fools like me

345
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:14,280
But only God

346
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:21,890
Can make a tree

347
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,710
With the intoxicating rhythm
of the samba,

348
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:49,110
we serve up a musical cocktail
with true Latin American flavour.

349
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,590
If three boisterous
birds of a feather

350
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,270
fall under the influence
of this tropical tempo,

351
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,110
don't blame them,
blame it on the rhythm of the samba.

352
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,030
If your spirits have hit a new low

353
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,510
And they long to hit a new high

354
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,070
One little musical cocktail

355
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,630
Will lift them to the sky

356
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,910
Mix a jigger of rhythm

357
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,390
With the strain of a few guitars

358
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,550
Add a dash of the samba

359
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,670
And a few melodious bars

360
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,230
And then,,,

361
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,750
And then,,,

362
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,230
You take a spark of bossa

363
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,750
One fandero

364
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,510
Take a wiggle

365
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,430
You've got the fascinating rhythm
of the samba

366
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,910
And if guitars are strumming
Birds are humming

367
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,870
Drums are drumming
Then blame it on the samba

368
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,110
It's the beat you cling to
The type of song you sing to

369
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,230
The kind of thing you swing to
With the beat in your feet

370
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,390
When you're bouncing
to the beat you're reeling

371
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,190
With the carioca feeling

372
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,590
But if you want to hit the ceiling
Here is all you have to do

373
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,630
You take a spark of bossa

374
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,070
One fandero

375
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,030
Take a wiggle

376
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,790
You've got the fascinating rhythm
of the samba

377
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:45,270
Here's a tall tale, just the way
the old timers used to tell them.

378
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,350
Pecos Bill was the roughest, toughest
shootingest cowpoke that ever lived.

379
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,950
Any story about Pecos
is bound to be strong medicine.

380
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,670
Maybe it's best
to sashay into it gently.

381
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,650
Shades of night are falling

382
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,890
As the wind begins to sigh

383
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,370
And the world is silhouetted

384
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,530
Against the sky

385
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:29,530
Blue shadows on the trail

386
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:41,410
Blue moon shining through the trees

387
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:50,970
And the plaintive wail
from the distance

388
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,690
Comes a-drifting

389
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,770
On the evening breeze

390
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,970
Move along, blue shadows!

391
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,250
Move along!

392
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,970
Soon the dawn will come

393
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,530
And you'll be on your way

394
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:35,690
But until the darkness
sheds its veil

395
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,530
There'll be blue shadows

396
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,650
On the trail

397
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,490
Move along, blue shadows

398
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,090
Move along

399
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,690
Move along

400
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,730
Soon the dawn will come

401
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,010
And you'll be on your way

402
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,050
On your way

403
00:53:52,220 --> 00:54:00,130
But until the darkness
sheds its veil

404
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,780
There'll be blue shadows

405
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,290
On the trail

406
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:17,610
Shadows on the trail

407
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,210
Uncle Roy, what makes the wolves
howl like that?

408
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,970
Wolves? Those are coyotes.

409
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,850
Yes, Bobby's right.
They howl when the moon is bright.

410
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,090
- Why?
- That's quite a story.

411
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,250
- Cowboys in it?
- Yes, sirree.

412
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,850
- Indians, too?
- Could be two or three.

413
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,610
Mostly this story's about Pecos Bill.

414
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,370
Pecos Bill? Who's he?

415
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,570
- Never heard of Pecos Bill?
- Imagine!

416
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,810
I thought everybody knows Pecos.

417
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,050
Bill was the world's
greatest buckaroo.

418
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,290
The roughest, toughest critter
Never was a quitter

419
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,730
Cos he never had no fear
for man or beast

420
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,890
Pecos Bill was...

421
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,930
Easy, Trigger,
I won't forget his horse, Widowmaker.

422
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,770
- Widowmaker?
- That's a funny name.

423
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,010
That horse earned it, just the same.

424
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,810
- A killer.
- Dynamite.

425
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,290
Widowmaker was Bill's best pal.

426
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,410
Until along came
that beautiful prairie gal.

427
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,930
- Shucks, a woman!
- But what a woman.

428
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,570
She was fresh as the dew

429
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,010
On a prairie rose

430
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,730
A true thoroughbred

431
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,010
From her head to her toes

432
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:56,410
That there was Slue Foot Sue

433
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,730
Sweet Sue

434
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,850
I'd rather hear about the coyotes.

435
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,810
You started to say...

436
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,570
Why coyotes howl at the moon
that way?

437
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,570
You're right. It all fits together.
You can't tell one without the other.

438
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:21,490
The story of Bill and that gal
is the story of why coyotes howl.

439
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,690
I'm getting to the details now.

440
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,490
Here on the map of the old US,

441
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,890
completely surrounded by wilderness,
lies Texas.

442
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,050
- There are some other states.
- Like Wyoming.

443
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,370
- Milwaukee.
- Long Island South.

444
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:44,240
Down Texas way, a river flows.
Where it comes from nobody knows.

445
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,270
Where it's going, don't no one care.
Just glad it's leaving there.

446
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,440
- The Pecos River.
- Pure alkali.

447
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,360
- Naturally mean water.
- The buzzards won't even touch it.

448
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,160
Into this fertile garden spot
came a prairie cart.

449
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,790
There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats,

450
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,510
- four hound dogs.
- And a couple of cats.

451
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,630
- Going west looking for elbow room.
- Sure could use some of the same.

452
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,190
Crossing the river bed,
something fell out on to his head.

453
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,200
They didn't even know he was gone.

454
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,520
The wagon just kept rolling along.

455
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,880
It was Bill, poor little critter.

456
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,920
Homeless as a poker chip.

457
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,440
Along came night and a prairie moon

458
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,720
Old Ma Coyote a-hurrying home

459
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,520
She was due for a shock
at her journey's end

460
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,640
The stork had delivered a dividend

461
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,640
- One more than usual!
- It had never happened before.

462
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,190
Probably one of them
new-fangled models.

463
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,920
- Bill looked up and grinned
- Shucks!

464
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,790
Ma 's old heart just caved in

465
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:18,310
Bill saw that he needn't fear
He'd staked himself a claim here

466
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,520
Headed straight for the chuck wagon.

467
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,760
Bill was hungrier than a woodpecker
with a headache.

468
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,760
It followed as natural fact

469
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,120
that Bill growed up
with that coyote pack.

470
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,040
He soon became the top hand
in a way they all could understand.

471
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,280
Little Bill couldn't rest
till he'd proved himself the best.

472
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,390
He studied other varmints, too,
then showed them a trick or two.

473
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,910
Outloped the antelope.

474
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,760
Outjumped the jackrabbit.

475
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,440
Bill even outhissed
the rattlesnake.

476
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,230
Then one day

477
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,110
Across the burning sand

478
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,590
A stranger came

479
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,800
To the Pecos land

480
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,400
The usual committee
Was there today

481
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,400
To welcome their guest

482
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,350
In the usual way

483
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,800
Fifty to one weren't no fair fight,

484
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,670
but one plus Bill
made it just about right.

485
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:35,360
Well, it was the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

486
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,000
They stuck together like warts
on a toad, like birds of a feather.

487
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,390
When Bill growed up, of course,

488
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,190
he chose a career to suit him
and his horse.

489
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,200
Yep, Bill became
a rootin', tootin' cowboy.

490
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,830
Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy
down in Texas

491
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,600
The western superman,
to say the least

492
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,040
The roughest, toughest critter
Never was a quitter

493
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,510
Cos he never had no fear
of man nor beast

494
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,800
So yippee aye-ay, aye-ay!
Yippee aye-o!

495
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,040
For the toughest critter
west of the Alamo

496
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,070
So yippee aye-ay!

497
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,920
Yippee aye-o!

498
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,750
Once, a drought spread
all over Texas,

499
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,630
so to sunny Californy he did go.

500
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,430
Though the gag is corny
He brought rain from Californy

501
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,480
That's the way we got
the Gulf of Mexico

502
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,400
So yippee aye-ay aye-ay!
Yippee aye-yo!

503
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,680
For the toughest critter
west of the Alamo

504
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,360
Once a band of rustlers
stole a herd of cattle

505
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,880
but they didn't know it was Bill's.

506
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:38,200
When he caught them villains,
Pecos knocked out all their fillings.

507
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,750
That's why there's gold
in them hills.

508
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,080
So yippee aye-ay!
Yippee aye-o!

509
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,320
For the toughest critter
west of the Alamo

510
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,190
Pecos lost his way

511
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,880
- While travelling on the desert
- Water!

512
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,600
It was 90 miles
across the burning sand

513
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,280
Water!

514
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,120
He knew he'd never reach the border

515
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,400
- Water!
- If he didn't get some water

516
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,280
Water!

517
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,720
So he got a stick
and dug the Rio Grande

518
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,600
While a tribe of painted Indians
did a war dance

519
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,150
Pecos started shooting up
their little game

520
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,480
He gave them such a shake-up
They jumped out from their make-up

521
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,080
That's how the Painted Desert
got its name

522
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,950
So yippee aye-ay aye-o!

523
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,430
For the toughest critter
west of the Alamo

524
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,790
Reclining on a cloud high over Texas,

525
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,840
with his gun,
he made the stars evaporate.

526
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,680
He saw the stars declining,
so he left one brightly shining

527
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,470
as the emblem
of the lone star Texas state.

528
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,720
So yippee aye-ay, aye-ay!
Yippee aye-o!

529
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,400
Them was happy days
for Bill and that horse.

530
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,400
Looked like nothing
could come between them.

531
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,550
Then it happened.

532
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,720
Bill was happy that day,
killing time in his carefree way,

533
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,560
inventing the one-man rodeo
and butting heads with the buffalo.

534
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,320
Poor Bill, happy as a hog
in a turnip patch and then,

535
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,240
Old Man Fate started dealing
from the bottom of the deck.

536
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,720
Down the stream came Slue Foot Sue,
all her charms revealed to view.

537
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:15,320
Like something from a dream,
the first woman Bill's ever seen.

538
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,350
She was strange.

539
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,310
- Unusual.
- Yeah, but powerfully stimulating.

540
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,480
Like a slug of rye
on an empty stomach.

541
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,560
Give him a right peculiar feeling,
set his senses reeling,

542
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,400
with a pounding inside his ears
like the galloping of steers.

543
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,520
His chest was churning

544
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,600
His brain was burning with a fire
that could only be cooled...

545
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:50,320
In the beckoning depths
Of two blue limpid pools

546
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,150
Yep, l'amour had come to Pecos Bill.

547
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,550
Widowmaker was puzzled.
Looked like trouble to him.

548
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,640
He sure was right.

549
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,680
Bill was busy inventing courting,
western style.

550
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,920
He arranged for the moon

551
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,040
To rise just right

552
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,000
And flood the land

553
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,040
With a silvery light

554
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,430
Ordered the stars

555
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,150
In heaven above

556
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,630
To form a token

557
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,560
Of undying love

558
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,830
Then across the sky

559
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,960
In words of fire

560
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,040
Bill told sweet Sue

561
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,240
Of his own heart's desire

562
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,160
Sweet Sue

563
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,000
I love you

564
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:36,000
Sue named the wedding day
but Bill had a price to pay.

565
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,310
Sue wanted a bustle,
the finest, of course,

566
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,440
and she aimed to be wedded
riding Bill's horse.

567
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,680
Sue got her bustle
and it was classy.

568
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,680
Put the finishing touch
on her chassis.

569
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,720
That happy blushing bride
was busting with girlish pride.

570
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,440
But Bill had promised her
a ride on Widowmaker.

571
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,720
Would that horse let Sue ride?

572
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,350
Here comes the answer.
Fit to be tied!

573
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,550
- Widowmaker was irritated.
- But that didn't bother Sue.

574
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:18,320
She walked up to his side,
touched his bristling hide.

575
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,760
With a flick of her bustle, Sue
was aboard and sat for the tussle.

576
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,840
The proceedings commenced
forthwith.

577
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,360
No doubt about it, that Sue
was a regular female buckaroo.

578
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,960
And then... that bustle.

579
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,200
Underneath the frills and flounces,
Sue developed plenty of bounces.

580
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,270
More than she could handle.

581
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:13,440
Then Sue took off
like a Roman candle.

582
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,840
That devilish contraption
of steel and wire

583
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,680
bounced the poor girl
higher and higher.

584
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,440
It was plain to the multitude
that Sue was gaining altitude.

585
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,040
Looked like she was a goner.

586
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,880
But no! A ray of hope.

587
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,160
Look! Bill and his trusty rope.

588
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,320
He'd darned soon put a stop to this.

589
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,360
Shucks. Bill was never known to miss.

590
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,760
Bill was calm, confident.
He built his loop with careless ease.

591
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,240
He judged his distance,
tested the breeze.

592
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,640
Then a whirl and a twirl and
a twist of the wrist, he let her go!

593
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,640
But the champion missed!

594
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,120
How it come to happen,
nobody could figure out.

595
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,630
She was off again
on her heavenly flight.

596
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,320
Up she went, clean out of sight.

597
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,320
Till, far into space,
this unfortunate maid

598
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,510
finally come to the moon,
and that's where she stayed.

599
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:42,440
In the state of Texas, USA, life
still goes on in the same old way.

600
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:49,280
The Pecos River still flows on, but
the greatest cowboy on earth is gone.

601
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,360
Yeah, Bill went back to the coyotes,
but he never forgot Sue.

602
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,080
Every night when the moon was high,

603
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,000
he'd lift his voice
in a mournful cry,

604
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,440
bewailing the fate of his lady fair,

605
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,070
his long-lost love
in the sky up there.

606
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,000
So painful was his grief to see, the
varmints joined in out of sympathy.

607
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:19,400
That's how come, to this very day,
coyotes howl at the moon that way.

608
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,670
Move along, blue shadows

609
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,280
Move along

610
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,830
Move along

611
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Soon the dawn will come

612
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,040
And you'll be on your way

613
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,120
On your way

614
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:48,240
But until the darkness
sheds its veil

615
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,760
There'll be blue shadows

616
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,280
On the trail

617
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:05,150
Shadows on the trail
