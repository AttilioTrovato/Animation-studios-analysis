1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:06,673

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,641
A fond greeting to you

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,729
A warm handshake or two

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,523
Good friends always

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,321
A new's waiting to start

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,367
You must meet it
Wake up and greet it

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,911
With a gay song in your heart

8
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,741
Here's an unusual expedition:

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,162
artists, musicians and writers setting
out for a trip through Latin America...

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,249
to find new personalities, music
and dances for their cartoon films.

11
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,894
Three days later they glided in
to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil...

12
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,855
then down to the Argentine,
Buenos Aires...

13
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,864
and out across the pampas.

14
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,038
At Cordoba, the party divided.

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,669
Some flew over the Andes into Chile.

16
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,671
The others went north
to the Inca country--

17
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,257
Bolivia, Peru
and Lake Titicaca...

18
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,052
turning away from the modern cities
to find the descendants...

19
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,388
of ancient Inca civilization.

20
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,104
Eight thousand square miles of water
over two miles above sea level...

21
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,984
Lake Titicaca has been prominent in Inca
history and folklore for generations.

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,326
Wood is scarce at this altitude...

23
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,579
so the fishermen's boats
are woven of balsa reeds.

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:52,005
There's always plenty of colour
and excitement here on market day.

25
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,596
These folks come from miles around
to trade their goods...

26
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,140
and swap some of the local gossip.

27
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,524
The styles run to bright-coloured
clothes and conservative hats...

28
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,028
and a rumble seat for the baby.

29
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,323
Just the kind of material
the artists were after.

30
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,329
Their music is strange and exotic--

31
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,376
melodies handed down
from their Inca ancestors.

32
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,637
And walking haystacks
are right in tempo.

33
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,103
These little syncopated burros
bear the heavy burdens here...

34
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,899
because the more dignified llama
will carry us to much and no more.

35
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,780
When his quota is exceeded,
that haughty aristocrat of the Andes...

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,533
calmly sits down
and refuses to budge.

37
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,623
Yes, a llama can make you feel
awfully unimportant.

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,684
All these impressions, together with the
local colour that had been absorbed...

39
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,186
resulted in a little travelogue...

40
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,188
seeing the land of the Incas
through the eyes...

41
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,941
of a celebrated North American tourist.

42
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,866
Lake Titicaca is approximately
13,000 feet above sea level.

43
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,910
- 13,000 feet!
- Hmm, approximately.

44
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,583
At this great height, many visitors are
subject to altitude fever, or soroche.

45
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,086
- Is that so?
- The most common symptom is dizziness.

46
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,255
Dizziness? Aw, phooey!

47
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,310
Often followed
by palpitation of the heart.

48
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,813
The ears have a tendency to pop.

49
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,609
And a peculiar
ringing sound is heard.

50
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,906
Fascinating, isn't it?

51
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,160
The balsa, or basket boat...

52
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,872
is constructed entirely
of reeds tightly bound together.

53
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,875
It's built to withstand
the fury of the elements.

54
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,671
In fact, it seems to be impervious
to practically everything...

55
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,258
except the inquisitive tourist.

56
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,347
Crossing the lake
is often filled with adventure.

57
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,225
A strong wind
may arise very suddenly...

58
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,480
and then stop suddenly.

59
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,413
For the artist
in search of local colour...

60
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,416
the marketplace presents an
excellent picture of village life...

61
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,961
as shoppers and merchants
bustle about the public square.

62
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,849
The precipitous terrain in this region
offers no problem to these hearty folk.

63
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,437
And we find the people here
divided into two classes--

64
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,981
those who walk against the wind...

65
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,942
and those who walk with the wind.

66
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,491
Yes, wherever the visitor
points his camera...

67
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,036
he finds a picture fit for framing.

68
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,956
The llama, or "yama",
is an odd-looking individual...

69
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,334
with considerable personality.

70
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,962
His master, here, exercises
complete control over him...

71
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,048
with a home-made flute.

72
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,479
is quickly interpreted
by this wide-awake youngster.

73
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,039
The visitor never seems to be satisfied
until he tries on the native costume.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,625
And our tourist is no exception.

75
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,321
The llama is obviously
not a jitterbug...

76
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,824
but if you want to explore
this precipitous country...

77
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,869
he’ll solve all your
transportation problems.

78
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,088
One soon becomes accustomed
to the low, fleecy clouds...

79
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,258
that steal like silent ghosts
across one's path.

80
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,098
The gentle undulating gait of the llama
adapts itself very nicely...

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,226
to the swaying motion
of the suspension bridge.

82
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,979
Suspension bridge?

83
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,023
Oh, no!

84
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,987
Far below us, we see the village.

85
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,199
Whoa! Whoa-oa!

86
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,913
The flute.

87
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,471
Give me that flute, ya big palooka!

88
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,900
Hey! Take it easy!

89
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,735
Whoa! Whoa-oa!

90
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,365
What?

91
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,547
The traveller should be cautioned
against any reckless behaviour...

92
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,674
at this high altitude.

93
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,759
Overexertion is dangerous.

94
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,179
And above all, one should
never lose one's temper.

95
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,306
Shut up, ya big windbag!

96
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,854
Get off of me!
Go on, beat it!

97
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,065
Doggone you.

98
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,999
And finally, the pottery market...

99
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,585
where the visitor always drops in...

100
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,672
seldom failing to accumulate
a large collection...

101
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,383
of the native handiwork,
as he bids a fond farewell...

102
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,678
to the land of the Incas,
Lake Titicaca.

103
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,353
The flight across the Andes
into Chile...

104
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,855
over the highest mountains in America.

105
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,192
Plenty to see and remember
on this spectacular trip.

106
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,861
Since no cameras are allowed here...

107
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,239
the boys have to cover this
from memory and sketches.

108
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,412
Impressions of Uspallata Pass
from 16,000 feet.

109
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,251
These sketches and the stories
told of the pioneer mail planes...

110
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,630
that first flew this route
started everyone thinking.

111
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,343
First a little plane
began to take shape...

112
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,306
with a personality all his own.

113
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,686
All agreed that he had
good screen possibilities...

114
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,897
and before the plane set down
at Santiago...

115
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,066
his life story had begun.

116
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,572
Once upon a time in a little airport
near Santiago, Chile...

117
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,534
there lived three aeroplanes:

118
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,787
the papa plane, the mama plane
and the baby plane.

119
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,750
The papa plane was a big,
powerful male plane.

120
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,133
Mama plane was
a middle-sized female plane.

121
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,804
And the baby plane was
a little boy plane named Pedro.

122
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,723
Uh, where is Pedro?

123
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,309
Oh, there he is. Maybe someday...

124
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,438
he’ll grow up to be a big plane
like his father...

125
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,524
who carries the mail
between Chile and Argentina.

126
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,321
Like all fledglings,
Pedro went to ground school...

127
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,657
to learn the ABC's of flying.

128
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,912
He studied reading,
skywriting and arithmetic.

129
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,750
He was taught anatomy.

130
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,627
He also studied history--

131
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,339
Pedro! And geography.

132
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,053
And in geography, he learned the mail
route between Santiago and Mendoza.

133
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,181
Over the mighty Andes,
past Aconcagua...

134
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,310
highest mountain
in the Western Hemisphere.

135
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:35,357
One day the papa plane was laid up
with a cold in his cylinder head.

136
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,279
So he couldn’t fly the mail.

137
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,990
And the mama plane
couldn’t stand the altitude...

138
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,493
because she had high oil pressure.

139
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,703
So she couldn’t fly the mail.

140
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,914
But the mail must go through...

141
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,917
I hope.

142
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,212
Calli Pedro.
Ready for Flight 2 to Mendoza.

143
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,675
"Now, remember, Pedro",
the mama plane said...

144
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,512
"stay out of downdraught
and keep your muffler on tight."

145
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,515
And don’t go near Aconca--

146
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,433
Aconca-- Aconcagua!

147
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,981
Flight 2 leaving for Mendoza.

148
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,113
All clear, Pedro.
Let 'er go.

149
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,160
Give 'er the gun, boy!
Gun 'er! Gun 'er!

150
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,164
Don’t lose you ring speed!
Pull up!! Pull up!!

151
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,792
Look out!

152
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,798
And so, after a masterly takeoff...

153
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,800
Pedro started on
his first assignment...

154
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,219
to pick up the mail at Mendoza.

155
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,183
Each and every trip through
this pass is an adventure in itself.

156
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,270
At this altitude,
you never can tell what--

157
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,938
Downdraught!

158
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,775
Pulled out of that one all right.

159
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,236
Handles himself like a veteran.

160
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,574
His course carried him
over the Pass of Uspallata...

161
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,452
where stands the statue
of the Christ of the Andes...

162
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,330
marking the boundary
between Chile and Argentina.

163
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,166
So far, so good.
Not a cylinder missing.

164
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,211
Pedro was flying on top
of the world when suddenly...

165
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,132
his first view of that
towering monarch, Aconcagua!

166
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,596
So this was the big bully
they’d warned him about.

167
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,973
But he didn’t scare Pedro, though.

168
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,558
No, sirree.

169
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,232
Well, the worst is over.

170
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,361
And from now on,
it's clear sailing to Mendoza.

171
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,863
Come in against the wind, Pedro.

172
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,574
There's your mail.
Easy now. Attaboy!

173
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,079
He picked up his mail
like a veteran.

174
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,165
Uh-oh! Careful!
That cargo is precious.

175
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,503
Pedro was homeward-bound
and ahead of schedule.

176
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,091
I’ll bet his mother and dad
will be proud of him.

177
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,593
Just a natural-born flier.

178
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,264
Hmm. Maybe I
shouldn’t have mentioned it.

179
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,276
Look out!

180
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,071
Hope he got that out of his system.

181
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,323
Now with good luck and a--
Uh-oh.

182
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,287
I was afraid of that.
Hey, Pedro, come back!

183
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,168
The little fellow had completely
forgotten his responsibilities. Pedro!

184
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,839
Then suddenly, Aconcagua!

185
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,594
Its rocky, snow-filled crags formed
the face of a leering monster.

186
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,682
The oil froze
in little Pedro's cylinders...

187
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,184
and his motor knocked with fright.

188
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,021
All those warnings
came back to him now:

189
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,399
the treacherous crosscurrents,
the sudden storms.

190
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,440
Climb above the storm, Pedro!

191
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,526
Never mind the mail!
Let it go! Let it go!

192
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,321
Forget the mail!
Climb, Pedro! Climb!

193
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,742
Look out!

194
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,580
Climb, Pedro! Climb!

195
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,376
Get above the storm!
I know you can make it!

196
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,221
Drop the mail!
You’ve got to save yourself!

197
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,974
More altitude!
25,000's all you need!

198
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,811
Up! Up!

199
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,649
Gun your motor! Now just a little more
and you’ll be in the clear!

200
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,026
Climb, Pedro! Climb!
Good boy!

201
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,280
Good boy!
I knew you could make it!

202
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,783
You’re all right now.

203
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,703
Just level off
and head straight for home.

204
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,081
He's out of gas.

205
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,459
Pedro! Pedro!

206
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,340
He's gone.

207
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,969
Back at the home field...

208
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,014
Pedro's parents
searched the skies in vain.

209
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,183
They knew that he couldn’t
have held out this long.

210
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,728
Their brave little son was gone...

211
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,272
another martyr to the mail service.

212
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,859
Poor little fella.
His first flight.

213
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,362
It's too bad
it had to end this way.

214
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,949
What was that?

215
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,869
I wonder if it--
No, it couldn’t be.

216
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,955
Wait! It is! It's Pedro!

217
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,757
Pedro! Petey boy!
Are you all right?

218
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,594
Well, don’t ask me how he did it.

219
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,514
It wasn’t exactly
a three-point landing...

220
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,975
but he did fulfil his mission.

221
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,895
He brought the mail through.

222
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,731
The mail,
that all-important cargo.

223
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,487
"Having wonderful time.
Wish you were--" Mmm.

224
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,490
Well, it might have been important.

225
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,825
And he did bring in the mail.

226
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,954
And so, the papa plane,
the mama plane...

227
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,374
and little Pedro
flew happily ever after.

228
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,088
Sailing eastward from Chile,
we cross the Argentine pampas...

229
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,425
just millions of acres
of rich grazing land...

230
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,598
the third largest city
in the Western Hemisphere.

231
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,643
Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.

232
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,105
This is the plaza de Mayo,
one of its delightful parks;

233
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,817
the Teatro Colon,
home of the opera;

234
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,614
and the stately Congress building,
centre of Argentina’s government.

235
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,494
The tallest building
in South America...

236
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,746
the Edificio Cavanaugh.

237
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,209
Yes, they were really
impressed with the big city...

238
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,795
but impressive, too,
was the lure of the pampas...

239
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,298
and the Argentine gaucho
as painted by F. Molina Campos.

240
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,177
The party were guests
at his ranch studio...

241
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,179
where Senor Campos paints the gaucho...

242
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,598
with amazing detail and humour.

243
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,188
Seeing these pictures made them
more anxious than ever...

244
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,816
to meet these caballeros
in person.

245
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,947
And they lived up to their pictures.

246
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,074
A real Wild West show...

247
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,453
but just part
of the day's work for a gaucho.

248
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,332
Sketching these paisanos
in action was no easy ob.

249
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,341
But they did manage to get a good
look at the gaucho's equipment.

250
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,427
Silver coins decorate his belt,
or tirador.

251
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,347
The sheepskin saddle.

252
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,849
Soft horsehide boots.

253
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,269
This garment's called a chiri .

254
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,692
Here the visitors
were treated to an asado.

255
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,904
choice cuts of meat;
mate, the Argentine tea;

256
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,533
and wine from their own vineyards.

257
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,994
True Argentine hospitality.

258
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,498
A group of skilled dancers
entertained the guests.

259
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,292
Not the modern tango
of Buenos Aires...

260
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,337
but the country dances
of the Argentine.

261
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,924
The same tunes to which
their grandparents had danced.

262
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,276
Notice how closely
these steps resemble...

263
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,029
the old-time square dances
of North America.

264
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,668
Gathering picture material
here was a pleasure.

265
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,945
Another story was under way.

266
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:28,325
And after seeing Senor Campos, paintings
and all this colourful exhibition...

267
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,827
we couldn’t help but compare
the life of the Argentine gaucho...

268
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,079
with that of our own cowboy.

269
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,708
And they reached way back
into Texas to find a leading man.

270
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,461
From the windswept plains
of Montana...

271
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,255
to the sunbaked banks
of the Rio Grande...

272
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,467
over countless miles
of mountain and prairie...

273
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:49,679
untouched and unsullied by
the mercenary hand of civilization...

274
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,892
roams a tough,
hardy and heroic breed of man:

275
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,062
the North American cowboy.

276
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,898
Strong, silent and weather-beaten.

277
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,819
Howdy, strangers.

278
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,489
This colourful cowhand
of the great West...

279
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,700
has his counterpart
in the South American gaucho.

280
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,663
Over land and sea, over rugged
mountains and dense jungles...

281
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,585
down across the equator to the lush,
grassy pampas of the Argentine...

282
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,588
the home of the gaucho.

283
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:29,010
Now, the cowboys of both
Americas have much in common...

284
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,931
although their costume
differs in a few minor details.

285
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:36,184
We substitute bombachas
for chaps; the sombrero.

286
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,020
Then there's the saco,
the tirador...

287
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,231
the chiri and the panuelo.

288
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,073
Then, finally,
we have the poncho...

289
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,575
which just about covers everything.

290
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,540
The gaucho's closest friend
and inseparable companion...

291
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,625
is his horse, or pingo.

292
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,549
Quickly the gaucho
reaches for his lasso!

293
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,052
Twirling the rawhide above his head, he deftly
tosses the noose about the horse's neck...

294
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,430
and easily subdues
the spirited animal...

295
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,765
with the help
of the snubbing post...

296
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,184
or palenque.

297
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,522
Thanks to the palenque,
or snubbing post...

298
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:26,568
the horse is soon brought under
control and is ready for the saddle.

299
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,534
While it appears complex
at first glance...

300
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,466
adding the cinchas,
bastos, sheepskin, pigskin...

301
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,177
bridle, bit and, finally,
the gaucho.

302
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,474
When riding the range at night...

303
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:01,019
the saddle may be quickly
converted into a bed, or catre.

304
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,771
Bed?

305
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,987
One of the gaucho's
favourite sports is the asado...

306
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,031
or Argentine barbecue.

307
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,326
Over an open charcoal fire...

308
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,329
thick, juicy,
tender steaks are prepared.

309
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,957
And, amigos,
it fairly melts in your mouth.

310
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,133
The gaucho's method
of eating looks quite simple...

311
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,053
yet requires
a certain amount of practice.

312
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,056
The bread and meat
are held in one hand...

313
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,641
the knife in the other.

314
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,643
Note the action
of wrist and elbow...

315
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,105
as knife and food synchronize
in deft, graceful rhythm.

316
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,858
One, two, bite, cut, chew.

317
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,529
One, a-two, a-bite, cut, chew.

318
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,992
Yes, it is this wholesome diet
that builds...

319
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,869
the gaucho's nerves of steel
and muscles of iron.

320
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,165
And now the boleadoras, or bolas.

321
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,169
The bolas consists of three lead
weights covered with rawhide...

322
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,672
and is often used for sport,
such as capturing...

323
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,925
that swift-moving bird of the
pampas, the Argentine ostrich...

324
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,593
or avestruz..

325
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,930
Unlike most members
of the ostrich family...

326
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,933
the avestruz. is not equipped
with ornamental tail plumage.

327
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,353
Its slender legs make
excellent targets for the bolas.

328
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,772
Did he say bolas?

329
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:34,446
Dashing at breakneck speed, the gaucho
whirls the bolas, round and, round...

330
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,198
faster and faster,
and then the throw!

331
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:48,251
And now to fully appreciate
this remarkable feat...

332
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,962
let us study the action...

333
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,882
through the eye
of the slow-motion camera.

334
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,260
Note the grace and beauty...

335
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,680
of this light-footed creature
in startled flight.

336
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,561
With delicate balance and
clocklike precision of timing...

337
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,856
man and beast moving as one...

338
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,568
display a minimum of waste motion...

339
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,657
as the whirling bolas are unleashed.

340
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:28,500
Faster and faster!
On and on they spin, closer and closer!

341
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,503
Here they come! Be careful!
Get out of the way! Heads up! Watch it!

342
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,630
Look out, look out!
Here it comes! Duck, duck, duck!

343
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,548
Too late! Too late!

344
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,934
And when night--

345
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,061
When night falls...

346
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,482
the lone gaucho oft-times finds
himself far, far out on the pampas.

347
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,861
Listen to the melancholy
strains of the triste...

348
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,239
a sad, romantic ballad.

349
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,064
But the gaucho is not always sad.

350
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,568
Come, let us dance to
the lively beat of the chacarera...

351
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,154
the dance of the farmer's daughter.

352
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:45,201
Combining the minuet...

353
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,330
the bunny hug
and a dash of jumping jive.

354
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,208
The pampas version of cutting a rug.

355
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,879
And El Malambo...

356
00:29:56,087 --> 00:30:00,008
a solo number in which the dancer
swings out with utter abandon...

357
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:04,012
often described as
perpetual motion below the equator.

358
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,653
Traditional dance
of the rooster and the hen.

359
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:38,380
And now, as he sways to
the gentle undulations of El Malambo...

360
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,508
we gently waft
our transplanted cowboy...

361
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,636
back to his prairie homeland.

362
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,806
Here we leave him
with warm and tender memories...

363
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:51,017
of his visit to the gay,
romantic land of the gaucho.

364
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,450
And now from the pampas
to Brazil and Rio de Janeiro...

365
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,662
a city of amazing beauty
and a perfect setting.

366
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,174
One of the best views of the city
is from the top of Sugarloaf...

367
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:26,511
overlooking Copacabana Beach,
the playground of Rio.

368
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,808
From Corcovado, the Statue
of the Saviour looks out...

369
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,561
upon these scenes
of active city life.

370
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:40,275
This is the kind of atmosphere
the artists were after:

371
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,652
the outdoor cafes...

372
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,906
the mosaic sidewalks
that are found all over Rio.

373
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:51,202
These designs are a tribute
to patience and artistry...

374
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,705
preserving a Brazilian tradition.

375
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,501
Here are some
of the first impressions.

376
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,214
This is what can happen to a big city
when a crowd of cartoonists...

377
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,050
are turned loose.

378
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,600
Among the sketches
was a promising actor...

379
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,604
Old Papagaio, the parrot featured
in most of Brazil's funny stories.

380
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:25,195
With the help of the wardrobe
department, he becomes Joe Carioca.

381
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,698
The music of Brazil, a samba.

382
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,952
Rhythm instruments
like the reco reco...

383
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,705
and the cabaca...

384
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,918
all help to beat out
that intricate samba rhythm...

385
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,588
a lively two-step with a bounce.

386
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,385
It's the same rhythm that
captivates the whole city...

387
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,845
when carnival time comes around.

388
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,494
Carnival in Rio--

389
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,122
three hilarious days and nights.

390
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,666
Singing, dancing and celebrating.

391
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:24,004
The spirit of the Mardi Gras
and New Year's Eve rolled into one.

392
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:34,305
Each year hundreds of songs are written
especially for this occasion...

393
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:39,185
and the dream of every composer is to
have his song chosen as a carnival hit.

394
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:44,190
One number stood out as a perfect
background for the first Brazilian film.

395
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,944
Its author, Ary Barroso,
has made use of the samba rhythm...

396
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:51,031
to paint a musical picture
of his native land.

397
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,577
A watercolour of Brazil.

398
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,568
What happened? Where am I?

399
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,654
What's going on around here?

400
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,702
Boy, this is fun!

401
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,751
Uh-oh.

402
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,921
What's this? A parrot?

403
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,233
"Chosé Carioco.

404
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,069
Rio de, uh...

405
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,780
January, Brassa."

406
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,535
No, senor. José Carioca.
Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.

407
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,205
Huh?

408
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:32,002
My card? I know I brought one
from the States.

409
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,296
Ah. There you are.

410
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,219
"Donald Duck"?

411
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,722
O Pato Donald! O Pato Donald!

412
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,653
O Pato Donald!

413
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,593
Or, as you Americans say...

414
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,095
- Huh?
- "let's go see the town."

415
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,306
Okay, Joe! Where do we go?

416
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:29,684
Donald, I will show you
the land of the samba.

417
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,562
Samba? What's samba?

418
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,814
Ha! The samba!

419
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,866
Ah! Soda pop!

420
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,666
Down the hatch, Joe!

421
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,511
Ohh!

422
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,812
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Samba!

423
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:37,163
