173
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:22,546
Digitizing. A laser dismantles
the molecular structure of the object,

174
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,882
and molecules remain
suspended in the laser beam.

175
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,343
Then, when the computer
plays out the model,

176
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,722
the molecules fall back
into place and voilà!

about tampering.

young software engineers.

He's so bright, as a matter of fact,
that he starts going in at night,

263
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,994
sets up his own private memory file,
and begins writing a program

264

for a video game he's invented
called Space Paranoids.

-You invented Space Paranoids?
-Paranoids. Matrix Blaster.

for a very good reason.

303

Ed, all I'm saying
is that if our own people

304
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,964
can't get access to their programs...

305
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,507

That's half our problem right there.

of handling what we do.

we designed for this computer.

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,459
FLYNN: They never should have
gotten rid of me.

338
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,549
-Now, that is a big door.
-ALAN: Shut up.

339
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,644
DILLINGER: It's my fault.
I programmed you to want too much.

340
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,147
MASTER CONTROL: l was planning to
hit the Pentagon next week.

341
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,357
The Pentagon?

342
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,402
It shouldn't be any harder
than any other big company.

343
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,363
But now this is what I get
for using humans.

344
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,616
Now wait a minute. I wrote you.

345
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,621
I've gotten 2,415 times
smarter since then.

346
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,623
What do you want with the Pentagon?

347
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,625
The same thing I want
with the Kremlin.

348
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,171
I'm bored with corporations.
With the information I can access,

349
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,383
I can run things 900 to 1200 times
better than any human.

350
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,011
If you think you're superior to us...

351
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,180
You wouldn't want me to dig up
Flynn's file

352
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,934
and read it up on a VDT at The Times,
would you?

353
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,602
You wouldn't dare.

354
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,321
-Hi.
-Hi.

355
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,823
-Working late?
-Yeah.

356
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,500
Okay, come here.
I'm gonna put him at my terminal.

357
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,002
I'm gonna meet you
in your office upstairs.

358
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,712
Don't fall asleep.

359
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,756
If and when I activate
your Tron program,

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,882
you're only gonna have
a few minutes to use it

361
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,301
before Dillinger catches
the break in security, all right?

362
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,137
As long as we stay off the top floor,

363
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,682
Dillinger will never know
we've been in here.

364
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,517
ALAN: Good luck, hot shot.

365
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,958
-Ahem!
-Flynn!

366
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,876
After you.

367
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,610
MASTER CONTROL: Keep those
programmers out of the system,

368
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,864
and get me that Chinese
language file I asked for.

369
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,198
End of line.

370
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,177
FLYNN: You are gonna stay with me,
aren't you?

371
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,138
LORA: What for? You're the one
who never needed help, remember?

372
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,349
FLYNN: Hey, come on.
I'm scared of the dark.

373
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,435
All this technology scares me.
Come on, babe.

374
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,841
This way.

375
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,559
-FLYNN: When did they put this in?
-This is where I work now.

376
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,062
I've got a direct terminal
in the laser target area.

377
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,023
You can stay there all night
if you have to.

378
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,449
Like the man says,
there's no problems, only solutions.

379
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,536
Okay, remember,
this laser is my life's work.

380
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,414
Don't spill anything, huh?

381
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,041
Have fun, sweetheart.

382
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,725
MASTER CONTROL:
You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.

383
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,810
Hey, hey, hey.

384
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,813
It's the big Master Control Program
everybody's been talking about.

385
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,607
Sit right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

386
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,694
Remember the time we used
to spend playing chess together?

387
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,659
That isn't going to do you
any good, Flynn. I'm afraid...

388
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,328
Stop. Please.

389
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,789
You realize I can't allow this.

390
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,082
Now how are you gonna
run the universe

391
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,877
if you can't even answer
a few unsolvable problems, huh?

392
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,212
Come on, big fella.
Let's see what you got.

393
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,174
I'd like to go against you
and see what you're made of.

394
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,634
FLYNN: You know, you don't look
a thing like your pictures.

395
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,178
MASTER CONTROL: l'm warning you.

396
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,762
You're entering a big error, Flynn.

397
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,515
I'm gonna have to put you
on the game grid.

398
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,058
Games? You want games?

399
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,310
I'll give you games.

400
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,827
Oh, man, this isn't happening.
It only thinks it's happening.

401
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,164
GUARD: Vacate entryport, program.

00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,629

-(EXCLAIMS)

403
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey!

404
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,597
Look, if this is about those parking
tickets, I can explain everything, okay?

405
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,563
Zero programs with war games.

406
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,401
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark.

407
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,902
A new recruit.

408
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,114
He's a tough case, but I want him
treated in the usual manner.

409
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:34,994
Train him for the games, let him hope
for a while and blow him away.

410
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,662
You got it.

411
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,583
I've been hoping you'd send me
somebody with a little bit of guts.

412
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,501
What kind of program is he?

413
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,172
He's not any kind of program, Sark.
He's a user.

414
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,382
-A user?
-That's right.

415
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,968
He pushed me in the real world.

416
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,429
Somebody pushes me, I push back.

417
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,014
So, I brought him down here.

418
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,226
What's the matter, Sark?
You look nervous.

419
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,020
Well, I...

420
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,314
It's just...

421
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,193
I don't know. A user. I mean...

422
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,029
Users wrote us.

423
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,034
-A user even wrote you!
-No one user wrote me.

424
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,536
I'm worth millions of their man-years.

425
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,038
What if I can't...

426
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,791
You rather take your chances with me?

427
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,669
Want me to slow down
your power cycles for you?

428
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,712
Wait! I need that!

429
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,800
Then pull yourself together.
Get this clown trained.

430
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:35,096
I want him in the games
until he dies playing. Acknowledge.

431
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,765
Acknowledged, Master Control.

New guy.

437
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,329
Another free program offline.

438
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,165
You really think
the users are still there?

439
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,126
They'd better be.

440
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,753
I don't wanna bust out of here
and find nothing

441
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,630
but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me.

442

-Who are you guys?
-RAM: Hold it.

444
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,264
Wanna watch those force fields.

445
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,517
You'll be having plenty of chances
to get hurt. Don't worry about that.

446
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:28,941
Look, just so I can tell my friends
what this dream is about, okay?

-Where am I?
-You're a

guest of the Master Control Program.

449
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,415
-Oh, great.
-Gonna make you play video games.

450
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,794
Okay. No sweat.
I play video games better than anybody.

00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,103
Hey, there's been a mistake.
I gotta see the guy in charge.

455
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,480
You will.

456
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:33,631
Look, operative. Command program
Sark's carrier is approaching.

457
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,842
He will explain the training procedures.

458
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,391
Greetings.

459
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,105
The Master Control Program
has chosen you

460
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,901
to serve your system on the game grid.

461
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:58,030
Those of you who continue
to profess a belief in the users

462
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,076
will receive the standard
substandard training,

463
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,038
which will result
in your eventual elimination.

464
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,625
Those of you who renounce

465
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,921
this superstitious and hysterical belief

466
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,467
will be eligible to join the warrior elite

467
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,387
of the MCP.

468
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,932
You will each receive an identity disk.

469
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:31,105
Everything you do or learn
will be imprinted on this disk.

470
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,693
If you lose your disk
or fail to follow commands,

471
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:40,155
you will be subject
to immediate de-resolution.

472
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,658

-That's Tron. He fights for the users.
-Tron.

00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,978
My name's Ram.

480
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,319
Hey, Ram.
What were you, you know, before?

481
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,364
I was an actuarial program.

482
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,866
Worked for a big insurance company.

483
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,997
Really gives you a great feeling helping
folks plan for their future needs.

484
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,917
And, of course, if you think of the
payments as an annuity over the years,

485
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,752
the cost is really quite minimal.

486
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,754
Yeah. That's great.

487
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,756

488
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,051

00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:28,430
I don't remember too much.

00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,434

That's normal in transport.

00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,811

-I'll probably never meet him.
-You might.

508
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,316
There's something different about him.

509
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,955
Okay.

510
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,397
That was a very fancy shot.

511
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,024
(CHUCKLES)

512
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
Okay, here's an easy one.

513
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,131
-Finish the game!
-No!

514
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,382
Kill him.

515
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,552
No!

516
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,472
You'll regret this.

519
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,327
MASTER CONTROL: l want him
in the games until he dies playing.

520
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,428
GUARD: This is the holding area
for the Lightcycles.

521
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,305
Hey, Flynn. You made it!

522
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,974
-Wait here.
-You won!

523
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,353
-Alan!
-Where did you hear that name?

524
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,732
-Well, that's your name, isn't it?
-The name of my user.

525
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,862
How did you know?

526
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,198
I'm a program from a user
that knows Alan.

527
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,950
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

528
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,244
Yeah, but I'm remembering
all kinds of stuff.

529
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,080
Like my user wants me
to go after the MCP.

530
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,626
-My user wants that, too.
-I know.

This is blue leader to blue bikes.

WARRIOR 2: Copy, blue leader.
WARRIOR 3: Copy, blue leader.

TRON: This is gold one to gold two
and three. Split up.

537
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,294
Take them one on one.

This is it. Come on.

542
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,082
FLYNN:
Gold three to gold two and one.

543
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,168
I'm getting out of here right now,
and you guys are invited.

00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,836

545
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,049

-Ready.

This is an illegal exit.
You must return immediately.

551
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,830
Repeat, this is an illegal exit.

552
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,041
-You must return to the grid.
-RAM: Gold two to gold three.

553
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,460
Those demons are coming down.

554
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,223
Get them.

555
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,601
Send out every game tank in the grid.

556
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,437
Get them!

557
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,317
FLYNN: I should never have written
all those tank programs.

558
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,249
Targets leaving protective field.

559
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,129
Missed!

560
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,179
All units exiting game arena!

561
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,242
Target units accelerating!

562
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,050
Pursuit force minus one tank.
Close ranks.

563
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,534
Oh, man.

564
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:17,334
On the other side of the screen,
it all looked so easy.

565
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,550
They must've gone right past us.

566
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:32,098
We made it...this far.

567
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,063
GUARD: Pursuit force reporting.

568
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,023
We lost visual contact
with escaped units.

569
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,191
Awaiting further orders.

570
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,401
SARK: Get the pursuit forces
back into the canyons.

571
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,195
Those programs never
made it out of there.

572
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,281
We'll have them back in no time, sir,
long before the interrupt interface.

573
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,534
We'd better, Null Unit.

574
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,871
I'll be lucky if the MCP doesn't
blast me into a dead zone.

575
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:56,873
I want those conscripts!

578
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,679
Watch it. Watch it.

579
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,477
Come on, you little bugger. Come on.

580
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,896
RAM: Look at that.

581
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,192
When do we pay our visit
to the old Master Control, huh?

582
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,944
What?

583
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,115
There's just three of us.

584
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,535
Well, you know anybody who's
got an army for rent, that's fine.

585
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,247
But my user told me
to go take that sucker out,

586
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,249
or I'm never getting outta here.

587
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,044
We can't get to the MCP
without the help of my user.

588
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,716
I have to get to that input/output tower

589
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,843
and communicate with him.

590
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,640
Well, good. Check in with Alan.
Maybe he knows what's...

591
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,726
What's that?

592
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:03,064
That is just what I need right now.

593
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,499
Oh, it's nice.

594
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,052
Incredible.

how good the power feels

we have scored.

I feel so much better.

-One second.

00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,837
Come on! We gotta get outta here.

GUARD: No sign of life.
Looks like we got them.

619

Continue pursuit

Proceeding toward sector frontier.

We're gonna make it, Ram.
I just gotta find you a place to rest.

622
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,259
Hang in there, Ram.

623
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,219
This looks like a good spot.

624
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,564
Those tanks won't find us here.

625
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,525
Okay.

00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,949
You see this?

632
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,702
You shouldn't be able to do that.

633
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,797
Now for some real user power.

634
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,498
Hey, this looks promising.

635
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,756
This is just like the old arcade grips.

636
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,012
All right, let's get this show on the road.

637
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,232
Now we're smoking.

638
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,275
How can you steal a Recognizer?

639
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,444
Hey, you okay? You don't look so good.

640
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,822
We'll get you fixed up. Hang on.

641
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,240
Come here.

00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:55,560
Oh, my user. Users are users. They...

643
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,233
Are you a user?

644
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,403
Yeah.

Flynn?

646
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,419
Help Tron.

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,432
Ram.

648
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,525
Ram!

649
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,405
Damn Recognizer.

650
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,868
Why won't the thing just go straight?

651
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,497
I gotta get to that I/O tower.

They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.

Listen, Yori. We have to make plans.

671
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,980
Where can we go?

-Yes.
-Is that all you can say?

-No.
-Anything else?

Yes.

Positive and negative, huh?
You're a bit.

680
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,188
Yes.

681
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,108
Well, where's your program?
Isn't he gonna miss ya?

682
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,737
-No.
-I'm your program?

I can't stand all this commotion.
What do you want?

718
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,383
I've come to communicate with my user.

719
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:51,428
Difficult proposition.
Difficult proposition at best.

720
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,266
Why, I could be de-rezzed
just for letting you in here.

721
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,018
They hate this tower.

722

They'd close it down if they dared.

over your shoulder.

must grow beyond itself

and extend into the realm
of the invisible.

SARK: We're taking our friend here

860
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,549
and some other religious fanatics
to Master Control.

861
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:26,052

-Intermediate vectors detached.
-Route us to the MCP.

867
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,938
I want to get rid of this dead weight

868
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,399
and catch a transport beam
to the game domain.

Something's happening.

870

Hey.

871
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:41,771
Yori?

872
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,650
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.

873
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,530
-Leave me alone. We've failed.
-We're only gonna fail if we give up!

874
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,782
Now come on! Look! The wall!

Yori.

876
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,423
You brought me back. How?

877
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,175
Why did you bring me back?

878
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,177
I need your help. Come on.

-I'm on it.
-It's the MCP.

We're getting closer.

I don't know how you survived, slave.

888

It doesn't matter. Prepare to terminate.

MASTER CONTROL: All programs
have a desire to be useful.

890
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:58,950
But in moments, you will no longer
seek communication with each other

891
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,369
or your superfluous users.

892
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,832
You will each be part of me,
and together, we will be complete.

893
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,717
You should've joined me.
We'd have made a great team.

894
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,433
-You're very persistent, Tron.
-I'm also better than you.

MASTER CONTROL: Your user
can't help you now, my little program.

901
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,003
I got it. Steer us over by the beam.

902
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,840
-Right next to it.
-What good'll that do?

903
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,718
I'm gonna jump.

904
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,098
-It's the only way to help Tron.
-Don't. You'll be de-rezzed.

905
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,161
Don't worry.

Where's Flynn?

912
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:20,086
It was incredible.
He threw himself into the beam

913
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:24,298
and distracted the MCP just
long enough for you to get the disk in.

914

He saved us. He really did it.
