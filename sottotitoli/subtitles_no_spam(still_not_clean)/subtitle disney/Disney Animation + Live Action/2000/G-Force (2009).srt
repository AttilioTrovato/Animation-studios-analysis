1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,035
Hey, slow down!

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,330
That is not cool!

3
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,765
Thank you for coming tonight, Darwin.

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,351
This room is secure,
so we can speak freely.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,520
Why the secrecy?

6
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,107
Because the Feds are coming
tomorrow... to shut us down.

7
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,739
Shut us down?
Without even giving us a chance?

8
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,823
Yes.

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,993
And there's only one way
we can save this department,

10
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,829
and that's prove ourselves,
in the field.

11
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,719
Our target is Leonard Saber.

12
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,808
As you know, he is a former arms dealer
and current CEO of Saberling Industries.

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,437
The Bureau's intel shows Saber
has developed a new microchip

14
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,440
with possible military applications.

15
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:53,737
They suspect he has sold his technology
to the Far East under the code name...

16
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,072
...Clusterstorm.

17
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,951
Now, Darwin, we need to find out
how Saber plans to use this technology.

18
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,411
Your mission is to download
the Clusterstorm files

19
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,415
from Saber's personal computer
located in his library, right here.

20
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,967
Ben, we're gonna get you that evidence.

21
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,427
We'll prove, once and for all,
what we can do.

22
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,138
We'll give 'em no choice.

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,182
They'll have to keep the program
and make us special agents.

24
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,853
Look, I believe in you,
but ifwe fail...

25
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,689
...we blow a case they've been
trying to crack for two years.

26
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,568
Hey, I'm nine inches tall.
I only see the upside.

27
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,088
Right this way, sir.

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,090
Thank you.

29
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,191
Tick tock, we're on the clock.
Speckles, do you copy?

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,614
Ten-four. I read you, Darwin.
Five-by-five.

31
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,199
All communication systems are online.

32
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,328
Status report.

33
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,126
I have a visual on Saber.

34
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,588
He's wearing a $6,000 suit,
$50,000 watch,

35
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,592
and, according to my infrared scope,
Hanes size 36 tighty whiteys.

36
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,804
Saber's about to start his speech.
Remember, the clock is ticking, dude.

37
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,141
Blaster, Juarez, what's your twenty?

38
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,894
Juarez here.
Approaching first objective.

39
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,522
We're ten seconds ahead of schedule
because Blaster is a little hyped-up.

40
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,776
Of course I am.
This is what I live for.

41
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,153
Time to get this party started.

42
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,076
- Talk to me, do we have any activity?
- Southbound is secure.

43
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,036
OK, we're clear.

44
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,748
Darwin, you're behind schedule.
You all right?

45
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,335
- First mission jitters, I guess.
- Do you want to abort?

46
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,254
No, no, it's OK.
I've been trained to do this.

47
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,925
I'd follow you
into a snarling pack of Dobermans!

48
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,219
Oh, wait. I already have.

49
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,388
Now, get your fuzzy hind end moving.

50
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,099
Hold on. There's a civilian
passing through the perimeter.

51
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,227
What are you looking at?
Move along, pal.

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,231
Don't worry. I just spotted my way in.

53
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,879
Juarez...

54
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,884
- Blaster, don't drop a pellet.
- Too late.

55
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,477
I'm cool.

56
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,813
Speckles to Mooch. Getting no visual.

57
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,897
Over.

58
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,535
The fly is in the ointment.
Darwin, do you copy?

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,912
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,041
Holy foxes.

61
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,877
- What's your twenty?
- I'm in the morgue.

62
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,393
Don't you wish your blowtorch
was hot like mine

63
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,814
Good thing I took shop.

64
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,614
Welcome to my home.

65
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,034
I want you to know how grateful I am
to all of you for, once again, making us

66
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,788
the number one consumer
electronics brand in the world!

67
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,207
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,503
These things are so popular,
I can't get one.

69
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,091
Mooch, focus. Come on, honey.

70
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,135
You're not here for the sweets.
Get back on mission.

71
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,472
For years,
we've been putting a secret...

72
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,976
...into the heart of every member
of the Saberling family,

73
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,440
be it the cryogenic refrigerator or
the new microwave-heated coffeemaker.

74
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:46,321
A secret which is at the core of
any successful family: communication.

75
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:58,083
- Hey, Juarez. Race you to the top!
- OK. On your mark, get set, go!

76
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,584
That's cold.

77
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,463
Darwin, the table's set. You are clear
to infiltrate Saber's study.

78
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,091
OK, I'm in.

79
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,056
Clearing exfil route.

80
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,934
- Hey, it worked!
- Of course it worked.

81
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:20,021
Nothing happens in this house
that I don't know about. Trust me.

82
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,110
In 48 hours, when I press this button,

83
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,865
it will activate a wireless system
we call "Sabersense,"

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,868
which will awaken the chips
already in the logic boards

85
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,995
of all Saberling appliances

86
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,707
allowing this coffee machine
to know how much coffee's been used,

87
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,837
communicate with your home computer,
and add coffee to your shopping list.

88
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,593
Now, in addition, Sabersense will link

89
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,638
every old and new Saberling
appliance in existence,

90
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:59,352
and create one big family!
And nothing will be the same.

91
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,275
Why did they put the Q
so far away from the O?

92
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,906
- OK, I'm in.
- Roger. I'm tracking it.

93
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,160
So what about it, Juarez?
You and me, I mean, you know...

94
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,622
Sorry, Blaster. You know
I've got my eye on someone else.

95
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,667
- No. In fact, I didn't know. Who?
- Darwin.

96
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,752
Why Darwin?

97
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,505
Because he's so...
so not interested in me.

98
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,924
Copy that, Juarez.

99
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,052
- Oh, shoot!
- Keep the comm line clear, please.

100
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,684
- OK, Speckles, I think I found it.
- Thank you, and good night.

101
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,562
Saber wrapped his speech.
Mooch, give me an eyeball.

102
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,901
Christa, I'm going upstairs for a drink.

103
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,694
Darwin, Saber's heading up.

104
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,364
ETA: about 50 seconds.

105
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,116
Copy that.
I'm into the Clusterstorm file.

106
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,040
- Speckles, are you seeing this?
- I see it.

107
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,128
This isn't about selling weapons.
It's about global extermination.

108
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm downloading now.

109
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,216
Whatjust happened?

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,510
Encryption. Hands off the keys.

111
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,887
- I'm setting up a worm to decipher.
- Mooch.

112
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,766
You have to stop Saber.
Execute delay strategy B.

113
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,119
I'm back in. Commencing download.

114
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,000
- Speckles, you're a genius!
- I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

115
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,048
Switching to wireless download.

116
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,218
Come on. Come on!

117
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,067
Darwin. Get out of there, now!

118
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,111
I can't.
The chimney will block the signal.

119
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,196
Come on, baby, come on.

120
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,657
If he doesn't make it,
are you free Thursday night?

121
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,075
He'll make it.

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,919
- OK, drop the line.
- Here we go.

123
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,306
Now, Blaster!

124
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,483
Ouch!

125
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,112
Darwin! Your butt's on fire!

126
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,281
Stop, drop and roll!

127
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,830
- We got it. Speckles, exfil.
- Way ahead of you.

128
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,918
I'll be waiting at the entrance
of the... Oh, no!

129
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,337
Oh, my God!

130
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,256
Speckles reports
a large canine at exfil.

131
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,051
No escape. Repeat: no escape.

132
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,970
Hang on, Speckles.
We leave no rodent behind.

133
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,397
- I'm going after the dog!
- Wait, Blaster! Think it through!

134
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,482
There's no time for thinking.

135
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,818
Juarez, Blaster's gonna need backup.

136
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,820
- Got it.
- I'll rescue Speckles.

137
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,282
Hey, meathead!

138
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,119
Oh, did you see that?

139
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,085
Let's go, old buddy.

140
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,966
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Heads up, boys!

141
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,053
Yeah, Juarez! You get him, girl!

142
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,932
We're out of here. Let's go.

143
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,893
Something spooked the dog.
Let's check it out.

144
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,645
Blaster, Juarez, exfil.

145
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:15,024
By the way, in case you missed it,
I just saved your fuzzy behind.

146
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,068
We should celebrate over dinner.

147
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,821
Hang on, Speckles.
We're going off-road.

148
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,999
Gas!

149
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,260
OK. We're clear.

150
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,180
That was a little heavy
on the smoke, Ben.

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,102
Yo, Juarez, did you catch the little
leg twitch at the end of my "death?"

152
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,522
That was acting, baby. I was feeling it!

153
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,817
Yes, amazing.
Tell me you are not part possum.

154
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,738
OK, you can laugh now, but some of
those people back there were crying.

155
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,615
It was like the end of Old Yeller.

156
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,286
Mooch! You made it. Good.
How'd it go in there, guys?

157
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,123
The game's over for Saber. It's all
there. Clusterstorm, everything.

158
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,083
Our training finally paid off.

159
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,878
I knew you could do this.
This is great.

160
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,214
- G-Force!
- G-Force?

161
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,092
I figured we need a name. Like,
you know, Green Berets or Navy SEALs.

162
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,178
Come on. G-Force!

163
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,223
- No.
- The pose is cute.

164
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,270
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah, it's getting there.

165
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,814
Good. Feds won't be able to
shut us down with this evidence.

166
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,902
Does this make me look fatter?

167
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,599
- No. I think you look nice.
- How much longer, Speckles?

168
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:48,685
Just a few more touches to decode
Saber's crypto-system.

169
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,062
To access the information
on Darwin's PDA,

170
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:55,275
I have to factor a univariate
polynomial over a finite field.

171
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,987
OK. Hey, do I look fat in this?
I haven't worn a jacket since the prom.

172
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,325
You look very... sharp.

173
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,001
"Because he's so not interested. "

174
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:18,757
- What does that mean?
- Men are like government bonds.

175
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,426
They take way too long to mature.

176
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,763
But if you're a woman
trying to make it in a man's world,

177
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:29,309
you have to learn to think
like they do and keep them guessing.

178
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,353
Candygram.

179
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,563
Juarez?

180
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,777
I heard over the wire
that you're interested.

181
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,779
I'm not interested.

182
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,614
That's not what you told Blaster.

183
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,784
Don't you get it?
I want him interested in me.

184
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,620
And he'll only be interested
if he thinks I'm not.

185
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,872
But you are interested?

186
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,124
- Of course.
- But not in me.

187
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,877
No, no, no. Because you know
you could have me,

188
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,796
which makes you not interested,

189
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,008
and that means I wouldn't be
interested in you even if I were.

190
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,599
OK, everybody, they're here.

191
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:13,853
G-Force, in your positions.
It's showtime.

192
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,314
Hello.

193
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,358
Director Killian?

194
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:21,403
I'm Ben.

195
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,906
Congratulations on becoming the
new task force director. That's neat.

196
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,408
Let's save the chitchat.

197
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:28,743
Time is money.

198
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,826
OK.

199
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,370
Many people don't know
that since the Civil War

200
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:34,705
animals have been used
to gather strategic intelligence.

201
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,291
Now, our work focuses on
developing communication

202
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:41,254
between humans and animals. Now, these
cockroaches right here have been trained

203
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,965
to carry microcameras
into surveillance zones,

204
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,510
which is, I think, really kind of neat.

205
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:51,681
Congratulations. Dr. Kendall, do you
mean to tell me that Homeland Security

206
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:54,684
is financing a roach motel?

207
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,605
This is a rodent.

208
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,651
Guinea pig, sir. Don't say that.
They get highly offended.

209
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:06,696
You know their DNA is 98.7 percent
identical to humans, right?

210
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,490
No. How would I know that?

211
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,369
So you'll notice the extremely developed
sense of motor skills.

212
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:16,372
That's because their brains
have close to a billion neurons,

213
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:17,623
and a trillion synapses.

214
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,459
That's a thousand times stronger
than any supercomputer.

215
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,129
It gives them exceptional, like,
eye-hand reflexes.

216
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:24,338
It's a video game.

217
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:28,217
Yeah. And there's something over here...
OK, we'll go over here.

218
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:30,553
You're really gonna be amazed by this.

219
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,472
It's a language decoder.

220
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:37,643
It enables animals to talk to humans.

221
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:41,439
Without it, they sound like
normal animals. Go ahead, take a look.

222
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:47,028
You're Doctor Dolittle.
You talk to animals.

223
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,529
Talking to animals is the easy part.

224
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:50,698
Getting them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

225
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:55,828
- Darwin! Juarez! Blaster!
- So these guys are special agents?

226
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:58,331
Yeah, just like we're gonna be.

227
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:03,210
- Hey, how you doing?
- That's impossible.

228
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:07,757
No, no, no. Finding something that
fits me off the rack, that's impossible.

229
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:11,093
Think that's something? Check out
Speckles. He's been decrypting the file.

230
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,721
- Who's Speckles?
- Our mole.

231
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,765
Star-nosed breed. Blind as a bat.

232
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,184
IQ off the charts.
He's lucky I found him.

233
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:21,020
- His family was exterminated.
- We're ready.

234
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,688
Last night, G-Force was able to get

235
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,024
some intelligence regarding
Project Clusterstorm.

236
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,109
You ran a mission
without my authorization?

237
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:29,779
Yes. We went to Saber's mansion and...

238
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:32,281
Wait a second, you broke into
Leonard Saber's house?

239
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:35,576
We accomplished in one night what
you guys couldn't do in two years.

240
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,912
And without a warrant. Holla.

241
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,081
Blaster, cool it.

242
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,545
I knew we were up for review, and I
wanted to show you what we could do.

243
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,756
All right, then show me.
What'd you get?

244
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,299
Speckles, you're on.

245
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,010
- Darwin's PDA contains classified...
- Just open it.

246
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,265
What is it?

247
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:04,313
- A cappuccino machine?
- What? That's not right.

248
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:08,317
I downloaded the Clusterstorm file,
not plans for a coffee machine.

249
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:13,322
- Right computer, wrong file.
- Darwin, what happened?

250
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,574
Specks, show them the Clusterstorm file.

251
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:18,285
Well, this is all we have. I'm sorry.

252
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,623
No, that's not it! It's about
global extermination. I saw it.

253
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:27,003
That's it, Kendall. Outside... now.

254
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:36,512
What a surprise.
The guinea pig mission didn't work out.

255
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,014
I'm shutting you down.

256
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:40,683
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, I can.

257
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,019
You performed an unauthorized infil,

258
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,646
compromised a two-year
undercover FBI operation,

259
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:48,024
and came out with the crucial intel
that Leonard Saber,

260
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:52,069
and stand by for this,
makes coffee machines.

261
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,156
This means we're in big trouble now.

262
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:56,949
¡Cállate ya!

263
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,909
You have to admit,
I've done some amazing things

264
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:00,870
as far as animal intelligence in there.

265
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:05,166
Thanks to you, those rodents can speak.
But sadly that means they're now capable

266
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,127
of exposing the derelict activities
committed on my watch.

267
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,211
- Yeah, but I...
- No!

268
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,047
I'm not gonna take the heat
for this, Kendall.

269
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,716
I'm not going down in Washington
as the crazy gopher guy.

270
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:18,387
Dr. Kendall's coming with me.
Cage anything that moves.

271
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:22,349
- Cage? Oh, no!
- What about my team here?

272
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:24,518
Here's an idea.

273
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:27,146
Since they're guinea pigs,
why don't we use them as guinea pigs?

274
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,148
- What?
- Oh, no.

275
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,984
Guys, we've got company.

276
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,173
We've got to get out of here.
The document capsules. Let's move.

277
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,009
- Vamos.
- Leave the gear behind.

278
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,344
All right, we're going native.
Lock and load.

279
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,804
I always wanted to say that.

280
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,014
Let's go.

281
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,351
Sorry, Speckles.
Talking animal, dead giveaway.

282
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,022
- No! No, not my glasses.
- In you go. Let's go.

283
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,982
No. No.

284
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,860
It's OK. I'll be right behind you.
Now, Marcie.

285
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,986
Good luck, team.

286
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,406
I love my job!

287
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,458
No! No!

288
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,712
Marcie, you tell Ben
the Clusterstorm file is on that PDA.

289
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,048
- And you tell him this isn't over.
- OK.

290
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,050
What we have here
is your classic case...

291
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,886
- Be quiet. I'll distract them.
- ... and overspending.

292
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,222
- Bye, guys. Have fun in the lab.
- Hey, hey!

293
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,142
- Would you put that down, please?
- Put it down.

294
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,563
It's not working. Come on. Come on.

295
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,693
- It's empty.
- Stealth hamsters.

296
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,320
A special coating on the fur.

297
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,906
Light bends around them.
Renders them invisible.

298
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,574
That is ridiculous.

299
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,327
We did see hamsters talk.

300
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,289
- Now, let me see now.
- Step aside.

301
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,042
What are you doing?
Why are you letting them out?

302
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,002
- What?
- Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

303
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,087
I don't see anything.

304
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,339
On the floor...
Be careful not to step on them.

305
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,264
- What was that?
- What was what?

306
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,850
There's no such thing
as a stealth hamster.

307
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,186
Be cool if there were, though.

308
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,029
Juarez, what's the situation?

309
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,948
FBI.

310
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,284
They got the whole lab surrounded.

311
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,538
I'll need to inspect your goods.

312
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,206
Let's go.

313
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,459
Yeah, 20 bags of Falfa Cravins.
Yes, I know.

314
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,132
- We can hide in here. Go, go, go!
- No, not the cage!

315
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,301
This facility's closed.
Get this delivery truck out of here.

316
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,555
- I don't do cages!
- Speckles, let go!

317
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,226
Great. Now we are locked in.

318
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,530
What do you think?
Is this the frying pan or the fire?

319
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,325
Let's all agree right now.
None of this goes on our résumé.

320
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,328
This is Killian.

321
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,666
We're locking the building down, sir,
but the animals have all bolted.

322
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,252
If those animals bolted,
then I got a problem.

323
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:22,173
I want them all back,
dead or alive, zero exposure.

324
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,092
- Three guinea pigs and a mole. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

325
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,148
I've never seen
such fat animals in my life.

326
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:43,611
Don't they have a gym around here?
A Jamba Juice or something?

327
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,279
Lay off the nuggets, man.

328
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,784
All right, my furry little friends.
Welcome to your new home.

329
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,329
Good luck getting out.

330
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,793
- G-Force!
- Why did you just do that?

331
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,878
I thought it might cheer us up.

332
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,215
You can'tjust blurt it out anytime.
It ruins the effect.

333
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,842
Guys, guys. Cool it.
The world's at stake.

334
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,344
We got to get out of here.

335
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,555
Then what? The Feds want to
turn us into guinea pigs.

336
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,557
They'll never take us seriously.

337
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,893
Well, we did get the wrong file.

338
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,021
No, I downloaded the right file,
and we're gonna prove it

339
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,731
as soon as we find a way out of here.

340
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,068
Well, let's ask that guy.
He looks cute and friendly.

341
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,654
Excuse me,
my incarcerated little friend.

342
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,656
- May I ask you a question?
- Don't move!

343
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,869
All I'm saying is, know your place,
behind this line. That's all I'm saying.

344
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,246
Is he talking to us?

345
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,874
Did someone order a knuckle sandwich?
Because I'm about to make a delivery.

346
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,044
Wow. You talk a lot of smack
for a little guy, buddy.

347
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,089
"Buddy?" No.
For your information, it's "Bucky. "

348
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,617
And if you want to stay alive,
do not cross that line!

349
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,538
Take cover!

350
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,250
The horror! The horror!

351
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,088
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning!

352
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,674
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a quarter ferret.

353
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:07,094
I have no ferret in me, Hurley.
That has never been proven.

354
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,387
Then why are you marked down?

355
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:11,765
I'm on sale!
Everyone goes on sale eventually.

356
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,686
This should come as no surprise, but
he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.

357
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,315
- Mice are on sale. Everybody's on sale.
- Enough with the line already.

358
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,859
We agreed this was my zone.
We all agreed that, right?

359
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,904
- Right.
- The mice will agree to anything.

360
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:27,281
- You guys are all idiots, right?
- Right!

361
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,366
Oh, yeah? Fine!

362
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,455
- Yeah, he's very sensitive.
- Not a ferret!

363
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:39,335
- Welcome, my friends, to the family.
- Where is the bathroom?

364
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,337
Well, for me, this morning,

365
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:44,048
the sports page, which is
pretty much where you're standing.

366
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:46,383
- Nasty!
- Look, don't worry.

367
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,220
They put down newspaper every day,
there's plenty to read.

368
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:51,388
We don't have time for this.

369
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:55,726
- Locate escape options.
- OK, here we go. Stand back!

370
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,855
- I'm gonna break the glass.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

371
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,735
This might be a good time for a nap.

372
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,864
OK. The truth is my grandmother met
a ferret at the San Diego petting zoo,

373
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:11,075
but nothing happened.
They simply dated.

374
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,410
My papers say hamster, end of story.

375
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,412
Now stop looking at the line!

376
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,581
Darwin, please let me
pull his tongue out.

377
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,917
Negative. Nobody touches the ferret.

378
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,043
I am not a ferret!

379
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,296
You try to pull my tongue out,
you'll see what happens...

380
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:25,756
Let's check that lock.

381
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,716
G-Force, Delta formation.

382
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,412
You guys from the circus or something?

383
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,165
- The circus!
- I hate the circus.

384
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:44,833
No, we're not from the circus.

385
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,543
We're specially bred,
genetically altered,

386
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,214
- and highly trained secret agents.
- Known as G-Force!

387
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,717
I get it. You guys are transfers
from the Hollywood store.

388
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,052
Darwin, it's locked.

389
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,931
We need another way out.

390
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,186
Mooch!
Go find Ben and report our location.

391
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,356
Clusterstorm launch is in... 29 hours.

392
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,899
Wait. Who's Mooch?

393
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,986
- The fly.
- Oh, man. Talking to the flies.

394
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,196
And I thought the ferret was crazy.

395
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:36,950
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:38,494
What happened in there?

397
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:40,996
Well, I told them
we shouldn't be shut down.

398
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,457
And then I got to the bit
where I talk to guinea pigs,

399
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,627
- and then that's where I lost 'em.
- Darwin told me, before he left,

400
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,837
that he was positive
he downloaded the right file.

401
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:50,339
Where is the PDA?

402
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:53,383
- It's still back at the warehouse.
- Well, we gotta go get it.

403
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:55,886
Security's probably
crawling all over the place.

404
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,431
- That's all right. I've got an idea.
- OK, what do we do about the G-Force?

405
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:02,768
They're highly professional. They're
probably halfway back to my house.

406
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:04,645
Now, Hurley.

407
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:11,693
Blaster, why don't you
leave the tactics to me?

408
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:16,990
- OK. No problem.
- So, Farty, how do you get adopted?

409
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:20,955
It's pretty simple. Act cute,
kid picks you out, takes you home,

410
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,166
and bingo, you're part of the family.

411
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,794
Except that, well, they never pick me.

412
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:28,296
Incoming.

413
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:34,886
Huddle up. OK, bring it in.

414
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,763
First, we get adopted. Then we escape.

415
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:40,475
Ben's house is the rendezvous point.
Now, go act cute.

416
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,895
Who's acting?

417
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:48,191
Check it out. I'm chasing my butt.
How cute is that?

418
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:52,862
- Come on, Specks. You, too. Act cute.
- I don't have that kind of range.

419
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:56,741
Grandpa, what is that?

420
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,327
That's a hideous crime
against nature, I'd say.

421
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:01,830
I'm outta here.

422
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,708
- What can I help you with, young lady?
- I want a hamster.

423
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:11,589
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

424
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:15,677
- Her. With the big cheeks.
- What?

425
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,680
- I could put bows in her hair.
- What?

426
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,474
I'm the hamster. They're guinea pigs!

427
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,438
- Watch the hands, buddy.
- One oversized hamster. There you go.

428
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:30,275
You try to put a bow on me,
you're gonna lose a finger.

429
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,111
That little girl
has no idea what she's in for!

430
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:38,283
I'm gonna put nail polish
and lipstick on her and a dress.

431
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,119
A dress?
You're going to lose your whole hand.

432
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,620
Juarez, remember.

433
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:46,207
I know. Maintain my cover
until I have a chance to escape.

434
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,627
What about that little fur ball there?
He looks like he's full of life.

435
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:53,839
- No, no. Give me the fat one.
- I'm not fat. I'm fluffy.

436
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:56,800
Even if you forget to feed this guy
every now and then,

437
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,093
it wouldn't bother him.

438
00:28:58,178 --> 00:29:01,722
- He's a little plump as it is.
- That's probably a good thing.

439
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,935
Oh, mama! This is it. This is it!

440
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,437
- What do these fellas eat?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

441
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:11,148
- Come on, Penny.
- See you on the outside!

442
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:15,861
Hey, guys, I can see my future!
It's all cakes and cuddles!

443
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,450
I think he's gonna
throw him in with the snake.

444
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,094
Make way. Hamster coming through.

445
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:51,230
You're lucky I'm not in there,
snake boy,

446
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:53,440
because it would've been
lights out for you!

447
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,527
I would've hit you so hard
you would have shed yourself.

448
00:29:56,611 --> 00:30:00,281
Then I would have turned you
into a nice pair of snakeskin boots.

449
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,242
That kid's a monster.
He just lifted him up and...

450
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,538
- Come on, kid.
- Blaster, do something.

451
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:11,041
- What do you suggest I do?
- Poop in his hand. Poop in his hand.

452
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:13,294
Hey, Grandpa, changed my mind.

453
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,172
Oh, no, no, not upside down,
not upside down. Hold him like this.

454
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,717
Where did...
Where did the chubby one go?

455
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:20,884
I don't know.

456
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:25,389
All right, Specks. We have to think
of a way out of here.

457
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,933
There you are.

458
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:33,605
I knew you were trouble.
I can see it in your eyes.

459
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,400
At 0920 local time,

460
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:39,903
Saber initiated a call to the usual
recipient, Mr. Yanshu, in Beijing.

461
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:43,365
He left a message saying the launch
was on track for Project Clusterstorm.

462
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,575
Since then, nothing.

463
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,577
Kip, our FISA tap just isn't cutting it.

464
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,663
Sir, with respect, if you were
to authorize a search warrant...

465
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:50,873
On what grounds?

466
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:54,251
I can't authorize a search warrant
without probable cause, and he knows it.

467
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,086
Saber comes from
the defence supply industry.

468
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:58,130
- He knows how to cover his tracks.
- Sir...

469
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:02,426
Just give me cause,
and I can authorize. Keep listening.

470
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:06,346
- We are listening, sir.
- Son, listen harder.

471
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,436
Careful.

472
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:16,481
- Come here.
- No, porfavor.

473
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:20,027
No, not pink. And it stinks!

474
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:22,946
This has to be against
the Geneva Convention.

475
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:27,451
Where is Blaster?
We have to get out of here.

476
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,078
I think you need lipstick, too.

477
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:33,332
The tiara.

478
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,002
Enough already.
This is the tenth outfit.

479
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,004
Don't you look pretty?

480
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:44,384
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

481
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:50,265
Let me do this, Specks.
I'll come back and get you.

482
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,934
Relax. They told me
one of the mice died last week,

483
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,644
and was buried in the backyard.

484
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:58,106
Once I'm in the ground,
I can tunnel to freedom and rescue you.

485
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,571
Terrell! Oh, man.

486
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:11,870
- Terrell!
- Mamacita, relax.

487
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:14,289
Está muerto.

488
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,832
It's dead.

489
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:20,629
- Yeah, you're right. It is.
- Do something.

490
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:23,006
Wow. This woman's really abrasive.

491
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:27,344
You get it out of here before
it starts to smell up my shop. Hurry up.

492
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:31,306
- Just run, take it out back right now.
- I am. It's squishy.

493
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:37,562
Trash truck.
Let's just get it on out of here pronto.

494
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,941
That's not the plan.
No, no, no. Speckles, no!

495
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,236
Hold it.
Good luck, rest in peace and all that.

496
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:47,155
Oh, no!

497
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,325
Oh, my God!

498
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,204
No, no, no.

499
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,711
- Is this OK?
- Yeah, this is good.

500
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,297
OK, Harry.

501
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,219
You know what to do.

502
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,502
- She was way cuter than the other one.
- Definitely.

503
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,199
OK, he's got it. He's got the PDA.

504
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,121
What the hell was that?!

505
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,333
OK, I got him. I got him.

506
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,128
- Let's go. Just stay calm, OK?
- I got him. Here he is.

507
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,632
Look on the bright side: at least
you haven't been marked down yet.

508
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,092
What's that on your butt?

509
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,679
It's a birthmark.
Never seen a birthmark?

510
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:21,558
I have seen that birthmark.
Look at this. I got the same one.

511
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,727
Don't point that thing at me.
It might go off.

512
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:29,065
Seriously, just look at my butt.
You see? You see? We must be related.

513
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,069
No. I am a genetically
engineered super spy.

514
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,948
Ben spent years training us. We do
things that people only dream of doing.

515
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,493
Yeah. That's what they want you
to think. So you'll do tricks for them.

516
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,913
But you, my friend,
are a common, everyday

517
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:47,083
pet shop guinea pig just like me.
We must have been separated at birth.

518
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,921
But fate has brought us back together,
my brother.

519
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,672
- Don't say that.
- I have a brother.

520
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,675
- Don't say that word.
- I have a brother! Come here, brother.

521
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,052
Come here, brother.

522
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,389
All right. My brother doesn't like hugs.
I'm good with that.

523
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,475
I am not your brother.

524
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,436
Listen. Darwin,
I'm not gonna dress it up, OK?

525
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,523
I sit here every day
hoping to get adopted, to find family.

526
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:15,403
And now, because of you,
family has found me.

527
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,823
Hurley, there is no way
that we are related,

528
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,368
so just get that
through your head, OK?

529
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,876
OK. Here we go.

530
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,507
Darwin was right.
The file was marked "Clusterstorm. "

531
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,093
- Can you open this?
- I don't know.

532
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,222
OK, well, we've already seen that.

533
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,768
OK, just unplug the computer.
Unplug. Go, go, go.

534
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,648
- Was that a worm?
- Nope.

535
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,901
This PDA is infected
with an extermination virus.

536
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,196
Yes!

537
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,241
What is going on in there?

538
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,496
No, no, no! Not the line, not the line.
Don't cross the line.

539
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,086
Busted.

540
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,174
Can I offer you something?
A macadamia nut perhaps?

541
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,722
So, this is why I never saw you eat.
Not once in all these years.

542
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,932
All these treats and you never shared?

543
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,436
You think I wanted to spend my nights
sneaking out to feed myself?

544
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,521
Starving by day and
praying for night to come

545
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:34,607
so I could take a bite without the
threat of you eating everything I have?

546
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,359
You drove me to this!

547
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:46,244
My friend Speckles
got crushed in a garbage truck,

548
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:48,413
and you said nothing about this.

549
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,628
I'm outta here.

550
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,339
- Darwin? I want you to go.
- I am going.

551
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,510
You can't worry about me. You got a job
to do. You can'tjeopardize it for me.

552
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,637
- I wasn't going to.
- You're only saying that

553
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,223
so I won't have to feel the pain so bad
when you leave.

554
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,058
Keep believing that.
Whatever works for you.

555
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,894
Oh, what a guy. What a guy!

556
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,646
- OK, OK. Listen, Hurley.
- You got to go, man.

557
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,815
- I got to go. You got to let go.
- You got to go.

558
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,692
- I've got to let go.
- Let go of me.

559
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,152
- OK.
- OK.

560
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,904
Don't give up the dream.

561
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,157
You're gonna find the family
you're looking for someday.

562
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,492
So long.

563
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,748
So long, brother!

564
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,626
I miss him already.

565
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:44,260
Good luck with the climb back up,
Hurley! The cage is mine!

566
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,347
And it's all true.
My grandfather was a ferret!

567
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,017
Now who's been marked down?

568
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,942
So, there's the North Star,
which means Ben's is east.

569
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,820
OK, I need to head that way.

570
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,864
Go back, Hurley.

571
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,953
Fine!
You think I can't make it out here?

572
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,914
You think you're the only one
who can survive in the big bad world?

573
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:17,460
Well, the truth is, Hurley is out of
his cage, and it's time to hit the town!

574
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,712
Guinea pigs gone wild!

575
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,589
Yeah!

576
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,177
Darwin!

577
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,973
Darwin? I saw a cat.

578
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,476
OK, you can come with me
until we find another pet shop.

579
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,521
Thanks, bro. Did I mention
I'm also afraid of the dark?

580
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,082
Greetings, Mr. Saber.
I have a status report.

581
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:59,502
You are a brilliant business partner,
Mr. Yanshu.

582
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,756
But remind me why we call these things
video conferences.

583
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:09,345
As we've discussed, it's in everyone's
best interest my identity remain hidden.

584
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,349
Project Clusterstorm
is perfectly on course, sir.

585
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,811
Sabersense will activate
in about 19 hours.

586
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:21,107
Why are we spending a large amount
of money tracking space junk?

587
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,568
Old satellites. Booster rockets.

588
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,113
Four million pounds of debris.
And why do we care?

589
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:30,533
The satellites, sir.
Communication systems.

590
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:35,163
We have to protect them. Integral aspect
of the Sabersense network.

591
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,999
We've got a lot riding on this, Yanshu.

592
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,211
I've put my trust
in your engineering skills.

593
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,775
- Mooch, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah!

594
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,569
Are the others OK?

595
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,821
- You know where they are?
- Yeah!

596
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,785
You want help with that?

597
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:20,500
E... I... i...

598
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,834
...a...

599
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,129
Oh, yeah.

600
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,260
Oh, Mooch... You're a genius.

601
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,931
I was so worried about you.
I don't like when my fly is down.

602
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,019
Hey, Marcie?
Yeah, it's Ben. I found them.

603
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,563
I'll be by in ten minutes
to pick you up.

604
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,194
There's the delivery truck from the lab.

605
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:50,571
¿Cómo estás, gentlemen?

606
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,074
We're looking for some rodents.

607
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,413
Si, for you or for your children?

608
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,456
For the government.

609
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:03,376
- We're special agents.
- What? Yeah, right.

610
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,837
Are they fugitives
or terrorists or something?

611
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,547
Just answer the question.

612
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:17,390
OK, sorry. I'm just saying, you look
like a regular guinea pig to me.

613
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,436
Listen, I told you, I'm a commando
who just happens to be a guinea pig.

614
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,813
Oh, yeah?
So where's all your fancy spy gear?

615
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,315
Back at the lab.

616
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,569
Same lab where I keep
my hot Canadian guinea pig girlfriend?

617
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,487
That's where my stuff is, too.

618
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,157
I have a unicorn back there
and a dragon that I ride around.

619
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,785
Look, if you want to stick with me,
stop with the yapping and keep up.

620
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,413
No can do, bro.
I'm calling a hunger strike.

621
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,958
And I am not moving an inch.

622
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,636
Civilians. Come on, soggy.

623
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,734
I'm hungry, I'm wet, I'm hungry...

624
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,404
Dogs!

625
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,454
Dogs. Why does it always
have to be dogs?

626
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,874
All right, MacGyver,
you got any brilliant ideas?

627
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,629
Yeah, I got an idea.

628
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,724
- I think we made it.
- Great. How do we stop it?

629
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,892
Just keep running.

630
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,436
That's not how you stop it!
That's how you make it go!

631
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,073
- Hurley, get your butt outta my face.
- Get your face outta my butt!

632
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,000
So this is what spies do.

633
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,674
¿Cómo estás, chica?

634
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,843
We're looking for
three guinea pigs and a mole.

635
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,680
Same one as the Feds,
or are yours from a rival militia?

636
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,098
Wait, what Feds?

637
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,600
Men in Black were here
looking for the same thing.

638
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,477
Wanted to know who had bought them.

639
00:43:27,437 --> 00:43:28,729
And did you tell them?

640
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,858
No, I refused and we shot it out.
What do you think? It's the Feds!

641
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,028
Thank you.

642
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,825
Mine! The cage is mine!

643
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,546
This is gonna be awesome.

644
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,217
I'm pretty sure this is
animal cruelty, but I love it!

645
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:03,222
Yeah!

646
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,059
This wheel doesn't work!

647
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,229
Strike!

648
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,737
- Is that all you got?
- Ready to go for the record?

649
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,618
Maybe this would be a good time
for you to take your medication!

650
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,289
I feel the need... the need for speed!

651
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,755
Say cheese!

652
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:44,138
Excuse me! Coming through!

653
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,769
- Yeah!
- Yes!

654
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,190
- That was off the hizz-ook!
- Connor! Take out the trash.

655
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,942
OK.

656
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,361
- Now!
- I'm coming!

657
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,323
What do we have here?

658
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,285
You, my friend, suck.

659
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,831
I'm coming for you, Juarez.

660
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,884
That's what I'm talking about!

661
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,595
Time for a joyride.

662
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,430
Yeah!

663
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,683
Get out the road, fool!

664
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,893
- Hey!
- Don't become roadkill!

665
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,478
I ain't used to driving stick!

666
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,151
- Not this time!
- Stop it. Stop it! Come back!

667
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,988
I'll come back when you're older
and put you in prison!

668
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,906
- Get over here!
- Don't go anywhere.

669
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,075
- I'll be right back.
- Finally!

670
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,540
- Juarez, Juarez! Where are you?
- Connor, get him!

671
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,500
I have to save his fur again?

672
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,173
Juarez?

673
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,803
Juarez!

674
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,973
Yeah!

675
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,064
I got you!

676
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,442
Why are you dressed like
"Guinea Pig Barbie?"

677
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,111
One more word and I'll turn you
into a small side of bacon.

678
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:23,779
Well, you are sizzling hot!

679
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,032
Connor!

680
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,159
Get this off of me!

681
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:37,543
Don't need that, or that, or that!

682
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,090
- Although, maybe this can stay.
- Juarez, you are fine china!

683
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,474
What exactly are we doing, anyway?

684
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:56,604
Two days ago, my team embarked on a
mission. Today, I'm gonna finish it.

685
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,649
My brother's a loon!
I love him, but he's...

686
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:05,112
Cake! Did I tell you I love cake?
I've heard of places like this!

687
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,573
They sell something called "layer cake!"

688
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,493
It's notjust one cake,
it's many, in layers!

689
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:15,122
Often up to six!
It is the Holy Grail of human food!

690
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:19,126
I can't believe you're getting
so excited about cake. Coffeemaker!

691
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,052
That's the same coffeemaker
that was on the Clusterstorm file.

692
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,389
Hurley, I got to check out
that coffeemaker. Stay close.

693
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,685
Fifty billion rodents in the world,
and I get stuck with this guy.

694
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,530
I hope you're keeping track
of all these parts.

695
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,156
Don't watch me. Watch my back.

696
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,160
Right now, you're my eyes and ears.
Just act natural.

697
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,830
- OK. Sure.
- Look, Daddy!

698
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,211
Hi, there. Hi.

699
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:06,132
- That wasn't very convincing.
- Hurley, do you know what this is?

700
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,217
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's called vandalism.

701
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,845
This is a military grade,
multiple array transceiver

702
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,514
developed for the military's
Unmanned Weapons Program.

703
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:15,850
Sorry, I tuned out there.
What were you saying?

704
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,935
I gotta get this chip back to Ben's.

705
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,524
OK, that's weird.

706
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,363
Hurley, duck!

707
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,283
Stay down!

708
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,085
I've heard coffee's bad for you,
but this is ridiculous!

709
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,462
Come on, move it!

710
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,843
- Why are we stopping?
- We're gonna fight it.

711
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,428
We're gonna do what?

712
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,389
We have to get that chip.

713
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,436
Good luck with that!

714
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,406
- Suck in your gut!
- I am!

715
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,286
Darwin!

716
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,621
Hang on, Hurley!

717
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,082
Yippee-ki-yay, coffeemaker!

718
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,506
Watch out, bro!

719
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:40,476
You want some of this,
you overgrown can opener?

720
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,316
Don't think the warranty
is gonna cover that.

721
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,611
Oh, brother. I thought I lost you there.

722
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:52,821
OK, thanks Hurley! Boundaries!

723
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,492
Talk about a killer cappuccino.
What is this thing?

724
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,702
This is Clusterstorm.

725
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,831
Saber must be weaponizing
his entire line of appliances.

726
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,542
We have to get this back to Ben's.

727
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,752
How are we gonna do that?

728
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:18,597
Hey, bro? You have to admit,
we make a pretty sweet team.

729
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,517
I could get used to all this
secret agent stuff

730
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,644
if you're ever looking
for a new recruit.

731
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,022
Hurley, just be quiet and lean right.

732
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,942
Look who I found out back.

733
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,862
- Blaster! Juarez!
- Darwin! You made it.

734
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,907
- Hurley, what are you doing here?
- Hey, guys!

735
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,995
Hurley, up high. Down low. Too slow.

736
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,163
Wait a minute. Where's Speckles?

737
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,168
Speckles didn't make it.

738
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,130
- What do you mean, he didn't make it?
- He was gonna break out

739
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,133
and engineer our escape,
but then the mission went bad.

740
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,304
He got crushed in a garbage truck.

741
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,350
- Speckles. Jeez.
- He sacrificed himself for us.

742
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,603
This is all my fault.

743
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,480
Ben, there's nothing you could've done.

744
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,986
No, I could've told you the truth
ofwho you really are.

745
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,198
Darwin, I misled you.

746
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,411
The truth is,
you're not genetically engineered.

747
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,371
Any of you.

748
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,125
I should've never... should've never
sent you out into the field. It's...

749
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:33,422
So we are not special at all?

750
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,884
No engineering? No enhancements?

751
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,013
We're just common, ordinary rodents?

752
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,099
I wanted you guys to think of yourselves
as more than just balls of fur

753
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,643
waiting for your next pellet.

754
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,021
Well, maybe you can
explain that to Speckles.

755
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,526
Ben, we need to know.
Tell us who we are.

756
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,779
OK, you guys want to know?

757
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:01,867
Juarez, we rescued you at a
roadside tapas stand in the Pyrenees.

758
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:04,912
I guess there you're some kind of,
you know, delicacy.

759
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,666
Blaster, we found you
at a cosmetics company.

760
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,961
They were testing, you know, some kind
of hair gel for allergic reactions.

761
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,589
And Speckles we found...

762
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,677
...you know, right before his
home was dug out to build a golf course.

763
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,388
And, Darwin, I...

764
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:26,642
I purchased you at a pet store.

765
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:31,563
Your parents abandoned you
because you were the runt of the litter.

766
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,359
I was a runt? What do you mean?

767
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,572
I never even had a chance.

768
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,311
This is Carter.

769
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,523
OK, we're on it.

770
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:54,985
Dispatch just got a report of two giant
hamsters riding a skateboard on Pacific.

771
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,987
Let's finish this.

772
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:05,788
You were right all along. I am just an
average, everyday pet store guinea pig.

773
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:09,583
Since when did you
start listening to me?

774
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,253
My parents didn't even want me.

775
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:17,258
Look, Darwin, you saved us from
the dogs, you defeated the Terminator,

776
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:19,760
read the stars like a map
and got us here.

777
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:21,720
I couldn't have done any of that.

778
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:25,683
Do you have any idea how many guinea
pigs could've done all those things?

779
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:29,603
I mean, literally, like three.
And they're all in this room.

780
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:36,443
Yeah, you're right.

781
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:40,447
I may not be genetically engineered,
but I'm no house pet, either.

782
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:45,119
Hey team, come over here. Listen up.
What Ben did was right.

783
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:49,248
He wanted us to believe in ourselves.
And we did believe.

784
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,002
We still have our training,
our abilities.

785
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:55,880
Blaster, you're a graduate
of West Point.

786
00:53:56,548 --> 00:53:58,966
Yeah, correspondence course.

787
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,761
Yeah, whatever. And Juarez, how many
hours have you put in on that simulator?

788
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:05,723
Two hundred... thousand.

789
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:08,267
I helped with the tire!

790
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:14,148
We may be guinea pigs,
but we're not ordinary. We're special.

791
00:54:14,232 --> 00:54:18,319
I still believe in us,
even if nobody else does.

792
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:24,283
I believe.

793
00:54:29,414 --> 00:54:30,831
I've always believed.

794
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:35,419
Ben, we don't have much time.
That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.

795
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:43,010
When I tried to disconnect this chip,
it came alive and it attacked us.

796
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:46,138
It was so gnarly!

797
00:54:46,222 --> 00:54:49,308
If I hadn't been there to take
cover fire for Darwin, who knows...

798
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:53,437
The Sabersense microchip
caused it to transform.

799
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:56,982
Ben, Sabersense and Clusterstorm
are the same thing.

800
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:59,902
And if every Saber product
in the world has that chip,

801
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:03,530
that means that every appliance on Earth
is gonna be a killing machine.

802
00:55:04,074 --> 00:55:05,199
Guys...

803
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:10,537
Sabersense launches in... 30 minutes.

804
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:13,123
I tried to access the
Clusterstorm file on your PDA,

805
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,542
but Saber, he protected it
with some nasty virus.

806
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:17,795
I mean, I'm a little bit at a loss.

807
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:22,549
Sorry to interrupt. Quick question.

808
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:25,552
If that little thingamabob
is all that, like you say it is,

809
00:55:25,637 --> 00:55:28,180
why don't you just use that
to destroy Saber's mainframe?

810
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:34,061
I'll go back in the box. Oh, pepperoni!

811
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:37,606
- That could work. That could work!
- OK, let's do this!

812
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:40,526
Wait a second.
We don't have our equipment.

813
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,153
Well, that's not entirely true.

814
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:51,996
This is a little prototype
I've been working on

815
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,707
called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle.

816
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,376
She'll do 65
with the throttle wide open.

817
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,965
And, Blaster, it has a rocking stereo.

818
00:56:04,134 --> 00:56:07,886
That's what's up! Pimp my ride!

819
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:10,931
All right, we got gear.
And we know our mission.

820
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:14,560
Infiltrate Saber's mansion,
locate the main network core

821
00:56:14,644 --> 00:56:16,603
and dock this infected PDA.

822
00:56:16,688 --> 00:56:20,024
Bring down big mama with baby disease.

823
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:22,985
I don't know what that means.
But, yeah, that's good.

824
00:56:24,362 --> 00:56:25,696
Here are the keys.

825
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:32,494
- Don't scratch it.
- All right. This is for Speckles.

826
00:56:35,915 --> 00:56:38,961
Dr. Kendall, we know you're in there!
Open the door!

827
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:42,089
Everybody, into the RDV!
You, too, Hurley. Move it!

828
00:56:42,174 --> 00:56:43,174
Shotgun!

829
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:48,262
Open the door, or we'll open it for you!

830
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,063
Hold on.

831
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,482
Don't these fools
know we're on the same team?

832
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:02,360
- Juarez, plot us a course to Saber's.
- I'm on it.

833
00:57:05,864 --> 00:57:08,991
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

834
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:11,160
Mooch, we need eyes in the sky.

835
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,333
Call for backup.

836
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,711
Tell them we're in pursuit of three
guinea pigs driving mobile spheres.

837
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:21,796
OK!

838
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,550
Actually, could you make that call?

839
00:57:27,261 --> 00:57:29,846
My stomach doesn't do well
with action-adventure.

840
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,681
Hurley, don't you dare.

841
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:35,142
Yuck, Hurley. That's disgusting.

842
00:57:35,227 --> 00:57:37,270
- I can't breathe.
- Roll down the window.

843
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,482
- These things don't have windows!
- That's real professional, guys.

844
00:57:44,903 --> 00:57:46,654
Mooch, where's that recon?

845
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:54,036
- OK, here come the bad guys.
- Better have their "A" game.

846
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:00,376
- Yeah!
- Mommy!

847
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,378
Where's that backup?

848
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:09,552
- May I ask why we're chasing rodents?
- No, you may not.

849
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,849
OK, you can just
let me out at the next corner.

850
00:58:18,312 --> 00:58:20,646
We got three party crashers on our tail.

851
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:25,067
- Hurry up! You're losing them!
- They're boxing us in!

852
00:58:25,152 --> 00:58:28,362
- Yeah, I got 'em, I got 'em.
- Maybe they want to adopt us!

853
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:31,240
Not likely, Hurley. Hold on, guys!

854
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:34,076
- Let's just crush 'em!
- Unlock it and rock it. Now!

855
00:58:36,163 --> 00:58:38,915
- Time to divide and conquer.
- See ya!

856
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,382
- Oh, yeah! Come and get me!
- Where'd he go?

857
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:51,302
- How low can you go?
- There he goes! Under the trailer!

858
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:52,678
Little is the new big!

859
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,393
Bye-bye, bipeds! Smell you later!

860
00:58:59,478 --> 00:59:02,480
- I want to go back to the pet store!
- You might want to buckle up.

861
00:59:08,737 --> 00:59:11,364
He paid for undercoating.
What a sucker!

862
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,033
Let's see if it protects him from this.

863
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:18,329
- Hey, what's that?
- This is my little friend.

864
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:22,667
- Say hello.
- Hello!

865
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,669
And goodbye!

866
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:28,047
Better hang on to your lunch!

867
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,439
Did we win?

868
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:49,986
This is Unit Two. We lost them.

869
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,948
How? You're driving a V-8. They're
rolling around in little plastic balls.

870
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:56,075
This one's not getting away from me!

871
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:00,204
Darwin, I need some help here.

872
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,707
Mooch, I need a visual on Juarez.

873
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:09,338
- I can't get these guys off my tail.
- We don't have tails.

874
01:00:09,423 --> 01:00:14,301
Hang on, Juarez. Hurley, we're
going to the fair. Blaster, hard right.

875
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:17,096
All right, Juarez.
Let's take it to the house!

876
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:24,270
OK, I'm taking the lead.

877
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:31,360
- You're scaring me!
- Shut it, Carter!

878
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,864
Here's that box of M-80s.
Careful with these.

879
01:00:34,948 --> 01:00:37,783
- You're driving angry!
- Yes, I am!

880
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:42,872
Come here, you little rodent.

881
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:45,541
Carl, look out! Look out!

882
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:48,294
Let's let 'em go,
let's let 'em go! Look out!

883
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:59,555
- This is so festive!
- This is crazy. This is crazy!

884
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,223
These are good seats!

885
01:01:01,308 --> 01:01:03,392
I'm gonna flatten this little varmint!

886
01:01:03,477 --> 01:01:06,228
Mess with the bull, you get the horns.

887
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:09,315
Look out! Look out!

888
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,249
How you doing?

889
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:31,504
Don't try this at home, kids!

890
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:37,510
That was great! Let's do it again.

891
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:45,517
Face it, Trigstad.
You just got out-driven by gophers.

892
01:01:54,903 --> 01:01:58,280
- Guys, I'm going in.
- Hurley, suck in your gut.

893
01:01:58,365 --> 01:02:00,783
Blaster, I need to
tell you something about Juarez.

894
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:03,452
You have nothing to worry about.
She's not interested in me.

895
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:06,247
- She told you that?
- Yeah. She really wants you...

896
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:09,625
She's trying to make you more interested
in her by acting disinterested.

897
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:11,961
Yeah, well maybe
she told you she wants me

898
01:02:12,045 --> 01:02:16,298
in order to look not interested in you,
which makes you more interested in her.

899
01:02:16,383 --> 01:02:17,675
Interesting.

900
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:25,724
Members of the Saberling inner sanctum,
my co-conspirators in this endeavour,

901
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:28,602
are we ready to dominate?

902
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:33,065
Are we ready to change the world?

903
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:38,487
- Go, go, go, go!
- Geronimo!

904
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:45,160
Hurley, this is our exfil. It's very
important that you stand guard.

905
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:48,372
Whatever you do, don't leave this spot.
We're counting on you.

906
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:50,207
OK, OK. Got it.

907
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:52,459
Hey, does this mean
I'm part of the team?

908
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,755
There's the network core.
Behind the glass.

909
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,301
Look! We can gain access
through that panel.

910
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:02,428
OK, follow me.

911
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,056
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

912
01:03:06,141 --> 01:03:07,516
It's a tripwire.

913
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:11,437
It's a booby trap.
Don't touch it, or this place'll blow.

914
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:14,565
Tick, tick, boom.

915
01:03:27,662 --> 01:03:30,331
I don't think anybody'll mind
if I check the perimeter.

916
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:34,376
As I press this button,

917
01:03:34,461 --> 01:03:37,963
we move forward
to a brave new world order

918
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:41,550
owned and operated by Saberling.

919
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:00,569
We're too late.

920
01:04:00,653 --> 01:04:04,365
We can still stop it ifwe download the
virus into Saber's computer. Let's go.

921
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:07,993
Cherries.

922
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:20,839
Cake! Oh, you're so beautiful!

923
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:24,927
Oh, come to Papa!

924
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:52,554
It's all Saber, sir.
Is this enough probable cause?

925
01:04:55,432 --> 01:04:57,934
Eyewitnesses report
common household appliances

926
01:04:58,018 --> 01:05:01,729
- coming to life and chasing people...
- Those are Saberling appliances!

927
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,774
But they're just supposed to
communicate with each other.

928
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:17,036
- Bravo, Echo! Go! Go!
- Spread out!

929
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,540
What is that thing?

930
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,127
It's heading for the tripwire.

931
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,549
- It's got Hurley!
- Oh, hey guys!

932
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:33,178
- What's it doing?
- Peppers. Casserole.

933
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,305
It's trying to figure out
how long to cook him.

934
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,807
Cook me? Get me out of here!

935
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:42,562
- Move it, Blaster!
- I don't want to be an appetizer!

936
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:44,689
- We got to save him!
- Get me out!

937
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,233
Let's go to Plan B!

938
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,569
- Blaster, immobilize that thing!
- I'm on it!

939
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:52,697
- Don't let it hit the tripwire!
- I want to go home!

940
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:58,745
Soup. Eggs. Beef.

941
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:02,582
- Oh, man! It's packing a toaster!
- Broccoli.

942
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,002
All teams, go, go!

943
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:11,216
Why is this happening?

944
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:14,135
This wasn't the plan!

945
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,846
- Saber, what's going on?
- Get us out of here!

946
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,974
Take Saber down to the command truck!

947
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,811
Bacon. Carrot. Soup.

948
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,814
- Hurley, don't be scared.
- I'm not a chicken.

949
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,650
Chicken. Match.

950
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,071
Not even close!

951
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:40,036
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a little piece of cake!

952
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,833
- Didn't drop the cake.
- Hurley, let's go!

953
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,295
Hunk ofjunk!

954
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,257
It's gonna hit the tripwire!

955
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,932
- Run for cover!
- Darwin, jump!

956
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,142
No!

957
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,837
Are you OK? We can't get through.

958
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,880
I'm all right. I'm gonna keep going.

959
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,008
Not without us. No way.

960
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,094
There's no time.
I've got to take down the network core.

961
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:43,349
Hurley, I told you
stay put and guard the exfil.

962
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,477
Didn't I tell you that?
I thought I could depend on you.

963
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,441
All right. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

964
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:01,492
Good luck, Darwin.
We'll find another way through.

965
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:09,500
OK, this is good. Over there.

966
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,880
Marcie, let's go.

967
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,426
I find it hard to believe
you've got nothing to do with this.

968
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:21,012
You have to believe me.
I don't know what's going on.

969
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:24,557
I only wanted to be the biggest
appliance manufacturer in the world.

970
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,853
What do you want?
I got major problems here.

971
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:32,106
There's your problem. The transmission's
coming off the core of his computer.

972
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,359
- G-Force went in to shut it down.
- G-Force?

973
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,028
You sent those gophers in
without my authorization?

974
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:40,281
Sir, I'm picking up a video feed.
It's one of ours.

975
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,616
Let's see it.

976
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,826
- What in the heck is that?
- That's Darwin.

977
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,453
You say that like it's a good thing.

978
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:47,205
What's he gonna do,
gnaw his way out of there?

979
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,375
He's gonna insert a virus into
the core and take down the network.

980
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:03,388
- Hello, Darwin.
- Speckles, you're alive.

981
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:07,809
You infiltrated the bad guy's lair.
Where is he?

982
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,478
I am the bad guy.

983
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:14,607
What? You really think I let myself
get killed in a garbage truck?

984
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:18,986
Well, I hid in a soup can.
Rode it all the way to the city dump.

985
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:20,655
And it was stinky.

986
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:24,450
- Speckles?
- I can't believe the mole was the mole.

987
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,038
Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.

988
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,067
- No.
- Business associate of Leonard Saber.

989
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:35,570
You tricked Saber
into helping you build Clusterstorm?

990
01:09:35,655 --> 01:09:37,531
How could you do this to us?

991
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:40,867
I thought we were friends.
I put my life on the line for you.

992
01:09:40,952 --> 01:09:44,705
Yanshu was in my basement
this whole time?

993
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:46,498
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

994
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,251
"Yanshu" is the Chinese word for mole.

995
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:50,836
Sabersense was just a cover.

996
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:55,549
I created an army of robotic appliances,

997
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:59,428
and they created an array of
giant electromagnetic nodes...

998
01:09:59,512 --> 01:10:02,597
Nodes capable of pulling down all

999
01:10:02,682 --> 01:10:08,186
the space junk orbiting the planet,
and driving every human underground.

1000
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:13,942
- So, what do you think?
- You've betrayed us. You!

1001
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:19,406
- You sabotaged our presentation.
- Extermination virus. Nasty stuff.

1002
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,241
Speckles, why?

1003
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:27,289
You ever Google the word "mole", Darwin?
Three million entries.

1004
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:31,418
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

1005
01:10:31,502 --> 01:10:34,379
Three million entries
on how to exterminate them!

1006
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:39,342
The humans came and destroyed
our home... destroyed our home.

1007
01:10:39,427 --> 01:10:41,845
Son, if you ever get the chance

1008
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:45,515
to bring mankind to its knees... do it.

1009
01:10:49,687 --> 01:10:51,772
They showed us no mercy, Darwin.

1010
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:54,900
Well, now it's my turn
to do a little pest control.

1011
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:58,361
If you'll excuse me... it's showtime.

1012
01:10:59,697 --> 01:11:02,574
Going up!

1013
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:13,835
He's created some kind of monster.

1014
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,463
I think I'll stay here
and guard the exfil.

1015
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:20,967
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

1016
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:23,595
That's more of a goal than a plan.

1017
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:35,873
It's working! Look out!
I'm feeling ten feet tall.

1018
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:48,094
No place like home.
There's no place like home.

1019
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,845
That'll leave a mark.

1020
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:53,474
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

1021
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,768
How big is this thing going to get?

1022
01:11:57,854 --> 01:12:01,941
You humans stole my home!
Now I will steal yours.

1023
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:04,819
Look out!

1024
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,907
Something is missing. Oh, I know!

1025
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,087
Incoming!

1026
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:28,092
Just like humans.
Bringing guns to a space junk fight.

1027
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,763
- Darwin!
- Speckles, shut this down, now!

1028
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,850
- No.
- Then I'll shut you down.

1029
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,937
I have no quarrel with you, Darwin,
but mankind must pay.

1030
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,315
You know I can't let you do that.

1031
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,650
Then you leave me no choice, my friend.

1032
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,159
My parachute.

1033
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,167
The PDA!

1034
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:04,170
Go get it, girl.

1035
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,676
No!

1036
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:38,954
Hurley, what are you doing?

1037
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,582
I gotta get you back up there.

1038
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:46,504
- No, Hurley! Don't do it.
- Go get him, bro! It's the only way!

1039
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,390
Coming, Hurley!

1040
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:05,690
Take that! And that!
It's no fun being the little guy, is it?

1041
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,484
Everybody, hold on!

1042
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,529
Fall back!

1043
01:14:19,287 --> 01:14:21,038
Speckles, if you keep doing this

1044
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,459
then you're no better than the humans
who destroyed your home and your family.

1045
01:14:25,585 --> 01:14:29,531
Well, that's kind of the point here.
I lost my family.

1046
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:32,283
No, you're wrong. We're your family.

1047
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:35,912
Me and Blaster
and Juarez and Ben and Marcie.

1048
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:41,543
Speckles, Ben took us in
when nobody else wanted us.

1049
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:43,753
And he made us a family.

1050
01:14:47,508 --> 01:14:49,634
We're a family.

1051
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,975
Oh, no! No! What have I done?
What have I done?

1052
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:02,230
It's too late, Darwin! I can't stop it!

1053
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,816
But we can.

1054
01:15:16,954 --> 01:15:19,747
It's working! Darwin, it's working!

1055
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,293
Speckles, come with me.

1056
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:31,551
I got you!

1057
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,615
We've gotta find Hurley.

1058
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,081
- Hold it right there.
- We'll take him from here.

1059
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:03,875
Relax, guys. He's code four.

1060
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:07,545
- What a mess.
- There you go. Easy.

1061
01:16:10,507 --> 01:16:13,134
- Darwin, over here!
- Hang on!

1062
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,180
- I got him. I got him.
- I can't hold it much longer.

1063
01:16:20,684 --> 01:16:22,268
No, Hurley.

1064
01:16:22,895 --> 01:16:25,021
No, not you, Hurley.

1065
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:27,899
Look, he landed next to his cake.

1066
01:16:28,943 --> 01:16:29,943
No.

1067
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:32,987
Oh, man, Hurley.

1068
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,407
- Hurley.
- Oh, no.

1069
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:41,079
No. No. This is all my fault.

1070
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,665
He was my man.

1071
01:16:43,749 --> 01:16:46,251
Hurley, wake up, pal.

1072
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,295
Listen, I just...

1073
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:53,675
I just wanted you to know you
were as good as anyone out there today.

1074
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:57,011
I don't know what they call it
back in the pet shop,

1075
01:16:57,096 --> 01:17:00,682
but out here we...
well, we call it being a hero.

1076
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:04,352
All you ever wanted was a family.

1077
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:06,271
I never got to tell you this, but...

1078
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:10,858
I'd be proud...
proud to call you my brother.

1079
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:19,200
Hurley.

1080
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,247
Hey, I think I saw his nose twitch.

1081
01:17:29,962 --> 01:17:30,962
Hurley?

1082
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:35,341
Did you mean it
when you called me "brother?"

1083
01:17:35,426 --> 01:17:38,136
Not exactly. I was just...
That was like a figurative...

1084
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:45,476
- You bet I did.
- Brother. I have a brother!

1085
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:47,228
This is great!

1086
01:17:47,313 --> 01:17:49,105
We can spend every
Thanksgiving together,

1087
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:52,066
take road trips to Vegas,
have tickle fights!

1088
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:55,069
Oh, come here. Give me a hug, bro.

1089
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:01,451
Oh, this is great!

1090
01:18:07,499 --> 01:18:10,835
So, Hurley.
You still want to be a part of the team?

1091
01:18:15,341 --> 01:18:16,674
Two...

1092
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:18,634
Three...

1093
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:20,553
Twenty-seven!

1094
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,848
- Hurley. I'm right here watching you.
- Thirty-two.

1095
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,768
OK, that's it.
I don't want to get too buff.

1096
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:28,353
Not to worry.

1097
01:18:30,564 --> 01:18:34,108
Alrighty, guys.
Welcome to your new home.

1098
01:18:34,526 --> 01:18:37,779
OK, but I'm telling you now,
I don't do well with roommates.

1099
01:18:37,863 --> 01:18:41,282
- Easy there, tiger.
- Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

1100
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:43,117
Jail break! Jail break!

1101
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:49,791
Look, Juarez, I gotta know.
Which one of us are you interested in?

1102
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:53,461
No, no, Blaster! You've gotta ask her
who she's not interested in.

1103
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:55,296
Thirty, 42, 83.

1104
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:58,633
As far as I can tell,
you're not interested in either of us,

1105
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:02,136
which means either
you want both of us or neither of us,

1106
01:19:02,221 --> 01:19:05,932
which leaves us desperate
even though we don't have a clue!

1107
01:19:06,016 --> 01:19:08,226
And that's just how I like it.

1108
01:19:09,728 --> 01:19:12,730
Hey, guys? It's the Director of the FBI.

1109
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:17,276
G-Force. I want you to know
that Leonard Saber

1110
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:21,823
has been forced to undertake the largest
recall of consumer products in history.

1111
01:19:21,907 --> 01:19:25,535
And he's getting help from somebody
quite knowledgeable about the defects.

1112
01:19:27,246 --> 01:19:30,540
Three down, 178,000 to go.

1113
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,584
I think I'm gonna be here awhile.

1114
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:37,797
But I'm gonna rejoin the team
when I'm done. If they'll have me.

1115
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:42,093
Your friend, Agent Killian, has been
reassigned. He has a few words for you.

1116
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,388
Hello, G-Force.

1117
01:19:45,889 --> 01:19:48,599
Look! A frozen FBI-cicle.

1118
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:52,812
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1119
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:57,150
How long do I have to stay down here?
It's really cold!

1120
01:19:57,776 --> 01:20:00,361
Team. As the full details
of your valour come to light,

1121
01:20:00,446 --> 01:20:05,783
it is an honour and a privilege to say
"thank you" on behalf of this country.

1122
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:09,996
You guinea pigs pack more courage and
heart into those teensy little frames

1123
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,081
than any agents I've ever seen.

1124
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:17,670
G-Force, your funding has been restored.
Welcome to the FBI.

1125
01:20:18,505 --> 01:20:21,215
Guys... we got our badges.

1126
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:26,345
- Yeah, boy! We're official-tishal now!
- Finally!

1127
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:33,478
Not bad for a runt.

1128
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:36,481
Thanks for believing in me, Ben.

1129
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,029
Hurley, I've been thinking...

1130
01:20:43,113 --> 01:20:46,407
If you're gonna be out there
helping us save the world,

1131
01:20:46,492 --> 01:20:49,660
you're gonna need this.
You're one of us now.

1132
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:53,831
My very own badge
and a new name! Rookie!

1133
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:59,003
- So we're finally agents.
- No, special agents.

1134
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:11,682
Let's get this party started right!

1135
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:15,520
Get him on the good foot!
All right, Hurley!

1136
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,985
G-Force in the house!

1137
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:41,963
My turn! My turn!

1138
01:21:55,435 --> 01:21:59,480
Hey, boys!
This ferret can dance, right? Right?

1139
01:21:59,565 --> 01:22:00,731
Wrong!

1140
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:02,650
Oh, Bucky!

1141
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:04,986
Oh, yeah!

1142
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,166
I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

1143
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,589
Good thing I took shop.

1144
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,342
Cherries.

1145
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,972
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

1146
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:04,311
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

1147
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:09,066
I'm Jeff Gordon! With fur!
