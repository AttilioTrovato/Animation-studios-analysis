- Father left us shares in the bank.

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,759
Traveling the world, he is.
Off to points unknown.

311
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,259
Well, now I am off to speak with
the father of these children.

312
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,599
This family is clearly in desperate
need of a nanny.

313
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,271
Now, quick march and best foot forward,
and I'll thank you not to dawdle.

314
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,379
Go on!

315
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,008
<font color=#ff00ff>[ANNABEL SIGHS]</font>

316
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,379
Father! Aunt Jane! Come quick!

317
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,479
- <i>Quickly!</i>
- What is it, Georgie?

318
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,999
Has something happened?

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,619
I was flying a kite and it
got caught on a nanny!

320
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,299
- Whatever are you talking about?
- Come! Come, look!

321
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,299
Wait, where did you get that kite?

322
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,799
I found it in the park.

323
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,755
She kept it from blowing away.

324
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,659
- Mary...
- Poppins.

325
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,079
Oh, close your mouth please, Michael.
We are still not a codfish.

326
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,239
<font color=#ff00ff>[GIGGLES]</font>

327
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,196
Jane Banks, still rather
inclined to giggle, I see.

328
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,719
Good heavens, it really is you.

329
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,399
- You seem hardly to have aged at all.
- Really! How incredibly rude.

330
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,359
One never discusses a woman's age, Michael.
I would have hoped I taught you better.

331
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,239
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- You came back.

332
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,239
- I thought we'd never see you again.
- It is wonderful to see you.

333
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,237
Yes, it is, isn't it?

334
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,519
<i><font color=#FF551>- ANNABEL:</font> So, you know her, then?</i>
- Mary Poppins used to be our nanny.

335
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,469
What brings you here after all this time?

336
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,659
<font color=#FF551>MARY:</font> Same thing that brought
me the first time.

337
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,359
- I've come to look after the Banks children.
- Us?

338
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,859
Oh, yes, you too.

339
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,959
<i><font color=#FF551>ANNABEL:</font> But we don't need a nanny.</i>

340
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,779
Mother taught us to look after ourselves.

341
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,049
You did just misplace Georgie,

342
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,379
- I might point out.
- Only slightly. We got him back.

343
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,319
- We can do anything a nanny can.
<font color=#FF551>- GEORGIE:</font> Mary Poppins flew here on a kite.

344
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,919
- You can't do that, can you?
- What are you talking about, Georgie?

345
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,819
- <i>Don't be silly.
<font color=#FF551>- JANE:</font> Oh, let him believe what he likes.</i>

346
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,139
When your father and I were
young, we used to imagine...

347
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,179
that Mary Poppins could do all
sorts of impossible things.

348
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,479
<font color=#FF551>- PARROT UMBRELLA:</font> Actually...
- "Actually," what?

349
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,739
Actually, I'd like to get back to
the matter of my employment.

350
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,519
- Your umbrella talks!
- Georgie, please,

351
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,099
we're in the midst of a grown-up conversation.

352
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,879
<i><font color=#FF551>ANNABEL:</font> Why don't we go upstairs, Georgie?</i>

353
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,279
But it did talk! I promise!

354
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,699
I'm afraid Georgie sometimes suffers
from an excess of imagination.

355
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,939
As I recall, you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young.

356
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,759
Did I, really? Well...

357
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,299
- those days are long behind me.
- Are they, indeed? Hmm.

358
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,559
- Now, about my employment...
- Yes, about your employment...

359
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,139
- the truth is, I simply can't afford...
- We can settle on terms later,

360
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,819
although I will want my old room back.
That's if it's not a complete disaster...

361
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,819
and I will insist on having

362
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,419
- every second Tuesday off.
- No, I'm afraid,

363
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,719
- I...
- Of course, Mary Poppins.

364
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,039
Good, good. That's all settled.

365
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,739
Then I'll stay. Now, if you'll excuse me...

366
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,639
the children have turned
themselves into dustbins.

367
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,057
So the first order of business is to see
them properly bathed and dressed.

368
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,319
Jane, have you gone completely mad?

369
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,759
- I can't afford to take on anyone else.
- Mary Poppins isn't just anyone.

370
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,839
Don't you see, Michael? No one's
hiring nannies anymore.

371
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,979
- <i>The poor woman has nowhere to go.</i>
- Well, neither will we...

372
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,059
- by the end of the week!
- Oh, don't be so grumpy.

373
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,849
You sound just like Father.

374
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,379
- I do not!
- Give Mary Poppins a chance.

375
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,699
You need help just as much as she does!

376
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,359
Very well. She can stay for
the time being, I suppose.

377
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,079
After all, she did fly all this way on a kite.

378

<font color=#ff00ff>[BOTH LAUGH]</font>

379
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,219
Those things, when we were
young, they didn't really...

380
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,079
- Happen?
- No.

381
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,919
- No.
- Of course not. Ridiculous.

- Hello, Ellen.

384
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,719
- How'd you do that?
- Do what?

385
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,139
And why didn't Father believe
you flew here on a kite?

386
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,219
- Because it's complete nonsense, of course.
- Grown-ups forget. They always do.

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,799
<i><font color=#FF551>MARY:</font> That will be quite enough of that.</i>

388

So, you're staying?

401

- What does that mean?

- That door's always opening.
- Oh, not that door, another one.

<font color=#ff00ff>- [CHUCKLES]</font> That's just silly, Georgie.

404
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,919

405
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,593
Come along. Time for a good, clean start.

406
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,019
Mother always had us take
our baths in the evening.

407

Well, in my experience, Annabel...

408
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,419
the perfect time of day to have a
bath is when one needs a wash.

409
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,699
Georgie, you will go first.

410
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,539
We are perfectly capable of
drawing our own baths.

411
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,439
<i><font color=#FF551>MARY:</font> How very helpful, John.</i>

412
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,659
<i>In that case, you may turn off the tap.</i>

413
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,079
But not quite yet, still need
to put in the bubbles.

414

- But I don't like soap bubbles.
- Well, then you shall have to try

415

are, don't you, Georgie?

1219

Yes. They're the lawyers.

1220
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:58,139
- He's the nice one.
- Maybe we could convince him to help us.

1236
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:57,979
19, sir, and we have nearly that amount
scheduled for next week alone.

Who'd have thought this slump would
be so good for business, eh?

1238
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:04,339
I wonder, Mr. Wilkins, if, perhaps as
Michael Banks is an employee,

1239
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,459
you might consider giving him...

1240
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,659
- a few more weeks.
- And lose our chance to get that house?

1241

What?

1276
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:48,859
I was just seeing if anything could be
done about extending your loan...

1277
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:52,059
when they came in claiming I was
trying to steal your house.

1278
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,549
- He is! We heard him!
- Mr. Wilkins is trying to help us!

1279
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,819
But then, why was he chasing us?

1280
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,399
I just thought they might stop running around

1281
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,949
and making a scene if I offered
them some sweets.

1282
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:04,739
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Wilkins.
- See it doesn't happen again.

1283
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:12,659
After all, you don't want your father losing his
position on account of you, do you? Hmm?

1284
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,739
I know time is running short, Banks...

1285
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,939
but I want you to have every chance
of paying off that loan.

1286
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,299
So, I will make sure that I'm in
my office on Friday evening...

1287
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,219

- Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

1290
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,954
- But, Father, he really did do it.
- Not another word!

1291
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,299
- Take them home this instant!
<i><font color=#FF551>- MARY:</font> Yes, sir.</i>

1292
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,533

know that we broke Mother's bowl.

Everything we've tried to fix,
we've only made it worse.

1298

- Which way do we go, Mary Poppins?
<font color=#FF551>- MARY:</font> Now, why would you ask me?

1299

- Walking around in a fog.
- No, we weren't.

1302
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:47,059
- I mean, we are in a fog, but...
- We were only talking.

1303
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:50,139
Yes, too focused on where you've been
to pay attention to where you're going.

1304
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:53,139
- But Father told us to go straight home!
- He'll be furious if we're late.

1305
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,739
Not much to be done about that now, is there?

1306
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,179
Are we lost, then?

1307
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,979
<i><font color=#FF551>JACK:</font> That would depend on where you want to go.</i>

<i>Lost Sixpence and found a penny?</i>

1311
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,689
- We've made a mess of everything.
- Father's...

1312
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:10,019
- furious with us.
- And we can't find our way home.

1313
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:16,059
- Lost? Are you, Mary Poppins?
- Hopelessly.

1314
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,099
Well, now, I'm no expert...

1315
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:23,109

for a little light to guide me.

- What did he say?

1369
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,179
"Kick and prance," it means
"dance." It's leerie speak.

We're sorry we're late, Father.
It wasn't Mary Poppins' fault.

1414
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,909
- We got lost in the fog.
- Jack and the leeries...

- Now leave us to it.
- Yes, sir.

1424
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:33,669
- Not you, Mary Poppins. In here.
- Very well, sir.

1425
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,406
You could have lost me my job.

1426
01:32:44,877 --> 01:32:47,195
Do you understand that?

1427
01:32:47,196 --> 01:32:52,259
Have you any idea how difficult it is to find
a good position like mine these days?

But there you all were, tearing about like a...

1429

And you, Mary Poppins, I thought you were
here to look after these children.

1430
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,139
- It wasn't her doing, it was me.
- No, it was us.

1431
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:08,699
We thought maybe if we talked to Mr. Frye, he
could give you more time to save the house.

1432
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,259
- We were only trying to help.

do this on my own. It's too hard. I just...

I'm barely holding it together as it is.

I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...

1439
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,519
and there's no more time, we're
about to lose our home...

1440
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,595

I never said a word.

1466

It was all the children's idea.

1467

The whole time I've been looking after
them, they've been looking after me.

- A Banks family trait.
