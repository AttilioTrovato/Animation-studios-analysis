{1276}{1349}This is James Henry Trotter.
{1434}{1549}He lived with his mother and father in|a cozy little house by the sea.
{1551}{1617}Hey, I've got ya!
{1618}{1712}Happy birthday, darling. Now, quickly,|blow them out before the wind does.
{1714}{1760}Make a wish first.
{1894}{1958}It was a wonderful life.
{1960}{2039}They had each other,|and they had their dreams.
{2041}{2087}Look!
{2089}{2179}That cloud|looks like a camel.
{2181}{2264}And that one over there|looks like a train engine.
{2302}{2383}Can you see the tallest building|in the world?
{2486}{2532}I can't find it.
{2562}{2637}Try looking at it|another way.
{2702}{2754}I see it!
{2798}{2865}That's where we're going...
{2866}{2940}on the great ship that will take us|across the ocean,
{2942}{3017}and we'll go right to the top|of that building.
{3019}{3086}The three of us...|on top of the world.
{3088}{3144}Are there any kids|there like me?
{3184}{3288}Hundreds of them.|It's a wonderful place,James.
{3290}{3372}A city where|dreams come true.
{3374}{3477}Then one day,|a terrible thing happened.
{3530}{3598}An angry rhinoceros|appeared out of nowhere...
{3600}{3666}and gobbled up|his poor mother and father.
{3697}{3757}Their troubles...|if they had any at all...
{3759}{3818}were over in 35 seconds flat.
{3898}{3973}But James's troubles|were just beginning,
{3974}{4070}for now he lives here|with Aunt Sponge...
{4072}{4130}Get up,|you lazy little bug!
{4132}{4237}- and Aunt Spiker.|- You've already wasted 4 minutes of daylight.
{4238}{4327}Look at him,|lollygagging in dreamland,
{4329}{4382}when there's|so much work to do.
{4384}{4450}Weeds to pull, wood to chop.
{4452}{4520}Work, work, work, work, work!
{5610}{5681}Wouldn't want one of those|nesting in your knickers.
{5730}{5807}I look and smell...
{5809}{5890}I do declare...|as lovely as a rose.
{5892}{5970}Just feast your eyes|upon my face.
{5972}{6050}Observe my shapely nose.
{6052}{6163}Behold my heavenly,|silky locks.
{6165}{6266}And If I take off|both my socks,
{6268}{6353}you'll see my dainty toes.
{6354}{6413}But don't forget,|my dearest Sponge,
{6414}{6478}how much|your tummy shows!
{6841}{6946}You lazybug!|Who told you to stop working?
{6948}{7007}I finished the wood.
{7053}{7130}A travel book?|How dare you even dream of leaving?
{7132}{7196}This is the only home|you'll ever have.
{7198}{7295}No one else would tolerate|a worthless little nothing like you.
{7297}{7378}Where did you get this?|Where?
{7379}{7438}Father gave it to me.|He said we're to go there one day.
{7440}{7486}Stupid,|foolish man!
{7488}{7572}Foolish man, always dreaming.|That's what got him killed.
{7574}{7643}- And your mother.|- Had his head in the clouds...
{7645}{7691}instead of looking|where he was going.
{7693}{7760}He never even saw that rhino coming.
{7762}{7816}That rhino!
{7818}{7920}And the beast will get you too|if you don't behave.
{7922}{8010}Now get these stupid dreams|out of your head...
{8012}{8067}and get back to work!
{8294}{8387}Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want|to ruin that girlish figure.
{8389}{8435}Oh, shut up!
{8501}{8571}- Yes?|- I finished all of the chores.
{8573}{8658}What a coincidence!|We finished all the dinner.
{8660}{8730}Oh, Sponge,|you're such a tease.
{8732}{8811}There's something special|waiting for you in the oven.
{9000}{9140}Oh, do let me guess:|They're not good enough for him.
{9142}{9199}What do you think this is,|Buckingham Palace?
{9201}{9270}Yuck!
{9272}{9350}- Get out of our sight!|- Go on!
{9386}{9433}Go on!
{10350}{10442}Hello, there.|Where did you come from?
{10444}{10524}You know, you probably shouldn't build|your web up here in the window.
{10526}{10618}Spiker and Sponge might see you,|and they hate spiders.
{10645}{10727}I'll be your friend, though.
{10729}{10841}/My name is James
{10842}{10951}/That's what Mother called me
{10953}{11061}/My name is James
{11063}{11139}/So it's always been
{11182}{11277}/Sometimes I forget
{11279}{11393}/When I'm lonely or afraid
{11394}{11513}/And I'll go inside my head
{11514}{11644}/And look for James
{11646}{11711}Here's something|I've never shown anyone.
{11841}{11951}/There's a city|/that I dreamed of
{11953}{12050}/Very far from here
{12052}{12174}/Very, very far|/away from here
{12176}{12292}/Very far away
{12294}{12421}/There are people|/in the city
{12422}{12527}/And they're kind to me
{12529}{12658}/But it's very, very far away|/you know
{12660}{12721}/Very far
{12762}{12809}/They'll say, James
{12810}{12876}/James, James
{12878}{12941}/How are'ya
{12943}{13024}/Isn't a lovely day
{13060}{13135}/James, James, James
{13137}{13247}/We're so glad|/you came here
{13249}{13301}/Where we are
{13302}{13441}/From so very, very|/very far
{13442}{13574}/My name is James
{13576}{13634}/James
{13635}{13682}/James
{14037}{14096}Good night.|Pleasant dreams.
{14239}{14319}Spider! Vermin!
{14321}{14387}Oh, beast!
{14389}{14438}No, wait!
{14440}{14513}- Sponge!|- Wait, I'll get it! I'll get it.
{14514}{14615}Kill it! Kill it!|Kill it!
{14617}{14690}Where is it?
{14860}{14935}- Get it! Get it!|- Kill it.
{14937}{14979}- Get it, get it!|- Kill it!
{14981}{15027}Get it!
{15073}{15172}You hit me in the face.|You hit me in the face!
{15174}{15232}Oh, do shut up!
{15373}{15490}Go on, get out of here. Get as far away|from this place as you possibly can.
{15492}{15560}Oh, I wish I could.
{15562}{15621}What's stopping you?
{15622}{15685}Oh, don't be frightened, James.|I mean you no harm.
{15734}{15813}How'd you know my name?
{15814}{15883}I know more|than just your name.
{15914}{15992}What would you say|if I were to tell you...
{15994}{16097}that the answer to all|your troubles is right here...
{16098}{16166}- inside this little bag?|- Hey, that's my...
{16168}{16233}Of course it is!|Go on, James.
{16234}{16302}Have a look.
{16304}{16435}There's more magic in them things than in all|the rest of the world put together.
{16437}{16492}But... what are they?
{16494}{16564}- Crocodile tongues.|- Tongues?
{16566}{16652}One thousand long,|slimy crocodile tongues,
{16654}{16746}boiled in the skull of a dead witch|for 20 days and 20 nights.
{16748}{16831}Add the fingers of a young monkey,|the gizzard of a pig,
{16833}{16903}the beak of a parrot|and three spoonfuls of sugar.
{16905}{16978}Stew for a week,|and then let the moon...
{16980}{17037}do the rest.
{17038}{17097}Have 'em,
{17098}{17220}and marvelous things will happen;|things even you never dreamt of.
{17222}{17280}- Like what?|- Well, like...
{17282}{17377}you'll never be|miserable again.
{17379}{17474}And you are miserable,|aren't you, James?
{17476}{17540}You weren't meant to be,|you know?
{17542}{17604}And that place|you're dreaming of...
{17606}{17670}It's not as far away|as you think.
{17778}{17839}New York City!
{17841}{17938}And it'll be that much closer|once you take the first step.
{17940}{18023}But how?|This doesn't make any sense.
{18025}{18134}Not up here it doesn't.|The answers are in here,
{18136}{18216}and the magic is in here.
{18249}{18318}So, James,|what'll it be?
{18502}{18611}Now listen to me, James. Don't let|them get away, because if they do...
{18613}{18736}they'll work their magic on whoever|or whatever they meet first.
{18738}{18784}Understand?
{18810}{18856}Good.
{19146}{19209}What's going on out here?
{19418}{19492}Uuh! Oh! No, wait!
{19578}{19636}Wait! No! No, wait!
{19753}{19818}Wait, just a...
{19820}{19878}- Wait.|- Here he is.
{19880}{19972}Get up, you little worm!|We sent you out here to kill a spider!
{19974}{20049}- Not to laze about.|- I wasn't lazing about. I tripped.
{20050}{20145}- How dare you disagree with us!|- Beat him, Sponge.
{20197}{20255}It's too early.
{20257}{20345}Well, that makes you|the luckiest boy alive.
{20347}{20400}Now come inside|and get dressed!
{20462}{20516}Spiker, look! A peach!
{20518}{20611}- A what?|- A peach! There, on that branch.
{20613}{20728}Why, that old tree's never had so much|as a blossom on it, let alone a...
{20730}{20831}Well, I'll be blowed.|There really is a peach there.
{20833}{20892}A nice, big one too.
{20894}{20953}How can we get it?
{20986}{21066}- The boy! Now, you be a good little boy...|- The boy!
{21068}{21167}and climb up there and get that peach|for your dear aunties.
{21169}{21244}- Can we eat it?|- Of course we can. We'll share it.
{21246}{21319}Me and your Aunt Spiker!|Now start climbing.
{21321}{21372}- Wait!|-  What?
{21374}{21441}- What, what?|- It's... It's growing.
{21442}{21521}- The boy?|- No, the peach, you idiot!
{21522}{21568}Look.
{21606}{21654}Oh! Come down!
{21656}{21730}- But I won't get hurt.|- Climb down!
{21732}{21835}What a peach.|What a peach!
{21837}{21918}Look, Spiker,|it's still growing!
{21920}{21989}I'm not blind, you dolt.|I can see for myself.
{22038}{22114}Look at it go!|It's a miracle.
{22116}{22167}It's coming down!|Stand back!
{22228}{22281}Oh, my heavens! My...
{22690}{22782}Marvelous things will happen,|just like he said.
{22784}{22831}Shut up,|you little grub.
{22833}{22912}This has nothing to do with you,|so just keep away from it.
{22914}{23017}Can you smell that, Spikey?
{23018}{23101}- It smells delicious.|- No!
{23146}{23217}It smells like... money.
{23328}{23401}Roll up, roll up. See the giant peach.
{23402}{23451}The Eighth Wonder of World.
{23453}{23532}Have your money ready, ladies|and gentlemen. Chance of a lifetime.
{23534}{23606}Ten bob only!
{23608}{23676}No peeking at the peach! Have your|money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
{23678}{23741}In you go.
{23742}{23839}- Can we touch it?|- Touch it? You want to touch it?
{23841}{23891}Huh! She'll be wanting|to taste it next.
{23893}{23991}Admission refused. This child|has too many cheeky ideas. Go away!
{23993}{24083}- Quite right!|- Ooh, Sponge.
{24085}{24141}A photographer.
{24175}{24222}And another.
{24223}{24273}Best side.
{24274}{24354}- Move on in.|- No cameras allowed.
{24356}{24446}Don't dawdle! Come along, ladies and|gentlemen. Sorry, Father, it'll cost you double.
{24448}{24511}- May God forgive you.|- Thank you, Father.
{24513}{24619}Come along, children.|Last chance of the day.
{24670}{24746}Yoo-hoo! Come down here.
{24770}{24816}Yes, Auntie Sponge?
{24818}{24895}Oo-ooh,|you're all spiffed up.
{24897}{24944}I was hoping to play|with the children.
{24946}{25048}- Aww!|- Aww! The children have gone.
{25050}{25121}But you can play|with their garbage.
{25123}{25215}Heh, heh, heh!|Garbage! Heh, heh, heh!
{25217}{25348}And don't even think|of going near our peach.
{25350}{25453}'Cause if you do... You know,|they never did catch that rhino.
{26241}{26318}No! Wait a moment!|Wait!
{28222}{28283}'Ere, now.|Where do you think you're goin', Yank?
{28285}{28350}I'm goin' stir-crazy.|I gotta take a look around.
{28352}{28418}- Plan our escape from Spiker and Sponge.|- Escape?
{28420}{28506}To where? We'll all be squashed...|swatted... smooshed!
{28508}{28588}No one's going to "smoosh" you,|my dear boy.
{28590}{28656}- You're six feet long now.|- Bigger target.
{28658}{28741}Let the biddies come.|I'll take 'em both on.
{28743}{28815}I'm "indefeatable".|I'm indivisible. I'm...
{28817}{28869}- Whoa!|- in trouble!
{28870}{28950}It's Spiker and Sponge!
{28952}{28998}They've found us!
{29000}{29060}- Hel-lo!|- Oof! Uuh!
{29062}{29121}No, no, no. It's the lad|from the house. What's his name?
{29122}{29197}- Miserable Tick.|- I thought it was Rotten Little Grub.
{29199}{29258}No, that's what those|horrible aunts call him.
{29260}{29333}His real name is...|Well, it's, eh, eh...
{29335}{29386}It's James.
{29388}{29470}Look what you've done now, miss.|Scared him to death.
{29472}{29530}Please! Don't eat me!
{29531}{29578}Eat you?
{29579}{29628}Hey, Glowworm,|turn up your lights.
{29682}{29749}- I'm a vegetarian.|- I eat dirt.
{29750}{29809}No one will be eating you,|James.
{29810}{29885}Yeah, she'll just puncture your head|and suck out the brains.
{29887}{29970}- That I am saving for you.|- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.
{30019}{30145}Oh, such rude behavior. There's|no need to be frightened, dearie.
{30146}{30201}But you're enormous bugs!
{30202}{30294}- Fascinating, isn't it?|- We've all changed...
{30296}{30347}and so have you,James.
{30380}{30451}The old man... the one|who gave me the green things...
{30453}{30514}He said marvelous things|will happen.
{30516}{30581}Did he say,|"Marvelous pigs in satin"?
{30582}{30685}No, dear lady.|"Marvelous things will happen."
{30686}{30753}Poor Glowworm.|She's a little deaf.
{30754}{30813}I, however,|have exquisite hearing.
{30814}{30901}Yeah? Well, listen to this.
{30903}{30962}- Let's get outta here!|- Waa-aa!
{30963}{31065}You mean leave the hill?|I can't. The rhino will get me.
{31066}{31117}Rhino?
{31118}{31220}I say, dear boy, I've lived|on this miserable hill for decades.
{31222}{31304}- There are no rhinoceri here.|- Except for Sponge.
{31306}{31384}She's twice as big as|a rhino, eh, kid?
{31386}{31464}And twice as dangerous.|My life hangs by a thread every day.
{31466}{31553}I've had to send all 300|of me children to safer pastures.
{31555}{31630}Hah! You think hiding|in solid rock is fun?
{31632}{31690}I can't even remember|what fun is.
{31692}{31780}Well, it's just 'cause you've been stuck|here too long. Listen to me, kid.
{31782}{31848}I know a place|that'll refresh your memory.
{31854}{31930}/Bright lights|/Big city
{31932}{31980}/That's where we gotta go
{31982}{32057}/Where the food is great|/and the bugs are so pretty

{32826}{32929}/That sounds lovely, dear.|/I'm sure we'd all agree.
{32931}{32985}/But I prefer the sunshine
{32987}{33054}/A little park right|/in the center of the town
{33056}{33172}/Flowers everywhere|/Children all around me
{33174}{33297}/I'd love it|/Landing on a baby's cheek so warm
{33298}{33381}/It's wonderful, wonderful

{34682}{34760}Hup! Time to go make a pest|of myself. Heh-heh!
{34788}{34882}Look at this place.|It's still filthy.
{34883}{34942}Where are you,you detestable worm?
{34944}{35017}Not you! Me!
{35019}{35096}You better not|be near our peach!
{35098}{35162}Oh, please!|Don't let them spray us!
{35164}{35249}Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there|and come after us with a shovel.
{35250}{35309}- It happened to my brother.|- How awful.
{35310}{35401}Split him right down the middle.|Now I have two half-brothers.
{35403}{35472}Shh! They'll hear us.
{35511}{35588}Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?
{35590}{35684}I think I hear|a rhino out here!
{35710}{35796}Ahh! This'll be a snap.
{35847}{35928}Shh! I really do|hear something.
{36090}{36148}Timber.

{36297}{36389}- Aaah! The car!|- Aaah! The car!
{36390}{36460}- We're turning!|- Wha-Wha-Wha... What have you done?

{38558}{38611}Sorry. I thought|you were the Spider.
{38613}{38684}Ouch! What was that?
{38686}{38742}Excuse. I thought you|were the Centipede.
{38744}{38805}Hey, Glowworm,|how about some light?
{38807}{38877}I can't hear you, dear.|I'll have to put my light on.
{38878}{38963}Oh! Oh! This is so|un-ladybug-like!
{38965}{39061}Don't worry. I'll have you|right-side up in no time.
{39063}{39125}Thank you, James.|Where are you going?
{39126}{39183}To see where we've landed.
{39330}{39377}Whoa!
{39641}{39687}Oh, my!
{39689}{39740}Oh, my, my!
{39742}{39816}Oh, my achin' back!
{39845}{39953}Fascinating, isn't it?
{39954}{40041}What? What's fascinating, tell me?|Don't leave me dangling.
{40043}{40157}We're in the middle of the...|How do you say? The big puddle.
{40159}{40237}The biggest puddle of them all,|angel fangs:
{40238}{40333}- the Atlantic Ocean.|- Technically, the Pacific is larger.
{40335}{40415}Well... that goes|without saying.
{40417}{40522}- But there is land in sight?|- Nothing but blue skies and clearwaters.
{40524}{40593}This is all your fault!
{40594}{40697}Hey! Wasn't for me, we'd all|be Spiked and Sponged by now!
{40699}{40819}This old man with his green things...|did he happen to speak to where we are going?
{40821}{40933}No. All he said was|the answers would be right here.
{40966}{41023}Huh? My travel book!
{41025}{41105}And look!|It's the peach!
{41131}{41197}We're going to|New York City!
{41198}{41307}- New York? They love me there!|- Wonderful! They've got...
{41309}{41373}a whole park full of leaves|for you, Miss Ladybug.
{41375}{41446}- Central Park!|- And loads of dark hiding places.
{41447}{41505}- Night clubs!|- And museums and concerts.
{41506}{41573}- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.|- What about me?
{41575}{41672}- Why, they've got miles and miles of underground tunnels!|- The subway!
{41674}{41749}My father says it's the place|where dreams come true.
{41750}{41928}/- That's the life for me|/- That's the life for me

{41995}{42073}/That's the life|/That's the life
{42075}{42171}/For me
{42173}{42289}New York it is then.|Now, how do we get there?
{42291}{42347}- I'll get us there.|- You?
{42349}{42435}Sure! I've sailed|all the five seas:
{42437}{42498}from the sun-drenched wreaths|of Bora Bora...
{42500}{42572}to the icy shores|of Tripoli.
{42574}{42620}- Oh!|- Commodore Centipede,
{42622}{42668}they used to call me.
{42670}{42721}Seven.
{42723}{42773}There are seven seas.
{42775}{42879}And Tripoli is in|the subtropics... Commodore.
{42881}{42956}- Trim the sails!|- There are no sails.
{42958}{43020}- Stoke the engines!|- There are no engines.
{43022}{43080}I can't work|with this miserable crew.
{43082}{43164}Great! We're stuck here|until we shrivel up and die.
{43166}{43223}- Highly improbable.|- That's a relief.
{43225}{43273}We're far more likely to drown.
{43275}{43372}Oh, no!
{43374}{43429}I know! We could...
{43431}{43485}No, it's a stupid idea.
{43486}{43541}- Compared to what?|- Hey!
{43542}{43604}Well, we could fly out.
{43606}{43681}He's right. It's stupid.
{43682}{43740}How would you do it, James?
{43742}{43808}With the sea gulls.|But we'll need string.
{43810}{43911}Oh, well, I'll just go to the stationer's and|pick up some paper clips while I'm at it!
{43913}{43993}I have string.|Miles of string.
{43994}{44085}And we'll need bait;|bird bait.
{44086}{44209}Bird bait? Where do you expect we're gonna|find bird bait out here in the middle of the...
{44211}{44282}The... Oh, no.
{44283}{44387}No, no!|Have you lost your minds?
{44417}{44499}They've lost their minds!|Anything but birds!
{44501}{44565}Don't worry, I'm right here.
{44567}{44614}- Now wiggle.|- No!
{44615}{44721}- But they won't come if you don't wiggle.|- Exactly, and you can't make me.
{44722}{44816}- Oh, yeah?|- Stop! Ah-ha-ha!
{44818}{44939}Oh! Hey, no fair!|Mockingbirds munched me mother!
{45001}{45088}Here comes the first one.|Get ready to pull down there.
{45090}{45191}My sisters were swallowed by swallows!
{45193}{45253}- Pull!|- Whoo!
{45426}{45496}It worked! I got one!
{45502}{45611}Shh! I hear teeth.|Great, big, gnashing teeth!
{45613}{45681}Sounds like a rhinoceros!
{45682}{45781}In the ocean?|Uh, scientifically impossible.
{45783}{45848}I hear something too.
{45850}{45904}It's a school of Tuna.
{45906}{45973}They're being sucked into|some sort of machine.
{45975}{46046}- What do you mean?|- Take a look.
{46126}{46176}It's a giant shark!
{46311}{46377}It seems to have spotted us!
{46455}{46501}What do we do?|What do we do?
{46503}{46566}The sea gulls!|It's our only chance.
{46568}{46664}It would take the whole flock and|then some. We'll never do it in time.
{46666}{46725}We'll use Miss Spider's web|for a net. Hurry!
{46803}{46864}Throw it here, dearie!
{46950}{47013}Wiggle, Mr. Earthworm!|Our lives depend on it!
{47015}{47084}I can't! I'm all wiggled out!
{47134}{47183}Here, let me help you.
{47185}{47283}Come and get it!|Get your fresh, hot wienie!
{47386}{47448}Come on, baby!
{47506}{47565}I got 'em!|Hand me the loops!
{47605}{47671}- Hurry!|- Shake a leg there!
{47673}{47737}Keep your pants on!|I've only got 12 hands.
{47802}{47856}It's getting closer!
{47858}{47937}Sea gulls away!
{48282}{48330}Oh, no!
{48331}{48402}Oh, dear!
{48654}{48712}They're getting away!
{48743}{48817}Hop on, James!
{48819}{48872}Now nab them!
{48982}{49024}- Help!|- Help!
{49166}{49233}Hooligans! Ruffians!
{49234}{49287}Degenerates!
{49431}{49516}- Come on, sea gulls!|- Put your backs into it!
{49518}{49569}Shake your|bloomin' tail feathers!
{49622}{49685}Good sharky. Nice sharky.
{49719}{49820}Oh! Sharky!
{50530}{50577}All right!
{50578}{50688}Teach ya to mess with me, ya overgrown|sardine! I'm from Brooklyn!
{50690}{50745}Oh, ho-ho! Pure twaddle!
{50746}{50834}Every bug on board displayed|extraordinary courage.
{50836}{50903}Why, did you see Miss Ladybug|risk life and wing...
{50905}{50976}to bash those brutes on the snoot?
{50978}{51061}Well, they were being very rude.|I can't abide rudeness.
{51062}{51117}We are all|forgetting something.
{51118}{51201}Everything we did was part|of the brilliant plan of James.
{51202}{51276}It really did work,|didn't it?
{51278}{51345}I say,|three cheers forJames!
{51346}{51510}- Hip-hip!|- Hooray!
{51399}{51441}- Hip-hip!|- Hooray!
{51442}{51510}- Hip-hip!|- Hooray!
{51512}{51559}New York...
{51597}{51661}here... we... co-ome!
{52063}{52158}Whoever you are,|keep away from me! Keep away!
{52160}{52240}Earthworm! It's me!
{52242}{52295}Oh, James.|Oh, thank goodness.
{52297}{52382}- You mustn't frighten yourself like this all the time.|- Why not?
{52384}{52435}You'll make yourself sick.
{52437}{52540}When I had a problem, my mum and dad|would tell me to look at it another way.
{52542}{52633}How? First I was bird bait,|then I was shark bait.
{52634}{52734}I suppose. Or, you could say|you gave us wings to fly,
{52736}{52805}and defeated a giant shark|single-handedly.
{52806}{52856}No-handedly.
{52858}{52913}Exactly.|You're a hero.
{52914}{53010}I am?|I'm... Wonder Worm!
{53012}{53058}You are!
{53331}{53394}Want... food.
{53396}{53455}Food.
{53544}{53607}You sure you know|where we're going?
{53609}{53666}I don't see how you can navigate|without a compass.
{53764}{53832}It's very hot up here.|I'm roasted.
{54142}{54194}Unhand that bird!
{54196}{54246}But I'm dyin' of hunger!
{54248}{54322}Oh, perhaps I have a bit|of soda bread in here somewhere.
{54324}{54386}- Food?|- It's not much, but it's...
{54388}{54429}- Not so fast!|- You?
{54430}{54493}I need this food. I have|a much higher metabolism.
{54495}{54556}- Bite me!|- Have you two gone mad?
{54558}{54633}Let go of it, Gramps!|Give it! Give it to me!
{54635}{54692}- Let go of my coat!|- Give it to me!
{54694}{54752}- Ow! My lower thorax!|- I'll rip you apart!
{54754}{54822}- I tell you, it's mine!|- Give... it... back!
{54824}{54918}Now look what you've done!
{54920}{55016}We're going to starve.|Waste away. And not quickly.
{55018}{55096}Oh, no, that wouldbe|the easy way out. We'll linger.
{55098}{55192}Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.
{55194}{55272}Nobody's going to starve.
{55274}{55372}Don't you see? We have|enough food here for five voyages.
{55374}{55436}- Food? Where? What are you talkin' about?|- Is there really food?
{55438}{55529}- Ourwhole ship is made of food!|- Oh, such a clever little boy.
{55573}{55665}- Takes after me.|- After you there is nothing left to take.
{55667}{55765}- It's delectable.|- Better than aphids.
{55767}{55819}Mm, better than ladybugs.
{55821}{55871}- What?|- Excuse.
{55873}{55965}It's not dirt...|but it's not bad.
{55966}{56043}Not bad? It's the best thing|I've ever tasted,
{56045}{56118}and I have tasted a lot.
{56291}{56400}/I've eaten many strange and|/scrumptious dishes in my time
{56402}{56479}/Like chili bugs|/and curried slugs
{56481}{56536}/And earwigs|/cooked in slime
{56538}{56601}/And mice with rice|/is very nice
{56603}{56666}/When they're roasted|/in their prime
{56668}{56733}/But don't forget|/to sprinkle them
{56735}{56805}/With just a pinch|/of grime
{56949}{57027}/I'm crazy about mosquitos|/on a piece of buttered toast
{57029}{57111}/And pickled spines of porcupines|/And then a great big roast
{57113}{57223}/And dragon's flesh quite old|/not fresh, it costs a buck at most
{57225}{57275}Does it come with gravy?
{57277}{57370}/It comes to you in barrels|/if you order it by post
{57605}{57697}/It comes to you in barrels|/if you order it by post
{57698}{57748}/For dinner|/on my birthday
{57750}{57809}/Shall I tell you|/what I chose
{57811}{57927}/Hot noodles made of poodles|/on a slice of garden hose
{57929}{57997}/And a rather|/smelly jelly
{57999}{58070}/Made of armadillos toes
{58072}{58120}/The jelly is delicious
{58122}{58216}/But you have to|/hold your nose
{58236}{58283}/- Peach, peach, peach|/- Peach, peach
{58285}{58385}/Peach, peach, peach, peach|/Peach, peach, peach, peach
{58387}{58471}/I crave the tasty tentacles|/of octopi for tea
{58473}{58593}/I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs|/and surely you'll agree
{58595}{58692}/A plate of soil with engine oil's|/a super recipe

{60139}{60224}Watch this!
{60225}{60282}/This fantastic peach
{60928}{61006}You keep to yourself, don't you?
{61008}{61064}I prefer to be alone.
{61065}{61139}I was alone|for a long time once.
{61141}{61222}I think it's much nicer|to have friends, don't you?
{61224}{61270}I would not know.
{61272}{61382}They would be your friends too. The|others, I mean, if you'd just let them.
{61384}{61504}No, it is in their nature to have|fear of me. This I cannot change.
{61505}{61552}You're very kind to me.
{61553}{61665}Maybe this is because|you are kind to me first.
{61667}{61769}You were the spider in my window.
{61770}{61824}You were my first friend.
{61825}{61940}I mean, since I went to live|with my aunts. They hated me!
{61941}{62012}Do not think of them now.
{62013}{62060}But what if they find us?
{62061}{62125}What if we don't|make it to New York?
{62127}{62238}I'll die if I have to go back to|the way I was! They can't make me.
{62240}{62317}Nobody can make you|do anything, James,
{62319}{62371}if you do not let them.
{62373}{62448}You are a brave boy.
{62449}{62514}Now to sleep.
{62516}{62609}You have had a very|"tired-making" day.
{63513}{63624}Look, the little maggot's|stuffing his face with our peach!
{63626}{63717}Get him, Sponge!
{63718}{63790}You can't crawl away|from us!
{64127}{64218}The rhino will get you.|The rhino will get you.
{64220}{64313}The rhino will get you.|The rhino will get you.
{64314}{64445}The rhino will get you.|The rhino will get you.
{65159}{65226}This is an outrage!
{65228}{65332}You are a disgrace to your phylum,|class, order, genus and species!
{65333}{65401}- Say it in English!|- You, sir, are an ass!
{65402}{65469}Where are we?|What's going on?
{65471}{65565}I found this dime-store timmy|asleep at the helm.
{65567}{65625}- Now we're lost.|- We are not lost!
{65626}{65726}- Then where are we?|- Somewhere north, or possibly very, very far south.
{65728}{65785}What's your latitude?|What's your longitude?
{65787}{65856}Hey, hey, hey!|That's personal, bub.
{65857}{65909}You said you could navigate!
{65911}{66000}- You said you traveled the world.|- You said you'd been to Bora Bora.
{66002}{66061}Well, not Bora Bora,|per se, uh...
{66062}{66117}What about the shores|of Tripoli?
{66119}{66218}Did I say "Tripoli"?|I meant the Halls of Montezuma.
{66220}{66278}- That's what you said.|- Never have I heard such mendacity!
{66280}{66330}- Charlatan!|- Wait!
{66332}{66442}If he says he's seen the world, then he's|seen the world. Right, Mr. Centipede?
{66468}{66512}- Right?|- Well...
{66513}{66593}I did used to live between two pages|of a National Geographic.
{66639}{66737}Very informative magazine, National|Geographic. Wonderful pictures.
{66739}{66845}You incompetent,|blithering nitwit!
{66847}{66931}All right, hoppy!|Them's fightin' words.
{66933}{66989}Put 'em up!|Put 'em up! Come on!
{66990}{67045}Gimme your best shot.
{67047}{67108}Whoa. Good shot.
{67110}{67160}Did you see what he did to me?
{67161}{67212}Serves ya right.
{67242}{67314}What do we do now?|Which way do we go?
{67316}{67380}Oh, it's simple, really. All we need|to do is determine our coordinates,
{67381}{67460}then use triangulation to chart|a direct route to New York.
{67461}{67541}- Then there's hope.|- Don't be ridiculous. There's no hope at all!
{67543}{67589}We don't have a compass.
{67591}{67640}We'll never reach New York.
{67641}{67760}We're gonna be stuck here forever. We're|gonna be frozen like living statues.
{67761}{67812}Dead living statues.
{67813}{67874}No dark hiding places.
{67876}{67935}No cozy leafin the park.
{67937}{68030}No city where dreams come true.
{68032}{68104}Don't ships have compasses?
{68105}{68166}No doubt. But to brave|those icy waters...
{68168}{68227}would mean certain death.
{68229}{68297}Only a fool would do it.
{68348}{68405}Geronimo!
{68407}{68484}- What? What was that?|- The Centipede jumped in!
{68486}{68544}Good heavens!|He's committed pesticide.
{68545}{68598}Oh, this is all|my doing.
{68600}{68657}Don't take all the credit.|I helped too.
{68659}{68758}- I have to go after him!|- Not on your life. You'll catch your death of cold.
{68760}{68865}- But he's my friend.|- James is right. Centipede is one of us.
{68866}{68918}Get on my back.|I'm going with you.
{68920}{68989}- You had better take good care of him.|- This I promise.
{68991}{69090}Stay by the line, and when|you feel two tugs, pull us up.
{69733}{69792}A skellington?
{69945}{70013}Jackpot!|A genuine compass!
{70049}{70128}Sounds like you need|a little oil, Captain.
{70157}{70238}Thank you, sir!|I'll be shovin' off now.
{70357}{70449}I should've worn a belt!
{70505}{70602}Holy ship wreck!
{70920}{70984}Listen, fellas,
{70986}{71093}I got a long history of back problems,|and I don't need it to get any longer!
{71192}{71268}Hey, that one felt pretty good.
{71321}{71394}It's Paul Bunyan coming|to cut me some slack. Whoa!
{71396}{71529}Whoa! Hey, pal, you're aimin'|a little low. He's gonna cut me in half!
{71614}{71713}Hey, sailors!|Looking for some kicks?
{71773}{71837}Oooh!|Cut me loose!
{71983}{72029}Get the compass!
{72115}{72205}- Have got it!|- Ubutu!
{72414}{72492}Gotcha!
{72494}{72550}Polly want a smacker?
{72593}{72652}Look out!
{72701}{72788}- Sounds like big trouble.|- Get ready to pull.
{72844}{72899}I got a good one for ya.
{72901}{72972}Why don't skeletons|play music in church?
{72973}{73047}'Cause they got no organs!
{73233}{73280}Noo-oo!
{73448}{73514}Oh, thank goodness!|You're all right!
{73516}{73586}- What happened to Centipede?|- He found a compass for us.
{73588}{73661}- And a shipload of pirates!|- Hold this. I am going back.
{73663}{73729}Do be careful,|Miss Spider.
{73918}{73980}Poor Centipede.
{73982}{74032}He saved our lives|down there.
{74033}{74100}- Look out!|- Miss Spider!
{74151}{74213}Centipede!
{74215}{74265}How am I lookin', kid?
{74267}{74393}Centipede, I do not know|whether to kill you or... kiss you.
{74461}{74512}- I'm so sorry.|- Hey, I'm sorry.
{74514}{74569}- My sincere apologies.|- I just wanna apologize.
{74571}{74621}- I just wanted to say...|- What I'm tryin' to say...
{74623}{74673}That's enough chitchat!|I'm freezin'!
{74675}{74726}Hello?|The compass is ready!
{74728}{74863}Mr. Centipede, would you please do us the honor|of navigating us out of this icebox?
{74865}{74962}- It would be my pleasure.|- I believe our position puts us very close...
{74964}{75052}I admire your bravery, Miss Spider.|I really do.
{75053}{75120}Why... thank you,|Mrs. Ladybug.
{75121}{75193}All right, boys.|Coffee break's over.
{75333}{75405}I'm looking forward|to a hopping good time...
{75407}{75471}in the Big Apple,|Mr. Centipede.
{75473}{75543}You said it, Mr. Grasshopper.
{75756}{75838}Oh, boy, what I wouldn't do|for a cup of coffee.
{75902}{75990}Cup of joe.
{76042}{76123}I say, old sport,|came to relieve you of your duties.
{76125}{76235}I said I'd steer the peach.|Have to steer the peach.
{76237}{76295}Can't quit... now.
{76297}{76355}Good show, old boy.
{76442}{76550}Thanks... Mr. Grasshopper.
{77653}{77739}- That music!|- Oh, Sir James! Did I disturb you?
{77741}{77802}So sorry.|I'll put this away.
{77804}{77849}No, no. I like it.
{77851}{77946}I used to hear it at my aunt's house|before I went to sleep.
{77948}{78044}That was you, wasn't it?|Or do all grasshoppers play music?
{78045}{78132}All grasshoppers... try.
{78133}{78202}I'm sure you've heard this.
{78281}{78346}Ghastly, isn't it?|Cricket stuff.
{78348}{78425}Music should be|the voice of the soul.
{78427}{78507}- What does that mean?|- It means that when I'm happy,
{78509}{78566}my music sounds like this.
{78923}{79020}When I'm sad,|it's like this.
{79243}{79360}When I was sad, I used to climb|in bed with my mom and dad.
{79361}{79433}But that was|a long time ago.
{79435}{79508}I'm sure they'd be|very proud of you, James.
{79510}{79571}I know we are.
{79832}{79927}/Take a little time|/Just look at where we are

{83704}{83797}- New York City.|- Breath taking!
{83798}{83853}- Stunning! Glorious.|- Look at the park.
{83855}{83926}- It's fabulous!|- We have made it!
{83928}{84018}What a wonderful sight!|There's Lady Liberty!
{84020}{84101}I can almost smell the lovely dirt.

{84199}{84245}See those lights!
{84247}{84356}Wa-hoo! Yippee!|Atta boy, Jimmy!
{84358}{84444}Good show, James.|The city awaits us.
{84445}{84550}Now remember, James,|first impression is very important.
{84830}{84924}- Oh, no!|- We'll be blown off course.
{84925}{85013}We'll wind up in Jersey!
{85089}{85184}- Could it be...|- No, it couldn't be.
{85185}{85265}It's the rhino!
{85266}{85322}Oh, James, do something.
{85425}{85513}Everyone, climb up|into the rigging!
{85515}{85561}Hurry!

{88305}{88365}Mr. Grasshopper?
{88392}{88453}Hello?|Is anyone there?
{89349}{89396}This isn't right.
{89398}{89468}Where's the|Empire State Building?
{90002}{90052}What the...
{90131}{90248}Officer!|There's a boy up there!
{90249}{90305}What?|A boy?
{90412}{90510}Mabel, we got us|a huge unidentified object here!
{90512}{90620}- What's it look like?|- Round, fuzzy. It looks sorta like a giant fruit or something.
{90621}{90671}- Well, what is it?|- I don't know what it is!
{90673}{90744}Just send us the biggest crane|in New York!
{91165}{91276}- Please, sir. How do I get to the Empire State Building?|- You're on top of it, kid.
{91277}{91339}We made it!
{91431}{91486}Well, I made it.
{91583}{91673}Hang on.
{91768}{91836}Have you seen|any big bugs tonight?
{91837}{91889}Big bugs? How big?
{92037}{92097}I hope they're all right.
{92520}{92581}Let's go. Let's go.|Stay back. Stay back.
{92759}{92824}Don't worry, kid.|You'll be all right.
{92826}{92878}Come on, sonny.|Don't be afraid now. I got you.
{92885}{92957}Stay away from those trucks!
{92959}{93018}What is this thing?
{93020}{93065}- Where you from?|- Why you here?
{93067}{93140}- Who? What? Where? When? Why?|- Hold your fire, fellas!
{93141}{93234}He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.|Here, I got you.
{93236}{93309}It's okay, little guy.|Nobody's gonna hurt you.
{94056}{94104}No.
{94526}{94594}Hello.
{94596}{94690}Little angel.
{94692}{94808}So kind of you to look after|our little lost lamb.
{94809}{94916}- Who are you?|- We are the boy's legal guardians.
{94917}{94971}We've missed him|so much.
{94973}{95039}So we'll just|take him home now.
{95041}{95100}And the peach, of course.|We're taking that as well.
{95101}{95164}Well, wait a minute.|Back up.
{95165}{95237}You mean to tell me|that this thing is a peach?
{95239}{95334}- It's not a peach. It's our peach.|- Our peach.
{95336}{95390}- Show him, Spongy.|- Yes.
{95609}{95686}- Looks like it's their peach all right.|- Yes!
{95688}{95779}- Yes. We're very proud of it.|- We're going to be in the record books.
{95781}{95850}It's not their peach.|The old man gave the green things to me.
{95852}{95948}- That's what made it grow.|- How dare you disagree with us!
{95950}{96061}Patience, sister.|Remember his... condition.
{96063}{96145}- His condition?|- He's a chronic liar.
{96146}{96217}Sad, really.|He needs his treatment.
{96219}{96283}Well, that's why we're here;|to bring him home.
{96285}{96368}So, you come here with us,|hey, lovey!
{96404}{96476}I'm not the one who's lying.|They are!
{96477}{96580}As you can see, Officer, it is urgent|that you release him to us immediately.
{96581}{96635}Let the boy speak!
{96744}{96836}All right, all right, all right!|Let's get to the bottom of this!
{96837}{96912}This thing is a peach.
{96913}{96961}Now, all right.|I'll buy that.
{96963}{97029}Now, does somebody wanna|tell me how it got here?
{97031}{97084}We attached it|to a hundred sea gulls.
{97086}{97145}Sea gulls?
{97147}{97263}That's what happened! Me and Miss Spider and|the Centipede and the Old Green Grasshopper.
{97265}{97343}I think he's gone mad.
{97345}{97404}This is all something|he dreamed up.
{97453}{97568}Well, maybe it started that way,|as a dream, but doesn't everything?
{97569}{97618}Those buildings,
{97620}{97689}these lights,|this whole city!
{97691}{97780}Somebody had to dream about it first,|and maybe that's what I did.
{97781}{97861}I dreamed about coming here,|but then I did it!
{97863}{97936}- The poor boy needs his medicine.|- Yes.
{97937}{97994}- So we'll just take him.|- And the peach.
{97996}{98096}Back to our cozy|little house on the hill.
{98098}{98193}- Come along. You're going home with us.|- No, I'm not.
{98194}{98289}What did you say?
{98290}{98402}I said...|no... I'm... not!
{98404}{98501}I hate that house and that cold room|and how I was always hungry.
{98503}{98549}All right, that's enough!
{98551}{98618}- And how you beat me!|- He's lying!
{98620}{98690}And told me I was nothing!
{98692}{98746}- Shut up!|- Shut up! Shut up!
{98748}{98837}No, not this time!
{98839}{98897}I flew the giant peach|across the ocean.
{98898}{98992}I landed on top of|the tallest building in the world.
{98993}{99080}I made it! I'm not the one|who's nothing. You are!
{99081}{99179}And I'm never going back with you!|Not me and not the peach.
{99181}{99244}How dare you speak|to us this way.
{99525}{99585}James! Up here.
{99586}{99672}Hello, we're here.
{99673}{99755}- Hey, buddy!|- What are they?
{99757}{99839}- Young James.|- Hey, Jimmy.
{99841}{99941}- Bugs!|- Need a little help down there?
{99943}{100012}Giant bugs!
{100013}{100082}Hey, you old biddies!
{100084}{100128}Help us!
{100130}{100193}- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.|- Hello, James!
{100195}{100264}I told you|they were real.
{100265}{100364}- Hello, old boy.|- Requesting clearance to land.
{100559}{100646}Miss Spider,|throw me a string!
{100757}{100848}Okay, pull them up.
{100850}{100905}Help!
{100907}{100972}Where are we going?
{101036}{101117}- Spin them around!|- You little...
{101181}{101232}Wrap them tightly!
{101397}{101470}Tighter! Tighter!
{101472}{101532}Well, I'll be a...
{101533}{101621}The kid was tellin' the truth.
{101623}{101708}Get those two creeps|outta here!
{101992}{102104}Stop the presses. I got a new front|page. "Big Bugs In The Big Apple."
{102105}{102200}In big bold print:|"Little Lindy Flies Giant Peach."

{103189}{103242}Hey!|What was your name?
{103255}{103317}It's James!
{103509}{103617}They ate that peach all|the way down to the pit.
{103658}{103751}And set it up in Central Park|as a permanent home.
{103793}{103853}And James Henry Trotter,
