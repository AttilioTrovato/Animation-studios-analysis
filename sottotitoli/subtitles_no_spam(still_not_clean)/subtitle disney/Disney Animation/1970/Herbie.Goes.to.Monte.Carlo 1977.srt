1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,606
- Destination, monsieur?
- Monte Carlo.

2
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,859
Uh, <i>rue,</i> uh, <i>de</i> "boisie-arie."

3
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,612
<i>Au rue Dubec,</i>

4
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,244
<i>a droite a place</i>
"dee-l-eena."

5
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,995
Will you give it to me
in English?

6
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,618
Sure. We're lost.

7
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,329
Thanks.

8
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,580
Hey!

9
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,291
- Herbie!
- What's he doing?

10
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,633
I think he's getting us un-lost.

11
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,052
Hi, there. Say, uh,

12
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,180
we're looking for the
Trans France Race Exposition.

13
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,762
<i>Oui,</i> straight ahead
on your right.

14
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,850
You can't miss it.

15
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,806
- That's going to be some race.
- Yeah.

16
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,850
Well, you're looking
at the winner right here!

17
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,981
This car? The winner?

18
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,031
- He didn't.
- He did.

19
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,722
All of this
for the museum payroll?

20
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,269
The most magnificent
diamond in the world!

21
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,267
<i>L'etoile de Joie!</i>

22
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,184
Could we have just
a little peek?

23
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:31,405
On this very afternoon,
at 1:00, precisely,

24
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,202
you and all of Paris will be
able to take the peek!

25
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,170
Now, fresh from his triumphs

26
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,504
on the European
racing circuit,

27
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,760
Bruno Von Stickle...

28
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,885
Who'll be driving
his laser 917 GTE coupe.

29
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,808
Here we have
a magnificent Pantera...

30
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:05,481
Ah, I see the American entry is
just arriving, Mr. Jim Douglas.

31
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,275
Mr. Douglas will be driving a...

32
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,072
A-a...

33
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,077
Mr. Douglas will be driving
a most unusual entry.

34
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,536
Something funny
must've happened.

35
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,079
Uh-huh. Us.

36
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,256
How about giving Jim Douglas

37
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,257
and his partner,
Wheely Applegate...

38
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,338
A nice, warm welcome, huh?

39
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,928
Eh, this little car of yours
is the toast of America.

40
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,229
When was your last win?

41
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,686
Uh... 12 years ago.

42
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,065
That was only because,
uh, that was our last race.

43
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,230
Yeah.

44
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,443
Yes, this race... We're kind of
staging a comeback here,

45
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,987
and so it's very
important to us.

46
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,911
I-I mean, we won't
be coming back very far

47
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,996
unless we qualify, will we?

48
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,624
Qualify? Are you kiddin'?

49
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,375
Don't let his modesty

50
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,879
or this little car coming out
of retirement fool ya!

51
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,632
There isn't a finer-tuned,
cleaner engine anywhere!

52
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,717
I'm sure it
should be easy to keep clean.

53
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,141
All you have to do is

54
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,469
drop it in the washing machine
along with your socks.

55
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,187
Appreciate your humor,

56
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,688
but just don't
you worry about

57
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,065
this little washing
machine... Car!

58
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,106
It's a real jewel!

59
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,785
But Monsieur Ribeaux,

60
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,075
isn't it too much
responsibility...

61
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,911
- For one man?
- One man?

62
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,081
One man and the finest
security system

63
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,416
that can be devised.

64
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,751
All in the computer.

65
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,345
Now, this alone

66
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,302
will keep the diamonds safe
from the grasp of a thief.

67
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,638
But, monsieur, one would
only have to reach in and...

68
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,195
The pillow is sensitive
to the heat of the hand

69
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,026
when it gets close
to the diamond.

70
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,536
I'm sorry, monsieur.

71
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,226
What does that do?

72
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,354
I'm engaging a system
of electric eye beams

73
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,894
that surrounds the pedestal.

74
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,107
One last precaution,
gentlemen.

75
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,567
Would you please
step out of the room?

76
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,631
Now the entire floor
is a trap!

77
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,220
The mere ashes from a cigar
would activate the alarm.

78
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,161
Right on schedule.

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,289
Only ten steps
to six million dollars.

80
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,463
One step to Devil's Island if
anything touches that floor.

81
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,768
Pardon, Monsieur Ribeaux,

82
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,892
but you forgot to give me the
computer and the numbers.

83
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,348
I did not forget!

84
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,318
They were put in my trust
and will remain with me.

85
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,606
One does not part with
the only copy in existence!

86
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,996
Patience, Quincey.
Electronics is the answer.

87
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,166
This notebook is our passport
to the future.

88
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,744
I think I shall put my trust
in this bit of rope.

89
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,392
When the man has it
all worked out for us,

90
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,639
silly not to use it.

91
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,317
You had to bring
the whole kit, didn't you?

92
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,986
I was just checking
for the radar beam.

93
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,199
It's there.

94
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,202
Now it isn't.

95
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,468
Some chunk of rock, eh?

96
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,262
One could spend a lifetime

97
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,465
without setting eyes
on a rock like that.

98
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,391
You'll love getting your hands on it.

99
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,641
Ah!

100
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,312
Patience, Quincey.
Pillow's the trap.

101
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,106
One more set of numbers.

102
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,480
Why can't a man write
an "o" that looks like an "o"?

103
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,733
Or is it a "9"?

104
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,322
Can't take a chance.

105
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,163
I don't trust nobody.

106
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,036
I'm glad I come prepared.

107
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,077
The old ways are still
the best ways.

108
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,255
We've got six minutes
before the guard checks.

109
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,081
Get on with it!

110
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,153
Aren't you ever gonna
get that thing fixed?

111
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,405
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I...

112
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,951
- Excuse me! Oh, I just, eh...
- Oh.

113
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,124
Jim!

114
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,642
A word to the wise.

115
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,470
Paris may be the land of love,

116
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,186
but it can also be the land
of heartbreak.

117
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,602
I'll tell you what I'll do.

118
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,645
I'll make a deal with you.

119
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,648
I'm willing to resist
the girls, if you are.

120
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,868
- Well, that's some sacrifice.
- I know.

121
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,953
But I'm willing to make it.

122
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,993
You're made of
strong stuff, Wheely.

123
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,003
Patience, patience, Quincey.

124
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,467
You tell
that to the guard.

125
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,257
He'll be here in two minutes.

126
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,185
Give me that!

127
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,272
Well, we're comin' into this
big right hand sweeper, see.

128
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,820
Dropped him into third gear
and really jumped on it.

129
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,197
Took three cars.

130
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,485
Then back into fourth,
and we were flyin'!

131
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,824
Tach-in'
seven or eight thousand.

132
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,365
We blew off the lead car
100 yards from the finish line.

133
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,203
Won it going away.
How about that?

134
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,960
Hmm?

135
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,508
<i>Je ne comprens pas,
parlez anglais.</i>

136
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,965
I didn't understand
what he was saying.

137
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,049
That's okay.

138
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,638
He didn't understand
what you were saying either.

139
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,719
Come to think of it,

140
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,603
I don't think I understood
what you were saying.

141
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,357
There's no more time.

142
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,234
That guard's practically
in the door.

143
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,187
You want that stone,
don't ya?

144
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah, and there's
only one way to get it.

145
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,555
It's not possible.

146
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,942
<i>Attention!</i>

147
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,502
<i>Attention, everyone,
attention!</i>

148
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,956
<i>Nobody is to leave the area.
I repeat.</i>

149
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,920
<i>- Nobody is to leave the area.</i>
- We still have to qualify!

150
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,504
Come on!

151
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,634
- What's the trouble?
- I-I don't know!

152
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,138
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

153
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,766
<i>there has been a theft
in the museum.</i>

154
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,475
Everyone will be searched
before leaving the area.

155
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,355
<i>I repeat.</i>

156
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,029
<i>Nobody is to leave the area
until they have been searched.</i>

157
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,402
Here, mate,

158
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,655
there's no point in us both
getting caught, is there?

159
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,499
No point in either of us
getting caught.

160
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,342
<i>I repeat.
Nobody is to leave the area.</i>

161
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,802
I repeat.
Nobody is to leave the area

162
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,846
until he has been searched.

163
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,031
We'll never see it again!

164
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,991
That little car there?
Indeed you can.

165
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,875
It will be in a showroom
on the Champs-Elysées

166
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,373
at 4:30 this afternoon.

167
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,798
Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,715
But are you sure all
the security precautions

169
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,757
had been taken?

170
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,719
I've searched my memory.

171
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,558
Could I have forgotten
something?

172
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,231
Inspector, some residue
from a footprint.

173
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,559
I might have overlooked it,

174
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,773
but I seemed to hear
your voice calling out,

175
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,197
"Fontenoy, remember,
no clue is too small!"

176
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,654
Did you also hear me saying,

177
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,237
"Take it to lab and get it
analyzed, Fontenoy?"

178
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,789
Yes, sir, and I'm doing just that.

179
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,630
No!

180
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,591
No, I couldn't have
forgotten anything.

181
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,423
I am as sure
the security was on yesterday

182
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,305
as I am sure it's off today!

183
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,727
Fontenoy!

184
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,859
<i>Attention, please.</i>

185
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,155
<i>The qualifying rounds
will begin in eight minutes.</i>

186
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,044
- Douglas and Applegate.
- Douglas.

187
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,120
Ah, yes, Monsieur Douglas.

188
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,164
You're in the heat
after this one.

189
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,717
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

190
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,636
That's the same heat
I'm in, Douglas.

191
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,635
And you're going to need
more than luck.

192
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,681
You're going to need wings.

193
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,603
Oh, yeah? Well, you may be
in for a little surprise.

194
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,603
I can see your surprise.

195
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,476
It is very little.

196
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,194
<i>Attention...</i>

197
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,869
Look for an even
bigger surprise

198
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,953
when the race starts.

199
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,174
<i>There
will be qualifying</i>

200
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,504
<i>today and tomorrow,</i>

201
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:09,340
<i>with the top 16 times running
in the Trans France race.</i>

202
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,756
You are not in this heat!
Come back!

203
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,432
Say, Herbie,
where you going?

204
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,798
Herbie, you could
get us disqualified!

205
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,474
He could get us killed!

206
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,735
- What was that?
- I don't know!

207
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,117
Forget the music!

208
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,409
Whoa!

209
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,593
He's out of his mind.

210
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,337
He's out of his mind, all right.

211
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,885
Over that luscious
little Lancia.

212
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,150
What is...

213
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,909
I'm telling you, Paris
and women have got him.

214
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,487
I'm gonna have to warn him
the same way I did you.

215
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,413
Like father, like car.

216
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,749
What are you doing?

217
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,223
- Now, wait a minute, buddy...
- What do you mean, "buddy"?

218
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,802
- Uh, Miss Buddy.
- You... You...

219
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,728
Yeah, Jim Douglas.
And I'm very sorry.

220
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,809
You think...

221
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,606
That because
I'm a woman driver,

222
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,901
you can get away
with anything you please!

223
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,233
Well, I'm not a pigeon
for your fun and games.

224
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,568
I've had it with you clowns!

225
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,906
No, I'm not the clown.
Believe me, it was Herbie.

226
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,072
Oh, yes, you're blaming
your dizzy mechanic.

227
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,906
No, no, it's...

228
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,629
Herbie's the car,
and he's kinda like a person.

229
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,081
He's... now, I know
that sounds funny.

230
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,508
Crazy, is more like it!

231
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,095
Well, what were you doing
out there, Douglas?

232
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,922
Well, it's kinda hard
to explain, sir...

233
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,216
Not for me, it isn't.

234
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,009
He doesn't want a woman
in the race.

235
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,141
Look, Miss Darcy, you'll be given
another chance to qualify.

236
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,472
We're terribly sorry.

237
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:31,150
You're sorry, he's sorry,
everybody's sorry.

238
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,444
But I didn't qualify!

239
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,229
<i>Attention,
Antonio Vittoro.</i>

240
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,569
If you wish to qualify,
Mr. Douglas,

241
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,109
you have exactly 10 minutes.

242
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,945
Hear that, Herbie?

243
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,531
You forget that powder puff
and get your mind on racing!

244
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,161
You better believe it!

245
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,329
Gilbert.

246
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,504
We're going to cook that
chicken, European-style.

247
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,880
When he sticks out his neck,

248
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,048
- we will chop it off.
- Uh-huh. <i>Oui, oui!</i>

249
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,678
<i>Jawohl, jawohl.</i>

250
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,147
We'll see whose neck
gets chopped off.

251
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,726
Right, Herbie?

252
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,685
<i>Attention,
attention, attention!</i>

253
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,602
You better close
your mouth, turkey,

254
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,350
'cause you're gonna
get our tire marks

255
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,181
right across your teeth!

256
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,536
- Where'd they go?
- I really got snookered.

257
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,864
I'm even rustier than I thought.

258
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,461
Hey! Herbie,
what are you doing?

259
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,248
It's her again!

260
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,509
Oh, no!

261
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,898
Well, it took a crowd to do it.

262
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,735
But at least we lost
the Lancia.

263
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:46,243
And not to mention the
first qualifying round.

264
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,046
Did you get a hold
of Double X?

265
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,707
He wasn't very happy.

266
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,752
Who is? Where is
that stupid little car?

267
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,171
Patience, patience...
Oh, excuse me, sir.

268
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,881
There are impressive
racing cars here,

269
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,345
but I don't seem
to see the little Volkswagen.

270
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,520
Ah, you mean the Douglas car.
It will be here.

271
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,598
Patience, my friend, patience.

272
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,105
One more person says
"patience" to me, I'll...

273
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,185
We better have it now,

274
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,942
because if we don't turn up
with that diamond,

275
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,949
Double X is going to mark
the spot where we're buried.

276
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,075
Here, here. Don't dig
our graves just yet.

277
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,634
Come on, let's grab it.

278
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,972
- Don't tell me, "patience"!
- In front of 100 witnesses?

279
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,347
We need a plan.

280
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,051
Attention, everyone.
Attention.

281
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,932
We would like to show a film

282
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,518
of the route
the racing cars will take

283
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,065
when they leave Paris.

284
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,892
If someone
will catch the lights

285
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,943
while I draw the drapes...

286
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,940
I think the gentleman
just gave us a plan.

287
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,584
The fine machines you have seen here

288
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,341
will be among those
testing the grueling route,

289
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,093
stretching through
our fair city,

290
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,799
twisting through
the French Alps...

291
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,516
Back up slowly, as if
nothing was the matter.

292
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,189
In the city, the cars will
be able to pick up speed...

293
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,227
As they race along
the French countryside.

294
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,860
...only by the challenge

295
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,533
that becomes evident...

296
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,161
As we approach
the famous French Alps.

297
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,290
It's not here, max.
The car's just not here.

298
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,619
...will test the endurance...
Of even the sturdiest of cars.

299
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,544
Perhaps we're backing
in the wrong direction.

300
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,873
Just keep backing up.

301
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,924
There remains the final dash
for Monte Carlo.

302
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:11,847
And for someone,
victory is just a step away.

303
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,151
- Herbie! Excuse me.
- You mean, no Herbie.

304
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,751
Garcon! Garcon!

305
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,706
<i>Garcon!</i>

306
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,832
<i>Excusez moi!</i>

307
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,460
<i>Oui.</i>

308
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,511
<i>- Etes-vous,</i> cuckoo?
<i>- Oui.</i> Cuckoo.

309
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:50,891
My car. My car!
Has anybody seen my car?

310
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,395
- Oh, that was your car?
- Yes, yes. It's gone!

311
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,396
- Yes, it's gone.
- Did you see who took it?

312
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,735
Not exactly, mademoiselle.

313
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,445
Excuse me,
I hate to bother you...

314
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,323
You! I should have
known I'd see you.

315
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,281
You and trouble go together.

316
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,457
Yeah, okay.
Look, we've lost our car...

317
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,626
And I'd just like
to know if you'd seen it,

318
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,702
by any chance.

319
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,917
Who cares about
your silly Volkswagen?

320
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,374
My Lancia has been stolen!

321
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,511
- Stolen?
- Uh, uh, your car?

322
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,882
- And your car.
- Yeah.

323
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,014
- I saw them both.
- Then you saw who stole them!

324
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,773
You would not believe this.
I would not believe this.

325
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,604
- No one would believe this.
- What?

326
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,733
I think they steal each other.

327
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,529
Come on.

328
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,455
Taxi!

329
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,126
Cuckoo.

330
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,541
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Coo!

331
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,862
Talk about
a needle in a haystack.

332
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,033
How are we gonna find 'em?

333
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

334
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,951
My life is riding on that car.

335
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,367
Lady, I got a few things
to prove myself.

336
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,374
Where would you
take a boyfriend

337
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,454
on first night to Paris?

338
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,668
"Boyfriend"?

339
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,172
Don't tell me this is your
cute way of making a pass.

340
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,505
If I had romance in mind,
would he be along?

341
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,547
Right.

342
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:56,725
- It's Herbie.
- Herbie. I don't believe this.

343
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,895
Well, it's true!

344
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,188
There's something
about that car.

345
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,311
He's got a... He...

346
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,191
Well, we've been through
a lot together.

347
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,980
Yeah, well, nothing like this.

348
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,294
<i>Hey! Regardons! Regarde!</i>

349
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,466
<i>...Bateaux-Mouches.</i>

350
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,223
Do you think this is
something to laugh about?

351
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,555
Forgive me, mademoiselle.
I laugh at the radio.

352
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,597
Two automobiles,

353
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,058
they take a ride
on the <i>Bateaux-Mouches.</i>

354
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,438
Would you
believe such a thing?

355
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,939
<i>Bateaux-Mouches?</i>

356
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,064
Take a left at that bridge!

357
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,846
Maybe I can explain this
over dinner tonight.

358
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,267
Maybe not.

359
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:36,825
I don't know, Herbie.
12 years is a long time.

360
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,622
Hope we can handle it.

361
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,456
Hope I can handle it.

362
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,086
- Well, all taken care of, Jim.
- Yeah?

363
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,627
Had a little talk with Herbie.
Had to straighten him out.

364
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,929
I don't mind havin'
a car that's got a heart,

365
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,339
but I will not tolerate

366
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,641
a car falling in love
with another car.

367
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,051
What did you expect him
to fall in love with,

368
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,135
the Goodyear blimp?

369
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,395
The Goodyear...
Yeah.

370
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,313
Anyway, I said, "Listen Herbie,

371
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,146
"we're here
for one thing only.

372
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,977
"And that's to make the
biggest comeback

373
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,361
"in racing history.

374
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,986
"So, no women in training camp.

375
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,649
"Just forget that little chick.

376
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,985
"And you can do it.

377
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,119
"Just a matter of mind
over metal."

378
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,620
- You expecting company?
- No.

379
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,255
Detective Fontenoy here.

380
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,334
And this is the famous
Inspector Bouchet.

381
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,426
I'm Jim Douglas

382
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,506
and this is my partner
Wheely Applegate.

383
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,136
Look, if there's a problem

384
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,098
about our car cruisin'
on the <i>Bateaux-Mouches...</i>

385
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,929
<i>Bateaux-Mouches?</i> Eh, no, no.

386
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,685
It's about the
six million dollar diamond

387
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,894
stolen this morning.

388
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,317
Perhaps the most beautiful
diamond in all the world.

389
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,351
Fontenoy.

390
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,694
No?

391
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,197
We are questioning everyone

392
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,278
who was in the area
at the time.

393
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,359
Perhaps you can help us.

394
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,146
Pushing the car won't help me
get the cap off.

395
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,476
- Must've rolled.
- Well, pull the hand brake on.

396
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,784
Door's locked.

397
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
The window!

398
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,037
Put your hand
through the window!

399
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,292
Ooh!

400
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,545
Aah.

401
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,094
Let me get at it!

402
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,929
I'm gonna hotwire this car.

403
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,631
We'll get the diamond
at the garage.

404
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,933
Right.

405
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,223
Well, I'm not waiting.

406
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,560
Car, it's either you... Or me!

407
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,277
Oof!

408
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,745
I suppose
you're going to tell me

409
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,784
that car started up
and drove away by itself.

410
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,963
No, and I'm not going
to tell Double X that either.

411
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,365
What's happening?

412
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,287
There's seven cars ahead of us

413
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,169
and we're in last place.
That's what's happening!

414
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,501
- Darcy.
<i>- Oui.</i> Qualifying today?

415
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,340
I hope so.

416
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,514
New Herbie?
He's not even an old Herbie.

417
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,186
He's not any Herbie at all!

418
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,310
My whole lecture must've
fallen on a deaf carburetor.

419
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,021
He doesn't need a lecture.
He needs an old-age pension.

420
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,352
You listen to me, Herbie,
and you listen good.

421
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,812
You and I didn't come
out of moth balls

422
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,231
to be the laughingstock
of the continent.

423
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,784
Either get the lead out
of your pants right now,

424
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,361
or I'm going to ship you
back to the states,

425
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,287
have you stuffed
and hung on a wall

426
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,240
in Retirement Village!

427
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,222
Ah!

428
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,070
Ooh! Now you're talking.
We got the old Herbie back!

429
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,398
The old Herbie and the
new Herbie, rolled into one!

430
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,924
I'm telling you,
it's the old Herbie,

431
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,468
and he's doing it for us!

432
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,439
He's not doing it for us.

433
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,771
He's doing it for her.

434
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,289
Okay, so he did it for her.

435
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,548
I never saw anything like that.

436
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,474
- Congratulations, you did it!
- Thank you, thank you!

437
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,806
- Somebody did it.
- Who cares, Wheely?

438
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,973
It's, "Hello, comeback!"

439
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,608
In record time for this track.

440
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,518
You shattered
Von Stickle's mark.

441
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,479
<i>Congratulations, Douglas.</i>

442
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,907
You have just won the right
to taste my dust tomorrow.

443
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,780
And mine, Douglas.

444
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,616
Today, you break my record.

445
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,908
Tomorrow, I will turn
your "Hello, comeback"

446
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,914
into "Goodbye forever."

447
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,586
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

448
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,000
Couple of
charm school dropouts.

449
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,085
Yeah.

450
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,231
Well, one showboat
deserves another.

451
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,150
I'll go get him.

452
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,580
<i>Félicitations!</i>

453
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,871
Absolutely amazing!

454
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,286
I knew I had a good car
under me, but...

455
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,371
The exact same time
as the Douglas car.

456
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,630
- A track record!
- What?

457
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,333
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

458
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,760
Oh, thank you for staying
off the track.

459
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,509
It's one way
I can prove what I can do.

460
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,932
Well, it wasn't exactly you.

461
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,725
You've got a real problem

462
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,601
about women in racing,
Mr. Douglas.

463
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,605
What is it? We drive too slow...
Or too fast?

464
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,478
Oh, I didn't mean that.

465
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,935
It's not you at all,
it's your car.

466
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,437
And my car.

467
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,276
Excuse me, I don't want
to hear about your car.

468
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,356
No, I have to tell you this.

469
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,442
I know it's gonna be hard
to believe, but...

470
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,404
You see,
Herbie's not just a car.

471
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,036
I didn't believe it myself
at first,

472
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
but the little guy
has actually got a...

473
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,752
He's...

474
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,257
When a car like Herbie
comes to Paris,

475
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,668
he meets a beautiful Lancia,

476
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,378
that is also a car like Herbie,

477
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,929
with a, with a...

478
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,977
You know, it's natural
that they're gonna fall in...

479
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,232
You're right.

480
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,440
I wouldn't believe it either.

481
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,651
When the men come by
from the booby hatch,

482
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,323
go quietly.

483
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,496
Just trying to warn you
about your car.

484
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,203
Let me warn you about me.

485
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,082
I'm in this race to win,
and frankly, I'd like to see...

486
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,836
You and your car
disappear entirely.

487
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,798
Oh.

488
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,034
Quincey.

489
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,160
Pull over! We want that car!

490
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,247
What are you going to do?

491
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,413
I'm gonna pull over.

492
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,936
Hang on!

493
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,459
Ohh.

494
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,429
Darkness is about
to fall upon you.

495
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,018
Amazing!

496
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,398
Whoa!

497
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,954
Hot, hot, hot!

498
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,960
You...

499
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,421
They're still comin'!

500
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,961
I think they are
trying to kill us!

501
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,262
<i>Mon dieu! Mon dieu!</i>

502
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,999
I never
thought she'd go that far

503
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,372
to make us disappear.

504
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,919
Who's that?

505
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,497
That cute little
time bomb, Diane.

506
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,457
She set us up to knock us
out of the race,

507
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,591
just like she said.

508
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,886
Now, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.

509
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,510
Oh, of course not.
They never say what they mean.

510
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,386
That's what makes
the female of the species

511
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,012
deadlier than the male.

512
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,724
You read that someplace.

513
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,931
Yes, and I've got a mother,
three sisters

514
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,936
and two ex-wives to prove it.

515
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,983
They never told me
they wanted me out,

516
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,315
but every time I came home,
the lock was changed.

517
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,946
I don't take that kind of
strong-arm stuff

518
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,524
from anybody, male or female!

519
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,318
Then somebody better teach
this female

520
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,451
the rules of the game...

521
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,574
Before the game is over.

522
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,700
If she doesn't know 'em now,

523
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,032
she will when
I get through with her!

524
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,543
You might as well
settle back, Herbie.

525
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,547
Once Jim gets started,
nothin' can stop him.

526
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,923
Who hired thugs?

527
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,672
I'm just as good as anybody
out there on that track!

528
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,549
And I don't need anybody
to win my races for me!

529
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,629
We...

530
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,057
That is the trouble
with you, all of you!

531
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,720
You don't think
a woman can do anything!

532
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,772
Yeah, I know he seems
like a quiet sort of guy,

533
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,943
but when a fight
is inevitable, he never ducks.

534
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,109
"Women are
supposed to be nurses

535
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:46,318
"and secretaries
and school teachers!"

536
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,027
I've taken that all my life.

537
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,242
I took it from my mother
and my father!

538
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,166
And my aunts and my uncles!

539
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,621
But I'm not going
to take it from you!

540
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,425
When old Jim gets started,
I hate to get in his way.

541
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,461
He's a regular steamroller.

542
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,304
- Whoa!
- Coward!

543
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,600
I'm a race driver
and I can win it on my own!

544
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,351
Oh!

545
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,102
You know, I think you can.

546
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,228
Double X?
Uh, yeah.

547
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:27,032
I'm afraid we-we-we've
had another complication.

548
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,869
<i>I'm beginning to think
you are the complication.</i>

549
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,580
That...

550
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,207
That item should have been
in my hands by now!

551
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,671
Oh, don't worry, sir.
It's still in the gas tank.

552
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,750
Then bring me the gas tank!
What are you waiting for?

553
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,136
We've lost them again, sir.
We don't know where they are.

554
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,721
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Inspector Bouchet.

555
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,390
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

556
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,591
Impossible!

557
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,930
Are you trying to tell me

558
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,847
a couple of
simpleminded Americans...

559
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,806
Ah...

560
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,068
- Disappeared?
- Hold on.

561
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,692
Hope we're not
disturbing you, Inspector.

562
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,318
No, gentlemen!

563
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,527
Your timing could not
be more perfect.

564
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,656
Good.

565
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,784
I want to thank you for
your continued cooperation...

566
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,870
In this matter
of the stolen diamond.

567
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,327
Tonight, we're asking
for your help.

568
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,287
Somebody's out
to get our car!

569
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,330
Ah, that's impossible.

570
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,337
I think they're trying
to knock us out of the race!

571
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,463
Ahh!

572
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,344
I was wondering if there's
some way, I don't know,

573
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,847
we can put the car
in protective custody

574
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,881
for the night.

575
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:33,966
That is, if you're not too busy

576
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,601
trying to find that diamond.

577
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,677
No, no!

578
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,063
One is just as important
as the other, I assure you.

579
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,482
I'll only be a moment. Uh...

580
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh! I-I mean, uh...

581
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,871
- We'll wait in the car.
- Good idea.

582
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,707
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to it.

583
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,038
Not now.

584
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,007
Hello.
The car is here.

585
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,169
Never mind how...

586
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,257
Never mind how.

587
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,548
No, no!
It's too risky for me.

588
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,308
I will see to it that the car
will be at number 32,

589
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,761
Avenue Mozart
within the hour.

590
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,729
Don't get lost on the way!

591
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,871
Your worry is now my worry,
gentlemen. Rest easily.

592
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,283
I'll take personal charge
of this valuable possession.

593
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,710
- Inspector!
- What is it, Fontenoy?

594
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,587
Off duty or not, sir,

595
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,669
I couldn't sleep,
thinking about the diamond...

596
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,295
And how it would
be weighing on your mind.

597
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,877
At the moment, Fontenoy,

598
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,546
I have a car
weighing on my mind.

599
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,931
Somebody's trying to knock
us out of the race.

600
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,134
Well, with your excellent time
in the trials,

601
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,060
it would not take a master
of deduction

602
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,266
like Inspector Bouchet...

603
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,188
To see that you have
an excellent chance to win!

604
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,937
Which is why I personally
will ensure

605
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,984
the safety
of this automobile.

606
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:13,195
Now, put your minds at ease.
Get a good night's sleep.

607
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,901
Thank you! You too, Herbie.

608
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,120
A big day tomorrow, pal.

609
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,163
- Good night.
- Good night.

610
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,913
- No, no. Permit me, sir.
- What do you mean?

611
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,294
You have enough responsibility
trying to find the diamond.

612
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,043
- I'll look after the car.
- Don't be ridiculous!

613
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,671
Aah, aah!

614
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,880
What are you doing?

615
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,091
Anything for you
and the force.

616
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,805
Get out of the car!

617
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:44,726
Leave it to me, sir.

618
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,900
I'll keep this little car
hidden so no one will find it.

619
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,244
Fontenoy...

620
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,202
My best man.

621
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,128
Huh.

622
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,334
- Good night.
- Good night.

623
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,714
My very best.

624
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,846
We've checked that, sir.
It's nowhere.

625
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,932
We've covered the whole city.
Now what?

626
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:32,069
In the morning,
before the race,

627
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:35,523
that ridiculous little car
will get gasoline.

628
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,443
When it does,
you'll be there.

629
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,618
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

630
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,244
<i>to the inaugural running
of the Trans France race.</i>

631
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,620
They're all here:

632
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,793
qualifying drivers and cars
from the world over,

633
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,711
each looking forward,
expectantly,

634
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,630
for the chance
at the magnificent trophy...

635
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,082
And the $20,000
winner-take-all prize.

636
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,211
This promises to be one of
the most punishing races ever.

637
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,422
And these drivers know it.

638
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,428
They've no doubt gone
through these cars,

639
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,384
time after time after time.

640
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,684
And yet, we have them all here,

641
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,642
still refining
and tuning car after car,

642
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,894
each preparing
for the gruelling race...

643
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,562
That will test the endurance
of man and machine.

644
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,446
I just wish I had
a machine to test.

645
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,565
I hope, uh, what's-his-name

646
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,822
didn't hide Herbie so well,
he can't find him.

647
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,201
I wish you hadn't said that.
I mean, I'm a mechanic.

648
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,832
And a mechanic is nothing
without his car.

649
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,750
A million and one details

650
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,661
have to be taken care of
for a race.

651
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,339
You know me, how I pride
myself on being thorough.

652
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,293
My tools!
Where's my tools!

653
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,131
Right here.

654
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,642
- I knew that.
- Uh-huh.

655
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,022
Inspector, the race is about
to begin! Where's our car?

656
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,354
Believe me,
I am as concerned as you are!

657
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,438
But I'm sure Fontenoy
will be here.

658
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,201
He's unpredictable,
but he's dependable.

659
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,368
What?

660
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,788
Let me check
headquarters again.

661
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,127
He'll be here.

662
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,674
You be ready.

663
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,137
Who's that?

664
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,182
He's Double X, you dummy.

665
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,930
Uh-oh, better duck.
Here comes trouble.

666
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,143
Hello.

667
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,063
Hello.

668
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:41,612
- Uh, look, about last night.
- I know. Me too.

669
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,820
Sorry.

670
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,994
Not about missing me
with that vase, I hope.

671
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,663
No, no.

672
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,162
I guess I was
a little uptight last night.

673
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,542
Nervous about the race.

674
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,130
Yeah, yeah. Well, I threw a few
brick bats myself.

675
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,211
In the wrong direction.

676
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,211
We didn't get off to
a flying start, did we?

677
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,432
Herbie and I take a little
getting used to.

678
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:12,013
When you keep
including Herbie like that,

679
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,681
you take a lot
of getting used to.

680
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,029
By the way, where is... it?

681
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,524
- Well, I...
- Douglas,

682
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,951
did you misplace
your little car?

683
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,696
Just temporarily.

684
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,866
You should look under a rock
or two. You might find it.

685
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,160
No, not under a rock, Gilbert.

686
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,545
Under a gravestone.

687
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,581
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

688
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,884
<i>All drivers, bring your
machines to the grid.</i>

689
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,212
<i>Five minutes 'til race time.</i>

690
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,138
It's just as well, Douglas.

691
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:51,476
You know the saying,
"They never come back."

692
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,148
- Well, I better go.
- Diane!

693
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,531
Good luck.

694
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,943
I think you mean that.

695
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,747
<i>Drivers will please take
your position...</i>

696
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,703
<i>As quickly as possible.</i>

697
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:18,393
- Well, take the brake off!
- The brake is off!

698
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,979
You know somethin'?

699
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,984
That Lancia's waiting
on Herbie.

700
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,488
Well, so are we, and all we
need is her hanging around.

701
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,575
All right! Push it, push it!

702
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,991
- No, <i>mademoiselle!</i>
- Listen, I...

703
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,698
I hope you had nothing
to do with this.

704
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,499
I didn't, but I think
I can tell you who did.

705
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,497
I know, it's your Herbie.

706
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,161
That's right! Herbie's missing

707
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,422
and your Lancia's
missing Herbie.

708
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,716
You must think
I'm an absolute fool

709
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,010
with this
"Herbie, Herbie, Herbie."

710
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,840
Well, I don't believe in fairy
tales or Herbie or you!

711
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,176
Jim, pop the hood, will ya?

712
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,559
What are you doing?

713
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,767
You want your car
started, don't ya?

714
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,904
Listen, uh,
I know how you feel,

715
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,361
but you better
get over it right now.

716
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,779
Forget Herbie.

717
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,035
You know why he isn't
here, don't you?

718
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,667
He's found somebody
else, that's why.

719
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,795
He didn't have the guts to tell
you himself, so I'm telling you.

720
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,962
Oh, yeah, we're talkin'
about the same guy, all right.

721
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:32,592
Old Herbie. Old fun-lovin',
fickle, Herbie.

722
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,310
Now you see him,

723
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,058
now you don't.

724
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,889
He's right, you know.

725
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,690
So far, we've had to tell this
to a Fiat,

726
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,146
a Thunderbird
and an Austin-Healey.

727
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,320
I know how you feel. It's...

728
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,652
Fun while it lasted, but...

729
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,868
You know, the truth is,
you weren't the first

730
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,244
and you won't be the last.

731
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,245
You might as well take off.

732
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,255
Will somebody help me
start my car?

733
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,003
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

734
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,921
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>
Let me have a look.

735
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,432
Thank you!

736
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,512
No problem.

737
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,684
I was beginning to think

738
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,761
everybody around here
was crazy.

739
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,523
Well, so much for the Lancia.

740
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,950
Yeah. So much for
both of them, I guess.

741
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,333
Douglas, let's go.

742
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,164
Don't you realize you've
got pole position?

743
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,170
I also realize
we don't have a car.

744
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,126
But it'll be here.

745
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,588
It'd better be. In two
minutes, Douglas,

746
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,506
or you can try again next year.

747
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,430
<i>Mesdames et monsieurs...</i>

748
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,268
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

749
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,986
<i>the first running
of the Trans France race...</i>

750
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,821
<i>Is about to begin.</i>

751
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,552
What's that?

752
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,604
<i>It's an armored truck.</i>

753
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,900
That armored truck is us!

754
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,070
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes. Yes.

755
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,123
Where's Herbie?
Are you crazy?

756
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,461
We're supposed
to be in a race,

757
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,585
and here you are guarding
the Bank of England...

758
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,045
Or the crown jewels
or who knows what!

759
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,051
We didn't travel 6,000 miles

760
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,758
just to see
some French pastry

761
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,342
dressed up like a tin soldier.

762
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,299
I'll tell you something.
I've had it with the French...

763
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,760
The men, women and the...

764
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,436
Herbie?

765
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,108
Are we still in it?

766
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,816
From the looks of it, you'll be
starting and finishing in last place.

767
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,869
Quickly, you've no time to lose.
You have things to attend to.

768
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,949
- Gas! Let's move it, Wheely!
- Check! Top of my list!

769
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,962
Fill it up!

770
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,798
Monsieur Douglas, stop!

771
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,762
What do you mean,
stop?

772
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,973
The tank is full.
I filled it this morning.

773
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,097
Let's go, Wheely.

774
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,783
Come on, Herbie. What're you
doing? The race is back there.

775
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,569
I know what he's doing.
He can't fool me.

776
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,325
He's looking for that Lancia.

777
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,494
Inspector.

778
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,495
Well, what I was going
to say, sir...

779
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,504
Suppose there was
a connection

780
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,502
between the men who attacked

781
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,338
and the men who stole
the diamond.

782
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,422
Not now, Fontenoy!

783
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,755
But, sir, what if they've hidden
the stolen diamond in the car?

784
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,975
- What?
- If I may suggest, sir,

785
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,511
we should have our men
search that car immediately.

786
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,850
- Search?
- Yes!

787
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,525
- There is no time!
- The car is still here.

788
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,601
Yes?

789
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,033
Yes, but it is obviously...

790
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,034
Tuning up, or something.

791
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,037
Just say the word,
and the men and I...

792
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,202
Will search that car
from bumper to bumper.

793
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,587
The word is no, Fontenoy!

794
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,039
N-no?

795
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,713
What you don't seem
to understand is that, um,

796
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,012
a thorough search
would take over an hour.

797
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,552
And an hour's delay
would deprive Douglas

798
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,062
of winning a race...

799
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,725
He has traveled halfway
around the globe to enter.

800
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,070
Sir, I admire you
for your consideration.

801
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,322
And I understand now exactly
how you are thinking.

802
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,247
Sorry, sir.

803
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,083
Forget the Lancia, Herbie.
She's gone.

804
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,168
You heard him right.
Gone, split!

805
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,008
Yeah, that's right.

806
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,766
She took off in that race
like you never existed.

807
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,933
She wanted me to tell you,
it was fun while it lasted,

808
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,566
but when push came to shove,
she shoved off.

809
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,822
That's just the way
women are.

810
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,407
Might as well face it.

811
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:12,196
You've been deserted,
jilted. Abandoned!

812
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,735
Too late now.

813
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,616
We'll get it in Monte Carlo
after the race.

814
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:27,084
Inspector, I think
you will be proud of me.

815
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,966
What now, Fontenoy?

816
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,759
I have done exactly what I knew

817
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,302
you would have wanted me to...

818
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,597
notified Monte Carlo.

819
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,599
Their police will search
the car as soon as it arrives.

820
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,606
I'll take care at once, sir.

821
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,277
Whoa!

822
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,878
UH...
Catch anything?

823
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,048
I didn't think so.

824
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,885
- Which way?
- Right.

825
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,649
Left!

826
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,834
Hope they get that trophy
to Monte Carlo

827
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:21,086
on a fast jet.
We may beat 'em to it.

828
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,044
Unfortunately, somebody
put the Alps in our way.

829
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,529
The way Herbie's flyin',
nothing can stop him,

830
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,564
including the Himalayas.

831
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,765
Some road. It's not
even on the map.

832
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,342
Maybe you oughta
ask directions.

833
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,927
From who,
a French mountain goat?

834
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,262
There must be somebody.

835
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,330
Wheely, you...

836
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,540
Maybe I'll just call from in here.

837
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,703
Yeah.

838
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,847
Hey, there's somebody
out there.

839
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:27,477
No, that's just me! I never
heard a real echo before.

840
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,236
Will you sit down, Wheely?

841
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,783
Just one more, okay?

842
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,078
Come on, Wheely!

843
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,191
Uh, I got somebody.

844
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,662
Those are the guys
who were after Herbie.

845
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,497
Get out of the car.

846
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,186
- I'm taking over.
- I'll drive the car!

847
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,650
If it worked once,
maybe it'll work again.

848
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,007
Hey, buddy, I like
your "yodel-ay-hee-oo"!

849
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,422
Well, we're back
on the beam.

850
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,970
How many cars you figure
are ahead of us?

851
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,922
Would you believe all of 'em?

852
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,136
Is that a knocking I hear
in the gas tank?

853
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,273
Not in my gas tank.
Never!

854
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,144
Sounds like something
clunking around in there.

855
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,071
Well, we either listen
to the driver...

856
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,733
And stop to take
the gas tank apart,

857
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,244
or we listen to the mechanic
and try to win this race.

858
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,906
Well, I'm listening
to the mechanic.

859
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,244
Let's go, Herbie!

860
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,226
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

861
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,311
The oil pressure's up,
there's plenty of gas.

862
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,363
But he's not getting it.

863
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,629
I hate to mention this again,
but I heard some clunking...

864
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,011
You mean that nonsense
about the gas tank again?

865
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,300
Yeah, that's...

866
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,010
All right, let's get it straight,
once and for all,

867
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,175
who the mechanic is
around here, okay?

868
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,684
You say it's the gas tank,

869
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,682
and I say it isn't the gas tank.

870
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,894
You see?
It isn't the gas tank.

871
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,858
It's this... Rock
that was in the gas tank.

872
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,988
Hold it!

873
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,368
There's only one kind of rock
that glistens like that.

874
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,695
Well, sure, quartz.

875
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,534
You can find millions of 'em
around any quarry in Philly.

876
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,078
But... Not one that's worth...

877
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,540
Six million bucks.

878
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,382
- Huh?
<i>- L'etoile de Joie.</i>

879
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,633
The tall, the what?

880
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,719
<i>Etoile de Joie.</i>

881
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,381
Oh, wow!

882
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,970
That's...

883
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,888
That's the biggest hunk
of diamond

884
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,599
I've ever seen in my life.

885
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,555
What I don't understand
is how it...

886
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:58,891
The black sedan!

887
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,648
- Huh? Where?
- No, no, no.

888
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,570
They're the ones
that robbed the museum.

889
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,022
Don't you see?

890
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,736
They weren't trying
to knock us out of the race.

891
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,738
They were trying to get this.

892
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:11,995
Thank you for helping us, gentlemen,
and up with your hands.

893
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,283
You gave us the slip
for the last time.

894
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,128
We'll take the rock.

895
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:21,171
I don't suppose you'd
believe that was just a

896
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,714
big hunk of quartz.

897
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,753
The rock.
Let me have it.

898
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,735
Aah!

899
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,151
Aah!

900
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,624
Ha-ha-ha!

901
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:11,180
The rock.
Well, come on, hand it over.

902
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,570
Oh! Oh!

903
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,408
Ooh! Ooh!

904
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,574
Well, what do we
do with them now?

905
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,675
Thanks, Herbie. We tie 'em up!

906
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,204
Double X,
we lost them.

907
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,244
First time we've ever
been done in by a car.

908
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,248
<i>The goods</i>
<i>will be in Monte Carlo</i>

909
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,704
<i>in a couple of hours.</i>

910
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,918
<i>No chance of stopping them.</i>

911
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:31,135
See, we... We're rather
tied up at the moment.

912
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,058
Get me the airport.

913
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,930
We passed every car
on the road.

914
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,597
All except the Lancia.

915
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,312
Well, after the way
she jilted Herbie,

916
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:30,065
that's one car he won't
wanna come in second to.

917
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,649
Right, Herbie?

918
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,447
Hey, isn't that it?

919
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,821
It sure is.

920
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,912
Maybe we
should've stopped.

921
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,869
Stop? Are you kidding?

922
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,450
Throw away 100 grand

923
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,786
and the biggest comeback
of our lives?

924
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,165
We've got this thing.
We're a shoe-in.

925
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,797
- She's in trouble.
- Well, sure,

926
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:51,964
plenty of cars get in trouble.

927
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,088
Let the rescue boys
bail her out.

928
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,379
Yeah, but I mean,
she could be in real danger.

929
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,347
I'm sorry, Wheely.

930
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,724
Sometimes a comeback
comes second.

931
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,230
Herbie doesn't seem
to think so.

932
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,981
Well, yeah, sure. Why should
Herbie want to stop...

933
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,945
After the lies
you told him back there?

934
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,030
Shh!

935
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,370
Yeah, the jilted lover.

936
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,956
Why, if he knew that
that little Lancia...

937
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,921
Had been waiting on him
at the starting line,

938
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,718
wouldn't even budge...

939
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,047
Until you lied to her about
him throwing her over...

940
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,433
I mean, she...
Why, he'd...

941
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,852
I mean, he'd be back
at her side right now.

942
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,024
I hate to say this, Jim,

943
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,319
but you got a big mouth.
You know that?

944
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,158
Hang on, Diane!

945
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,966
Thank you.

946
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,896
Thank you.

947
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,231
- Thank you.
- You okay?

948
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:39,657
I think so. I missed a shift
and lost control.

949
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,075
That's not all
you could've lost.

950
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:45,912
<i>Herbie,
what're you doin'?</i>

951
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,823
Herbie, there's no time!

952
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,829
Forget it, Wheely.

953
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,621
He's gonna get his girlfriend
out of the mud.

954
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,921
And us out of the race.

955
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,922
I see it,
but I don't believe it.

956
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,606
Well, you can believe this,
we are now out of the money,

957
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,567
because "Sometimes
a comeback comes second."

958
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,733
Who's giving up, buddy?
Not me!

959
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:25,285
- Come on, you come with us.
- No, no, I...

960
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,195
I'm gonna stay with my car.

961
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,158
Looks like we're all
gonna stay with her car.

962
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,253
Let's go, Wheely!

963
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,804
You're not going
anyplace, are you?

964
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:07,827
Uh, Herbie?

965
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,073
Now listen to me.

966
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,119
Uh, Herbie, I know
just how you feel,

967
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,209
but I also know
you're not a quitter.

968
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,925
Now show 'em
you can do it, Herbie.

969
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:26,013
Win it for them!

970
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:27,847
And for her.

971
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,139
Oh, hey!

972
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:34,054
The rest is up to you.

973
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,352
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

974
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,814
Aw, come on, Herbie!

975
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,525
Open up, will ya?
Come on!

976
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,106
I know you're sore

977
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,533
about what I told you,
but I'm sorry, okay?

978
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,070
Look, I did it for you.

979
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,199
Okay, okay,
I did it for us.

980
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,744
What do you want me to do,
get down on my knees?

981
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,922
Okay.

982
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,967
All right, I lied to ya,
and I'm sorry.

983
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:07,888
And I promise I'll never,
never do it again, okay?

984
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,642
Boy, you sure don't
forgive easy, do ya?

985
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:30,911
Bouchet, did you miss a turn
on your way to the Eiffel Tower?

986
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:35,082
No. A little
unfinished business, Emile.

987
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,583
You've wounded me, my friend.

988
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,745
You think I cannot handle
a little diamond search?

989
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,080
Five of my best men

990
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,960
are waiting for the cars
to enter Monte Carlo.

991
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,258
- That is exactly why I'm here.
- A-ha!

992
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,836
Afraid I will steal
some of your glory?

993
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,388
There is no glory
to be stolen.

994
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:53,096
I wish to rectify
a terrible mistake...

995
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,682
And save everyone
from embarrassment.

996
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,898
- The search is off.
- Off?

997
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,859
The message was an error

998
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,936
by another zealous
young detective,

999
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,569
anxious to make an overnight
reputation for himself.

1000
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:09,945
Ah, yes,

1001
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,452
but for this kind of news
they invented the telephone.

1002
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,574
Ooh-la-la!

1003
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,160
This is a matter that needed
my personal attention.

1004
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,080
Who knows what
complications could arise

1005
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,165
from a situation like this?

1006
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,502
This is a big race.

1007
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:28,302
It could cause...
An international incident.

1008
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:34,428
Hmm.

1009
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,554
Ah!

1010
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,475
Well, it, uh, seems
your young man in Paris...

1011
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,527
Has caused you
a lot of trouble.

1012
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,400
I assure you, Emile,

1013
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,652
I intend to put an end to it.

1014
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:52,776
Wiser heads
are always called upon

1015
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,660
to clean up
the mistakes of the young.

1016
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,323
- It's true.
- And our reward,

1017
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,242
we get it
when we reach heaven.

1018
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,749
Perhaps a bit sooner.

1019
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,914
Three down and two to go.

1020
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,808
Dirty road hog!

1021
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,396
Why doesn't he learn
how to drive?

1022
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,399
He knows how to drive.
That's the trouble.

1023
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,114
Yeah, I see what you mean.

1024
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,995
If we don't get him
by the tunnel...

1025
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,543
There's no way
we can pass him!

1026
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,550
Bruno was right.
They never come back.

1027
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,723
H-h-Herbie!

1028
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:14,755
Ha-ha! I don't b...
believe it!

1029
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,798
We did it!

1030
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,428
They don't come back, huh?

1031
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,430
I guess Herbie wasn't listening.

1032
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:30,596
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

1033
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:31,933
Ha-ha!

1034
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,269
Swine!

1035
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,479
Herbie! Herbie!

1036
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,405
Herbie! Herbie!

1037
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,205
Herbie! Herbie!

1038
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:52,163
How does it feel to be back
in the winner's circle?

1039
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:53,538
Pretty good!

1040
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:57,122
Well, for the 20th time,
it was a great race,

1041
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,506
and we enjoyed
every minute of it...

1042
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,958
Almost every minute of it.

1043
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,252
Well, I'm enjoying
every minute of this,

1044
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,795
I can tell you that.

1045
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,975
And, uh, both of us
would like to thank you all

1046
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,643
very, very much.

1047
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,311
<i>Au revoir! Arrivederci!</i>

1048
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,271
<i>Ciao! Buenas noches!</i>

1049
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,491
<i>Sayonara.</i>

1050
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,660
Right. See ya around, Douglas.

1051
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,337
Hey, that's
some cute little memento

1052
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,507
you got there, old buddy.

1053
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,174
Well, this little memento's

1054
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,926
as much yours as mine,
old buddy.

1055
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,469
And it's more Herbie's
than anybody's.

1056
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,426
You can say that again.

1057
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:50,850
Well, look who's here.

1058
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,428
May I add my congratulations.

1059
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:56,765
You'll congratulate us even more
when you see what we've got for ya.

1060
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,567
- It was right in Herbie's gas tank.
- Ah.

1061
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,653
This whatcha been lookin' for?

1062
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:03,688
Yes.

1063
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,491
It's had a rough trip, hasn't it?

1064
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:09,448
But it's winding up in the right hands.

1065
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,447
Indeed, it is.

1066
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,407
Don't know how we
missed connections, sir,

1067
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,992
but here I am.

1068
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,953
Fontenoy.

1069
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,049
You see? I knew the diamond
would be found.

1070
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:24,592
It's an honor to be at your side

1071
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,590
in this moment
of triumph, Inspector.

1072
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,973
And I have more good news, sir.

1073
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,471
The two thieves have been captured.

1074
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:36,679
Good!

1075
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:39,812
Good! Then I'd say
the case is concluded.

1076
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,019
Yeah.

1077
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:45,067
But, you know, there seems
there'd be a mastermind

1078
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,606
behind this kind of thing.

1079
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:47,941
Yeah, or that museum

1080
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,571
has some
pretty lousy security.

1081
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:52,203
Sir, men have been
challenged to a duel

1082
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,738
for such an accusation.

1083
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,244
The museum's security
was virtually foolproof.

1084
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,161
I made an interesting
discovery just today, sir.

1085
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,541
- Fontenoy...
- From the sensitized floor...

1086
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,206
...to the radar beam
surrounding the pedestal

1087
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:06,091
to the very pillow
on which the diamond rested,

1088
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:09,171
all the traps were conceived
and executed by one man.

1089
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,425
- Fontenoy.
- No, sir.

1090
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:12,261
Give credit
where credit is due.

1091
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,926
The combinations to the entire
security system

1092
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:18,096
were devised
and known only to you!

1093
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:22,188
The only question is,
who besides the inspector

1094
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,519
knew the details
of these precautions?

1095
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:30,449
Who besides the Inspector?

1096
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:37,206
The answer to
that question is...

1097
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,163
Nobody!

1098
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,829
My retirement has been
delayed too long.

1099
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:47,254
Now I hope no one will be
foolish enough to make a move.

1100
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,764
Move this ridiculous car,
or I'll be forced to kill you!

1101
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,014
Ah!

1102
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:01,309
Even a mastermind can be
outsmarted by this car.

1103
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,399
Thanks, Herbie.

1104
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:08,980
Inspector.

1105
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:22,664
I always hoped

1106
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:25,501
you'd be present when I
cracked my first big case, sir.

1107
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:29,092
Fontenoy!

1108
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,635
Uh, excuse me, sir.

1109
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:35,344
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

1110
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,847
I think you'll find
it's all here, monsieur.

1111
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,686
I'm so happy!

1112
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,188
I personally will see to it

1113
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:48,690
that this magnificent
automobile

1114
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,607
receives the greatest honor
France can bestow.

1115
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,097
<i>S'il vous plait,</i>
the, uh, VW?

1116
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,925
VW.

1117
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,934
Yes, the VW. The white one with
the 53 on the side.

1118
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,560
Yes, yes, I know the car.

1119
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,146
It is the toast of all Monte Carlo.

1120
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:31,695
Yes. It's also our transportation,
if you wouldn't mind.

1121
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,858
Oh, I wouldn't mind, monsieur,
but it is no longer here.

1122
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,360
What?

1123
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,072
It was stolen.

1124
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,834
Mademoiselle,
you would not believe this.

1125
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,583
I would not believe this.

1126
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,294
No one would believe this.

1127
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,501
It was stolen...

1128
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,086
By another car.

1129
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,765
I know that you believe
about Herbie,

1130
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:04,600
but you're probably
not ready to believe...

1131
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:08,187
Giselle can do anything
she wants to.

1132
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,767
- Giselle?
- Mm-hmm.

1133
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,353
We're strong women, she and I.

1134
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,610
Shall we make it a foursome?

1135
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:18,864
Let's go.

1136
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:26,166
Take us to ze most romantic

1137
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,789
spot in Monte Carlo.

1138
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:55,946
Well...

1139
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:03,408
Yeah, bein' chief mechanic
is important,

1140
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:07,367
but I didn't exactly
win the race all by myself.

1141
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:09,994
No?

1142
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,168
Well, almost.
