1
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,720
You poor little fella.

2
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,560
It’s all right.

3
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
Big Mama’s here.

4
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,520
You know, you’re gonna
need some caring for.

5
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Now... Now, let’s see, darlin’.

6
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
You need...

7
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

8
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.

9
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Now I’m thinkin’, though.

10
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
Now... Now don’t...
Don’t you move, honey.

11
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,760
Big Mama’s gonna be right back.

12
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,120
Good work, Boomer.
We’ll get him this time.

13
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,280
I think he’s in there.

14
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Am I glad I found you boys.

15
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,440
There’s no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.

16
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,760
- Come on.
- Let’s go, Boomer. Come on.

17
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.

18
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,360
Oh, poor little guy.

19
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,440
Don’t you worry now. We’re going
to find someone to look after you.

20
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,680
Hey, I think I got an idea.

21
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,080
OK, Boomer,
now you know what to do.

22
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.

23
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Who is it?

24
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, I was sure
I heard someone knocking.

25
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Oh, dear! My laundry!

26
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,240
Oh, here! Stop it!

27
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?

28
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,680
Oh, stop!

29
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, I wonder what
got into those birds.

30
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,560
Well, bless my soul!

31
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,960
Why, it’s...

32
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,320
It’s a baby fox.

33
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Hello, little fella.

34
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
I wonder where its mother is.

35
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,760
Come on, now.
I’m not going to harm you.

36
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,800
Now, now. Oh, isn’t that...?

37
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, my, my. You’re a feisty
little rascal, aren’t you?

38
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,880
There, there, now. Calm down.

39
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,640
No, I just can’t leave you
out here all alone.

40
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Oh, isn’t he darling?

41
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Now, not so fast.

42
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,080
Now, now, not so fast.

43
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, my. You’re such a little toddler.

44
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,680
Say, that’s what
I’m going to call you.

45
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
Tod.

46
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
You know, Tod,

47
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,360
I’m not going to be
so lonesome anymore.

48
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,680
I got a surprise for you,
Chief, old boy.

49
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,040
Now, now, now, take it easy.

50
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,800
Well, how’s this for a huntin’ dog?

51
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,600
He’s just a little runt now,
but he’ll grow.

52
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,040
You may as well
get used to him, Chief.

53
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,320
He’s for you
to look after from now on.

54
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,160
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.

55
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Abigail, you’re going
to have to be patient with Tod.

56
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,600
He’s one of the family now.

57
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,880
Oh, of course. Now I know.

58
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,960
I declare,
I never will get my chores done.

59
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
Oh, mercy!

60
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
Tod! Tod, stop it!

61
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Abigail! Abigail!

62
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,120
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!

63
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,560
Easy, easy, Abigail.

64
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Steady, old girl. Steady.

65
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,520
There, there.

66
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,920
Tod, you come here.

67
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,680
I said come here!

68
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,000
Just look what you’ve done.

69
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Now, don’t try to butter me up.

70
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,200
Oh, Tod, I just can’t
stay angry with you.

71
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,720
You little imp.
Now run along and play.

72
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,320
Go on.

73
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,720
And try to stay out of mischief.

74
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,800
Hey, it’s Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.

75
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Is this it, Boomer?

76
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,240
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.

77
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,640
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.

78
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,680
He won’t get away this time.

79
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Hold it, Boomer.
I think I hear somethin’.

80
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,520
That’s him, all right, Dinky.
That’s him, all right.

81
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,960
Get ready, Boomer.

82
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,840
Hey, I can hear him movin’. Listen.

83
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,800
That’s funny. I don’t hear nothin’.

84
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,080
Quiet.

85
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,800
That’s him, Dinky.
That’s him, all right.

86
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,200
Button your beak, will ya?

87
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,040
I’ll check it out.

88
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,880
Would you look at that?

89
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,280
OK, Boomer, he’s right... there.

90
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Yikes! Watch it!

91
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Why, you...

92
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,880
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

93
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,400
Hiya, fellas.

94
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,360
What ya doin’? Wanna play?

95
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Stay outta this, kid.
This don’t concern you.

96
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,680
Let him have it!

97
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,680
Don’t let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!

98
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,280
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!

99
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,200
- Which way did he go?
- This way.

100
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
There he is!

101
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
What happened to ya? Golly!

102
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,520
Oh, shucks!
I think I bent my beak.

103
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,320
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.

104
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,640
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

105
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
- What are you talkin’, my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.

106
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,840
A worm? For breakfast?

107
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,960
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniffin’ at?

108
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
Somethin’... I never smelled...

109
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,920
... before, Chief.

110
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
Let me see.

111
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,200
Shucks, that’s easy.

112
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,080
The master’s just cookin’ grits
and fatback. You oughta know that.

113
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,080
That’s not what I smell.

114
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,640
I don’t know, Chief.

115
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
It’s something else.

116
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,240
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin’ to do
about a-sniffin’ and a-smellin’.

117
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,600
Hey, where you goin’?

118
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,840
I want to find out
what that smell is.

119
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,800
OK, Copper, but the master
ain’t gonna like you wanderin’ off.

120
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,640
I won’t get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.

121
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Can’t tell these young
whippersnappers anything.

122
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
What ya smellin’?

123
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,840
I’m on the trail of somethin’.

124
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Trail of what?

125
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
I don’t know yet.

126
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Why, it’s... it’s you!

127
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,160
What do you do that for?

128
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,320
We’re supposed to do that
when we find what we’ve been trackin’.

129
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,120
I’m a fox.

130
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,400
My name’s Tod.
What’s your name, kid?

131
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,240
Mine’s Copper. I’m a hound dog.

132
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,040
Gee, I bet you’d be good
playin’ hide-and-seek.

133
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Wanna try it, Copper?

134
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Can I use my nose?

135
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,080
Sure. OK.

136
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Now go ahead
and close your eyes and count.

137
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,440
One, two, three...

138
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,680
No, Copper! You can’t peek!

139
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
Now start again.

140
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,040
One, two, three, four,

141
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
five, six, seven...

142
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,040
My, my. Look at that.

143
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,760
A fox and a hound, playin’ together.

144
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,920
”When you’re the best of friends”

145
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,240
”Having so much fun together”

146
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,440
”You’re not even aware”
”you’re such a funny pair”

147
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,840
”You’re the best of friends”

148
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,360
”Life’s a happy game”

149
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,520
”You could clown around forever”

150
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,840
”Neither one of you sees”
”your natural boundaries”

151
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,640
”Life’s one happy game”

152
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
Copper!

153
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Gee, I’ve gotta go.

154
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,640
”If only the world”
”wouldn’t get in the way”

155
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,080
”If only people”
”would just let you play”

156
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,600
”They say you’re both being fools”

157
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,080
”You’re breaking all the rules”

158
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
”They can’t understand”

159
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,680
”The magic of your wonderland”

160
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,000
”When you’re the best of friends”

161
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Copper!

162
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,440
”Sharing all that you discover”

163
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,120
”When these moments have passed”
”Will that friendship last?”

164
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
”Who can say?”

165
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,080
”There’s a way”

166
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,320
”Oh, I hope”

167
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,880
”I hope it never ends”

168
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,800
Come on, Copper!

169
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,520
”‘Cause you’re the best of friends”

170
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,760
Copper, you’re my very best friend.

171
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,800
And you’re mine too, Tod.

172
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
And we’ll always
be friends forever, won’t we?

173
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,760
Yeah, forever.

174
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,880
Hey, let’s go swimmin’!

175
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,320
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!

176
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,880
Dagnabit! That Copper pup’s gone
and strayed off again.

177
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Come on, Chief.

178
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,680
If that little rascal’s
gonna make me a good huntin’ dog,

179
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,440
he’s gotta learn to mind.

180
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,360
Copper! Get over here!

181
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,760
Copper!

182
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,920
I gotta go home.

183
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,640
Do ya have to?
We’re havin’ too much fun.

184
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,560
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

185
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
I’ll see ya tomorrow!

186
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,720
- And don’t forget!
- I won’t!

187
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?

188
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,280
Why didn’t you...?

189
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,880
Golly! You’re all tied up.

190
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,080
Yeah, and it’s no fun either.

191
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,360
The master says I gotta stay home.

192
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,280
Well, we can play around here then.

193
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,960
Oh, no.
Not with old Chief over there.

194
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,440
Is that him making that awful noise?

195
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
He keeps me awake at night.

196
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
Oh, don’t go in there!
He can get awful mean!

197
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,720
He’s cranky.

198
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,200
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.

199
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,960
His ears isn’t as big as yours, Copper.

200
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,880
That’s not the part
you gotta worry about.

201
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,320
Wow! Look at those teeth.

202
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,920
That’s the part
you gotta worry about!

203
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,080
I’m gainin’ on him.

204
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,320
- He won’t get away now.
- He’s wakin’ up!

205
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,560
Get out, Tod!

206
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,880
No. He’s havin’ a dream.
He’s chasin’ somethin’.

207
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,840
When I get him cornered...

208
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,920
It’s... It’s... It’s a big old badger.

209
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Copper, he’s chasin’ a badger.

210
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,040
No, no, it ain’t a badger.

211
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,080
It’s a... It’s a f...

212
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,320
It’s a fox. A fox?

213
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,440
Run, Tod! Run!

214
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,960
Tod!

215
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,400
Amos Slade,
you trigger-happy lunatic!

216
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,280
Give me that gun!

217
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
My radiator!

218
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,000
Why, you blasted female.

219
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,640
- I’ll... I’ll...
- Hold it right there!

220
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,040
Watch it! That thing’s loaded!

221
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
Now it ain’t loaded!

222
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,680
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin’ fox
was after my chickens!

223
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
Rubbish and poppycock!

224
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,880
I don’t believe it.
He wouldn’t hurt a thing.

225
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,360
You callin’ me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?

226
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,280
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours

227
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,520
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

228
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,800
Temper?

229
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Temper, woman?
You ain’t seen my temper!

230
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,440
If I ever catch that fox
on my property again, I’ll blast him!

231
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,440
And next time, I won’t miss!

232
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,920
Poor little tyke.

233
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It’s a shame I have
to keep him cooped up.

234
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,760
Tod, stop looking at me like that.

235
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,200
It’s not my fault, you know.

236
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,800
You caused a lot
of trouble yesterday.

237
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh, now what are they up to?

238
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Why, it looks like Amos
is going on a hunting trip.

239
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,520
A long one, from the looks of it.

240
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,400
Well, good riddance!

241
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,120
Doggone meddlin’ female,

242
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
shootin’ up my radiator!

243
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,960
Dad blame it. Get goin’!

244
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,440
There. Well, that’s more like it.
Keep runnin’, old girl.

245
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,480
Well, Copper, me and old Chief
are gonna teach you all about huntin’.

246
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes, sir. It’s about time too.

247
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
Attaboy.

248
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,240
Yeah, you’re gonna like
trackin’ down those varmints for me.

249
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Get in the back, half-pint.

250
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,840
You gotta earn your right
to sit up front.

251
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,560
Well, boys, we’re gettin’
outta here till next spring.

252
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,800
Tod, honey,
what are you doin’ over here?

253
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,560
Gee, I just wanted
to say goodbye to Copper,

254
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
but I’m too late.

255
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,160
Well, what did you plan to do
if you ran into old Chief?

256
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,680
Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.

257
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,880
Tod, now hold it just one minute.

258
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,560
Didn’t you learn anything yesterday?

259
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,560
Now you listen good, Tod,

260
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
because it’s either education
or elimination.

261
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,560
Now if you’re so foxy
and old Chief’s so dumb,

262
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,120
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?

263
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,440
’Cause he’s got the hunter,
and the hunter’s got the gun.

264
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,760
Elimination. Lack of education.

265
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
”If you pal around”
”with that Copper hound”

266
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,560
”You’ll wind up hangin’ on the wall”

267
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
”Keep your nose to the wind”
”You’ll keep your skin”

268
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,400
”‘Cause you won’t be home”
”when the hunter comes to call”

269
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,880
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.

270
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Why, old Copper,
he’s my best friend.

271
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,000
Your best friend.

272
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
Now, Copper’s gonna
do what he’s been told.

273
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,400
Supposed to chase the little old fox
into the old foxhole,

274
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,520
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.

275
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,720
Elimination.

276
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
Lack of education.

277
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
You better believe it, Tod.

278
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,880
Yes, sirree!

279
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,840
You mean Copper
is gonna be my enemy?

280
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,440
Hey!

281
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,320
Kid, you better step over here
and take a good look.

282
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,520
Why... Why, that’s awful.

283
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,680
Those poor things.

284
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,840
I’m sorry, Tod.

285
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,600
Honey, Copper’s gonna come back
a trained huntin’ dog.

286
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,120
A real killer.

287
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

288
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,200
He won’t ever change.

289
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,440
I hope you’re right, Tod.

290
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,960
And we’ll keep on
being friends forever.

291
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,520
Won’t we, Big Mama?

292
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,320
Darlin’, forever is a long, long time,

293
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,600
and time has a way
of changin’ things.

294
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,120
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

295
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
- I’m freezin’ my b...
- Hey!

296
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,040
It’s that fuzzy worm! Let’s get him!

297
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
Charge!

298
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!

299
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,520
I got him! I got him!

300
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,400
Do I look like a worm?
That’s who we’re after.

301
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
Come on!

302
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,760
Look at that little creep,

303
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,880
warm and cosy by the fire.

304
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,280
Let me take a look.

305
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,000
Now how do you like that guy?

306
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,280
Snug as a bug,

307
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,840
while we’re out here
freezin’ our beaks off.

308
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,880
Yackin’ and shiverin’
ain’t gettin’ us anywhere.

309
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,160
We’ll get that no-good worm
when we come back.

310
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,600
Oh, shucks.

311
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
So long, Big Mama.

312
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
Yeah, we’re goin’ south for the winter.

313
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,640
Goodbye, boys.
See ya next spring.

314
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,600
Well, look who’s here.

315
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,760
Oh, my goodness.

316
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,120
I’m sorry, Tod, honey.

317
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,120
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.

318
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,320
We’re back. We flew all the way.

319
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah, we did. We did.

320
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
Welcome home, boys!

321
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,760
It’s been kind of lonesome
around here without you little rascals.

322
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,320
Hi, fellas!

323
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
Hey, who’s that? Who’s that?

324
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
This can’t be
that scrawny little squirt

325
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,920
we found by the fence post,
can it? Come on.

326
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,520
I can’t believe my eyes.

327
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,480
Oh, it’s me, all right.

328
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,320
Hey, looky there.
He’s got himself a real fancy collar.

329
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,920
Hey, hey, hey.
Just look at this bushy tail.

330
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Beautiful.

331
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,160
Come on. Cut it out.
You guys are always teasin’ me.

332
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,160
Hey, it’s him, it’s him. Squeeks.

333
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,120
We’ll see ya later, kid.

334
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,960
We gotta take care
of some unfinished business.

335
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,480
I can’t understand.

336
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,720
It was so healthy.

337
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,640
There. That oughta perk it up.

338
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Now, where’d he go?
Where’d he go?

339
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,960
He’s goin’ up the drainpipe!
I’ll head him off.

340
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,120
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped!
Let him have it!

341
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,080
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn’t.

342
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,560
Neither did l.

343
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Come on! Look!

344
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,000
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!

345
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,320
- Holy!
- Smoke!

346
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Hey, hey, how’s he do that, Dinky?
How’s he do that?

347
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,080
”I ain’t got no job”
”I’m a huntin’ man”

348
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
”And I’d rather have a dog”
”than a dollar”

349
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,000
”So let’s go banjo”
”ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho”

350
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,760
”Give a little hoot and a holler”

351
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,160
Come on, Chief.

352
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,200
Just ‘cause you’re not sittin’ up front,
that ain’t no reason to be a sorehead.

353
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
Shucks, if it weren’t for you,

354
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,640
Copper’d never have turned
into a good huntin’ dog.

355
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,440
Yes, sirree.

356
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,120
Now I got me
the best two dogs there is.

357
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
Right, Copper?

358
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,240
Isn’t he somethin’, Chief?

359
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,800
Look, Big Mama! Copper’s back!

360
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,480
Boy, has he grown big.

361
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,280
And look at that big pile of skins
he helped track down.

362
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,800
I know, Big Mama.
He’s a huntin’ dog now.

363
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,840
You’re right. And you’re a fox.

364
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,760
That won’t make any difference.
Copper’s gonna be glad to see me.

365
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,600
Well, honey,
just don’t get your hopes too high.

366
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,120
Look, don’t worry. I’ll be careful.

367
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,000
I’ll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.

368
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Boy, it’s great to be back home,
isn’t it, Chief?

369
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Come on, Chief.
You aren’t still sore, are ya?

370
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
Hey, hey, come on. Let’s scuffle.

371
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,400
We ain’t scuffled in a long time.

372
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,920
Come on, Chief!
Let’s have some fun!

373
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Oh, lay off, Copper,
you overgrown pup, you.

374
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,480
Oh, let go!

375
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,320
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!

376
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Oh, OK, OK.

377
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,360
That was your trouble on the hunt.

378
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,000
Come on, old-timer.

379
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,120
You treat me like a pup,
you know that?

380
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,600
Why, I think I done real good
trackin’ down them varmints for ya.

381
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,000
Smellin’ and trackin’ ain’t enough.

382
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,360
You gotta think nasty.

383
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
OK, OK, I know.

384
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,880
I know.

385
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,720
Copper.

386
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,640
Hey, Copper.

387
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,920
It’s me, Tod.

388
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,760
I thought that was you, Tod.
I heard ya comin’.

389
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,640
Boy, you’ve really grown.

390
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
You have too, Copper.

391
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
I saw you comin’ back
with Chief and the hunter.

392
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
It’s great to see ya, Tod.

393
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,120
But, you know, you...
You shouldn’t be over here.

394
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,720
You’re gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.

395
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,040
Hey, look, l...
I just wanted to see ya.

396
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,800
We’re...
We’re still friends, aren’t we?

397
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,560
Tod, those days are over.

398
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
I’m a huntin’ dog now.

399
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,880
You’d better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.

400
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,720
Chief. He doesn’t worry me.

401
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
Tod, I’m serious. You’re...

402
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,520
You’re fair game
as far as he’s concerned.

403
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,920
It’s that fox again!

404
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,240
Oh, no! No!

405
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,160
They’re after Tod!

406
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,600
After him, boys! Go get him!

407
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,040
Copper!

408
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,360
Copper! Copper!

409
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
Tod, I...

410
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,040
I don’t wanna see you get killed.

411
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,920
Track him down, boy!

412
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,720
I’ll let you go this one time.

413
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,120
Don’t lose him!

414
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,320
There they are!
Old Chief’s got him on the run!

415
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,680
Jump, Chief! Jump!

416
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,120
Chief!

417
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,800
Chief?

418
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,720
Oh, no!

419
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,360
No!

420
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,520
Tod, if it’s
the last thing I do, I’ll...

421
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,200
I’ll get you for this!

422
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,480
Tod!

423
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,360
Tod? Tod!

424
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh, Tod!

425
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,400
Thank heaven you’re safe.

426
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,240
Oh, poor Chief.

427
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,080
And it’s all my fault.

428
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,800
I shouldn’t have let Tod go.

429
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,960
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!

430
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,960
There’s trouble!

431
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,920
Tod! Well, what is it?

432
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,280
What on earth?

433
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,640
Widow, get out here!

434
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,800
Why, Amos! What are you...?

435
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,560
Where is he? Where is he?

436
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,480
I know he’s in there.

437
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,240
Now just a minute.

438
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,000
You can’t come bargin’
onto my property, Amos Slade!

439
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,120
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,

440
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,320
and I’m gonna get him!

441
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,640
You can’t keep him locked up forever!

442
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,840
”We met, it seems”

443
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,080
”Such a short time ago”

444
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,600
”You looked at me”

445
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,560
”Needing me so”

446
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
”Yet from your sadness”

447
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,880
”Our happiness grew”

448
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
”And I found out I needed you too”

449
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,840
”I remember how we used to play”

450
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,040
”I recall those rainy days”

451
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,640
”The fire’s glow”

452
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,960
”That kept us warm”

453
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,960
”And now I find”

454
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,440
”We’re both alone”

455
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,360
”Goodbye may seem forever”

456
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,600
”Farewell is like the end”

457
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,960
”But in my heart’s the memory”

458
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,880
”And there... you’ll always be”

459
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,840
”Goodbye may seem forever”

460
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,680
”Farewell is like the end”

461
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,120
”But in my heart’s the memory”

462
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,600
”And there you’ll always be”

463
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,360
Hold it, sonny! Back off!

464
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,760
Consarn it! Where...?
Where do you think you’re goin’?

465
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,960
Oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...

466
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,840
You barge in on somebody’s house
like you own it.

467
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,800
Tarryhootin’ around them woods,

468
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,640
wakin’ up folks
in the middle of the night.

469
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,520
I honestly didn’t know
anybody lived here, and I...

470
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!

471
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,360
Go on! Beat it!

472
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,480
I’ve been watching you, sir.
You can stay with me if you want to.

473
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,600
- That’s very nice of you.
- Come with me.

474
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,680
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.

475
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,600
We’ll get him. We’ll get him.

476
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,360
Well, now, if you
gotta have a busted leg,

477
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,600
this is the way to do it.

478
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,360
Good food, soft pillow,

479
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,680
warm stove.

480
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,960
Sure beats sleepin’ in that barrel.

481
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,160
Well, now, here comes visitors
to see the invalid.

482
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,360
How do you like that?
They didn’t even ask how I’m feelin’.

483
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,920
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.

484
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,080
Copper, Copper, lookit here.

485
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,800
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin’ along,

486
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,760
suspectin’ nothin’...

487
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,360
Tod?

488
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,720
Tod?

489
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,040
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain’t what they used to be.

490
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,040
Big Mama,
you better lose a few pounds.

491
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,880
There he is, there he is.

492
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,200
Tod!

493
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,080
Tod!

494
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,000
Oh, hi, Big Mama.

495
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,880
Oh, it’s you, Vixey.

496
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,800
Hey, what brings you way out here?

497
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,440
I’m lookin’ for a fox named Tod.

498
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,720
- He’s new here in the forest.
- Oh, new?

499
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,880
Well, what does he look like?

500
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,120
Oh, he’s young. About your age.

501
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,600
And handsome.

502
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,560
Handsome? Oh, say.

503
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,560
Gee, he sure sounds nice.

504
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,160
I’m not doing anything.

505
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,160
I’ll help you find him.

506
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,720
Come on.
He’s gotta be around here somewhere.

507
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,680
Wha...?

508
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,160
What happened? Where am I?

509
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,480
So, it’s you again?

510
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,120
You barged in on me last night,
and now you...

511
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
I didn’t mean to.

512
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,880
Just look at the mess you made.

513
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,720
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!

514
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,760
I’m sorry. It was an accident.

515
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,760
Excuses, excuses.

516
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,440
Mr Digger, sir?
It was so too an accident.

517
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,280
You keep out of this,
you walkin’ pincushion.

518
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,080
You shouldn’t be so grumpy to
someone who’s new in the neighbourhood.

519
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,600
A stranger?

520
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,200
Why don’t you go back
where you came from?

521
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,040
Wha...?

522
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,080
Well, go on.

523
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,240
Get goin’. Git!

524
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,480
Gosh, he seems so... I don’t know,
so downhearted, Big Mama.

525
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,800
Well, you can’t blame him, honey.

526
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,840
He was dropped out here and left
all alone without a friend in the world.

527
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,120
Well, maybe there’s
something I could do.

528
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,040
You know, cheer him up.

529
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,560
Honey, you just said
the magic words.

530
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,760
Now...

531
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,920
What? But Big Mama, I don’t...

532
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,680
Darlin’, don’t move.
You look beautiful.

533
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,120
Thank you.

534
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,840
Mornin’, Tod.

535
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,920
Hello, Big Mama.

536
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,120
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn’t it, honey?

537
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,400
Just terrible.

538
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,640
Cheer up and look around.

539
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,280
The forest is beautiful this morning.

540
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,240
After last night,
nothin’ looks beautiful.

541
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,080
Wow!

542
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,360
Who...? Who is that?

543
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,920
Oh, just another fox.

544
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,920
A lady fox.

545
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,520
Golly!

546
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,560
Is she beautiful!

547
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,920
I wonder what her name is.

548
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,080
Well, why don’t you go ask her?

549
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah. Yeah, guess...
Guess I will.

550
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,960
I’ll... I’ll go up to her and I’ll say,
”You’re the most gorgeous...

551
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,120
The most beautiful...

552
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,960
Never seen anyone, anywhere...”
I’ll say...

553
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,400
Hi.

554
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,320
Hello.

555
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,360
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...

556
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,880
May I call you by your first name?

557
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,200
Oh, sure. Why not?

558
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,000
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

559
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,440
- Vixey.
- Vixey.

560
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,680
My name is... is... Tod.

561
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,400
Tod?

562
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,400
That’s a... That’s a nice name, Tod.

563
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,680
It looks like that farm boy
is makin’ it big with her.

564
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,640
Now just keep it down.

565
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,240
Well, Tod, you know something?

566
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,600
This stream is just full of trout.

567
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,720
Do you think you could catch one?

568
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,520
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

569
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,760
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

570
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,880
My dear young lady...

571
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,880
...you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.

572
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,760
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don’t overdo it.

573
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,920
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.

574
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,280
Please let him catch a fish.

575
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,920
Here comes a whopper!

576
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,240
Now, watch closely.

577
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,040
Tod, do you need help?

578
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,960
No. No, I do it this way

579
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,360
all... all the... all the time!

580
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,440
I got him.

581
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,960
Oh, that farm boy,
he don’t know nothin’ about fishin’.

582
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,120
He ain’t gonna hook her that way.

583
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,160
Oh, gosh!

584
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,080
Tod, you’re the
funniest thing I ever saw!

585
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,000
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!

586
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,520
You’re like everyone else around here.

587
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,440
I’m sorry. I can’t help it.
You are so funny.

588
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,440
So I can’t fish!

589
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,440
You’re a silly,

590
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,600
empty-headed... female!

591
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,040
Now just a minute.

592
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,840
I mean, you’ve got a nerve.
Why don’t you grow up?

593
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,760
Tod, that’s no way
to talk to Vixey.

594
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,280
Oh, raspberries! I’ve had it.

595
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,240
Honey, don’t stay mad.

596
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,040
You gotta be natural. That’s the trick.

597
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,520
Can’t you see?

598
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,080
”When you have a natural attraction”

599
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,040
”You deserve a mutual reaction”

600
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,760
”You’re gonna get a whole lot”

601
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,800
”Of satisfaction”

602
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,760
”Here’s all you gotta do”

603
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,680
”When you feel that”

604
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,160
”Natural affection”

605
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,000
”Leads you in the positive direction”

606
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,000
”You gotta stop showin’ off”

607
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,400
”Start showin’ up”

608
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,120
”With little old natural you”

609
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,320
”Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady”

610
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,640
”And now that is a natural fact”

611
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,560
”‘Cause when you be yourself”

612
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,360
”With the lady, yeah”

613
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,240
”You gonna get appreciated”

614
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,080
”Right back”

615
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,360
- But Big Mama...
- It’s just getting interesting.

616
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,200
Tod, I...

617
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,320
I just know you’re
gonna love the forest.

618
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,680
Listen, come on.
Let me show you around.

619
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,280
Sure.

620
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,520
Come on.

621
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,160
Look. One, two,
three, four, five, six.

622
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,800
Seven.

623
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,520
I think six would be just right.

624
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,760
Six?

625
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,760
Six what?

626
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,720
”No hunting.”

627
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,920
Well, now, we ain’t gonna
do none of that, are we, Copper?

628
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,440
We’re just gonna
get us a no-good fox.

629
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,080
All right, boy, get trackin’.

630
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,720
Smell him out.

631
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,000
What ya got there, Copper?

632
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,200
Good work, boy.

633
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,400
He’ll be comin’ right through here,
headin’ for water.

634
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,320
But he won’t be drinkin’ any.

635
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,160
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.

636
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,440
You know, I’ve never been happier.

637
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Oh, Tod, me too.

638
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,680
That does it.

639
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,080
Amos, you crafty old coot.

640
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,280
The devil himself
couldn’t have done no better.

641
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,240
Tod?

642
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,480
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?

643
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,600
I don’t wanna go in there.
It’s too quiet.

644
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,480
Vixey.

645
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,000
What?

646
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,520
Tod, be careful.

647
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,200
Dad blast it! He’s gettin’ away!

648
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,920
Quick, Vixey!

649
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,360
Go on, head for the burrow.

650
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,920
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.

651
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,920
Tod!

652
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,520
Oh, no, Tod.

653
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,880
Copper! Copper!

654
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,960
We got ‘em now for sure.
This is their only way out.

655
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,040
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

656
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,480
Tod!

657
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,800
We’re trapped!

658
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,760
Tod, I’m scared.

659
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,040
Quick, Vixey!
This is our only chance!

660
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,600
Whoa! No! I don’t believe it!

661
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,000
Copper, we’ve trapped him now!

662
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,040
Copper!

663
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,200
Tod!

664
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,000
Tod?

665
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,000
Come on, Copper.
Get outta the way.

666
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,520
Well...

667
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,480
...come on, boy.

668
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,560
Let’s go home.

669
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,360
This is it.

670
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,360
We got him for sure now.

671
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,880
Oh, my gosh!

672
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,200
What happened?

673
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,800
Hey, there’s somethin’

674
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,640
very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.

675
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,560
Nah, it couldn’t be.

676
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,800
Could it?

677
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,480
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.

678
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,400
Good luck, honey.

679
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,880
Ouch! You’re killin’ me! Ouch!

680
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,120
Amos Slade, will you hold still?

681
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,920
You’re behaving like a child.

682
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,160
Well, for gosh sakes,
you’re hurtin’ my foot, woman!

683
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,840
Nonsense! Your foot is mendin’ fine.

684
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,760
You’ll soon be yourself.

685
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,600
Oh, land sakes.
I don’t know if I like that.

686
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,320
Be careful! Ouch!

687
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,400
He’s sure makin’ a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.

688
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,280
”Copper?”

689
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,840
”You’re my very best friend.”

690
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,040
”And you’re mine too, Tod.”

691
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,040
”And we’ll always”
”be friends forever, won’t we?”

692
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,880
”Yeah, forever.”
