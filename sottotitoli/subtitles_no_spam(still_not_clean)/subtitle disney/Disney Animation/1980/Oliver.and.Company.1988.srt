1
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:42,627
<i>Now it's always once upon a time
in New York City.</i>

2
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:48,007
<i>It's a big old, bad old, tough old town.</i>

3
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,759
<i>It's true.</i>

4
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:55,181
<i>But beginnings are contagious there.</i>

5
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:58,685
<i>They're always settin' stages there.</i>

6
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:03,356
<i>They're always turnin' pages there for you.</i>

7
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:09,696
<i>Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City.</i>

8
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,531
Let me have one. Please.

9
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,534
<i>Right away you're makin' time.</i>

10
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,036
<i>And makin' friends.</i>

11
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,207
<i>No one cares where you were yesterday.</i>

12
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,586
<i>If they pick you out you're on your way.</i>

13
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>To a once upon a time.</i>

14
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:31,551
<i>That never ends.</i>

15
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,887
<i>So, Oliver, don't be shy.</i>

16
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,224
<i>Get out there and go and try.</i>

17
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,561
<i>Believin' that you're the guy.</i>

18
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,272
<i>They're dyin' to see.</i>

19
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,111
<i>'Cause a dream's no crime.</i>

20
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,405
<i>Not once upon a time.</i>

21
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,951
<i>Once upon a time in New York City.</i>

22
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,708
<i>If it's always once upon a time in New York City.</i>

23
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,423
<i>Why does nightfall find ya feelin' so alone.</i>

24
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,928
<i>How could anyone stay starry-eyed.</i>

25
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:19,474
<i>When it's rainin' cats and dogs outside.</i>

26
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:24,520
<i>And the rain is saying "Now you're on your own".</i>

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,833
<i>So, Oliver, don't be scared.</i>

28
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,253
<i>Though yesterday no one cared.</i>

29
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,632
<i>They're gettin' your place prepared.</i>

30
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,967
<i>Where you wanna be.</i>

31
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,390
<i>Keep your dream alive.</i>

32
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:04,185
<i>Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.</i>

33
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:08,648
<i>Once upon a time in New York City.</i>

34
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,215
<i>Keep your dream alive.</i>

35
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,135
<i>Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.</i>

36
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,179
<i>Once upon a time in New York City.</i>

37
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,770
<i>Keep your dream alive.</i>

38
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:51,441
<i>Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.</i>

39
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:55,361
<i>Once upon a time in New York City.</i>

40
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:01,033
<i>And it's always once upon a time.</i>

41
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:05,413
<i>In New York City.</i>

42
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,082
- Forty seconds.
- All right. Here we go.

43
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,236
<i>You see the feet walkin'
down the street in the fast lane.</i>

44
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,322
<i>Walkin' on the street where they goin'.</i>

45
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,491
<i>Just makin' a move tryin' to survive.</i>

46
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,076
<i>Find a way or not to stay alive.</i>

47
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,247
<i>Cool cat in a cruel world knows
good from bad, his mind is in a swirl.</i>

48
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,416
<i>Got to look out and open your eyes.</i>

49
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,668
<i>If you're in a jam you got to realize.</i>

50
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,923
<i>- You're in the fast lane.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.</i>

51
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,759
<i>- In the fast lane.
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

52
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:03,513
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

53
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,398
Come on, sweetheart. We're late.

54
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,529
You can play with the kitty
some other time, honey. Come on.

55
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,828
Hey, 'scusa me.

56
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,957
Don't ya see I'm pushin'
somethin' here? Thank you.

57
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,514
Hey, come on, folks! Step right up.

58
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,974
Get your hot dogs.

59
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,269
The best hot dogs in New York.

60
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,817
Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?
Come on, folks.

61
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,652
Step right up.

62
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,739
Hey! Go on. Get outta here. Shoo!

63
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,157
Get outta here. Go on, kitty.

64
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,993
Get your sausages.

65
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,995
All right, let's go, folks.

66
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,873
Step right up.
I got the hottest dogs in the Big Apple!

67
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,221
Hmm.

68
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,017
Psst. Psst.

69
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,191
Hiya.

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,571
- Hmph!
- Ooh. La-de-da.

71
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,905
Hey! Hey, get off of me!

72
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,699
- What's the matter with you?
- Well, well.

73
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,867
I said get outta here.

74
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,119
Looks like Louie's got a visitor.

75
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:54,874
Could be time for the Dodge to turn
this into a total "cat-astrophe."

76
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,210
Get off me! Get outta here. Go on! Shoo!

77
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,884
Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy
to get hot dogs from, kid.

78
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,387
- Get away from me!
- Whoa! Chill out, man.

79
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,641
I don't eat cats. It's too much fur.

80
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,309
I've been watching you,

81
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:17,521
and I think you're in serious need
of some professional guidance.

82
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,024
Now what do ya say we team up
and change old Louie's mind

83
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,068
about sharing those hot dogs?

84
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,445
I'm not goin' back there again.

85
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:28,324
Hey. It'd be a snap, kid.
I'm an expert at these things.

86
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:31,911
All you gotta do is learn some moves.

87
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,580
- Moves?
- You know. Tempo.

88
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,374
Ooo-cha-ba. A rhythm.

89
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,585
This city's got a beat.
You gotta hook into it.

90
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,089
And once you got the beat, you can do anything.

91
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,592
- Loan?
- "Absitively posolutely."

92
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:52,306
The man you see before you
is affectionately known as "Old Louie."

93
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,476
A well-known enemy of the four-legged world.

94
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,105
Our mission, cat, is to liberate
those all-beef kosher franks

95
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,607
and hightail it outta here.

96
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,610
- Startin' to feel that rhythm?
- Well, uh...

97
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,364
Yeah! Yeah!

98
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,118
I do feel it! When are we gonna get
those hot dogs?

99
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,994
Right now.

100
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,292
Hey! Dog.-

101
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:25,131
Hey! Get outta here! Hey!

102
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,801
Hey! Hey. Get outta there!

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,305
I'll get you!

104
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,059
Kitty!

105
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,985
Hey, you really got that rhythm, kid.

106
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,905
Uh... Yeah?

107
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,242
We were good, huh?
So when are we gonna eat?

108
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,995
- We?
- Yeah. I'm starvin'.

109
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,664
Listen, kid. I hate to break it to ya,

110
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:02,501
but the dynamic duo is now the dynamic <i>uno.</i>

111
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,961
What do ya mean?

112
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:08,674
What I mean is,
our partnership is herewith dissolved.

113
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:12,011
But, wait! Wait. You're not being fair!

114
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:17,183
Fairs are for tourists, kid. Consider it
a free lesson in street savoir faire

115
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,518
from New York's coolest quadruped.

116
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,936
Check ya later.

117
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,106
Hey, wait! I helped you get those!

118
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,108
Half of those are mine!

119
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,370
Ya want 'em? Come and get 'em.

120
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,123
<i>Uh-huh</i>

121
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,667
But I'm warnin' ya, kid.

122
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,378
<i>One minute I'm in Central Park</i>

123
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,550
<i>Then I'm down on Delancey Street</i>

124
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,010
What the... Hey!

125
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>Say, from the Bowery to St. Mark's</i>

126
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,354
<i>There's a syncopated beat</i>

127
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>Like I said Woo-hoo</i>

128
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,608
<i>Woo-hoo-oo</i>

129
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,362
<i>I'm street wise</i>

130
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,406
<i>I can improvise</i>

131
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,077
<i>Said ooo-hoo woo-hoo-oo</i>

132
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,039
<i>I'm street smart</i>

133
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,667
<i>I've got New York City heart</i>

134
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,170
<i>Why should I worry</i>

135
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,589
<i>Why should I care</i>

136
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,759
<i>I may not have a dime</i>

137
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,053
<i>But I got street savoir faire</i>

138
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,597

<i>The rhythm of the city</i>

144
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,282
<i>Boy, once you get it down</i>

145
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,243
<i>Then you can own this town</i>

146
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,662
<i>You can wear the crown</i>

147
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,206
<i>Why should I worry</i>

148
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,459
<i>Tell me why should I care</i>

<i>Everything goes, everything fits</i>

<i>They love me at the Chelsea

<i>Why should I worry</i>

Tito! Stop that racket!
I'm trying to watch this show.

176
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,312
<i>There would have been a time for such a word.</i>

177
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,232
<i>Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow creeps...</i>

178
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,738
<i>In this petty pace from day to day
and all our yesterdays</i>

179
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,364
<i>have lighted fools the way to dusty death.</i>

180
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,616
Hey, Frankie, whatcha watchin'?

181
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,410
Hey, does he get the girl? I mean, what happens?

182
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,287
Shut up, you little rodent.

183
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,956
Hey, man, this stuff is boring, man.

184
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,792
Come on, let's watch some boxing.
I wanna see some action.

185
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,088
Hey, Frankie. Que' peso'?
You're getting slow, man.

186
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,550
My name is Francis.

187
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,803
Francis. Not Frank.

188
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:08,140
Not Frankie. Francis.

189
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:12,686
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did
you bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?

190
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,398
It's none of your business,
you intrusive little pipsqueak.

191
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,983
Look what I got.

192
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:23,530
Oh, good show, Einstein.
Now all we need is the court and the net.

193
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,574
You think this place is big enough?

194
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,619
Hey, come on. What we need is
some good quality stuff, man.

195
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,873
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.

196
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,336
Shredded what? What you talkin' about,
man? That's a primo wallet, man.

197
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,505
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!

198
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,174
You insulted my pride! That means death!

199
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,718
- Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Cut it out, you two.

200
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,178
- Frankie! Frankie!
- Arf!

201
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,140
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about this.

202
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,643
So, Francis, you got the food, right?

203
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,105
- Well, no. I...
- Ooh, Frankie.

204
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,023
Frankie. It was your turn to get the food today.

205
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,859
- It's newspaper burritos again!
- Hey.

206
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,904
Whoa. Whoa. Cool it, Dodger fans.

207
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,491
I'd like to introduce you to... Your dinner.

208
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,910
- Ia Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!

209
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,288
You remain our preeminent benefactor.

210
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:16,208
Yeah. And you're okay, too.

211
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,544
So how'd you do it this time, Dodgie baby?

212
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,714
Let me tell you, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.

213
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,218
Did you have to fight, man?
Did you fight? How many were there?

214
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,220
Picture the city.

215
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,557
Eighth and Broadway. The crowds hustling.

216
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,102
The traffic roaring. The hot dogs are sizzling.

217
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,896
I love a story with food in it.

218
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,233
Enter Dodger, one bad puppy.

219
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,236
Not just out for himself, but community minded.

220
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,738
But he's not the only one out there.

221
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,700
Enter the opposition.

222
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,745
A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster...

223
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,249
With razor-sharp claws, dripping fangs,

224
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,586
and nine lives, all of them hungry.

225
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,214
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.

226
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,049
Suddenly...

227
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,135
Gang war! Gang war!

228
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,595
Watch out! Here comes a gang war!

229
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,096
- Help!
- Take cover!

230
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,560
Well, what is it?

231
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,689
Hey, man, check it out.

232
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,192
Ay, it's a alien!

233
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,112
Cool it, guys. It's just a cat.

234
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,615
<i>- Mi madre, un gato!
- Felis domesticus!</i>

235
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,910
Now, how'd you find this place, cat?

236
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,079
I followed this dog.

237
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,372
He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!

238
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,457
Shut up, Tito!

239
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,501
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah?

240
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,130
I... I just wanted some of the sausages
I helped him get.

241
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:49,134
He's a spy, man! Come on,
let's eat him. You're dead meat, kitty.

242
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:52,012
I... I saw him come down.

243
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,348
Hey! That's... Hey, that's him! Over there.

244
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,309
- Hmm?
- Hey, kitty. What took you so long?

245
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,021
Relax, kid.

246
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,316
Dodger, razor-sharp claws?

247
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,654
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.

248
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,490
Hey, keep it down, guys. The game's on.

249
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,534
Oh, boy, Dodger.
Top dog has to get help from a cat.

250
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,996
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.

251
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,123
Come on. Let's see this big,
bad kitty fight in action.

252
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,792
Hey, Tito, look!

253
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,172
Oh, boy! Dog pile!

254
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,009
Oh, what a bunch of overgrown... Oof!

255
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,845
All right. That's it.

256
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,689
All right, all right, knock it off! Enough!
What's the matter with you guys?

257
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,023
Don't you understand?

258
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,151
Sykes will be here any minute.
And I don't have...

259
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,654
No, no, no, no, no!

260
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,158
No, no. Stop it.

261
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,869
No. No. No licking.

262
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,875
What a joke! All right, settle down.

263
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,336
Sykes!

264
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,049
All right, all right. I'm coming.

265
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,385
I'll be right there.

266
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,595
You guys, listen. Don't let me down.

267
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,889
What do you got? Let's see what you got.

268
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:22,519
It's worthless! What have you done?

269
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:27,566
Oh, how are we ever going
to pay Sykes off with a pussycat?

270
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,530
Oh.
Look who's here, kids.

271
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,575
Company. Nice doggies.

272
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,454
I was just on my way out.

273
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,710
You guys miss us?

274
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,594
Mr. Sykes. I, uh...

275
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,143
He's gonna kill me.

276
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,527
Hello. Oh, lovely evening.

277
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,947
I was just saying this to your two lovely
purebred Dobermans.

278
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,616
The money, Fagin.

279
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,744
Actually, I've got something
much better than money.

280
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:26,208
Some luxury items that should make
a considerable dent in my debt to you.

281
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,252
Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you?

282
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,589
Did they use the buffer on it,
because I can see myself.

283
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,926
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

284
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,639
I don't want your garbage, Fagin!

285
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,809
Oh, please, Sykes. Oh, please. Oh, please.

286
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,603
I don't think you grasp

287
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,189
the severity of the situation.

288
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,984
Oh, no! Oh, no, I did grasp it.

289
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,987
This is how I grasp. Look.

290
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,615
Accident.

291
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,617
Accident! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

292
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,744
- Mr.- Fagin!
- Sorry.

293
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,416
Now, I lent you money and I don't see it.

294
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,838
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?

295
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,048
People get hurt.

296
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,178
People like you get hurt.

297
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,350
Do I make myself clear?

298
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,352
Clear! Perfectly clear!

299
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,480
Ya know, Rita, I can't figure out,

300
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,941
why you'd rather hang around a dump like this,

301
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:37,070
when you could be living uptown
with a class act like myself.

302
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:41,950
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's
entire vocabulary in a single sentence?

303
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,954
Hey, Frankie, get down,
brother. You bad, man.

304
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,039
Hey, you got something to say to me, fat boy?

305
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,169
Come on, you guys don't scare me.
I'll kill you both.

306
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,920
Come on, let me at 'em!
I'll kill 'em! I'll kill 'em!

307
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,632
Go ahead. Let him go.

308
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:00,594
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?

309
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,472
- Like you, old man?
- Hey, Roscoe.

310
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,392
Roscoe, is this us losing our sense of humor?

311
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,479
Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humor.

312
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,069
See? I find that funny.

313
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,655
Oh, please.

314
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,450
Please. Oh, please!

315
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,246
Three sunrises. Three sunsets.

316
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,416
Three days, Fagin.

317
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,878
Three sunrises. Three sunsets.

318
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,589
Three days. Three, three, three. That's nine.

319
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,966
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.

320
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,302
- Three.
- Three!

321
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,471
Oh, you mean, just three days?

322
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,058
Oh, my goodness!

323
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,353
Oh, I'm having a bad day!

324
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,153
Hey, hey, Roscoe. Look what I found.

325
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,031
Forget it, Desoto. We gotta go.

326
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,117
I like cats. I like to eat 'em.

327
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,379
Get out of my way, Dodger.

328
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,172
That's enough, Roscoe.

329
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,805
Run along, Roscoe.

330
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,599
Your master's calling.

331
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,771
Come on, Desoto.

332
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:40,860
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this,

333
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,988
starting with that cat.

334
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,492
Oh, yeah? You guys don't scare me!
Come on and say it to my face!

335
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,578
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

336
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,915
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice
before hassling us, man.

337
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,460
All right, kid. What'd I tell you guys?

338
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,629
OI' Dodge can really pick 'em, huh?

339
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,012
Ooh, three days.

340
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,859
How am I ever gonna come up
with all that money?

341
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:30,368
What's the use? I'll never get out
from under that maniac.

342
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,042
My days are numbered

343
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,919
and the number is three.

344
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,048
It's hopeless.

345
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,732
Thanks, guys.

346
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,655
That reminds me.

347
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,367
I saw Desoto's nose. Who did that?

348
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,705
You? You.

349
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,210
That took a lot of guts.

350
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,212
We've never had a cat in the gang before.

351
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,964
We can use all the help we can get.

352
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:33,765
Ahhh. All right. Time for bed.

353
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,725
We've got a big day tomorrow.

354
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,940
Aww, no.

355
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,110
Oh, all right.

356
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,195
But just one chapter tonight.

357
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,074
Um, let's see.

358
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,623
Here we are. Here we are. Chapter 7.

359
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:05,296
"Sparky stopped
and he rolled in a field of wildflowers.

360
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,174
"The dandelions tickled his nose,

361
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,136
"till he laughed out loud.

362
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,472
"And then something caught his eye.

363
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,435
"It was Bumper the rabbit.

364
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,311
"Sparky jumped to his feet,

365
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,939
"and ran toward Bumper barking loudly."

366
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,775
Woof. Woof.

367
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,903
Well, you try it sometime.

368
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:33,074
Ruff! R-Ruff!

369
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,701
Well, that's because you're a dog.

370
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,454
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run

371
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,664
"and that he could chase him over the field.

372
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,333
"But Sparky would never catch him or hurt him

373
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,253
"because Sparky was not that kind of a dog."

374
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,265
This is the big one.

375
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,768
We've got two days to do or die.

376
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,980
Dodger, you keep an eye
on the new kid. Show him the ropes.

377
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,483
I don't wanna put any undue pressure on you,

378
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:34,279
but, as you march off to do your duty,

379
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,574
I want you to keep one thing in mind.

380
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,286
Dead men do not buy dog food!

381
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,581
So, big smiles and get out there,

382
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,249
and fetch!

383
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,800
All right. If Mr. Sykes don't see
some cold, hard cash soon,

384
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,677
we are Doberman chow.

385
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,761
Come on.

386
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,014
We'll start on Columbus Avenue.

387
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,642
- What kind of work do we do, anyway?
- Investment banking, man.

388
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:08,313
Didn't you read about us
in the Wall <i>Street</i> Journal?

389
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,649
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of industry.

390
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,484
Gosh! Can I be one too?

391
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:17,113
Hey, when you got your pals, you got all ya need.

392
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,156
Okay, Dodge.

393
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:22,285
We gotta clean you up, child,
and give you some on-the-job training.

394
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,538
<i>Ooo, yeah Now listen up</i>

395
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,166
<i>You got a lot to learn</i>

396
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,002
<i>And if you don't learn you don't eat</i>

397
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,299
<i>But if you're tough and always use your head</i>

398
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,427
<i>You'll feel right at home on the street</i>

399
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:44,349
<i>When you got talent Everything is free</i>

400
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:47,810
<i>Watch how we do things Ooo, I guarantee</i>

401
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,689
<i>You're gonna see how the best survive</i>

402
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,902
<i>We make an art out of staying alive</i>

403
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,322
<i>If you do just as you're told</i>

404
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,159
<i>These are streets of gold</i>

405
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:06,537
<i>Every boulevard is a miracle mile</i>

406
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,040
<i>You'll take the town and you'll take it with style</i>

407
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,462
<i>If you play it brave and bold</i>

408
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,216
<i>These are streets of gold</i>

409
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,723
Hello? What have we here?

410
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,686
- All right! A chauffeur shuffle!
- Listen up.

411
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,188
Einstein, gimme a fender bender at two lights.

412
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:37,735
Tito. You're in charge of electronics.
Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis...

413
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:41,114
I know. My public awaits.

414
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,991
Hey, but what about me? What do I do?

415
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,325
You help Tito.

416
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,036
All right! Come on, <i>gato.</i>
Uncle Tito will show you how it's done.

417
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,707
Ready? Go!

418
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,417
Winston, listen to this.

419
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,422
"After a little sightseeing, we left Paris by car

420
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,174
"for the con, confer..."

421
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:04,262
- Conference, Jennifer.
- Oh, yes. Conference.

422
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,806
"In Rome on Wednesday.

423
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,852
"Jenny, I'm afraid your father
and I won't be able to make it..."

424
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,896
Is there anything wrong, Jenny?

425
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,107
Are your parents all right?

426
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,777
- They're staying longer.
- Oh, don't worry.

427
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,947
I'm sure they'll be home
for your birthday.

428
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,658
No.

429
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,042
- What was that?
- I... I don't know.

430
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,627
But... But now, don't be alarmed.

431
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:41,299
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.
- Run, Sparky. Go find Bumper.

432
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,935
Why me? Today of all days.

433
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,313
Hey, check it out, man. Beep, beep.

434
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,734
Hey, forget Fagin, man.
Let's take this baby to Atlantic City.

435
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,863
What have I done? Poor thing.

436
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,573
You oughta be ashamed of yourself!

437
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,116
I'm sure he's just fine.

438
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,326
Harming that poor...

439
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,786
Probably just a little stunned.

440
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,120
Run along, little fellow. Go on, now. Shoo.

441
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,874
- Hey, Tito. What can I do?
- Well, uh...

442
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,002
Why don't you be a lookout, man?
Yeah, that's it. Be a lookout.

443
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,047
Okay. What is a lookout?

444
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:25,343
Ay! Look, just look out the window.

445
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,428
Make sure it's still daylight, okay?

446
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:36,687
Hey. Hey, Tito. Tito, there's somethin' back there.

447
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:40,525
Hey, stop hasslin' me, man.
I only got one more wire, okay?

448
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,402
But... But...

449
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,950
What's goin' on here?

450
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,702
Let's get outta here!

451
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:02,171
Oh, you poor kitty. Here. Let me help you.

452
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,090
Jenny, are you all right?

453
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,011
Where's the kid?

454
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,723
He must still be in the car, man.

455
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,393
Oh, that poor little kid.

456
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,770
You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito!

457
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,147
Yeah.

458
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,233
Well, it's hard to watch anything
when you're getting barbecued, man.

459
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,277
What are we gonna do, Dodge?

460
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,820
Tito, come with me.

461
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,905
The rest of you, get back to Fagin.

462
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:37,832
Now, really, Jenny. We can't
just take in a stray off the street.

463
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,084
But look at the poor thing.

464
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:43,671
Winston, he's half starved.

465
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,716
Ah. I know you're growing attached
to the little fellow,

466
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,802
but do try to understand.

467
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,513
Your parents left me responsible for you.

468
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,849
They won't mind. Really.

469
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,020
Don't worry, kitty. I'll take care of you.

470
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,857
Georgette is not going to like this.

471
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,153
Rise and shine, Georgette. Your public awaits.

472
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:35,306
<i>Girl, we've got work to do</i>

473
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,851

<i>Perfect isn't easy</i>

476
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:49,862
<i>But it's me</i>

00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:56,160
<i>When one knows the world is watching</i>

478
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,038
<i>One does what one must</i>

479
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:03,376
<i>Some minor adjustments, darling</i>

480
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,171
<i>Not for my vanity but for humanity</i>

481
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:10,299
<i>Each little step a pose</i>

482
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,178
<i>See how the breeding shows Ooh!</i>

483
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:20,017
<i>Sometimes it's too much for even me</i>

484
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:25,564
<i>But when all the world says yes</i>

485
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,235
<i>Then who am I to say no</i>

486
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:33,030
<i>Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl</i>

487
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,950
<i>No, girl, ya need a pro</i>

488
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:42,039
<i>Not a flea or a flaw</i>

489
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,334
<i>Take a peek at that paw</i>

490
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,379

Aaa... Ooo...

Ooo!

507
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,954
Wait till you taste this.

508
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,248
It's a secret recipe I just invented.

509
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:10,169
What on earth...

510
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,505
My goodness! Jenny!

511
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,466
Don't you think a tin of kitty chow
would have sufficed?

512
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,676
Nonsense. He'll love this.

513
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,012
Now, young lady.

514
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,723
I really think we should've waited
until your parents...

515
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,227
Ugh!

516
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,980
Oh, bother!

517
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:33,359
And for ze kitty, the house specialty.

518
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,987
Ia <i>Jenny</i> avec Cocoa Krispies.

519
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,156
Mmm.

520
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,327
- Jenny, it's your parents!
- Yeah! Wait till I tell 'em!

521
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,623
Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you
everything is absolutely hunky...

522
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:51,669
Georgette, I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

523
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,755
- Uh, everything's fine here.
- They're gonna be so excited.

524
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:55,923
Here she is now.

525
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,343
A cat!

526
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,846
What is the meaning of this?

527
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,557
Winston!

528
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,310
I guess I'll have to handle this myself.

529
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,691
- Hello.
- Hello.

530
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:17,361
I, um, hope you won't think me rude,

531
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,447
but do you happen to know

532
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,825
out of whose bowl you're eating?

533
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,619
- Yours?
- Ooh!

534
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,581
Aren't you a clever kitty?

535
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:35,212
And do you have any idea whose home this is?

536
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,339
I thought it was Jenny's.

537
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,843
Well, it may be Jenny's house,

538
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:45,389
but everything from the doorknobs down is mine!

539
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:49,351
Oh, Georgette. I see you've met Oliver.
Isn't he cute?

540
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,438
I've got great news. Mom and Dad
just said I could keep him.

541
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,192
I'm sure you two are gonna be the best of friends.

542
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,071
<i>Now for $200..</i>

543
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,991
- Where's the kid?
- We tailed him all the way up the park.

544
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,203
- We never had a chance.
- You should see this place.

545
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,872
There's gotta be maybe 200 people livin' there.

546
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,874
We can't let the kid take the heat for us.

547
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,044
Yeah, man. If we don't get him,
they're gonna torture that kid.

548
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,962
What in heaven's name are we waiting for?

549
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,423
But what about Fagin?

550
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,551
Alas, our beleaguered benefactor,

551
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:25,346
bearing the brunt of our futile endeavors.

552
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:28,140
Gimme a break. Speak English, Frankie.

553
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,267
Francis. Francis. Francis!

554
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,436
All right, cool it!

555
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:34,980
Now we got work to do.

556
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,608
First, we'll spring the kid.

557
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,903
Then we'll take care of the old man. All right?

558
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:45,324
Yeah! That's right, man! He's family. He's blood.

559
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,492
Hear, hear!

560
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,912
Okay, troops. Our mission begins at daybreak.

561
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,414
Einstein, go up to the door. Francis, you're our...

562
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,967
Oh, Jennifer. I don't hear any practicing!

563
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:08,138
All right, Winston. I gotta practice now, kitty.

564
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:18,148
Oh, you wanna practice too.

565
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,654
<i>You and me together</i>

566
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:27,825
<i>Will be forever</i>

567
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,952
<i>You'll see</i>

568
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:35,666
<i>We two can be good company</i>

569
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,668
<i>You and me</i>

570
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,379
<i>Yes, together we two</i>

571
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,547
Hmph!

572
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,719
<i>Together that's you</i>

573
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,806
<i>Forever with me</i>

574
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:56,186
<i>We'll always be good company</i>

575
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,856
<i>You and me</i>

576
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,651
<i>Yes, together we'll be</i>

577
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:16,183
<i>You and me together</i>

578
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:20,771
<i>Will be forever</i>

579
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,148
<i>You'll see</i>

580
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:29,488
<i>We'll always be good company</i>

581
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,324
<i>You and me</i>

582
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:37,413
<i>Just wait and see</i>

583
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,875
Good night, Oliver.

584
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,680
Bye, Winston. Good-bye, Oliver.

585
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,934
Hi, Jenny. Sit over here.

586
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:02,563
All right, listen up. We checked it out.
All we gotta do is...

587
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:08,152
Oh, man! He's dead meat now!

588
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,487
I'll handle that ruffian.

589
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:14,616
Body slam! Body slam! Oh, come on, you fool!

590
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,453
Hit him! Hit him! Oh, bother.

591
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:21,373
Einy. Get outta there!

592
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,167
Huh?

593
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,712
Yes? Who is it?

594
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:31,717
Oh, my-

595
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,261
You!

596
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:37,431
I'll show you, you, you...

597
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,433
Come back here!

598
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,852
What...

599
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:51,695
Miralo this place. Check it out.

600
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:55,282
Chagall. Matisse.

601
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,701
These are all masterpieces.

602
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:02,080
Huh, this place looks pretty nice.
I mean, how bad off could it be here?

603
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:07,336
Hey, man, if this is torture,
chain me to the wall.

604
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,837
Tito!

605
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,550
We're here for the kid, remember?
Now let's get him and go.

606
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:19,306
"I love you, Oliver. Play with Georgette."

607
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:24,228
I'd like to play with him, all right!
The little fur ball!

608
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,146
Ooh.

609
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,858
Who are you? What do you want? Winston!

610
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,735
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.

611
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:36,240
Ooh!

612
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:43,163
Don't come any closer!
I knew this would happen one day.

613
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:46,583
You're barkin' up the wrong tree.
It's not you I'm after.

614
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,545
It's not? It's not!

615
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,630
Well, why not?

616
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,384
What's the problem, Spot?
Not good enough for you?

617
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,762
I mean, do you even know who I am?

618
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:02,432
Fifty-six blue ribbons.

619
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,435
Fourteen regional trophies!

620
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:08,897
Six-time national champion!

621
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:12,317
Ooh, and we're all very impressed. Right, guys?

622
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,444
Very impressed.

623
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,363
Oh!

624
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:20,951
Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Ignacio Alonzo Julio Frederico de Tito.

625
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,745
Get away from me, you little bug-eyed creep!

626
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,247
Winston!

627
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:31,253
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!

628
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,298
And you, tubby, off the bed!

629
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,383
Get away from there, you...

630
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,720
- All right! That does it!

631
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:42,848
You yo-yos clear out and I mean now!

632
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,767
Winston!

633
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,980
Relax, champ.
We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.

634
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:54,151
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch
of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...

635
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:57,154
Your cat?

636
00:44:57,321 --> 00:45:01,158
How stupid of me. You must be
the friends he keeps talking about.

637
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,368
- Yes.
- Georgette.

638
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,413
Something's not quite right here.

639
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,135
Shh. Quick. Before he comes back. Follow me.

640
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:25,807
Look at him, Dodger.
Honey, let's just forget the whole thing.

641
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,852
No, no, you can't do that! You don't understand.

642
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:31,521
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- Georgette.

643
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,691
- Huh? What?
- What is going on here?

644
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,694
Now get going. Hurry. Use the fire escape.

645
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,115
Hey, there's no time for long good-byes,

646
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,910
but here's something to remember me by, baby.

647
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,668
Ooh, I think she likes me, man.

648
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:54,753
<i>Ooh, I could've danced all night</i>

649
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,588
<i>I could've danced all night</i>

650
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,883
- You were very good.
- What?

651
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:03,595
- Nice job, Dodger.
- Hey, wait. What's goin' on, you guys?

652
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,973
- Just the rescue of the century.
- Rescue?

653
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,557
Shoulda seen Frankie handle that butler.

654
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:11,228
I was rather good, wasn't I?

655
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:15,273
And how about Tito
and Miss Six-time National Champion?

656
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:18,360
Hey, hey, but, wait.
I don't understand you guys.

657
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:21,863
- You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

658
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:24,992
Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito.

659
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:28,578
I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?

660
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,418
We rescued you, kitty.
We... We brought you home.

661
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:38,296
But, well, I have another home now.

662
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,340
And someone who loves me.

663
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:43,927
What do you mean, kid? You're in the gang.

664
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,931
- But, but...
- The gang means family.

665
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,851
We risked a lot to get you outta there.

666
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,854
Look, I'm sorry, but all I ever wanted was...

667
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,940
What? This place is not good enough
for you anymore?

668
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,900
Don't wanna mix with the riffraff?

669
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:03,447
No, no. I like you. I mean, I like...
I like every one of you, but...

670
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:07,993
But there was a little girl. I just wanna go back.

671
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,955
We never should've took him, Dodger.

672
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:13,290
But, Dodger, please...

673
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,126
You wanna leave? Fine! There's the door.

674
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:19,963
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin' ya.

675
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:22,090
Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up.

676
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,510
You lighten up! If he doesn't like it, let him go.

677
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,787
Oh, it's hopeless.

678
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,096
What's this?

679
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,849
So that's where you've been!

680
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,936
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, Oliver.

681
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:20,816
Your owner probably spends
more money on catnip

682
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:23,026
than we do on food in a month.

683
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,529
He's probably worried sick about you.

684
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,699
All alone in that big house
with only his money to comfort him.

685
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,869
Only his millions and millions of dollars to...

686
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,584
That's it! We're saved!

687
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,921
Oh-ho-ho. What a plan! Ah, yes!

688
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:47,092
Uh, paper! Paper! Whoo, it's so great.

689
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:55,725
Dear Mr. Rich... Ah!

690
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,690
Mr. Very Rich.

691
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,319
- Bye, Jenny!
- Oliver!

692
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,406
Oliver? Oliver!

693
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,908
<i>Feel it. That's it. Very good.</i>

694
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,243
Oliver!

695
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,619
Oliver!

696
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:17,038
<i>Two, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, you love it!</i>

697
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,374
Oliver, I'm home.

698
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,879
That's funny.

699
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:27,716
Georgette, help me find Oliver.

700
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,179
Oliver! Oliver!

701
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,931
Oh, where could he be?

702
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,310
Oliver?

703
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,855
He's not here.

704
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,903
Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

705
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,070
Hmm.

706
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,787
"Dear Mr. Very Rich Cat-owner Person."

707
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:06,963
Whoops.

708
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:11,968
"And if you don't bring the money,

709
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,930
"you'll never see your cat again."

710
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, no.

711
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:21,311
Georgette, something terrible has happened.

712
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:24,564
They've kidnapped Oliver.

713
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:28,985
Oh, Georgette, you loved him too.

714
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,988
Don't worry. We're going to get him back.

715
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:40,121
<i>This is an airtight plan, Sykes.
Sweet and simple.</i>

716
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,960
I ransom the kitty,
and you get paid in full tomorrow.

717
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:48,838
I'll even toss in a little extra
for your patience.

718
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:53,009
Whaddya say? It's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

719
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,894
Yeah, Who <i>is</i> it'?

720
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,521
Oh...

721
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:10,151
Fagin, it's you. Why didn't you say so?

722
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,530
<i>Oh! Good question.</i>

723
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:18,660
<i>But listen, if you're busy,
we can drop by some other time.</i>

724
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:22,330
Don't be silly. Just push the door.

725
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,877
<i>I said, push!</i>

726
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,299
Ooh!

727
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:42,350
What do you mean? You start with the knuckles.

728
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:45,895
Ahh, Fagin. Do come in. I'll be right with you.

729
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:48,064
Yeah.

730
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:50,900
No, you don't kill him yet.

731
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:54,070
Huh? Yeah.

732
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,949
And then, what's the last thing you do?
You put on the cement shoes.

733
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,953
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

734
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,956
Come on. Hey, don't worry about it.

735
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:07,834
So, Fagin.

736
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:12,756
Did we bring something green
and wrinkly to make me happy?

737
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:16,801
Sykes, I've got an airtight kitty... Plan... Plan!

738
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:18,845
It's sweet and simple, the plan.

739
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,556
- Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Let's just take this from the top.

740
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,976
What am I gonna do with you, Fagin?

741
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,686
- I've got this kitty, you see...
- Fagin.

742
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,939
You don't got the money.

743
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,360
Oh, no! Oh, no!

744
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:34,944
Oh, no, no, no! Stop! Please, Sykes, please!

745
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,782
Sykes, I'm getting your money tonight!
It's coming tonight!

746
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:43,870
Please. It's from a rich cat... No, I mean,
a cat from a rich family's paying... Ow!

747
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:48,291
They're coming tonight with the money
I owe you, uh, to get the cat back!

{SNAPS) - ********************

749
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,303
Hey, I think there's hope for you yet.

750
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:05,308
Oh-ho! I'm proud of ya, Fagin.

751
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,895
Yeah, you're startin' to think big.

752
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,441
You've got 12 hours.

753
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,861
And, Fagin?

754
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,657
This is your last chance.

755
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:30,041
Turn left, right when you get to the big propeller.

756
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,337
Oh, Georgette, I can't read this.

757
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:39,008
No, that... No, that's not right. It's left.

758
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,095
Oh, Georgette, where are we?

759
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:44,848
I think we're lost.

760
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:50,270
Stick close, Georgette. It's creepy down here.

761
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:56,693
He's late. I drew a perfectly good map.

762
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,779
Well, there was a few smudges on it, okay.

763
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:03,366
I went outside the line with
the green crayon, but not that much.

764
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:04,701
- Oh, Dodge.
- A child could read that map.

765
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:07,871
Hey, Rita, they never laid a paw on me.

766
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:12,500
Ooh, wait. What if he comes
and he's huge and mean?

767
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,044
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's the FBI!

768
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,881
I didn't do it! I didn't do it! I was framed!

769
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,300
Oh-ho-ho! Whaa...

770
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:28,725
Listen, little girl, this is a tough neighborhood.

771
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,644
You'd better go home.

772
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,230
- Ugh!
- I can't.

773
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,400
- I'm lost.
- Aw, gee.

774
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,943
Lost. Well.

775
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:41,446
I'd help you, but I'm kind of busy right now.

776
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:46,242
What're you doin' down here anyway?

777
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,745
I came to find my kitty.

778
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,748
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole him.

779
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,583
But... But, uh, are you sure?

780
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:55,627
Maybe you made a mistake.

781
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,794
No.

782
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:58,838
No, somebody stole him and sent me this note.

783
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:02,592
- Easy, boys.
- See? Now I'm lost. Look.

784
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:05,595
I even brought this to get him back.

785
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:09,265
Oh-ho-ho-ho-hoo! You brought a piggy bank.

786
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,644
- That's all I have.
- That's awful.

787
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:17,398
I know. And what kind of a person
would steal a poor little kitty?

788
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:20,610
But I... I mean, maybe he...

789
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:24,447
Maybe he was up against the wall,
at the end of his rope.

790
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,827
He must have been a poor, desperate man.

791
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,454
It's still wrong!

792
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:36,751
I'm so scared. I don't know what to do.

793
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:40,255
- I don't know what to do.
- Neither do I!

794
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,045
Hey! Guess what?

795
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:25,842
I found a little lost kitten.

796
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:29,220
I don't know, take a look. Maybe he's yours.

797
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:32,974
Oliver! Oliver! Oh, my Oliver!

798
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:34,684
Sykes.

799
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:38,688
Sykes! I was gonna... Yaaah!

800
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:42,442
- Hey! Hey, wait! What're you doing?
- Let go!

801
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:45,612
No! No, wait! You can't do this!

802
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:47,739
Keep your mouth shut.

803
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,699
Consider our account closed.

804
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,744
Stop! Stop! Time out!

DOGS BARKING)

806
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,708
- Wha... What happened?
- You okay, kid?

807
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:02,962
- Jenny... He took Jenny!
- Don't worry. We'll get her back.

808
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,632
You will?

809
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:08,009
Hey. "Absitively," kid.

810
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:10,053
Come on, man, let's go! Come on!

811
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:12,722
- Let's get him, man!
- All right... Let's do it.

812
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:17,810
Wait! Come back! Stay. Sit. Wait!

813
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,979
Come back!

814
00:57:25,777 --> 00:57:29,739
- Oh, man. It don't look good.
- It's all locked up, Dodger.

815
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,908
All right. There's gotta be some way in.

816
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,372
Yeah. Francis.

817
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:40,166
Now, don't cry, little girl.

818
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,461
They only eat when I tell them to.

819
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:49,133
- Francis, you all set?
- Farewell, Dulcinea.

820
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:51,594
- Francis!
- Peasants.

821
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:53,429
Maestro?

822
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:56,974
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah.

823
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:58,184
Go!

824
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,228
Oof!

825
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,316
Roscoe. Desoto.

826
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,453
Come on, Desoto.

827
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,170
Hey, hey, hey! There is a lady present.

828
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:30,174
Well, it's nice to see
that one of you has some manners.

829
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:33,302
After you, my little croissant.

830
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,179
Good grief.

831
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:42,311
And remember, quiet.

832
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:46,566
Oh!

833
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:50,737
- I broke a nail.
- Oh, balderdash.

834
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,156
- What'd you call my woman, man?
- Freeze!

835
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:58,202
- Yo, Tito.
- Right. I'll check it out.

836
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:05,126
Yeah. Oh, that's funny, Mr. Winston.

837
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:08,421
But I don't think you really
appreciate the situation.

838
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,673
Somebody could get hurt.

839
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,510
Why not just get the old man on the phone

840
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,304
and tell him it's about his daughter...

841
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:18,639
Jenny.

842
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:21,476
Okay, listen up. Tito, Francis,
I want you...

843
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,853
You smell that?

844
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,857
Yeah. Heh-heh! It's party time.

845
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,988
What the...

846
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,952
Didn't order any pizza.

847
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,330
Go, go, go, go, 90, 90, 90, 90!

848
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,710
Where are those dogs?

849
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,008
Oh, Oliver!

850
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,552
I thought I'd never see you again.

851
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:02,725
- Ahem... Gentlemen.
- What's the occasion?

852
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:06,145
- Come to rescue your little friend?
- Say good-bye, Francis.

853
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:08,397
Oh, boys!

854
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,359
Whoopsy-dais-Y!

855
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,653
All right! What a woman!

856
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:21,118
Francis, you keep an eye
on the monitors. Rita, over here.

857
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,250
What is this, a slumber party?
Get goin', ya stupid mutts!

858
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,711
Francis, is the coast clear? Francis!

859
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,048
Goodness!

860
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:37,343
- What're we gonna do, Dodge?
- Yo, Tito, hot-wire.

861
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:38,803
Hey, no way, Dodger, man.
