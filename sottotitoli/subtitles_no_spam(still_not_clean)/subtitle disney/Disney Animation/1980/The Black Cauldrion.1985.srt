1
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>Legend has it,
in the mystic land of Prydain,</i>

2
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,574
<i>there was once a king
so cruel and so evil</i>

3
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,577
<i>that even the gods feared him.</i>

4
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,213
<i>Since no prison could hold him,</i>

5
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:44,051
<i>he was thrown alive into a
crucible of molten iron.</i>

6
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:47,121
<i>There, his demonic
spirit was captured</i>

7
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:51,792
<i>in the form of
a great black cauldron.</i>

8
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:53,327
<i>For uncounted centuries,</i>

9
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,664
<i>the Black Cauldron
lay hidden, waiting,</i>

10
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>while evil men searched for it,</i>

11
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>knowing whoever possessed it
would have the power</i>

12
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:07,742
<i>to resurrect an army
of deathless warriors</i>

13
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:11,679
<i>and, with them, rule the world.</i>

14
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:47,715
There's something wrong.
I can feel it in my bones.

15
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,151
And the Fairfolk know it, too.

16
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,686
You don't see
any of them around.

17
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,389
The Horned King,

18
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:59,927
that black-hearted devil,

19
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,163
what's he waiting for?

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,168
Yes, yes, cat. I know you
want your breakfast,

21
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,238
but just now
thinking is more important.

22
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,445
Taran! The pot is
boiling over, Taran!

23
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:22,583
Oh, Dallben.
I was just thinking.

24
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:26,954
What if the war's over, and I
never had a chance to fight?

25
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,223
And a good thing, too.

26
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:32,727
War isn't a game.
People get hurt.

27
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:34,729
But I'm not afraid.
Ouch!

28
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,398
Yes, there you are.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,266
If the Horned King ever returns,

30
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:41,602
you'll have a great deal more
to worry about

31
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:44,205
than a burned finger.

32
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,410
No, no, no, cat. That is not for you.
It's for Hen Wen.

33
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:52,413
Hen Wen, Hen Wen.
It's always Hen Wen.

34
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:57,084
And one day, my boy,
you may learn why.

35
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:01,122
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.

36
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:02,423
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,994
He's so anxious

38
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:10,665
and so blind to
the dangers ahead.

39
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:16,037
Look! Look, cat.
You're in luck.

40
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,606
Just enough left for you.

41
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:26,547
Dallben doesn't understand.

42
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,283
I'm not a little boy any more.

43
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:36,290
I should be doing heroic deeds
for Prydain,

44
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:38,959
not waiting hand and foot
on a spoiled...

45
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,795
Hey!

46
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,197
Oh, all right, Hen.

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,733
I didn't mean it.

48
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,069
You'd better eat it.

49
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,938
Dallben made it
especially for you.

50
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,916
Is this to be my life?
Pampering a pig?

51
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:05,019
I'm a warrior, not a pig keeper.

52
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,289
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid,
but I wouldn't.

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,192
All I need is a chance,

54
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:14,395
and I could be a famous warrior.

55
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:17,665
Look at me, Hen! I can do it!

56
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,800
Hah!

57
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,740
Even you're afraid.

58
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:29,110
Do you challenge me?
Run, you cowards.

59
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,818
There you are.

60
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,755
His Majesty, the Horned King.

61
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,623
So we meet at last.

62
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,925
Hah!

63
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,495
Even the Horned King
shakes with fear.

64
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:51,832
See, Hen? Everybody runs from the
famous Taran of Caer Dallben!

65
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,474
Prydain's finest warrior

66
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:04,912
draws his last breath.

67
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,257
Dallben.

68
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,361
Hmm. Not quite
the blade for a hero.

69
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:24,665
I was...
It's just that we were...

70
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,967
Hen Wen got dirty.

71
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,003
Oh, I see.

72
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,039
Another dream, Taran?

73
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,544
But, Dallben, won't I ever be
anything but an assistant pig keeper?

74
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,779
She's a special pig, Taran.

75
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,388
Now, give her a nice bath.

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,259
Well, Hen, it looks as though I'll
still be an assistant pig keeper

77
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,928
when I'm as old as Dallben.

78
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,833
You like that, don't you?

79
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,235
Now for the part you like best.

80
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:15,382
Hey, come on, Hen. I haven't
finished scrubbing your...

81
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,919
Hen, what's the matter?
Calm down, Hen.

82
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,955
Stop it, please!
What's the matter?

83
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,423
Hen Wen...

84
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,325
Taran, what's going on?

85
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't know.

86
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,896
There's something wrong
with Hen Wen.

87
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:32,700
What? Quickly,
lad, bring her inside.

88
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:43,544
What's that for?

89
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,446
Put Hen Wen down.

90
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,849
I never use her powers
unless I have to,

91
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,151
but now I must.

92
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,519
Powers?

93
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,723
Taran, what you
are about to see,

94
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,893
you must never reveal to anyone.

95
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:05,165
Hen Wen, from you I do beseech

96
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,769
knowledge that
lies beyond my reach,

97
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:12,039
troubled thoughts
beyond your heart.

98
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,676
Pray you now
those thoughts impart.

99
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:35,729
Ah, the Horned King.

100
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,436
Don't interfere.

101
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,807
He is searching.

102
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,689
The Black Cauldron!

103
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,291
So that's it.

104
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,226
The Black Cauldron?

105
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,862
An awesome weapon, Taran.

106
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,965
It's been hidden for centuries,

107
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:15,769
but if the Horned King should
find it and unleash its power,

108
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,539
nothing could stand against him.

109
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,241
That's Hen Wen.

110
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,277
He knows.

111
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,382
Stop! Enough!
You must leave here at once.

112
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,384
Take Hen Wen to
the hidden cottage

113
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,386
at the edge of
the Forbidden Forest.

114
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:36,790
Hide there and never bring her
out until I come for you.

115
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,293
Hide? But why?

116
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:43,430
Only I knew the secret
of Hen Wen's power,

117
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,667
but now the Horned King
has discovered it.

118
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:52,272
We must make sure he never uses
it to find the Black Cauldron.

119
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:54,341
I'm not afraid of
the Horned King.

120
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:57,411
Then you are a very foolish lad.

121
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:01,715
Untried courage is
no match for his evil.

122
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,018
Just remember that.

123
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,788
Now, off you go, my boy,

124
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,923
and take care of yourself.

125
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:12,926
Goodbye, Dallben.

126
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,230
I won't fail you.

127
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,739
So much, so soon,

128
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,911
to rest on his young shoulders.

129
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:30,471
Oh, yes.

130
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,640
Yes, my soldiers.

131
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,745
Soon the Black
Cauldron will be mine.

132
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:45,686
Its evil power will
course through my veins,

133
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:52,860
and I shall make
you Cauldron-Born.

134
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:59,700
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes.

135
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,704
Then you will worship me!

136
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:07,107
Me.

137
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,379
Oh, my soldiers.

138
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:17,718
How long I have
thirsted to be a god

139
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:21,722
among mortal men.

140
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,465
Gosh, Hen Wen,

141
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:35,002
I never knew you could create
visions and things like that.

142
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,437
I thought you were
just an ordinary pig.

143
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:42,209
I had no idea you
were so special.

144
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,379
Dallben's going to be glad
that he put his trust in me.

145
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,714
Just you wait and see.

146
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,484
Now, don't go wandering about.

147
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,019
And don't you worry.

148
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,955
Keep close to me and no
one will do you any harm,

149
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,858
not while I'm around.

150
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,064
And I won't let the Horned
King get close to you, Hen.

151
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,066
I'll protect you.

152
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:13,607
<i>Taran of Caer Dallben,</i>

153
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,711
<i>the greatest
warrior in all Prydain,</i>

154
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,013
<i>a true hero!</i>

155
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:25,552
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you all.

156
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:29,289
But without the help of my
pig, Hen Wen, here, I...

157
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,292
Hen Wen, where are you?

158
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,196
Hen Wen? Oh, no!

159
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,834
Hen?

160
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,475
Hen Wen!

161
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,050
Is that you, Hen?

162
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,688
Look what I've got.

163
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,124
Come on out.
Here's a lovely, juicy...

164
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,231
Oh, great prince,

165
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:14,134
give poor, starving Gurgi
munchings and crunchings.

166
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:16,336
Nice apple.

167
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,707
Good prince. Good apple.
Oh, boy, what a juicy apple.

168
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,879
Hey! No, you don't.

169
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:28,615
I didn't give you that apple.
You took it.

170
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,250
Ow!

171
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:34,921
Hey, hold on, you hairy little thief.
Come back with my apple!

172
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:38,959
If you don't give it back,
you'll be sorry. I mean it.

173
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:42,429
I'm warning you.

174
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:45,332
Give it back.

175
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,374
Come on.
The apple. Where is it?

176
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,611
Gurgi not know where the...
Uh-oh.

177
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:03,183
Give it back. I warn you.

178
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,687
Come on.

179
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,294
Come on, the apple.
Let's have it.

180
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,702
You horrible, greedy thing.

181
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,371
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

182
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:29,276
Oh, poor, miserable Gurgi deserves
fierce smackings and whackings

183
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,245
on his poor, tender head.

184
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,049
Always left with no munchings
and crunchings.

185
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,321
Forgive poor Gurgi.

186
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:45,258
Oh, stop that sniveling.
I'm not going to hurt you.

187
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,228
Now, look here.
Have you seen my pig?

188
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,399
Piggy? Round, fat piggy?

189
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:54,801
Big snout?

190
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:56,136
Yes, yes.

191
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,671
Curly tail?

192
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,439
That's her. That's Hen Wen.

193
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,709
Nope.
Gurgi not see piggy. Nope.

194
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,379
Oh, never mind.

195
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:09,149
No telling where
Hen Wen is by now.

196
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:13,854
Oh, master, master, now Gurgi remembers!
Yes, yes!

197
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,891
Clever, sharp-eyed Gurgi
saw the piggy run.

198
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:22,729
Yes, right through the forest.
I saw it. I saw it.

199
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:25,899
Come! Gurgi will
find the lost piggy.

200
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:29,469
Then we'll be friends forever.

201
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:33,106
Munchings and crunchings
in here somewhere.

202
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:37,344
It's Hen Wen!
She's in trouble!

203
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:38,745
Goodbye.

204
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:42,215
Hen Wen!

205
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,450
Hen!

206
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,591
Hen Wen!

207
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,905
Hen Wen, look out!

208
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,114
Look out!

209
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:21,688
Come on! Hurry, Hen!
No! No! Hen, hurry!

210
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,861
No! No!

211
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,832
No! No!

212
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:36,736
No! Come back!

213
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:39,306
Please!

214
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:42,375
No! No! Come back!

215
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,472
Hen Wen.

216
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,342
I must get her out of there.

217
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,377
Oh, no, great lord.

218
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:20,680
Not go in there.
Forget the piggy.

219
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,249
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,685
Gurgi come back
to be your friend.

221
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,355
Friend? You're no friend!

222
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:32,792
Why, you ran away when I...
Oh, never mind.

223
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:36,162
I promised Dallben
I would keep Hen safe.

224
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,965
I have to go.

225
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,702
Well, are you coming?

226
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:46,172
Me? Go in there?

227
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:49,409
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a terrible place.

228
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,579
Just as I thought.
You're no friend.

229
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:56,049
You're just a miserable coward.

230
00:17:57,386 --> 00:18:01,054
Here. This is
all you wanted.

231
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:09,262
If great lord go
into evil castle,

232
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:12,232
poor Gurgi will never see
his friend again.

233
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:15,101
No, never.

234
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,035
Shut up,
you thick-skulled dolt.

235
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,504
Always barking at nothing.

236
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:27,374
All right,
might as well make our rounds.

237
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,853
Here's to everybody!

238
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:43,623
More wine and meat for my men!

239
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,959
And more women.

240
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,695
Quiet. I'm trying to sleep.

241
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,234
What about a kiss, eh, princess?

242
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,736
Gads, you're a lovely one!

243
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,837
Come on!

244
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,905
Here.

245
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,747
Keep your hands off,
you little creeper.

246
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:12,118
Going somewhere, Creeper?

247
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:19,759
Kiss me, love, and I'll die
with a smile on my face.

248
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,073
Welcome, Your Majesty.

249
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:10,310
We're just
celebrating our success.

250
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,080
I mean your success.

251
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:17,684
We've made no
mistakes this time.

252
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,188
Bring in the prisoner!

253
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,696
Oh, no.

254
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,768
There, sire.

255
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,037
This is the pig
that creates visions.

256
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:41,941
All right, pig,
show His Majesty where

257
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:44,544
the Black Cauldron can be found.

258
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,380
Go on! Show it!

259
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,719
Stubborn little thing,
isn't she?

260
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:02,929
Why, yes, sire. You're quite right.
I'll take care of it at once.

261
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:06,032
The Black Cauldron.
Where is it?

262
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,602
Show us, swine!

263
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:13,673
I warn you,
the King's patience is short.

264
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:16,176
No, no!

265
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,444
No!

266
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,186
Get him!
The sneaking, no-good...

267
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:27,687
Get back, or I'll...

268
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,226
Oh.

269
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,894
Release him.

270
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:36,729
What?

271
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,132
Here.

272
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,937
Hen Wen.

273
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:47,373
Oh, Hen Wen. There, there.

274
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:52,178
I presume, my boy,

275
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:57,283
you are the keeper
of this oracular pig.

276
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:02,488
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,825
Then instruct her to show me

278
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:11,598
the whereabouts of
the Black Cauldron.

279
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,769
Oh, sir, I can't. I promised.

280
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,372
Very well.

281
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:22,008
In that case,
the pig is no use to me.

282
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:28,781
What are you going to do?

283
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:31,751
No! You can't!

284
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:34,954
Don't!

285
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,558
No! Stop!

286
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
I'll make her tell you.

287
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,428
That's better.

288
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,666
Now, get on
with the vision, pig.

289
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:55,141
Hen Wen, from you I do beseech

290
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:59,212
knowledge that
lies beyond my reach.

291
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:06,419
Look! Look, sire!
It's working!

292
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:10,456
Ah, yes.
The Black Cauldron.

293
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:14,060
So it does exist. Go on.

294
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:18,164
Yes, yes. Where is it?

295
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,067
Show me.

296
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,137
Show me.

297
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:31,744
Come on, Hen!

298
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:36,683
After them!
Get them! After them!

299
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,378
Gotcha, pig boy!

300
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,960
The moat.
It's our only chance.

301
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:23,629
Come on, Hen.

302
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:31,771
Swim, Hen! Swim!

303
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:38,478
I'm coming.

304
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:42,715
Gotcha, pig boy!

305
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:47,020
I caught him, Your Majesty!
I caught the boy.

306
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:49,989
But you let
the pig go, didn't you?

307
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:52,825
It wasn't my fault.

308
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,732
Throw the boy into the dungeon.

309
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:20,420
<i>You must make sure
he never uses Hen Wen</i>

310
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:23,589
<i>to find the Black Cauldron.</i>

311
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,358
<i>I won't fail you, Dallben.</i>

312
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:33,599
<i>Look at me, Hen! I can do it!</i>

313
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:40,873
I can do it.
I can do it.

314
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:04,197
I thought I heard
a noise in here.

315
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,834
Oh! Was that you?

316
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,968
Yeah. Yes.

317
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,504
You're being held
a prisoner, aren't you?

318
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,705
Yes.

319
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:15,241
I'm being held
against my will, too.

320
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,743
It lights up.

321
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:20,746
Why, of course. It's magic.

322
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:23,015
Oh, I hate this place.

323
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,418
I do hope there
aren't any rats in here.

324
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,987
Not that I really
mind them, you know,

325
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,756
but they do jump out at one so.

326
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:35,862
I'm Princess Eilonwy.
Are you a lord or a warrior?

327
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,066
No. I'm an
assistant pig keeper.

328
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:43,369
Oh, what a pity.

329
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:47,440
I was so hoping for someone
who could help me escape.

330
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:50,209
Oh, well. If you want to
come with me, you may.

331
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,644
Can I?

332
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:53,779
Well, yes. I said you could.

333
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:57,717
Oh, that wicked, wicked king.

334
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,785
You know, he stole me.

335
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:02,955
He thought my bauble could tell
him where some old cauldron was.

336
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:05,124
That's what he
wanted my pig for.

337
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:08,161
Oh, yes, your pig.

338
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:10,496
But my pig can tell the future.

339
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:13,366
Oh, how interesting.

340
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:17,069
Well, you'd better stay close
to me, or you'll get lost.

341
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,287
Your bauble!

342
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:36,289
Oh, it's always
chasing those rats.

343
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:43,062
A burial chamber.

344
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:46,933
This could be the tomb of the
great king who built this castle

345
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,502
before the Horned
King took it over.

346
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,610
Are you all right?

347
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:02,481
Well, come on, then.
Help me look around.

348
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:22,034
He must have been
a great warrior.

349
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:30,876
A sword!

350
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:46,058
This will please him.

351
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,060
It's a good lot this time.

352
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:50,963
Hurry! In with it!

353
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:54,033
Finally.
He'll reward me for this.

354
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:59,739
Don't stop, you weakling!

355
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:02,642
Put some muscle into it.

356
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,354
Let's get out of here
before they come back.

357
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:30,636
Where did you get that sword?

358
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:31,837
Back there.

359
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,005
You mean...

360
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,408
Well, he's not going to use it.

361
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,814
You're making
a horrendous mistake.

362
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:43,649
I'm not a spy!

363
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:48,287
I'm a bard! I sing.

364
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:52,558
I entertain. I...

365
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,896
Careful, sir. These are
the hands of an artist.

366
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,664
This'll hold you.

367
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:03,202
Now, look. You seem an
intelligent sort of chap to me.

368
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:06,339
I assure you I had no idea
who owned this castle.

369
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:08,240
I just happened to be passing.

370
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:12,378
Oh, he's nice, isn't he?
What's his name?

371
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:19,018
No! Down, boy!

372
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,119
Come on.

373
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:23,689
You don't realize who I am.

374
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:27,660
I shall sing of
your dastardly deed.

375
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:31,731
I'm Fflewddur Fflam,
minstrel of minstrels,

376
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:35,668
balladeer to the grandest
courts in all the land!

377
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,605
And I...
Well, have you forgotten?

378
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,943
I have sung in some
of the finest courts.

379
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,312
Well, I'm only
waiting for an invitation.

380
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,115
Oh, shush.

381
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,517
Why do you have to judge
every word I say?

382
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,888
Who's that?

383
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,424
Help!

384
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:02,561
Oh, hello. We'll have
you untied in a moment.

385
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,930
I'm Princess Eilonwy

386
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,366
and you're in bad trouble,
aren't you?

387
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:11,137
"Trouble"? Don't you know
where you are?

388
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,738
Haven't you seen him?

389
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,608
Pig boy has escaped.
Look in there.

390
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,343
We've been discovered.

391
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,078
That's you?

392
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,482
Oh, great Belin, run! Run!

393
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,717
Make haste!

394
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:29,655
"Make haste"?
I must save myself.

395
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,932
I think he went
through the passage.

396
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:42,368
All right, let's try down here.

397
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:52,912
Princess?

398
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,048
Princess Eilonwy?

399
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:00,753
Pig boy!

400
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:03,689
You little scut!

401
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:29,615
No, no, no.

402
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,338
Are you all right?

403
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,840
Oh, good. You're safe.

404
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,575
Why, of course. I...

405
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,578
Come on. I'm going to get
you out of here. Aah!

406
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:04,250
There they are.

407
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,218
Quick! Up here.

408
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:18,497
Taran, the sword.

409
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,299
Great Belin!

410
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,104
Help! Murder!

411
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:30,910
Keep going, Princess.

412
00:34:40,187 --> 00:34:41,854
There he is!
There he is!

413
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,594
Over there!

414
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,665
Stop him!

415
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:56,101
Taran!

416
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,436
There they are.

417
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,116
Come on! Get them!

418
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:13,752
Oh, no! Taran!

419
00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:16,388
We've got you now, pig boy.

420
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,894
Taran, do something!

421
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,698
Use the sword!

422
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,843
Make way! Make way!

423
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,347
Stand aside, I command you.
Get out from under my feet!

424
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,952
Let me go, you brute!

425
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:49,054
Run, Princess! Run!

426
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,890
Stay up! Please stay up!

427
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:59,131
Why didn't you tell me
you had a magic sword?

428
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:17,650
I'll say it wasn't
my fault. That's it.

429
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:22,354
That's it. I always get
blamed for these things.

430
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:27,192
I'll just tell him,
and if he gets mad...

431
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,296
I'll just straighten him out.

432
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:35,534
That's it. I'm not going to be
kicked around for this.

433
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,616
Sire?

434
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:58,090
You bring news of the pig?

435
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:04,863
No, not exactly, sire.

436
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:09,268
It's...
Oh, it's the pig keeper.

437
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,171
He's... Oh, he's...

438
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:16,508
He's escaped.

439
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:28,220
Oh, sire! Allow me.

440
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:37,029
Isn't that enough?

441
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:42,868
Good. He'll find his pig.

442
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,038
Send the gwythaints
to follow that boy.

443
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,073
Oh, yes, sire!

444
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,308
Oh, yes!

445
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:52,544
By all means, sire!

446
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:16,502
<i>* The world will applaud me</i>

447
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:19,304
<i>* Its praise will reward me</i>

448
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:23,609
<i>* And I, Fflewddur Fflam,
will find fame *</i>

449
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:28,113
They're almost finished,
Fflewddur.

450
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:32,484
It's not too good,
but it'll hold for a while.

451
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:35,053
Yes, I shall sing of your deed.

452
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:38,857
It would be better
to sing of our heroic escape.

453
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,226
Weren't you a bit
frightened, Fflewddur?

454
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:43,362
A Fflam, frightened?

455
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,466
The word is not
in my vocabulary.

456
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:50,235
But in this case,
well-chosen, my dear.

457
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:51,770
I wasn't afraid.

458
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:54,206
Ouch! Not afraid?

459
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,809
Why, we were
running for our lives.

460
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:59,077
Well, I got us out of
the castle, didn't I?

461
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,214
You? I'd say it was
the sword's magic.

462
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:05,651
But it takes a great warrior
to handle a sword like this.

463
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:09,154
But still, it is a magic sword.

464
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:11,990
What does a girl know
about swords, anyway?

465
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,827
Girl? Girl?

466
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:16,995
If it weren't for this girl,

467
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:19,665
you would still be
in the Horned King's dungeon.

468
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,501
Here now,
Princess Eilonwy, Taran...

469
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:26,238
At least I don't keep
talking about it forever.

470
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,841
Oh, you're so boring!

471
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,376
Princess Eilonwy...

472
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:33,478
How dare you take his side?

473
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:39,618
I really didn't... I didn't
mean to interfere, you know.

474
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,654
Silly girl.
Even if she is a princess.

475
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:48,994
But we're going to
have to... To...

476
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:52,531
Dear, oh, dear.

477
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,021
Hello.

478
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,524
Hello.

479
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:23,896
Fflewddur is right, you know.

480
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,331
We are going to
have to work together.

481
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:29,801
And we'll find your pig.

482
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:32,170
I'm sure it's important.

483
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:37,075
Thank you for getting
me out of the dungeon.

484
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:40,445
Oh, but we couldn't
have done it without you.

485
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:43,248
Well, at least we're all safe.

486
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:46,184
Great Belin!

487
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:47,586
Fflewddur!

488
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:50,055
Help! Murder!

489
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:52,424
Hurry!

490
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:55,594
Gurgi's lucky day.

491
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:56,828
Get this thing off me.

492
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,163
Wow.

493
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,432
Yes, keep it! It's a gift!

494
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,800
Want this. Gurgi want this.

495
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,135
Go ahead.

496
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:05,504
I'm sure you've
murdered for less.

497
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,573
Want. Gurgi want!

498
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,210
Gurgi.

499
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:17,516
Master? Oh, old man fell down.

500
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,351
Get up. Get up.

501
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,556
Well, really.

502
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:29,194
Who is your
pungent little friend?

503
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,663
He's no friend of mine.

504
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:34,199
He's just a coward and a thief.

505
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:37,970
Too big anyway.

506
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:47,045
You're charming.

507
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,114
And pungent, too.

508
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:53,685
Well, what are you waiting for?

509
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:56,989
Yes, yes. Exactly.
Now toddle off, toddle off.

510
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,992
Gurgi go.

511
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,064
Tracks? Tracks!

512
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:09,034
Gurgi remember.
Saw piggy's tracks.

513
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:10,902
You did?
Today!

514
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,572
Today? Wait a minute.

515
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,407
He'll try anything.

516
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,844
Oh, you're both horrid.
He just might know.

517
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:20,012
Pretty lady come, too?

518
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,179
Well, I...

519
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:24,282
Yes, yes, yes!
Follow Gurgi! Follow Gurgi!

520
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:26,284
You better be telling the truth.

521
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:29,588
Gurgi not lie, not this time.

522
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,268
See, master?

523
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,438
Piggy's footsteps. No lie.

524
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,941
Oh, good. They look fresh.

525
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:04,089
Oh, master. Master!

526
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:07,225
Gurgi, hold on!

527
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:11,797
Oh, no! Taran!
Give me your hand.

528
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,665
We're doomed!

529
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:42,894
Uh-oh.

530
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:46,665
How did they get in here?

531
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:50,435
Old Doli's
whirlpool broke again.

532
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:53,605
I bet they wake up soon.

533
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:55,941
We better tell King Eidilleg.

534
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:59,478
No, silly. You know we're
not supposed to be up here.

535
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,746
Uh-oh. We're all
gonna be in trouble.

536
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:03,982
Not me.

537
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:05,383
Me, either.

538
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:11,123
Uh-oh.

539
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:16,294
Oh, yes. I see you fixed that.

540
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:17,629
Yep.

541
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:24,169
When I get this
last peg in here,

542
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,605
I'll be finished.

543
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,543
Good. Yes,
that should work.

544
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:35,080
It's perfect. Grab that pole!

545
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:36,748
I got it!

546
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:48,627
Oh, aren't you all darling?

547
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:51,196
Hello.

548
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:53,765
I'm King Eidilleg
of the Fairfolk.

549
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:56,668
How the blazes did they...

550
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:04,709
I thought I told you
to fix the whirlpool.

551
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:08,613
I fixed it.
I did fix it! It was perfect!

552
00:45:08,615 --> 00:45:11,082
Evidently,
not completely perfect.

553
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,785
It's supposed to keep them out.

554
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,620
Can I be of any service?

555
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:18,557
Is everything that happens
around here my fault?

556
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,759
Are you here on
a friendly visit?

557
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:24,396
And I suppose it's my fault
the pig's here, too?

558
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:25,730
Hen Wen?

559
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,032
Oh, she's your pig?

560
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:29,134
Oh, good.

561
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:32,938
One less thing
for old Doli to worry about.

562
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,806
Doli.

563
00:45:34,808 --> 00:45:36,641
What now?

564
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:38,643
Would you hurry
and fetch the pig?

565
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,483
Hey, you kids,
what are you doing?

566
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:50,255
Oh, Mr. Doli, I just wanna
see the pretty lady.

567
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:53,725
Well, now,
you watch yourselves, hear?

568
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:17,983
I can't believe my eyes,
Your Majesty.

569
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:32,163
Watch it. Watch it!

570
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,531
Oh, Hen!

571
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,268
Thank goodness you're...

572
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:46,011
Tell me, is the burning and
killing still going on up there?

573
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:50,615
You refer to that joke on
humanity, the Horned King.

574
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:53,318
Will no one ever
stand up to him?

575
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,619
We've seen him,

576
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:59,190
and if he finds the Cauldron,
he'll kill us all.

577
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,660
Oh, no, no.
He'll never find it.

578
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:05,630
No, no.
It's safely hidden in Morva.

579
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:08,233
Morva?

580
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:10,802
Well, at least I think it is.

581
00:47:10,804 --> 00:47:13,371
Oh, Doli, is it?

582
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,806
Really?

583
00:47:14,808 --> 00:47:17,208
Is that one of my new jobs,

584
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,478
remembering where
the Cauldron was last seen?

585
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,147
Gee!

586
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:26,151
Oh, he'll know right
where it is. You'll see.

587
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:30,322
If we could get to the Cauldron
first and destroy it...

588
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:32,223
Oh, this isn't right, Taran.

589
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,092
But don't you see?

590
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:38,763
If we destroy the Cauldron,
it will stop the Horned King.

591
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,534
Please, come with me.

592
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:44,669
Wait, I never thought...
Morva.

593
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:46,171
That's a hard place to get to.

594
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:48,006
Yep.

595
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,207
Why, you can take them.

596
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:50,942
What?

597
00:47:50,944 --> 00:47:54,045
Do you mean we're trusting
our lives to him?

598
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,915
And what is wrong with me?

599
00:47:56,917 --> 00:48:00,352
Oh, nothing.
Splendid choice.

600
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:04,189
Shall we, then?

601
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:26,411
Wait! Hen Wen!

602
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:30,115
Oh, don't worry.
We'll get her home safely.

603
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,318
Oh, thank you, sir.
Be good, Hen.

604
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:57,342
Well, if it's the Marshes of Morva
you wanted, here you are.

605
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:01,279
Such a dreary place.

606
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,383
Let's see what it looks
like from up here.

607
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,387
I think we're lost.

608
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:14,492
Are you sure
this is the right place, Doli?

609
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,462
Yes, I'm sure.

610
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:21,299
Well, if you ask me...

611
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:26,104
Fflewddur! Doli!

612
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:27,739
Are you all right?

613
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:30,175
Hey, look out,
you big, clumsy oaf!

614
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:32,544
Look where you...
Uh-oh.

615
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,481
Welcome to Morva.

616
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:42,587
Well, someone must live here.

617
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,256
Gurgi not like this place.

618
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:48,092
No.

619
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,994
It seems empty.

620
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:53,097
Maybe we should have a look.

621
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:57,735
If I can just get
this door open...

622
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:03,708
How will we ever
find the Black Cauldron

623
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,543
in a place like this?

624
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,012
It must be here somewhere.

625
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,637
They're only frogs, Eilonwy.

626
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,539
Those were people.

627
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,442
You mean they were
turned into frogs?

628
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:39,811
Oh, master, come quickly.

629
00:50:39,813 --> 00:50:41,713
Gurgi found the wicked Cauldron.

630
00:50:41,715 --> 00:50:43,948
Quick, quick, quick!
Follow Gurgi!

631
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:48,386
Behold, master.

632
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:51,623
The whole room is
full of cauldrons.

633
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,992
I don't understand.

634
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:56,995
Why would anyone want so many...

635
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:01,099
Thieves! Thieves!

636
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,968
Someone stole all our frogs.

637
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:10,174
You evil, nasty people.

638
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:14,746
You shall all be turned
into frogs and eaten.

639
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:21,319
Nice and tender.

640
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:23,421
Stop that, you... You...

641
00:51:23,423 --> 00:51:26,524
Oh. So nice to
meet you, ladies.

642
00:51:26,526 --> 00:51:28,293
Goodbye. Aah!

643
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:29,627
Wait.

644
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:33,998
My, aren't you the handsome one?

645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,034
Who? Me?

646
00:51:36,036 --> 00:51:42,040
Oh, honestly, now, don't
you find me irresistible?

647
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,509
Yes. Well,
of course, most attractive.

648
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,611
Shush! Stop that.

649
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:50,214
You don't mind if
I pluck your harp,

650
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,686
do you, handsome?

651
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:57,555
Enough of that
lovesick nonsense.

652
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:00,658
Great Belin!

653
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:06,064
Quick! We're going
to have toad stew.

654
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:17,609
You're not gonna eat this one.

655
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:21,346
Come here, love.

656
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:24,716
Can anyone here
perform marriages?

657
00:52:24,718 --> 00:52:26,718
Marriages?

658
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,586
You love-struck witch!

659
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:34,158
Where is he? Where'd he go?

660
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:38,229
Yoo-hoo! Where are you?

661
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:40,331
Don't go.

662
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,100
Now look what you've done.

663
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:43,468
He's gone!

664
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:47,472
I'll never forgive you
for this, Orgoch, never!

665
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:50,608
Ooh! There you are.

666
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:02,954
Enough! We've come
for the Black Cauldron.

667
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:05,289
Did you hear that, sisters?

668
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,692
Why, nobody's asked
for the Black Cauldron

669
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:09,961
in over 2,000 years.

670
00:53:09,963 --> 00:53:11,696
It's a trick.

671
00:53:11,698 --> 00:53:13,531
We're not going to let
them have it, are we?

672
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,333
Don't worry.

673
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:17,869
Leave it to me.

674
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:21,606
Perhaps I might interest you
in something else?

675
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:25,910
A kettle, a cook pot,
a skillet, a teapot,

676
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,513
a bucket, a jar, a platter?

677
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,216
See anything you like?

678
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,457
I don't believe it.

679
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:50,301
I've never seen
a sword like that.

680
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:56,240
I've got to have that sword.

681
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:58,810
Listen carefully.

682
00:53:58,812 --> 00:54:03,114
We'll trade
the Cauldron for the sword.

683
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,117
But what can they do
with the Cauldron, Orddu?

684
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,188
Nothing! That's the point.
Don't you see?

685
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:16,127
We'll end up with both the
sword and the Cauldron.

686
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:20,298
It's decided, then. You shall
have the Black Cauldron.

687
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,101
You mean you'll give it to us?

688
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,671
That's not what I said.

689
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:28,706
You weren't listening.

690
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,708
We never give anything away.

691
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:35,313
What we do is bargain, trade.

692
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,415
Well, you'll not have my sword!

693
00:54:39,352 --> 00:54:42,086
May I ask you ladies to perhaps

694
00:54:42,088 --> 00:54:44,856
consider this magnificent harp?

695
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:46,791
A harp?

696
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:49,994
Oh, when we want music,
we send for the birds.

697
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,364
What would we do
with a simple harp?

698
00:54:53,366 --> 00:54:58,369
Wait! Gurgi will trade
his crunchings and munchings.

699
00:54:58,371 --> 00:54:59,971
Who would want...

700
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:02,473
Hold it, sister. Not so fast.

701
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:08,679
All right.
I know what you want.

702
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,548
Yes?

703
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,717
No, Taran! No!

704
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,752
It's our only chance.

705
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:20,758
Here is my sword. Take it.

706
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,694
Is it your own choice, duckling?

707
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:26,731
Remember, with this sword,

708
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:30,401
you could be
the greatest of warriors.

709
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:34,872
Yes.
I offer my dearest possession

710
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:38,276
in exchange for
the Black Cauldron.

711
00:55:38,278 --> 00:55:41,913
Agreed.
We have made a bargain.

712
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:55,126
Look out!

713
00:55:58,097 --> 00:55:59,997
Help!

714
00:56:03,937 --> 00:56:06,037
Taran, watch out!

715
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:09,440
Great Belin!

716
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:12,143
Duck!

717
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,398
Look!

718
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:58,990
The Black Cauldron.
It's ours!

719
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:06,030
I say,
what funny little ducklings.

720
00:57:06,032 --> 00:57:11,235
Don't they know the Black
Cauldron is indestructible?

721
00:57:11,237 --> 00:57:13,671
Now listen carefully.

722
00:57:13,673 --> 00:57:17,875
The Black Cauldron
can never be destroyed.

723
00:57:17,877 --> 00:57:21,412
Only its evil
powers can be stopped.

724
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:24,582
Then there is a way. But how?

725
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:30,821
A living being must climb
into it of his own free will.

726
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:34,759
Gurgi is bold and brave. He will
climb into the evil Cauldron.

727
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:40,665
However, the poor duckling
will never climb out alive.

728
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,566
Yikes!

729
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:44,535
Now, look here, madam.

730
00:57:44,537 --> 00:57:46,537
Don't forget we
had an agreement.

731
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:49,373
Yes. You said
we could have the Cauldron.

732
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,876
Of course we said
you could have the Cauldron.

733
00:57:51,878 --> 00:57:54,578
It's not our fault
you can't do anything with it.

734
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,853
<i>Goodbye, goslings.</i>

735
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:06,657
<i>Remember,
we always keep a bargain.</i>

736
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,776
What a bunch of
blundering misfits!

737
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:30,114
Things just never work out when
you're dealing with people.

738
00:58:30,116 --> 00:58:32,383
You can go back to feeding pigs.

739
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:34,719
I've had it. Goodbye.

740
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,759
Doli's right. It's my fault.

741
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,327
I let you down.

742
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:45,930
Without my sword, I'm nothing,

743
00:58:45,932 --> 00:58:48,933
just an assistant pig keeper.

744
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:51,902
Look, you are somebody.

745
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:54,372
You must believe in yourself.

746
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,308
I believe in you.

747
00:58:58,011 --> 00:59:00,111
You do?

748
00:59:00,113 --> 00:59:05,349
And I think that you're...
I mean...

749
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,018
That is...
Yes, Taran?

750
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,186
I mean...

751
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:17,094
What I mean is,
I'm grateful to all of you.

752
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,230
You've been true friends.
Now it's up to me...

753
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,699
Look!

754
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:27,671
Trouble. Goodbye.

755
00:59:27,673 --> 00:59:30,207
Quick!
We can't let them find us.

756
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,209
Pig boy!

757
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:44,055
Fight where you are, pig boy.

758
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:46,557
Gotcha.

759
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,092
Gotcha now, pig boy.

760
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:57,535
Get a move on! Careful, now.

761
00:59:57,537 --> 00:59:59,970
You! Pile them up over there!

762
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,373
And get that cart out of here!

763
01:00:03,676 --> 01:00:06,644
Oh, I'm sorry.

764
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:09,346
I've ignored you.

765
01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:13,717
You did come for the Black
Cauldron, didn't you?

766
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:16,987
Good. Then climb in!

767
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:20,858
It will only cost you your life.

768
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,959
Oh.

769
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:24,995
Oh!

770
01:00:26,532 --> 01:00:30,301
Everything is ready, sire.

771
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:36,440
My, such a brave
and handsome group:

772
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:40,077
a pig boy, a scullery maid

773
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,514
and a broken-down minstrel.

774
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:48,552
Perhaps it may interest you to see
what fate has in store for you.

775
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:58,262
Now I call on my
army of the dead,

776
01:00:58,264 --> 01:01:01,699
the Cauldron-Born.

777
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:09,073
Arise, my messengers of death.

778
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:13,477
Our time has arrived.

779
01:02:18,477 --> 01:02:22,379
Oh, it's horrible.

780
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:27,451
My beloved warriors
have come to life,

781
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:31,021
all the dead of centuries past.

782
01:02:31,023 --> 01:02:35,893
Never has anyone
created an army like this.

783
01:02:39,232 --> 01:02:43,167
Go forth, my deathless warriors.

784
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:46,437
Destroy all in your path.

785
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:52,243
Come, sire. We can get a
better view from above.

786
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,546
Oh, Taran.

787
01:02:55,548 --> 01:02:58,482
I'm afraid it'll
soon be over for us.

788
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:02,720
I hadn't planned it
to end like this, Eilonwy.

789
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:06,557
Oh, I wish I'd stayed a toad.

790
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:15,733
Only moments away from victory,

791
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:19,737
my greatest triumph.

792
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:23,774
We did it, sire! We did it!

793
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:25,709
Oh, I mean you.

794
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:29,947
Yes, of course.
You did it, sire.

795
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:41,625
Yikes!

796
01:03:44,897 --> 01:03:47,765
Gurgi? Gurgi?
Is that you?

797
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:49,800
Master!

798
01:03:49,802 --> 01:03:53,537
Gurgi, what are you doing here?

799
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:58,309
Gurgi is sorry he always runs
away when there's trouble.

800
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:02,813
He will untie everybody,

801
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,015
then we will
leave this evil place.

802
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:07,751
Yeah, but get on with it.

803
01:04:07,753 --> 01:04:09,353
Good boy, Gurgi.

804
01:04:09,355 --> 01:04:13,357
Eilonwy, you and Fflewddur
go with Gurgi.

805
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,959
I must stop the Cauldron.

806
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:20,931
Oh, but, Taran, that's impossible.
Why, you'd be...

807
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:22,132
Taran!

808
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:24,201
I'm sorry, Eilonwy.

809
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:27,638
Please, Taran. No! You can't!

810
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,306
My mind is made up.

811
01:04:29,308 --> 01:04:32,810
Wait, master! Gurgi not let
you jump into Cauldron.

812
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:34,578
Gurgi, get out of my way.

813
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:37,147
Whoa!

814
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:40,851
Whoa!

815
01:04:40,853 --> 01:04:44,521
Please, master,
not go into evil Cauldron.

816
01:04:44,523 --> 01:04:48,325
If I don't, we're all lost.
Out of my way!

817
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:51,595
No, Gurgi not let
his friend die.

818
01:04:53,299 --> 01:04:55,766
Taran has many friends.

819
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,237
Gurgi has no friends.

820
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:02,339
Gurgi, no!

821
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:04,441
Don't jump! Wait!

822
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:07,244
No! No!

823
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,317
Oh, no.

824
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:28,265
Sire?

825
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:32,536
Sire, look.
Something's wrong.

826
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:36,273
What is it, sire?
They're dying!

827
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:39,209
It can't be.

828
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:43,080
This had better
not be your fault.

829
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:47,584
Perhaps it needs
another body, sire.

830
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:50,587
Yes, yours.

831
01:05:57,196 --> 01:06:00,063
Get Eilonwy
out of here. Hurry!

832
01:06:00,065 --> 01:06:02,299
But, Taran, I...
Please, I...

833
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:04,468
Go on! Go with Fflewddur.

834
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:09,273
Maybe there's still
a chance for Gurgi.

835
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:11,742
Aah!

836
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:32,996
No, sire! Please!

837
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:37,301
Get up! Come alive!

838
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:40,571
Maybe they're
only resting, sire.

839
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:45,242
Do something!
My life is at stake!

840
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:49,112
Get up, you fools! Kill!

841
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:51,315
Look! Sire, look!

842
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:53,484
It's the pig boy.

843
01:06:53,486 --> 01:06:56,153
It's his fault. Yes.

844
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:59,122
He's the cause of it!

845
01:06:59,124 --> 01:07:02,960
You've interfered
for the last time.

846
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:05,095
Go for his throat, sire.

847
01:07:05,097 --> 01:07:09,733
Now, pig keeper, you shall die.

848
01:07:12,104 --> 01:07:14,571
No! No!

849
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:21,178
What? What's this?

850
01:07:24,016 --> 01:07:26,783
No, you'll not escape.

851
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:34,691
You shall satisfy
the Cauldron's hunger.

852
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:37,794
Oh, no!

853
01:07:42,968 --> 01:07:46,937
No! You'll not have me!

854
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:52,109
My power cannot die!

855
01:07:53,646 --> 01:07:55,746
Curse you!

856
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:02,819
No! No!

857
01:08:19,438 --> 01:08:21,071
Oh, no.

858
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:23,774
How horrible.

859
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,610
Poor sire.

860
01:08:27,746 --> 01:08:29,780
He's gone.

861
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:33,450
He's gone!

862
01:08:34,787 --> 01:08:35,953
He's gone!

863
01:08:38,524 --> 01:08:39,856
He's gone!

864
01:08:48,601 --> 01:08:53,437
Fflewddur! Eilonwy!

865
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,372
Over here! Hurry!

866
01:08:56,942 --> 01:08:59,042
Thank goodness you're safe.

867
01:08:59,044 --> 01:09:01,612
Come on, Fflewddur. Hurry!

868
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:05,983
Run for your lives!

869
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:15,125
Come on. Jump.

870
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:28,238
Taran, look!

871
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,674
Quick. Get in.

872
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:31,942
Let's go.

873
01:09:31,944 --> 01:09:34,244
Here. Push off,
Fflewddur.

874
01:09:36,181 --> 01:09:38,181
Uh-oh. Trouble.

875
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:42,019
Oh, we can't get through.

876
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,588
I'll try to open the gate.

877
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,723
Taran, be careful, please.

878
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:54,931
Hurry! Move on through.

879
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:57,801
Come on,
Fflewddur. Hurry!

880
01:09:57,803 --> 01:10:01,138
Oh, good work, lad.
Here, let me give you...

881
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,510
Look out!

882
01:11:09,341 --> 01:11:10,607
Look.

883
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:16,780
Gurgi.

884
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:22,552
Gurgi.

885
01:11:22,554 --> 01:11:24,855
Why is the poor duckling so sad?

886
01:11:24,857 --> 01:11:28,291
Yes. He's got
what he wanted,

887
01:11:28,293 --> 01:11:31,061
and he's still not satisfied.

888
01:11:31,063 --> 01:11:35,098
Just what do you think
you're up to, ladies?

889
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,635
Oh, we have business
with your little hero.

890
01:11:38,637 --> 01:11:42,906
Hero? Gurgi was the hero.

891
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:47,377
The only thing that mattered
to you was the Cauldron,

892
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:50,714
but now it's no use to you,

893
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:54,251
so we'll just take
it and be on our way.

894
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:56,253
Wait... But...
Wait a minute.

895
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:59,089
Stay your hand, ladies.

896
01:11:59,091 --> 01:12:02,092
We never give anything away.

897
01:12:02,094 --> 01:12:05,262
We bargain. We trade.

898
01:12:05,264 --> 01:12:06,730
Remember?

899
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:11,434
Did these old ears
hear the word "bargain"?

900
01:12:11,436 --> 01:12:15,772
Yes, madam,
those old ears heard right.

901
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:20,310
I adore forceful men.

902
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:24,080
Oh, pull yourself together,
madam.

903
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:28,285
Now, come on, out with it.
What is your offer?

904
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:30,687
No, not my...
Then I'll do it.

905
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:38,595
A magnificent
sword for a warrior.

906
01:12:48,373 --> 01:12:50,874
I'm not a warrior.

907
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:53,476
I'm a pig boy.

908
01:12:53,478 --> 01:12:55,779
What would I do with a sword?

909
01:12:55,781 --> 01:12:59,449
Absolutely nothing.

910
01:12:59,451 --> 01:13:00,951
But I would trade...

911
01:13:00,953 --> 01:13:02,619
Yes?

912
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:07,190
The Cauldron for Gurgi.

913
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:09,059
Oh, dear!

914
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:10,627
It's not possible.

915
01:13:10,629 --> 01:13:14,130
Just as I thought, ladies.

916
01:13:14,132 --> 01:13:16,299
You've got no real power!

917
01:13:16,301 --> 01:13:19,202
Admit it! Admit it!

918
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:34,918
<i>We have made a bargain.</i>

919
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:24,301
Oh, Taran.

920
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:51,328
Munchings and crunchings
in here somewhere.

921
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:55,065
Gurgi! You're alive!

922
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:57,100
He's alive!

923
01:14:57,102 --> 01:15:00,403
Great Belin, he is alive.

924
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:04,641
Oh, Fflewddur,
Fflewddur, he's alive!

925
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:07,410
I'm alive! Gurgi's alive!

926
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:10,647
Look, look, look! Touch me!

927
01:15:10,649 --> 01:15:13,416
Gurgi, you clever little thing.

928
01:15:21,326 --> 01:15:24,327
Come on, Gurgi, let's go home.

929
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:28,331
Gurgi's happy day!

930
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:31,434
Come on.

931
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:37,841
Great Belin!

932
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:56,526
You did well, my boy.

933
01:15:57,129 --> 01:15:58,328
Yep.
