1
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,653
A legend is sung

2
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,948
Of when England was young

3
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,120
And knights were brave and bold

4
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,832
The good king had died

5
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,711
And no one could decide

6
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:13,425
Who was rightful heir to the throne

7
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:21,099
It seemed that the land
would be torn by war

8
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,396
Or saved by a miracle alone

9
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,863
And that miracle appeared

10
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:40,952
In London town

11
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,166
The sword

12
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:52,381
In the stone

13
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,679
And below the hilt, in letters of gold,

14
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,348
were written these words,

15
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,686
"Whoso pulled out this sword
of this stone and anvil

16
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,439
"is rightwise king born of England.”

17
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,527
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,

18
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,530
none could move the sword, nor stir it.

19
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,741
So, the miracle had not worked.

20
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,328
And England was still without a king.

21
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,040
And in time,
the marvelous sword was forgotten.

22
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,590
This was a dark age,

23
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,635
without law and without order.

24
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,098
Men lived in fear of one another,

25
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,143
for the strong preyed upon the weak.

26
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,302
A dark age, indeed!

27
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,430
Age of inconvenience.

28
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,099
No plumbing.

29
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,394
No electricity.

30
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,438
No nothing.

31
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,650
Hang it all!

32
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,527
Hang it all.

33
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,241
Now what? Now what?

34
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
Leave off, leave off!

35
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,539
You... You fiendish chain, you!

36
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,627
Everything complicated.

37
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,296
One big medieval mess.

38
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,975
Now, let me see...

39
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,187
He should be here in...
I'd say half an hour.

40
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,523
Who? Who?

41
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,817
I'd like to know who.

42
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,820
I told you, Archimedes. I am not sure.

43
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,531
All I know is that someone
will be coming.

44
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,990
Someone very important.

45
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
Pin feathers.

46
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,830
<i>Fate will direct him to me
so that I in turn may guide him</i>

47
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,374
to his rightful place in the world.

48
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,335
And you say he will arrive
in half an hour?

49
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,673
Well, we'll just see.

50
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,009
And you will, Archimedes, you will.

51
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,808
He'll be a boy.

52
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,727
A small boy.

53
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,481
Eleven, 12 years old,

54
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,693
and a scrawny little fellow.

55
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,531
Oh, no, no, no. That can't be the one.

56
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,534
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close on to 20.

57
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,623
There he is.
The scrawny little fellow, about 12.

58
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
He's a regular little grasshopper.

59
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,129
Look at him go.

60
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,884
And where, where would you guess
he is at this very moment?

61
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,889
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I know where he is!

62
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,059
Less than a mile from here,

63
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,103
just beyond the forest.

64
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,564
And right on schedule.

65
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,608
If all goes well.

66
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,069
Quiet, Wart.

67
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,988
I'm trying to be.

68
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,992
And nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.

69
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,995
- I'm not even moving.
- Shut up.

70
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,793
Here we go. What a set-up.

71
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,506
Right smack through the old gizzard.

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,095
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

73
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,098
Why, you clumsy little fool!

74
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,727
Kay, please, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

75
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,228
Please.

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,731
If I ever...

77
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,069
If I ever get my hands on you
I'll wring your scrawny little neck,

78
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>so help me, I will.</i>

79
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,281
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

80
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,372
Don't tell me you're going in there.

81
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,250
- Why, it's swarming with wolves.
- I'm not afraid.

82
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,339
Well, go ahead. It's your skin, not mine.

83
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,132
Go on, go on.

84
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,622
There it is. There it is!

85
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,193
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

86
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,241
Well.

87
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,870
So, you did drop in for tea, after all.

88
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,291
You are a bit late, you know.

89
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,585
I am?

90
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,211
Yes.

91
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,714
Now, my name is Merlin.

92
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,342
Come, come. Who are you, my lad?

93
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,471
My name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

94
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,225
What a perfect stuffed owl.

95
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,604
<i>Stuffed? I beg your pardon!</i>

96
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,231
He's alive, and he talks!

97
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,318
And certainly a great deal better
than you do.

98
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,905
Come, Archimedes.

99
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,408
Come, come, now.
I want you to meet the Wart.

100
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,578
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

101
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,747
Boy? Boy.

102
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,916
I see no boy.

103
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,754
- I'm sorry that ...
- That's all right.

104
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,257
- He's much too sensitive.
- Sensitive?

105
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,885
Who? What, what?

106
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,013
- How did you know that I was...
- That you'd be dropping in?

107
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,017
Well, I happen to be a wizard.

108
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,145
A soothsayer, a prognosticator.

109
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,190
I have the power to see into the future.

110
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,277
Centuries into the future.

111
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,907
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.

112
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,078
They're only plans and small models,
of course.

113
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,125
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

114
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,757
There she goes.

115
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,467
Pretty good, eh?

116
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,976
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.

117
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,354
You mean you can see everything
before it happens?

118
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,314
Yes, everything.

119
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,984
Everything, Merlin?

120
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,821
No, no, not everything.

121
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,200
I... admit I didn't know whom
to expect for tea.

122
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,536
But as you can see,

123
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,331
I figured the exact place.

124
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,917
You're very clever, sir.

125
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,879
Yes. Well, never mind the "sir".

126
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,464
Just plain Merlin will do.

127
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,219
<i>- Now, would you care for sugar?
- Yes, I would.</i>

128
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,929
- Please.
- All right.

129
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,681
Sugar? Sugar!

130
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,480
No. Manners, manners.
Guests first. You know that!

131
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,861
All right. Just say when, lad.

132
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,321
When.

133
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,450
- Have you had any schooling?
- Yes.

134
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,369
I'm training to be a squire.

135
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,456
I'm learning the rules of combat
and swordsmanship

136
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,875
and jousting and horsemanship.

137
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,212
Yes, yes. Very good. That...

138
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,716
No, no, no! ll... I mean a real education.

139
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,929
Mathematics, history,
biology, natural science,

140
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,598
English, Latin, French.

141
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,143
No. When, when! Blast it all. When!

142
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,648
Impudent piece of crockery.

143
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,905
Boy, now, you can't...

144
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,247
You can't grow up
without a decent education, you know.

145
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,333
I suppose not, sir... Merlin.

146
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,003
<i>So, I am going to be your tutor.</i>

147
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,922
But I've got to get back to the castle.

148
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,550
- They'll want me in the kitchen.
- Well, then, very well.

149
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,345
<i>We'll pack and be on our way.</i>

150
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,057
You... You watch now. You'll like this.

151
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,730
Higitus figitus zumbakazing.

152
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,277
I want your attention, everything.

153
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,031
We're packing to leave.
Come on, let's go.

154
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,201
No, no, not you.
Books are always first, you know.

155
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,207
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack

156
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,251
Abra abra dabra nack

157
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,255
Shrink in size, very small
We've got to save enough room for all

158
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,342
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

159
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,271
Alakafez, balakazez
Malakamez meripides

160
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,606
Hockety, pockety, wockety...

161
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,193
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop.

162
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,903
Sugar bowl, you're getting rough.

163
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,197
That poor old tea set
is cracked enough.

164
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,494
All right. Let's start again. Let's start...

165
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,788
Where was I, boy?

166
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,917
- Hockety, pockety?
- Yes. Yes, that's right.

167
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,087
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack
Odds and ends and bric a brac

168
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,549
I'll be with you in a minute, son.
Packing's almost done.

169
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,223
You... You bungling blockhead!

170
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,268
Hey, easy there. No, go ahead.

171
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,605
Dun goo-dily doo-dily doo-dily dun.
This is the best part.

172
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,983
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

173
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,236
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitoni...

174
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,574
What a way to pack.

175
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,453
Well... Now, just a minute, boy.

176
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,832
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know.

177
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,003
- But I think it's wonderful.
- Yes, it is, rather.

178
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:46,928
Now, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

179
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,513
Because it won't!

180
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,765
But sir, I don't have any problems.

181
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,894
Everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

182
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,732
Blast it all.
There, now you see what I did?

183
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,576
That's the trouble with the world today.

184
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,538
Everybody butting their heads
against a brick wall.

185
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,332
All muscle and no mentality.

186
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,001
Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain?

187
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,629
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't?

188
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,049
- Well, how do you move about?
- I suppose I do have a little.

189
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,385
There, you see? Well, that's enough.

190
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,972
Now, develop your brain. Knowledge,
wisdom, there's the real power.

191
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,058
Higher learning, that's the thing.

192
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,106
First thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.

193
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,441
Eight hours a day.

194
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,403
We'll have six hours for school room
and two for study period.

195
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,572
But I al...

196
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,575
But I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

197
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,994
Page duties?

198
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,085
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

199
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,547
Well, yes, sir. I suppose so.

200
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,593
How do you expect to amount
to anything without an education?

201
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,637
Even in these bungling,
backward medieval times

202
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,349
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

203
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,311
Yes, sir.

204
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,729
Yes, of course.

205
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,358
You must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.

206
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,277
And you've got...

207
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,699
Now, by the by,
what direction is this castle of yours?

208
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,910
<i>I think it's north. The other way.</i>

209
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,334
All right. We'd better get a move on.
Come on, lad. Pick up the pace.

210
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,032
The devil take it.

211
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,826
The devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense

212
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,205
than to go barging off
in that infernal forest alone.

213
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,416
You had no business letting him go.

214
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,544
Look, Dad,

215
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,423
- I'm not the Wart's keeper.
- Well, blast it all, I am!

216
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,678
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

217
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,430
Being his foster father, I'm responsible.

218
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,731
Tiger, Talbert, off with you.

219
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,111
Look here. What's the big idea
of gallivanting off in the woods

220
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,990
-and worrying everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.

221
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,408
Well, sorry's not enough.

222
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,370
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.

223
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,165
- Report to the cook.
- But I'd like you to meet...

224
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,002
Go on, hop it, boy. Hop, hop, hop it.

225
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,089
You've got to keep a schedule
to run a place like this.

226
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,093
You need strict rules,
especially for small boys.

227
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,971
And I most certainly agree.

228
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,265
Who are you, and...

229
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,768
- mean, you?
- My name is Merlin.

230
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:27,148
And this is Archimedes,
the highly-educated owl.

231
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,777
Educated owl?

232
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,113
Say, that's a good one.

233
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>Say, say, I know.</i>

234
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,827
You've got him under a spell, Marvin.

235
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,290
- You're a magician.
- The name is Merlin.

236
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:50,129
And I happen to be
the world's most powerful wizard.

237
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,466
Come off it, man.

238
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>- Gadzooks.
- Al right. I shall demonstrate.</i>

239
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,140
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo,

240
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,644
wind and snow swirl and blow.

241
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,648
What the devil are you up to?

242
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,778
That is what I call a "wizard blizzard."

243
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,073
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?

244
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,866
An indoor blizzard.

245
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,160
And in the month of July.

246
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,453
So what?

247
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,374
All right, Marvin, turn her off.

248
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,126
I'm convinced.

249
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,462
Alakazam.

250
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:38,511
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

251
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,513
Oh, no, no, no, no.

252
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,682
Never touch the stuff.

253
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,560
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

254
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,108
In fact, that is why I am here.

255
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,319
I have come to educate the Wart.

256
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,363
Oh, no, you don't.

257
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,948
I'm running this place.

258
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,283
If you think you're gonna
fiddle with my schedule,

259
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,120
pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.

260
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,209
Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone.

261
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,962
Good riddance.

262
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,924
I'm gone, but then I'm not gone.

263
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:22,972
<i>So, if I do leave you can never be sure
that I am gone.</i>

264
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,307
- Can you?
- Well...

265
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,688
Well, I must say,
you've got me there, Marvin.

266
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,527
Where are you?
And you're welcome to stay, if you like.

267
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,572
Thank you. You're very kind.

268
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,450
<i>Very generous, I must say.</i>

269
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,495
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.

270
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,539
Hard times, you know, Marvin.

271
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,918
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.

272
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,088
It's drafty in the winter,
but in this hot weather

273
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,174
it's the best room in the house.

274
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,719
Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed.

275
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,055
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.

276
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,850
Marvin? Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

277
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,619
Best room in the house!

278
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,373
Guest room. Unwelcome guest room!

279
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,753
If he thinks that he can get rid of me,
I've got news for that old walrus.

280
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm sticking it out!

281
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,133
And I say we go back to the woods.

282
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,761
No, not on your life.

283
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,139
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

284
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,558
You may be right.

285
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,604
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

286
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,363
Something tells me
that you're all wet, Archimedes.

287
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,416
- Who goes there?
- Pellinore.

288
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,044
It's Pellinore, dash it all.

289
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,382
I've got big news from London.
Big news.

290
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,010
Come on, man. Drop the bridge.

291
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,940
Well... Big news, eh?

292
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,651
Well, can't wait for the London Times.

293
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:45,030
First edition won't be out for at least,
12 hundred years.

294
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,326
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and...

295
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,203
Not interested.

296
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,082
Come, come, come, come Now.
You're as wet as you can get.

297
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,043
No. No, no, no.

298
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,381
Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human.

299
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,218
<i>- You wouldn't dare.
- will. So help me, I will.</i>

300
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,929
All right. All right. All right!

301
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,514
All right.

302
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,725
Works every time.

303
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,602
Just like magic.

304
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,907
Pellinore!

305
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,412
Pellinore. Greetings, old boy.

306
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,081
What's all the noise about London?

307
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,585
Big news, really big news.

308
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,421
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

309
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,300
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

310
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,761
That's not news, dash it all.

311
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,472
- They always do.
- But Ector, Ector,

312
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,099
here's where
all the excitement comes in.

313
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:59,772
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

314
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,903
You mean...
You mean he'll be king of all England?

315
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,949
King of all England.

316
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,535
Kay, lad, did you hear that?

317
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,955
Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

318
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,750
Yes, and you could win it, boy,
if you'd knuckle down to your training.

319
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,796
We'll have you knighted by Christmas,
off to London. What do you say?

320
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,007
Sure. Why not? Why not?

321
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,969
Wart, lad,
how'd you like to go to London?

322
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,637
Sir Ector, you mean it?

323
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,348
If you stick to your duties
you can be Kay's squire.

324
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,517
<i>I will, sir, I will,.</i>

325
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,649
I don't want the Wart for my squire.

326
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,361
Here's to London, and here's to Kay.

327
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,448
And here's to the banner
of the castle of the Forest Sauvage!

328
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,325
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

329
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,303
Charge!

330
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,515
Wait, boy. Lean into it.

331
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,185
Steady, boy, steady.
Steady with the lance.

332
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,439
Do it, white knight! Hit him clean.

333
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,734
No. No, no!

334
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,989
Heads up!

335
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,412
Archimedes?

336
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,789
Archimedes, where are we?

337
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,042
In a tumbled-down old tower

338
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,379
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

339
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,215
Castle? Castle?

340
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,509
Don't you even remember the boy?

341
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,511
The boy?

342
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,306
Can't you remember one blasted thing?

343
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,308
Now, just a moment. ll...

344
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,602
Tight grip on the lance.

345
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,813
Loose in the saddle, knees in tight,

346
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,858
weight forward and stay on target.

347
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,571
You keep losing your grip.

348
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,741
It's not a mere matter of muscle, son.

349
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,911
Jousting is a fine skill.

350
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,122
It... It's a highly developed science.

351
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,375
Science, indeed.

352
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,254
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

353
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,758
And the Wart's just as hot for it
as the rest of them.

354
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,178
He certainly is.
That boy's got real spark.

355
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,471
Lots of spirit.

356
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,891
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

357
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,479
That's really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction.

358
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,606
Fat chance of that.

359
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,068
I plan to cheat, of course.

360
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,195
Use magic.

361
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,615
Every last trick in the trade if I have to.

362
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,046
I'd give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger,

363
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,092
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

364
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,596
- Well, won't you?
- Oh, no.

365
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,559
You see, I'm an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth.

366
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,520
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

367
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,856
That's a big job too, you know.

368
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,858
Oh, indeed. Yes, yes.

369
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:34,278
I would say almost impossible.

370
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,699
Yes. Well, now then,
when I said I could swim like a fish,

371
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,201
I really meant as a fish.

372
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,997
You mean you can turn yourself
into a fish?

373
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,875
After all, I happen to be a wizard.

374
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,710
Could you turn me into a fish?

375
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,089
Do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?

376
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,883
That's easy.

377
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,594
I've done that lots of times.

378
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,222
<i>Well, good. Then I think that my magic
can do the rest.</i>

379
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,729
Archimedes, what is that fish formula?

380
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,359
Who? Who? What?

381
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,904
You know, that Latin business.

382
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,739
Fish? Latin?

383
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:25,078
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus.

384
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:30,042
And now, if you don't mind,
I say good day to the both of you.

385
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,668
If you please.

386
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,465
When he stays out all night
he's always grumpy the next morning.

387
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,885
- He must stay out every night.
- Yes, yes.

388
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,640
<i>Oh, yes. I say, that's very good, boy.</i>

389
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,517
Who? What, what?

390
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,312
All right, boy. All set. Here we go.

391
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,065
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom.

392
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,400
Aquadigitarium.

393
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>Merlin, am I a fish? Am I a fish?</i>

394
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,118
Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish.

395
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,829
If you don't stop
flipping and flopping around

396
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,249
and get in the water you won't last long.

397
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,090
Now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll be with you in a minute.

398
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,777
So, you thought you could take right off
like a shot, did you?

399
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
Well, I am a fish, aren't I?

400
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,578
You merely look like a fish.

401
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,039
That doesn't mean
you can swim like one.

402
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,292
You don't have the instinct.

403
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:57,796
So, you'll have to use your brain
for a change.

404
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,299
You are living between two planes now,

405
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,011
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

406
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,810
Now, there are lots of ups and downs,
like a helicopter.

407
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,563
- Helicopter?
- Yes.

408
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,524
It... It... No, never mind.

409
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,737
Every flick of a fin creates movement.

410
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,324
So, first we'll start with the caudal fin.

411
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,120
No, no, boy. Your tail, tail.

412
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,546
Now, that gives you the forward thrust.
Now, let's get a rhythm.

413
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,216
Right, left, right, left

414
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,762
One, two, left and right

415
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,722
By day and night

416
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,309
That's what makes the world go round

417
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,063
In and out
Thin and stout

418
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,691
That's what makes the world go round

419
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:03,195
For every up there is a down

420
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,447
- For every square
- There is a round?

421
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
Yes.

422
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,452
- For every high
- There is a low?

423
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,870
And for every to

424
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,330
- There is a...
- Fro.

425
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,790
- Fro?
- Yes, fro.

426
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,709
To and fro, stop and go

427
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,671
That's what makes the world go round

428
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,674
In and out
Thin and stout

429
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,385
Merlin? Merlin?

430
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,637
I swallowed a bug.

431
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,766
What's wrong with that?
After all, boy, you are a fish.

432
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,726
Instincts, you know.

433
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,895
But you said I had no instinct.

434
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,563
Yes.

435
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,566
I did. That's neither here nor there.

436
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,403
The main thing is, you must...

437
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,447
Set your sights upon the heights

438
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,075
Don't be a mediocrity

439
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,285
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.

440
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,080
Don't just wait and trust to fate

441
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,417
And say that's how it's meant to be

442
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,503
It's up to you how far you go

443
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,714
If you don't try you'll never know

444
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,759
And so, my lad, as I've explained

445
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,012
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

446
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:29,281
Let's... Let's swim through
that tall grass again. It tickles.

447
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,710
I beg your pardon.

448
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,170
Me, too.

449
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,922
For every to there is a fro

450
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,675
For every stop there is a go

451
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,345
And that's what makes
the world go round

452
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,723
Let go, let go, let go.

453
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,311
You big bug-eyed bully, you.

454
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,188
Who, me?

455
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,107
Here, here, here, here, here now, boy.

456
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,693
No sense going around
insulting bullfrogs.

457
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,031
A fish has plenty of other problems
without that.

458
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,493
The water world has its forests
and its jungles, too.

459
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,621
So, it has its tigers and its wolves.

460
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,997
But that...

461
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,000
That's what makes the world go round

462
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,503
You see, my boy
it's nature's way

463
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,464
Upon the weak
the strong ones prey

464
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,342
In human life, it's also true

465
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,220
The strong will try to conquer you

466
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,847
That is what you must expect

467
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,850
Unless you use your intellect

468
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,353
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong

469
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,439
- Merlin, help, help!
- That's what makes the worl...

470
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,525
Jehoshaphat!

471
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,578
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
- No, no, you're on your own, lad.

472
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,791
- Now's your chance to prove my point.
- What point?

473
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,711
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Now, don't panic!

474
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,006
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.

475
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,054
Smart move, lad.
That's using the old intellect.

476
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,393
Bravo, boy. Great strategy.

477
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,105
- Is the lesson about over?
- Did you get the point?

478
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,482
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.

479
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,318
OK, lad, I'll fix the big brute.

480
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,111
Higgly piggly... No, no.

481
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,447
Hocus pocus... No! What the blazes...

482
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,116
- Hey didda dihicka...
- Merlin!

483
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,370
Now what?

484
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,915
Is it that, that boy?

485
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,002
- What in blazes...
- Help, help!

486
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,837
Help!

487
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,599
Help!

488
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,272
Archimedes!

489
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,857
Help!

490
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,469
What... What in...

491
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,514
What in thunder is a monster like that
doing in the moat?

492
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,599
By George, I...

493
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,185
I'll turn him into a minnow.

494
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,522
- Merlin.
- There you are, boy.

495
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,400
Snick, snack, snorrel.

496
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,861
How in the world
did you ever get out of that mess?

497
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,531
That big fish almost swallowed me,

498
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,283
and Archimedes, he, he saved me.

499
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,035
Well, by Jove.

500
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,955
Now, what do you know about that?

501
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,709
...1 did nothing of the sort!

502
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,877
I intended to eat him.

503
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,213
Young perch is my favorite dish.

504
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,589
You know that.

505
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,262
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, I...

506
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,639
Wart! Wart!

507
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,225
I've got to go. Thank you, Merlin.

508
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,019
It was so much fun. And Archimedes, I...

509
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,731
- Pin feathers, boy.
- Wart!

510
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,900
- Where are you, Wart?
- Coming! I'm coming.

511
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,070
Now, Archimedes,

512
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:23,491
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish?

513
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,411
And after such a big breakfast.

514
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:30,206
Pin feathers and gully fluff.

515
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,835
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.

516
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,423
Then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth.

517
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,843
- Turn him off, Dad.
- He was a monster.

518
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,511
<i>The biggest fish I ever saw.</i>

519
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,766
And, boy, that's the biggest fish story
I ever heard.

520
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,519
- But it's true, sir.
- That's three demerits for being late

521
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,189
and three more for the fish story.

522
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,899
Now, hop it to the kitchen!

523
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,652
I told you the Wart was loony.

524
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:04,616
He's either out of his head or
there's something fishy going on here.

525
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,371
For every high there is a low

526
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,083
For every to there is a fro

527
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,545
To and fro
Stop and go

528
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,924
That's what makes the world go round

529
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,970
- It's you, Merlin, sir.
- Yes, my lad.

530
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:30,725
Now, have you ever considered
being a squirrel?

531
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,020
- No, I don't suppose.
- Well, now,

532
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,399
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems.

533
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,820
How he has survived
throughout the ages

534
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,781
is one of nature's big mysteries.

535
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,617
His life is hazardous.

536
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,494
Downright dangerous.

537
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,956
Would you like to try it?

538
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,457
No, I'd better not.

539
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,504
Too dangerous for you, eh?

540
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,756
No, it's not that.

541
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,176
It's just that I've got six demerits.
All this work to do.

542
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,512
What a mess.

543
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,015
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.

544
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,601
Start an assembly line system.

545
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,938
All right, now.

546
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,148
A one and a two and a three and a four.

547
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,994
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Tittendy, bittendy, buttondy, dum

548
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,000
But I'm supposed to do it.

549
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,960
No one will know the difference, son

550
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,087
Who cares
as long as the work gets done?

551
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,972
Rubbety, scrubbety, sweepity, flew

552
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,103
Come on, son, let's go, let's go.

553
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,205
Wart!

554
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,082
Wart!

555
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,127
Wart, take it easy. Take it easy, boy.

556
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,172
Wart! Oh, no, boy. No, no!

557
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,342
- Wart!
- Wha... Wait. Whoa!

558
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,804
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.

559
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,599
Well, I made it, didn't 17?

560
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,684
Yes, yes, you made it, you made it.

561
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,146
But you can't always trust to luck, boy.

562
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:45,109
Now, first you start with the short jumps.

563
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,488
Gauge the distance carefully and...

564
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,661
There, you see?
Even then you can miss.

565
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,915
So, don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.

566
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,794
- What's gravity?
- Gravity's what causes you to fall.

567
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,673
- Like a stumble or a trip?
- Yes, like a stumble or a...

568
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,801
No, no, no.
It's the force that pulls you downward.

569
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:14,597
The phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies,

570
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,268
if free to move,
will be accelerated toward each other.

571
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,995
Merlin, how will we get by?

572
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,417
Well, I suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack.

573
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,298
Go on, go on. You've got lots of room.

574
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,472
<i>Well, I guess she can't be sidetracked.</i>

575
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,559
That's a girl squirrel
and a redhead, at that.

576
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,991
- She sure acts funny.
- She likes you.

577
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,409
Why?

578
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,288
Yes, well. Well, that's nature again.

579
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,124
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.

580
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,668
Here now,
you'd better leave me out of it.

581
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,881
Yeah. Me, too.

582
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,925
Merlin.

583
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,595
- Merlin!
- You're on your own, lad.

584
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,347
I'm afraid magic
can't solve this problem.

585
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,351
Look, I'm not a boy... I mean...

586
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,104
I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy.

587
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,857
A human boy, not a real sq...

588
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,487
Leave me alone.

589
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,825
Merlin, what will I do?
She won't leave me...

590
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,917
Well, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
When a girl squirrel chooses a mate,

591
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,335
it's for life.

592
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,504
<i>But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.</i>

593
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,049
She doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact,

594
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,927
that you're a him and she's a her.

595
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,263
It's a natural phenomenon.

596
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,765
Phenomenon?

597
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,725
Well, it's the...

598
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,772
It's a state of being, a frame of mind

599
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,650
It's a most befuddling thing

600
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,569
And to every being
Of every kind

601
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,863
It is discomboomerating

602
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,659
You're wasting time resisting

603
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,662
You'll find the more you do

604
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,623
The more she'll keep insisting

605
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,626
Her "him" has got to be you

606
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,169
Now, leave me alone.

607
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,629
I mean it!

608
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,257
It's a rough game, anyone knows

609
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,967
Go away!

610
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,304
There are no rules
Anything goes

611
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:06,644
There's no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration

612
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,982
It's a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing

613
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,738
Who? Who? What the...

614
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,992
Now, go on, shoo.
Get a tree of your own.

615
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,618
Skedaddle.

616
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,733
You squirrelly squirrels!

617
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,570
She's gaining on you, Wart.

618
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:04,660
There's no sensible explanation
for this discomboomeration

619
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,914
It's a most hodgepodge-ical
most illogical

620
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,583
Most confuse-ling, most bamboozling

621
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,879
Most bemuddling
Most befuddling

622
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,714
Thing

623
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,304
Really, now, Miss...

624
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,847
Madam, I...

625
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,475
You, you've made a mistake.

626
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,228
Now, now, now, please.

627
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,146
Madam. Madam!

628
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,360
Look here.

629
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,155
I am not a boy.
I mean, I am not a squirrel.

630
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,823
I'm a boy.

631
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,533
<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

632
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,285
No!

633
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,413
No, I'm a stupid old...

634
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,915
No!

635
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,043
I'm an old man.

636
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,128
An old hu... man.

637
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,422
Understand?

638
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,304
Hang it all. Now, go away.

639
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,233
Impossible. Impossible.

640
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,113
Confound it.

641
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,365
Confound it all!

642
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,413
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.

643
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,624
You've got trouble? Look at my...
Look back there!

644
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,044
One side, lad.

645
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,134
Help, Merlin, help!

646
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,694
By George!

647
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,034
I've had enough of this nonsense.

648
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,703
Alakazam.

649
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:01,670
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible,
grouchy old man.

650
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,554
Merlin.

651
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,393
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.

652
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,645
Snick, snack, snorrel.

653
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,901
There. Now you see? I'm not a squirrel.

654
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,403
I'm a boy.

655
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,032
I tried to tell you. I'm a boy.

656
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,992
A human boy.

657
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,872
If you could only understand.

658
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,303
You know, lad,
that love business is a powerful thing.

659
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,685
Greater than gravity?

660
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,438
Well, yes, boy, in its way.

661
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:05,234
I'd... Yes, I'd say it's
the greatest force on earth.

662
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,582
Ector! Ector!

663
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,001
Sir Ector, the kitchen!

664
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,377
Hold it, son.

665
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,755
- Madness all over the place.
- Kay!

666
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,924
<i>Hold that, I say.</i>

667
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,308
Now, what's all the commotion?

668
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,686
The kitchen, it's under an evil spell.

669
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,062
It's bewitched.

670
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,024
<i>No! I bet it's that old goat, Marvin.</i>

671
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,818
<i>Come on, son.
I knew he'd give us trouble.</i>

672
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,242
Gadzooks!

673
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,662
Black magic of the worst kind!

674
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,207
Come on, Kay, to the attack!

675
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,727
Heaven preserve us!

676
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,355
Kay!

677
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,670
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hop toads.

678
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:51,006
Alakazam!

679
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,055
So there you are, you old goat.

680
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:04,562
What's the idea of flinging
your evil spells all over the place?

681
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,522
Lend me a hand, boy.

682
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,446
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

683
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,785
You call washing dishes
and sweeping floors a work of evil?

684
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,997
I'll decide what's right and wrong
around here.

685
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,833
Besides, that's the Wart's job,
one of his duties.

686
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,168
Look here, boy.

687
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,589
If you want to make that trip to London,
you'd better toe the mark.

688
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,257
You old goat!

689
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,719
If I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll...

690
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,763
Madam, you won't.

691
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,682
Oh, dear.

692
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,642
He's gone.

693
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,811
Well, by Jove.

694
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,647
We ought to run the old geezer
right out of the castle.

695
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,650
Oh, no. No, no, Kay, no.

696
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,403
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us.

697
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,780
Turn us all into stone.

698
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,783
No, there's no telling
what the old devil might do.

699
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,535
He's not an old devil!

700
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,748
He... He's good
and his magic is good, too.

701
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,209
- If... If you just leave him alone.
- Now, look here, Wart.

702
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,713
- That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.

703
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:17,301
Just because you can't understand
something, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

704
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,886
Ten more demerits!

705
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,889
You make all the rules
and nobody else can say anything.

706
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,724
You've said a-plenty, boy.

707
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,810
All that popping off
just cooked your goose. Kay!

708
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,105
From now on,
young Hobbs is your squire.

709
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,482
Did you hear that, Wart?

710
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,486
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.

711
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,112
Yes, sir.

712
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,366
That will teach you to pop off,
you little pipsqueak.

713
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,714
I'm sorry, lad.

714
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,676
I'm sorry. I spoiled everything.

715
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,179
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.

716
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,348
It's not your fault.

717
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,350
I shouldn't have popped off.

718
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,519
Now I'm really done for.

719
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,313
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.

720
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,650
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.

721
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,360
I'd like to know how.

722
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,861
Use your head.

723
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,822
An education, lad.

724
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,786
- What good will that do?
- Get it first, then, who knows?

725
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,329
Are you willing to try?

726
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,874
Well, what have I got to lose?

727
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,460
That's the spirit. We'll start tomorrow.

728
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,796
We'll show 'em, won't we, boy?

729
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,631
We sure will.

730
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,885
Now, first of all, lad,

731
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,514
we've got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head.

732
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,392
Clear the way for new ideas.

733
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:53,647
Knowledge of man's fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead.

734
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,858
Now, that will be a great advantage.

735
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,818
Advantage, indeed!

736
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,947
If the boy says the world is round
they'll take him for a lunatic.

737
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,908
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

738
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:08,454
And it also goes around.

739
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:15,252
- You mean, it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no. It's round now.

740
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:18,130
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

741
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,965
And he will also find

742
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:25,179
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe.

743
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,348
- Universe?
- You're only confusing the boy.

744
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:32,394
He'll be so mixed up he'll...
He'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

745
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,688
Man has always learned from the past.

746
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,107
After all, you can't learn history
in reverse.

747
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,943
It's confusing enough,
for heaven's sakes.

748
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,738
All right. All right.

749
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,450
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.

750
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,368
You're the headmaster now.

751
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,954
So, from now on he's your pupil.

752
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:56,084
So, from now on, boy,

753
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,045
<i>you do as I say.</i>

754
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,047
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

755
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,301
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.

756
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,636
All of them?

757
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,972
<i>That, my boy,
is 2 mountain of knowledge.</i>

758
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,226
- But I can't read.
- What, what? What!

759
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,145
- I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.

760
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,648
- Well, what do you know?
- Well, ll...

761
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,652
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's.

762
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:26,740
First the A and now the B.

763
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,494
Loop and around and there's the C.

764
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,622
Merlin, look. I can write!

765
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,333
Oh, yes, yes. That's very good, boy.

766
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,502
Hen scratch, that's all. Hen scratch.

767
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:42,089
Now, come on. D, E, F.

768
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,341
And now the G.

769
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,011
You see, it's as simple as...
No, no, no, no, boy!

770
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:52,391
Use your head, use your head, will you?
How do you expect to learn anything?

771
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,559
Archimedes.

772
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:59,189
Have you seen
that flying machine model?

773
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,360
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

774
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,071
What's that thing up there?

775
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,032
Yes, of course. Here we are.

776
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,869
Do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday?

777
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,831
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

778
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:21,712
I am about to prove otherwise,
Archimedes, if you care to watch.

779
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,590
Here she goes!

780
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,718
No, no, no!

781
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,556
Man will fly, all right.

782
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,850
Just like a rock.

783
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:42,733
It would have worked if...
If it weren't for this infernal beard.

784
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,829
I never...

785
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,790
Never in my whole...

786
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,424
Man will fly someday, I tell you.

787
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,469
I have been there. I have seen it.

788
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:15,098
I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying.

789
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,685
That I was a bird and that
I could go sailing all over the sky,

790
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,437
high above everything.

791
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,107
Avis alitus avita atheta.
Prestidigitonium.

792
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,276
It's my favorite dream.

793
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,905
But then, I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

794
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,533
I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird!

795
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,037
Hold it, boy. Not so fast, not so fast.

796
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,124
First, I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.

797
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,711
Now, these large feathers

798
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,131
are called the primaries, and...

799
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:52,928
And since when do you know
all about birds' wings?

800
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,890
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and I...

801
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,978
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

802
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:05,190
All right, Mr. Know-it-All!
He's your pupil.

803
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:11,822
Now, boy, flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

804
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,869
It is a delicate art, purely aesthetic,

805
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,663
poetry of motion.

806
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:22,165
And the best way to learn it is to do it.

807
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:26,169
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

808
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,214
Spread your wings way out. Way out!

809
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,632
That's it, that's it.

810
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,176
Now, fan your tail.

811
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,180
Tippety toe, tippety toe and off we go.

812
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,644
Now, tuck your feet under like me.

813
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,605
That's it. That's the idea.

814
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,191
Whoa. What?

815
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,611
And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.

816
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,625
Why, say, boy!

817
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,753
That's pretty good.

818
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,881
Well, boy, you're a natural.

819
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,384
Are you sure this is
the first time that you...

820
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,012
Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk!

821
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,557
Look out, boy, heads up!
Come on, Wart!

822
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,935
Archimedes, help!

823
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,986
Wart! Wart!

824
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,916
What?

825
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,051
Sounds like someone's sick.

826
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,969
How lovely.

827
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,971
I do hope it's serious.

828
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,349
Something dreadful.

829
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,392
Bat gizzards.

830
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,605
It's nothing but a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.

831
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,109
I'm not really a sparrow. I'm a boy.

832
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,944
A boy?

833
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,073
Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.

834
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,117
Merlin!

835
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,829
Merlin.
The world's most powerful bungler.

836
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,082
Why, boy, I've got more magic
in one little finger.

837
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,838
Now, don't tell me you've never heard
of the marvelous Madam Mim?

838
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,549
Well, no, I don't guess so.

839
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,050
Madam Mim!

840
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,844
Good heavens.

841
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,096
Why, boy, I'm the greatest.

842
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,390
I'm truly marvelous.

843
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:48,145
<i>With only a touch
I have the power</i>

844
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,729
Zim zabberim bim

845
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,274
To wither a flower

846
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,694
! find delight
in the gruesome and grim

847
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,446
- That's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.

848
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,159
But that's nothing, nothing for me.

849
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,205
"Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

850
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:10,876
You know what?
I can even change size.

851
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,295
<i>I can be huge</i>

852
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,547
Fill the whole house

853
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,885
<i>I can be teeny
small as a mouse</i>

854
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:23,597
Black sorcery is my dish of tea

855
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,642
It comes easy to me

856
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:32,022
"Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

857
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:38,278
Marvelous, boy.
Marvelous, I'm marvelous.

858
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,951
Say, lad, did you know
that I can make myself uglier yet?

859
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,996
That would be some trick.

860
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,749
- I mean...
- Want to bet?

861
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,128
<i>You see? I win, I win!</i>

862
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,714
<i>Aren't I hideous, boy?</i>

863
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,259
- Perfectly revolting?
- Well... Yes, ma'am.

864
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:04,387
But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.

865
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:10,268
<i>I can be beautiful
Lovely and fair</i>

866
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:14,606
Silvery voice
Long purple hair

867
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,568
La la la-la
La la la la-la

868
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:22,656
La la-la la la
La-la la-la la la

869
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,077
But it's only skin-deep
Zim zabberim zim

870
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,704
I'm an ugly old creep

871
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:35,085
The magnificent, marvelous
mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim

872
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,006
Now what do you think, boy?

873
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,633
Who's the greatest?

874
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,888
Well, Merlin's magic is always,

875
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,600
well, useful for something good.

876
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,645
And he must see
something good in you.

877
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,188
I suppose so.

878
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,565
Yes, and in my book that's bad.

879
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:03,113
So, my boy,
I'm afraid I'll have to destroy you.

880
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,031
De... Destroy me?

881
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,659
Yeah, I'll give you a sporting chance.

882
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,787
I'm mad about games, you know.

883
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,039
Well, come on. Get going, boy.

884
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,583
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.

885
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,179
I win, I win!

886
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,431
The game's over.

887
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,602
Why, you little devil, you!

888
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,230
I'll wring your scrawny little neck.

889
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,774
Mim. Mim!

890
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,193
What... What are you up to?

891
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,112
Oh, Merlin.

892
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:48,325
Well, you're just in time.
We were playing a little game.

893
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,285
She was going to destroy me.

894
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,538
And just what are you gonna do
about it?

895
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,167
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizards' duel?

896
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,337
As you wish, Madam.

897
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,423
Well, come on. Step outside.

898
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,425
After you, Madam.

899
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,648
What... What's up, boy?
What's going on?

900
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,193
They're having a wizards' duel.
What's that?

901
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,861
It's a battle of wits.

902
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,614
The players change themselves
to different things

903
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:32,410
-and attempt to destroy one another.
- De... Destroy?

904
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,662
Just watch, boy. You'll get the idea.

905
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,168
First, if you don't mind,

906
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,046
- I'll make the rules.
- Rules, indeed.

907
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,590
She only wants rules
so she can break them.

908
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,010
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.

909
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:52,430
Rule one, no mineral or vegetable.

910
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,765
Only animal.

911
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:58,770
Rule two, no make-believe things
like, pink dragons and stuff.

912
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,065
Rule three, no disappearing.

913
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,193
No. Rule four, no cheating.

914
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,904
All right, all right. Now, pace off 10.

915
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:13,076
One, two, three, four...

916
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,703
Merlin, she disappeared.

917
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,790
Mim, now, you made the rules.

918
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,140
Change to something else, Merlin.

919
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,559
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give me time to think.

920
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,938
Higgity figgity... No, no.

921
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,440
Quick, Merlin, hurry!

922
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,442
Hoppity hip.

923
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,322
Madam, just a minute.

924
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,116
This is not...

925
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,875
- Come on, something bigger.
- Something smaller.

926
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,877
Mim... Mim...

927
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,886
Merlin?

928
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,013
No disappearing.

929
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,413
Mim? Mim?

930
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,791
Are you... What's going on here?

931
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,169
You... You big blimp.

932
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,849
Squash me, will ya?

933
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,690
Merlin.

934
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,153
Bravo.

935
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,909
Just you wait, just you wait.
You're gonna pay.

936
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,345
So, you want to play rough, do you?

937
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,391
All right, Merlin.

938
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,103
I'll smash you good, you old crab.

939
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,564
Jehoshaphat.

940
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,111
<i>Here I come, Mim, ready or not.</i>

941
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,115
Merlin, you wouldn't dare.

942
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,284
Merlin!

943
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,963
Now, Mim, Mim,
no dragons, remember?

944
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,009
Did I say no purple dragons? Did I?

945
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,109
I win, I win!

946
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,946
That horrible old witch.
I'll peck her eyes out.

947
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,281
No, no.

948
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,454
- He's gone.
- Disappeared.

949
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,789
<i>Madam, I have not disappeared.</i>

950
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,916
I am very tiny.

951
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,253
I am a germ, a rare disease.

952
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,131
I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis.

953
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,717
And you caught me, Mim.

954
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,177
What?

955
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,889
First, you break out into spots.

956
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:09,395
Followed by hot and cold flashes.

957
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,982
Then violent sneezing.

958
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,405
Watch it, boy.

959
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,783
You, you, you...

960
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,160
You sneaky old scoundrel!

961
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,171
It's not too serious, Madam.
You should recover in a few weeks

962
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:39,133
and be as good...
l mean, as bad, as ever.

963
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,469
<i>But I would suggest plenty of rest</i>

964
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:45,556
and lots and lots of sunshine.

965
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,518
I hate sunshine.

966
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:52,730
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!

967
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,524
I hate it, I hate it!

968
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,151
I hate, hate, hate...

969
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,531
You were really great, Merlin.
But you could have been killed.

970
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,784
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned something from it.

971
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,287
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.

972
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,999
Right you are, Wart.
So, stick to your schooling, boy.

973
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,711
<i>Don't worry. I will, sir. I will.</i>

974
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,129
I really will.

975
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,676
We will sing
all night and all day

976
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:27,014
We will fight for the blue oak tree
On a field of white

977
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,058
For the blue oak tree

978
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:34,564
On a field of white

979
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:44,282
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay.

980
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,702
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.

981
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,372
Of course, son, of course.

982
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,207
Here's to Sir Kay.

983
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,086
And who knows?
The future king of all England.

984
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,338
Watch it, will ya?

985
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,215
Kay the king?

986
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,760
What a dreadful thought.

987
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:08,181
Sir Ector, Sir Ector,
Hobbs has come down with the mumps.

988
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,435
He's all puffed up like a toad.

989
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,646
Then Kay will need another squire,
hang it all.

990
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,691
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

991
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,444
Kay's squire. You're going to London.

992
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:24,197
Sir Ector! Wha... Wait. Whoa!

993
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,203
Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin!

994
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,166
Merlin, look! I'm a squire.

995
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,882
Very nice, boy.

996
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,801
Yes, indeed.

997
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:48,888
A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.

998
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,349
It's what all squires wear.

999
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,435
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.

1000
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,604
I thought you had a few brains!

1001
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,107
Great future.

1002
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,946
A stooge for that love you, Kay.

1003
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,657
Congratulations, boy!

1004
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,243
What do you want me to be?

1005
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,161
I'm nobody. You...

1006
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,665
You don't know a thing
about what's going on today.

1007
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,501
I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.

1008
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,339
Of all the idiotic... I...

1009
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,299
Blow me to Bermuda!

1010
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,645
- Where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.

1011
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,773
- Where's that?
- An island way off somewhere

1012
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,777
-that hasn't been discovered yet.
- Will he ever come back?

1013
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,613
Who knows? Who knows anything?

1014
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,454
For the crown of all England,

1015
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,874
let the tournament begin!

1016
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:20,104
Kay! Now, it's up to the swords.

1017
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,481
Swords? Swords?

1018
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,317
Oh, no!

1019
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,903
- Kay.
- What? What?

1020
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,489
...I forgot your sword.

1021
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,034
Forgot my sword!

1022
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,037
...I left it back at the inn.

1023
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,749
Why, you bungling little fool!

1024
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,252
You'd better get it,
or don't you dare come back!

1025
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,259
Let me in, let me in!

1026
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,638
Somebody, please! Please let me in!

1027
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,891
It's no use, boy,
they've all gone to the tournament.

1028
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:00,770
What will I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

1029
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,814
Look, boy. Look.
There in the churchyard.

1030
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:07,026
A sword. Archimedes. A sword!

1031
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,280
You're gonna have a time pulling it out.

1032
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,116
Watch it, boy.

1033
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,627
Better leave it alone.

1034
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,172
But Kay's got to have a sword.

1035
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,802
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here.

1036
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,307
You're up next, son. Better get ready.

1037
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,518
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

1038
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:46,023
- This is not my sword.
- Hold on, Kay.

1039
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,525
Wait a minute.

1040
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,778
"Whoso pulleth out this sword..."

1041
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,490
It's the sword in the stone.

1042
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:57,952
The sword in the stone? It can't be.

1043
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,286
But look, it is.

1044
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,832
- It's the marvelous sword.
- Hold everything.

1045
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,669
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone!

1046
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,672
Where did you get it, Wart?

1047
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,050
I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone

1048
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,677
in, in a churchyard.

1049
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,725
The lad's a young Samson.

1050
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,644
You're making a fool of us, boy.

1051
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,772
<i>Now, tell the truth.
- But I did, sir.</i>

1052
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,109
Then come on. Prove it.
To the stone with you.

1053
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,737
Yes, prove it.

1054
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,031
Come on! Prove it!

1055
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:45,374
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.

1056
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,214
Now, wait a minute.

1057
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:55,885
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.

1058
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:01,057
Go to it, Kay. Give it all you've got.

1059
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,101
Put your back into it.

1060
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:07,021
- Get out.
- Push him aside.

1061
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,735
- Hold on. That's not fair.
- I say we let the boy try it.

1062
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:16,072
<i>That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.</i>

1063
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,907
Go ahead, son.

1064
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:34,632
It's a miracle, ordained by heaven.

1065
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,093
This boy is our King.

1066
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,970
Well, by Jove.

1067
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,932
- What's the lad's name?
- Wart.

1068
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,267
I mean, Arthur.

1069
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,228
Hail, King Arthur!

1070
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,107
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the King!

1071
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,610
I can't believe it.

1072
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,822
Forgive me, son.

1073
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,742
- Forgive me.
- Please don't, sir.

1074
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,745
Kay, bow down to your king.

1075
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,463
So, at last,
the miracle had come to pass

1076
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:17,633
in that far-off time
upon New Year's Day.

1077
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,054
And the glorious reign
of King Arthur was begun.

1078
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,476
I can't be a king, Archimedes.

1079
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,146
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.

1080
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:34,108
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

1081
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,153
I'll run away, that's what I'll do.

1082
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,701
- They'll have to get somebody else.
- Better take the side door.

1083
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,536
Out the side door.

1084
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:52,835
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the king!

1085
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,382
There's another door over there.
Over there, come on. Come on.

1086
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,138
Long live King Arthur!

1087
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,015
Long live...

1088
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,685
Looks like we're surrounded, boy.

1089
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,105
<i>Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.</i>

1090
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,611
Merlin! Merlin!

1091
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,326
Merlin, you're back from Ber... Ber...

1092
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,661
Bermuda? Yes.

1093
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,290
Back from Bermuda
and the 20th century.

1094
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,669
And believe me, you can have it.

1095
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,547
One big modern mess.

1096
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,591
Alakazam.

1097
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:45,304
- I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king.
- He pulled the sword from the stone.

1098
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,891
Of course, of course.

1099
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:52,937
King Arthur
and his Knights of the Round Table.

1100
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:56,857
-"Round Table"?
- Would you rather have a square one?

1101
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,151
Oh, no. Round will be fine.

1102
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,905
Boy, boy, boy.

1103
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,115
You'll become a great legend.

1104
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:09,411
They'll be writing books about you
for centuries to come.

1105
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:12,248
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

1106
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,251
Motion picture?

1107
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:20,214
Well, that's something like television.

1108
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,300
Without commercials.

1109
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:29,848
Hail, King Arthur
Long live the king
