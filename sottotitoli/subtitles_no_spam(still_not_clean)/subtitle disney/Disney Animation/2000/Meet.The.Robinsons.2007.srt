1
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,663
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

2
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:26,416
so I choosed another scary one

3
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:31,629
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

4
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:33,464
I wasn't scary at all.

5
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,602
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

6
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,687
I don't really care about winning.

7
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:53,275
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

8
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,319
I've gotten tired of it.

9
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,948
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

10
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:01,492
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

11
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:05,704
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

12
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,456
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

13
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:09,917
Not the lazy game.

14
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,634
They're here.

15
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,599
Lewis?

16
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,852
Lewis?

17
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,447
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

18
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,157
They are gonna love this!

19
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:46,160
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

20
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:47,411
Lewis!

21
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,663
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

22
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:51,581
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,792
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

24
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,086
Smile. Let's fix your...

25
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,130
Mildred.

26
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:01,591
All right, all right, all right, all right.

27
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,593
Go show them how special you are.

28
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,637
Oh, I hope this is it.

29
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,473
I hope he gets adopted.

30
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,224
You and me both, chief.

31
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,687
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

32
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,148
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

33
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:18,816
The possibilities are endless.

34
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:21,027
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

35
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,988
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

36
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,491
and we can make the world
a better place.

37
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,911
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

38
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,038
So, what's your favourite sport?

39
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:34,665
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

40
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,876
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

41
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,420
- What is that?
- First, a question.

42
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,839
What's the number one problem
that you face

43
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:43,674
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

44
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,092
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

45
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,136
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

46
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,345
takes forever to chew.

47
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,225
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

48
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,978
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

49
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,437
is within mankind's grasp,

50
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:59,856
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

51
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:02,192
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

52
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:03,401
Honey, it's okay.

53
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,361
As you can see, toasting is an option.

54
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,655
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

55
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,658
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

56
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,534
It's jammed!

57
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,164
Lewis, please, don't!

58
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,257
What's happening?

59
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:29,218
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

60
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,053
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,722
Here let me help you get that off!

62
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,598
Stand back!

63
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,395
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

64
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,482
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

65
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,233
It was really nice to meet you.

66
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:47,152
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

67
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,446
Hi, folks. Everything all...

68
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,656
What happened?

69
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:53,241
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

70
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,784
Now, if you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,872
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

72
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,216
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

73
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:13,719
Poor Mr Harrington.

74
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:17,390
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

75
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,475
I called. He's perfectly fine.

76
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,936
I was just gonna say that it's...

77
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,730
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

78
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:27,399
from that wonderful invention of yours.

79
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,609
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

80
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,238
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

81
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,282
One hundred twenty-four.

82
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:35,867
What?

83
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,495
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

84
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,705
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

85
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,082
You're exaggerating just to make your

86
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,834
point.

87
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,961
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

88
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,590
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

89
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:55,260
I have no future. No one wants me.

90
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:56,427
That's not true, Lewis!

91
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,222
My own mother didn't even want me.

92
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,724
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

93
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,225
Then why'd she give me up?

94
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,019
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

95
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:05,645
Did you ever think of that?

96
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:10,566
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

97
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:12,693
I never thought of it that way.

98
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:16,113
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

99
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:18,991
You're right.

100
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:22,787
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

101
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,664
Wait. I said "maybe."

102
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,583
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

103
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,168
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:32,671
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

105
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,172
and we'll be a family again!

106
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:38,092
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

107
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,970
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

108
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:44,850
Wrong. I saw her

109
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,059
once.

110
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,814
She's in here. I just have to remember.

111
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:54,902
That's it!

112
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,739
Hello

113
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,700
I got something to tell you

114
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:06,287
But it's crazy

115
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:09,874
I got something to show you

116
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,419
So give me just one more chance

117
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:17,673
One more glance
And I will make of you

118
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,302
Another believer

119
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:26,515
Guess what?
You got more than you bargained

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,684
Ain't it crazy?

121
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,438
You got more than you paid for

122
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,858
So give me just one more chance

123
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,569
One more glance

124
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:44,657
One more hand to hold

125
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:51,664
You've been on my mind

126
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,293
Though it may seem I'm fooling

127
00:08:55,418 --> 00:09:01,966
Wasted so much time

128
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:06,680
Though it may seem I'm fooling

129
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,182
What are we gonna do?

130
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:12,018
What are we gonna do?

131
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:16,022
What are we gonna do about it?

132
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:22,819
You've been on my mind

133
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:26,364
One more chance

134
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,704
Wasted so much time

135
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:36,166
One more chance

136
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,461
So tired.

137
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,841
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

138
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,259
Bye-bye, now.

139
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,970
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

140
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,139
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

141
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,308
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

142
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,519
I just hope I can stay awake.

143
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,521
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

144
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:02,399
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

145
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:04,234
but that's what happens

146
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,614
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

147
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:15,913
Ah, that's good joe.

148
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:20,293
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

149
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,421
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

150
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:26,632
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

151
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,426
Now the neural circuits will connect.

152
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,428
I've cracked the hippocampus!

153
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:33,430
Really? Okay. What?

154
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,348
Now to test it out.

155
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:40,186
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

156
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,395
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

157
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,189
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

158
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:44,690
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

159
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,110
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

160
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,112
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

161
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:51,114
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

162
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,242
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

163
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:58,162
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

164
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,581
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

165
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:04,418
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

166
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,461
I am, and this is it.

167
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,796
This is my future.

168
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,381
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:12,885
Lewis? Honey?

170
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,976
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

171
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,185
at Inventco Labs,

172
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,270
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

173
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,314
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

174
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,482
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

175
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,651
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

176
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,194
Oh, wait! I said that already.

177
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:33,113
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

178
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,240
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

179
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,326
I haven't slept in eight days!

180
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,162
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

181
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:43,290
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

182
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:46,042
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

183
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,586
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

184
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:50,796
Sorry. Who's this?

185
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:53,549
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

186
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,301
Oh, so cute!

187
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,803
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

188
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,225
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

189
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,894
It's actually a toga, sir.

190
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:08,480
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

191
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,066
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

192
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:14,194
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

193
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,570
It's my gym.

194
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,156
Stanley. Volcano.

195
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:23,786
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

196
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,960
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

197
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,170
Dr Krunklehorn?

198
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:33,297
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

199
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:37,384
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

200
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,219
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

201
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:40,845
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

202
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,680
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

203
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:55,193
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

204
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,486
That's right.

205
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,070
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

206
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,031
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

207
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,408
Only my enemies.

208
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,786
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

209
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,663
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

210
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,304
This area's not secure. Get in.

211
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,057
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

212
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,393
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

213
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,020
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

214
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,189
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

215
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,483
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

216
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,651
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

217
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,902
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

218
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:43,448
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

219
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,658
No, why?

220
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,160
I could lose my badge for this.

221
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,995
He's a suspect in a robbery.

222
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,205
What did he steal?

223
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,623
- A time machine.
- A what?

224
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,876
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

225
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,669
Me? Why me?

226
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,754
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

227
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,839
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

228
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,299
I know what HQ means.

229
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,967
Good. You're a smart kid.

230
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,136
That might keep you alive, for now.

231
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,804
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

232
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,057
and leave the "perp" to me.

233
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,935
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

234
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,062
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

235
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,775
Bowler Hat Guy!

236
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,738
My frogs!

237
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,114
You're not gonna get away with it,

238
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,910
kid with science project.

239
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,663
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

240
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,458
My frogs! They're getting away!

241
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,991
Got you! That's the last of them.

242
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:13,452
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

243
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:14,661
I'm on a very important...

244
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,997
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

245
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:21,167
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

246
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,418
Coach...

247
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:23,669
Next up is Lewis.

248
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,964
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

249
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,466
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

250
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,179
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

251
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,223
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

252
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:39,685
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

253
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,024
Okay, stand back, everybody.

254
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,818
This next project
will knock your socks off.

255
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:51,655
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

256
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,908
Have you ever forgotten something,

257
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:58,537
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,582
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

259
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:06,170
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

260
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:08,880
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

261
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,925
I call it the Memory Scanner.

262
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,177
It's shiny!

263
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,972
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

264
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:20,475
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

265
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,938
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

266
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,523
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

267
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,567
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

268
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:33,279
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

269
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,281
Why that particular day?

270
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,366
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

271
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:41,162
Well, that was the day...

272
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:45,291
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

273
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,959
Fair enough. Play ball.

274
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,629
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

275
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,815
Lewis, wait!

276
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,620
She's gonna blow!

277
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,747
Watch out!

278
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,837
Feel the pain! Love the...

279
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,006
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

280
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,179
Make it stop!

281
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,639
Coach, suck it up, okay?

282
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:47,184
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

283
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,102
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

284
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,812
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

285
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,565
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,191
Not now.

287
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,363
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

288
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:00,572
toward the exits.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,619
Wait, Lewis!

290
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:28,098
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

291
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:52,014
Hey, what are you doing up here?

292
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:09,739
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

293
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,283
You're blowing my cover.

294
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:13,993
We're the only ones up here.

295
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:16,078
That's just what they want you to think.

296
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,788
Now, enough moping.

297
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,833
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

298
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,834
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

299
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,002
Maybe you've forgotten.

300
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:26,671
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

301
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,924
That's no badge.

302
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,344
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

303
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:34,513
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

304
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:36,598
but I really am from the future,

305
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:38,683
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

306
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,018
Here we go again.

307
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,061
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

308
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,271
and ruined your project.

309
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:45,690
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

310
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:48,317
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

311
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:50,027
and you're not from the future!

312
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:51,195
You're crazy!

313
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,113
I am not crazy.

314
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,576
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

315
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,037
Yeah, that's what I thought.

316
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:01,998
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

317
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,042
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

318
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,503
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

319
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,839
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

320
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,882
Hey, let go of me!

321
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,051
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

322
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,448
What is this? Where are we going?

323
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:38,908
To the future!

324
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,555
The future has arrived

325
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:05,309
The future has arrived today

326
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,770
The future has arrived

327
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:11,650
The future has arrived today

328
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,064
Is this proof enough for you?

329
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,774
Is it ever!

330
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:58,902
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

331
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,447
and here it is, right in front of me!

332
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:03,324
The truth will set you free, brother.

333
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,327
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

334
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,329
This means
I could really change my life.

335
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,831
That's right. You can.

336
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,291
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

337
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,169
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

338
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:19,840
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

339
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,675
Why should I fix my dumb invention

340
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,220
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

341
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:31,018
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

342
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,979
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

343
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:36,440
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

344
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,691
What are you doing?

345
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:38,984
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

346
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,944
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

347
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:42,862
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

348
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,864
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

349
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,159
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

350
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,660
That makes me older.

351
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:50,869
Well, I was born in the past,

352
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,039
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

353
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:13,057
I am so dead.

354
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,354
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

355
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,855
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

356
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:21,733
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

357
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,526
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

358
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:24,694
- or something?
- No!

359
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:26,904
There's only two time machines
in existence,

360
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,823
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

361
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,410
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

362
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:34,579
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

363
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:37,123
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

364
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,792
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

365
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:43,088
All right, under one condition.

366
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:46,174
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

367
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,219
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

368
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,428
How can I trust you?

369
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:53,264
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

370
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,099
How can I trust you?

371
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:56,934
Touché.

372
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,604
So do we have a deal?

373
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:33,761
Good day, madam.

374
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:37,348
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

375
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:41,311
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

376
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:44,689
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

377
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:46,482
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

378
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,818
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

379
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,987
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

380
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,990
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

381
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,784
What time is your appointment?

382
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:02,248
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

383
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,999
You're the 2:00?

384
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,168
Yes. Yes, I am.

385
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,045
You're Mary Johnson?

386
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:10,505
Yes.

387
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:13,258
Mary is short for...

388
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:15,343
Marian?

389
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:18,346
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

390
00:26:18,763 --> 00:26:20,973
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

391
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:22,475
Oh, goody!

392
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:37,198
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

393
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:38,949
The board is ready to see you now.

394
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:42,411
Wait. What am I going to say?

395
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:45,413
I'm never gonna remember that.

396
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:48,918
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

397
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:51,253
That's true.

398
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:54,048
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

399
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:55,258
as its own.

400
00:26:56,634 --> 00:27:00,638
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

401
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:10,397
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

402
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,401
Prepare to be amazed!

403
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:19,572
"This is my invention."

404
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:23,743
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

405
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:24,911
Very well,

406
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,246
Miss Johnson?

407
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,290
It's Ms.

408
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:32,001
You have two minutes. Please begin.

409
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:39,008
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

410
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:43,678
Well, I like to call it my...

411
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,681
To call it my...

412
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:49,977
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

413
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,895
Well, then let me close the blinds.

414
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,610
Now, the name?

415
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:01,696
Well, what...

416
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,489
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

417
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:06,369
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

418
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,830
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

419
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,834
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

420
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,216
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

421
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,134
Yes, thank you.

422
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,887
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

423
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,431
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

424
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:30,183
Oh, nothing of consequence.

425
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:35,063
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

426
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,691
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

427
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:40,526
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

428
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:42,820
Thirty seconds.

429
00:28:47,657 --> 00:28:49,201
Allow me to show you how it works.

430
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,369
First, we turn it on.

431
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:56,333
That's not it.

432
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,294
Ten seconds.

433
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,399
So where do I sign?

434
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,705
Doris, it's all over.

435
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:35,791
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

436
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,628
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

437
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,588
You're right.

438
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,466
Success is still ours for the taking.

439
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:49,805
We must find that boy.

440
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:57,311
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

441
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,479
What about your parents?

442
00:29:58,604 --> 00:29:59,730
Mom never goes in there,

443
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,941
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

444
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,108
You've got till then to fix it.

445
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,403
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

446
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,864
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

447
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,828
Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?

448
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,997
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

449
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:20,292
None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.

450
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,836
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

451
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:26,256
Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.

452
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,508
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

453
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:29,968
You...

454
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:32,763
Good point.

455
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,851
Welcome back, little buddy.

456
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:39,520
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

457
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,189
Did you find it? Apparently not,

458
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:44,941
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

459
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,610
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

460
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,279
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

461
00:30:49,404 --> 00:30:51,447
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

462
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,699
Hi, I'm Lewis.

463
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,206
Well, that was unexpected.

464
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,376
As was that.

465
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,003
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

466
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,214
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

467
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,383
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

468
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:13,719
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

469
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,554
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

470
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,389
That is an excellent question.

471
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:18,974
Wait! Where are you going?

472
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,558
Another excellent question.

473
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:24,020
But I don't just want to sit here.

474
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,563
Stay.

475
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:26,898
But...

476
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:43,832
Wow!

477
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:51,255
Hey, ring my doorbell.

478
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,758
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

479
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:54,968
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

480
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,097
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

481
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:00,681
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

482
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:01,933
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

483
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:03,517
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

484
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:04,685
Evergreen.

485
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:12,192
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

486
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:16,029
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

487
00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:19,825
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

488
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,828
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

489
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:24,621
That and someone took my bike.

490
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:27,457
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

491
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:30,335
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

492
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,378
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

493
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:33,963
Then he fixes the time machine.

494
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,840
Why is it an acorn?

495
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:37,675
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

496
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,802
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

497
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:41,512
His confidence in inventing is restored.

498
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:44,098
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

499
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,142
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

500
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,019
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

501
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:49,979
I just told him that to buy some time.

502
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:53,441
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

503
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,318
Trust me. I got it under control.

504
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,528
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

505
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,532
But on the slight chance that I do...

506
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:04,827
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

507
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:09,832
What is it?

508
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:11,667
Well, it's not...

509
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:16,880
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

510
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:21,843
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

511
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:25,346
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

512
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,848
I won't exist?

513
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:28,474
And where does that leave me?

514
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,893
Alone, rusting in a corner.

515
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,857
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

516
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:42,947
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

517
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:44,365
and get some quiet time.

518
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:48,911
What's...

519
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,288
Well, hey, there, little fella!

520
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:55,125
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

521
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,793
My head is!

522
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:01,090
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

523
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,717
They didn't laugh, either.

524
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,887
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

525
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,055
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

526
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,267
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

527
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:13,018
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

528
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:16,730
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

529
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,982
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

530
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:20,191
Wilbur left me down there,

531
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:21,609
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

532
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:22,777
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

533
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,780
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

534
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:26,448
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

535
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:28,200
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

536
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,784
and lookie there!

537
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,952
Hope he ain't got rabies.

538
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:33,246
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

539
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,250
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

540
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,335
Welcome to the garage.

541
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:41,504
Well, I'm completely lost.

542
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,713
Hiya, Grandpa.

543
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:43,922
Hey, Aunt Billie.

544
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,591
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

545
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,968
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

546
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:50,429
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

547
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,433
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

548
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:57,769
That's a toy train?

549
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,858
On your mark, get set, go?

550
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,906
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

551
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:13,534
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

552
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:15,954
Lewis?

553
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:19,083
- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.

554
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,250
Keep those tummies tucked.

555
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,462
This isn't the garage.

556
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:24,629
I know.

557
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,132
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

558
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,926
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

559
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,595
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

560
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,639
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

561
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:37,057
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

562
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:40,562
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

563
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:43,356
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

564
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:44,816
Lewis?

565
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:47,943
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

566
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:49,778
Oh, yeah!

567
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:00,455
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

568
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,874
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

569
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:06,336
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

570
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:08,422
What is all the yelling out here?

571
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:09,714
- He started it!
- She started it!

572
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,174
I don't want to hear any more!

573
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,761
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

574
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,180
I'm going for a drive!

575
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,394
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

576
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,312
Lewis!

577
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:28,106
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

578
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,820
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

579
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:33,280
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

580
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:36,491
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

581
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,327
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

582
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:42,872
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

583
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:45,875
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

584
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,460
Nice to meet you.

585
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:50,879
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

586
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,382
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

587
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:56,594
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

588
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,387
I think you'll like her.

589
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,975
Hey, guys!

590
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:08,521
You ask me over
And over and over

591
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:11,733
Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?

592
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,025
Frogs?

593
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,652
Taught them everything they know.

594
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:17,738
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

595
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:21,408
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

596
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:25,872
Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that

597
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:28,082
Even though you've him, her, me

598
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,793
And an army searching

599
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:36,506
I've got a feeling
You will be reeling

600
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:40,219
When you are bad
And the circus comes to town

601
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,054
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

602
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,972
And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician

603
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:45,224
Or something like that

604
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,604
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

605
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:51,147
Ring-a-ding-ding.

606
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,153
All right!

607
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,406
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

608
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,950
but, wow, look at the time.

609
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,454
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

610
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,706
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

611
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,335
You met my family?

612
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:17,338
Pop quiz.

613
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,923
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

614
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,050
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

615
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,552
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

616
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:24,887
Cranky? Yes.

617
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,430
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.

618
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,515
Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.

619
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,766
Spike and Dimitri are twins,

620
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,685
and I don't know who they're related to.

621
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,894
Neither do we. Go on.

622
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,439
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

623
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,067
What does Cornelius look like?

624
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,486
Tom Selleck.

625
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,699
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

626
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,033
You're forgetting something.

627
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,368
Forgetting? Oh, right.

628
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,954
Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.

629
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,706
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

630
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:53,874
Nope.

631
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,500
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,045
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

633
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,269
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

634
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,818
I've got you now.

635
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,361
Lewis!

636
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,076
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

637
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,579
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

638
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,249
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

639
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:40,085
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

640
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,129
Nice to see that they're branching out.

641
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:45,798
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

642
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,009
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

643
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:51,095
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

644
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,349
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

645
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,769
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

646
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,814
Game didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:06,444
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

648
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:08,363
Then I got beat up.

649
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:12,700
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

650
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,869
I don't know. He's probably right.

651
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,120
No!

652
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:19,249
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

653
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:23,419
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

654
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:25,379
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

655
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,131
Let them fuel your actions.

656
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,300
Let hate be your ally,

657
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:33,137
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

658
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:39,476
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

659
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:43,980
What?

660
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,322
Where is that boy?

661
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:57,702
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

662
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:05,000
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

663
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,377
Now, what did you find?

664
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:11,215
Yes. Yes, I see.

665
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,468
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

666
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:17,931
That plus my stick must mean...

667
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:31,193
To the future! Shotgun!

668
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:40,536
I don't even know what I'm doing.

669
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:41,703
Keep moving forward.

670
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:43,872
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

671
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:45,081
Keep moving forward.

672
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:47,292
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,543
Keep moving forward.

674
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,169
Why do you keep saying that?

675
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:52,255
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

676
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,714
It's my dad's motto.

677
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,800
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

678
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:57,259
It's what he does.

679
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,053
What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:01,055
That is an excellent question.

681
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:02,557
Robinson Industries,

682
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:05,393
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

683
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,312
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

684
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:12,607
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

685
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:14,443
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

686
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,445
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

687
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,322
Your dad invented the time machine?

688
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,907
Yep. Five years ago,

689
00:42:21,032 --> 00:42:23,201
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

690
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:26,246
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

691
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:28,791
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

692
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,585
We're talking prototypes.

693
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,086
That's a prototype?

694
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:35,422
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

695
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:37,758
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

696
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,760
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

697
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:41,136
Number six, 58,

698
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:42,679
212, 485,

699
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:43,930
952,

700
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:46,307
and they all end the same way.

701
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:51,271
But he doesn't give up.

702
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:55,025
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

703
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,403
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

704
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:00,113
the first working time machine.

705
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:03,574
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

706
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:04,784
the second working time machine.

707
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,118
Kind of small.

708
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:08,370
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

709
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:09,955
This, my friend, is merely a model

710
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,999
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

711
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:16,712
is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.

712
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:25,971
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

713
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:28,556
Now, are you ready to start working?

714
00:43:42,488 --> 00:43:45,115
I think that's it. I did it!

715
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,658
I knew you could.

716
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:52,330
Nice work, my friend.

717
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,385
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

718
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,054
Don't say it!

719
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,936
Boys! Dinner time!

720
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:17,229
Not now, Mom!

721
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,982
If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!

722
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,944
We'd better get up there.

723
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:31,033
Let's get that boy!

724
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,161
Sit here?

725
00:44:33,286 --> 00:44:34,955
But I want to look, too.

726
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:38,833
A mini-Doris!

727
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:42,169
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

728
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:45,131
Let's take her out for a spin.

729
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:48,008
Sorry.

730
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:50,636
Teamwork.

731
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:54,849
Sorry.

732
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:57,560
Sorry!

733
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:04,567
There you are.

734
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,320
Now, to lure him out of the house.

735
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:13,784
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

736
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:17,078
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

737
00:45:17,954 --> 00:45:19,080
Oh! I know!

738
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:23,084
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

739
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,338
I don't know how to do that.

740
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:29,257
I don't really need a duck.

741
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:33,803
This may be harder than I thought.

742
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,516
Hey, ring my doorbell.

743
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:40,434
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

744
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,311
That doorbell will give you a rash.

745
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:45,355
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

746
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,065
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

747
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,360
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

748
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:51,278
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

749
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:54,865
I don't believe in fretting or grieving

750
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,075
Why mess around with strife?

751
00:45:57,826 --> 00:46:01,037
Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out

752
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:02,455
Give me the simple life

753
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:06,502
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

754
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:09,171
Dinner is served.

755
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:10,339
Dinner is served.

756
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:14,885
Hooray! Italian food.

757
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:16,429
I want a sloppy joe!

758
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,806
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

759
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,140
Coming to you, big girl.

760
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:23,977
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

761
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:25,979
on the black moon of Keward.

762
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,815
Where's my sloppy joe?

763
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,358
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

764
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,735
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

765
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,613
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

766
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:39,492
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

767
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:40,702
Temporary setback.

768
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:42,620
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

769
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:43,830
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

770
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:45,331
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

771
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:46,499
- Shiatsu?
- No.

772
00:46:46,624 --> 00:46:47,750
- Feng shui.
- No.

773
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,168
I've got it under control.

774
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:52,796
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

775
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:54,006
- No.
- Yes.

776
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:55,215
- Yes.
- No.

777
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:56,716
Well, yes and no.

778
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:59,636
Lewis is a new transfer student.

779
00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:01,012
Yeah.

780
00:47:01,137 --> 00:47:03,639
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

781
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:07,269
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

782
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:10,105
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

783
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:12,690
- It's a big country.
- State.

784
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:15,569
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

785
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:16,987
Oh, good idea.

786
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:19,614
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

787
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,076
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

788
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,702
Oh, nonsense.

789
00:47:24,828 --> 00:47:27,747
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

790
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:29,207
Let's see the cowlick!

791
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:30,751
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

792
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:32,085
Lewis, do you mind?

793
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,546
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

794
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:36,089
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

795
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:37,298
Now, don't be shy.

796
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:39,926
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

797
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:47,725
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

798
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:52,729
Impressive, little sister.

799
00:47:52,854 --> 00:47:55,524
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

800
00:47:55,649 --> 00:47:57,943
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

801
00:47:58,068 --> 00:48:01,613
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

802
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,125
Your meatballs are useless against me.

803
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,836
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

804
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,129
No!

805
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:31,101
That's right. I did it.

806
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:32,811
Is dinner like this every night?

807
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:34,729
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

808
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,653
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

809
00:48:42,778 --> 00:48:47,116
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

810
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:50,244
Hey, that's just like...

811
00:48:54,248 --> 00:48:55,582
Stupid...

812
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,875
Carl?

813
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,043
Is everything all right?

814
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,755
We're just experiencing bugs.

815
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:05,175
Just what the doctor ordered.

816
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:08,177
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

817
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:09,845
Wilbur, you know I can't.

818
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,723
Come on. Give it a try.

819
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,476
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

820
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:17,228
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

821
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:20,231
We're past the point of no return!

822
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:22,525
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

823
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,360
We all pay!

824
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,028
I don't know.

825
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:28,197
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

826
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:29,489
Please.

827
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:35,912
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

828
00:49:36,037 --> 00:49:39,292
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

829
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,170
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

830
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:44,130
All right, you bozos.

831
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:47,049
Have to get that boy out of the house.

832
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:49,969
Sorry. Wait!

833
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:52,346
So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?

834
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:55,724
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

835
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:58,560
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

836
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:01,146
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

837
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:04,733
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

838
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:06,401
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

839
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,079
That's a good buzz. What the...

840
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:21,790
Yes! You are now under my control.

841
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,001
I am now under your control.

842
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:28,589
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

843
00:50:28,714 --> 00:50:31,634
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

844
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:33,594
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

845
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:36,597
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

846
00:50:38,098 --> 00:50:39,182
No.

847
00:50:39,307 --> 00:50:41,518
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

848
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:46,356
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

849
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:48,483
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

850
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:50,818
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

851
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:54,615
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

852
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,575
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

853
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,369
Bring him to me.

854
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:04,040
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

855
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:08,378
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

856
00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:10,672
and I have little arms.

857
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:14,634
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

858
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:19,431
Master?

859
00:51:21,391 --> 00:51:22,475
Master?

860
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:26,062
Okay, that should do it.

861
00:51:26,437 --> 00:51:28,981
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

862
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:31,859
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

863
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:33,277
Everybody ready?

864
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:35,153
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

865
00:51:38,615 --> 00:51:39,741
Is it gonna work?

866
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:41,117
Oh, no!

867
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:46,623
No!

868
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:50,168
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

869
00:51:50,293 --> 00:51:52,754
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

870
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:55,131
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

871
00:51:56,132 --> 00:51:57,133
I've seen better.

872
00:51:57,258 --> 00:52:01,095
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

873
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,972
If I gave up every time I failed,

874
00:52:03,098 --> 00:52:05,016
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

875
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:07,602
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

876
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:11,356
Still working out the kinks.

877
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:13,733
Like my husband always says...

878
00:52:21,324 --> 00:52:22,825
Keep moving
Keep moving

879
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:23,993
Stop

880
00:52:28,914 --> 00:52:32,209
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

881
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:34,712
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

882
00:52:34,837 --> 00:52:36,547
Something that won't talk back.

883
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:38,841
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

884
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:40,425
Oh, my noggin.

885
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,886
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

886
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:45,013
You're gonna regret this!

887
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:50,351
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

888
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,980
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

889
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,398
No, I'll make it a surprise.

890
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:04,699
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

891
00:53:04,824 --> 00:53:08,619
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

892
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:11,288
May it lead to success in the future.

893
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:14,082
Gosh, you're all so nice.

894
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,003
If I had a family, I...

895
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:20,089
I'd want them to be just like you.

896
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,925
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

897
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,636
To Lewis!

898
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:25,762
To Lewis!

899
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,055
Yeah!

900
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,099
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

901
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:33,269
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

902
00:53:33,394 --> 00:53:34,603
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

903
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:37,064
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

904
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:42,819
What did he mean, if he had a family?

905
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:44,320
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

906
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:45,780
Orphan?

907
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,003
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

908
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:03,631
Get up, you pansy!

909
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:05,049
What a great plan!

910
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:09,469
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

911
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:12,764
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

912
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:13,932
Because we don't.

913
00:54:14,057 --> 00:54:16,185
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

914
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:21,106
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

915
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:22,858
I need him alive.

916
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:26,319
Choo-chew on this!

917
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,492
Lewis!

918
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:40,125
Ready, aim, fire!

919
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:50,302
Got you!

920
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:54,972
You messed with the wrong family!

921
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:04,398
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

922
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:10,488
No!

923
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:15,576
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

924
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:19,579
Run!

925
00:55:21,706 --> 00:55:23,333
Oh! He ate Carl!

926
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:27,920
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

927
00:55:40,184 --> 00:55:41,185
Oh, no.

928
00:55:47,357 --> 00:55:48,608
Incoming!

929
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:51,027
Run!

930
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:55,031
Now, go get that boy!

931
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:14,132
What's going on?

932
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:15,342
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

933
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:16,676
I have a big head...

934
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,511
...and little arms.

935
00:56:18,637 --> 00:56:20,096
I'm just not sure...

936
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:22,057
...how well this plan was
thought through.

937
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:26,019
Master?

938
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:29,356
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

939
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:34,569
Bowler Hat Guy!

940
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:36,070
Him you can eat.

941
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:38,572
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

942
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,842
No!

943
00:57:19,363 --> 00:57:20,739
Oh, no!

944
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:25,118
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

945
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:32,458
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

946
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,126
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

947
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,920
Yeah, guess we did.

948
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:38,757
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

949
00:57:38,882 --> 00:57:40,633
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

950
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:43,094
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

951
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:47,723
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

952
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:49,433
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

953
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,396
I'm really happy you're safe.

954
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,356
- Your head.
- What?

955
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:58,942
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

956
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:03,740
You all sacrificed so much for me.

957
00:58:03,865 --> 00:58:06,826
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

958
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:08,161
One of a kind.

959
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,539
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

960
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:14,833
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

961
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:17,502
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

962
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,504
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

963
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,549
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

964
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:28,137
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

965
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:31,725
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

966
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,727
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

967
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:37,814
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

968
00:58:37,939 --> 00:58:40,983
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

969
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:43,611
- We really have to go.
- No.

970
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:47,573
No, you don't. You have to stay.

971
00:58:48,323 --> 00:58:51,868
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

972
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:54,246
What do you say, Lewis?

973
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,790
Do you want to be a Robinson?

974
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:02,421
You want to adopt me?

975
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,889
- Yeah!
- Yes!

976
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:25,360
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

977
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:26,653
Now you know the big secret.

978
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:30,907
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

979
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:32,909
That is an excellent question.

980
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:34,535
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

981
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,037
He was just being a good friend.

982
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:40,291
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

983
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:41,834
What? You just said...

984
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:43,836
I know what I said.

985
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:45,922
I'm from the past. So what?

986
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:49,592
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

987
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:51,844
You're a great kid,

988
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:54,888
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

989
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:59,851
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

990
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:06,107
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

991
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:09,777
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

992
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,864
which kind of explains the dino.

993
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,454
I'm calling your father.

994
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:21,122
Wait. If I have to leave,

995
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:23,457
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

996
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:25,292
Wilbur promised.

997
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:26,628
You promised what?

998
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,588
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

999
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:31,632
- You lied to me?
- No!

1000
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,010
Yes.

1001
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:35,679
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1002
01:00:35,804 --> 01:00:39,307
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1003
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:41,309
I am your friend!

1004
01:00:41,434 --> 01:00:44,979
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1005
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,836
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.

1006
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:15,049
All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,

1007
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:20,513
but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.

1008
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:24,475
Too bad
we don't have a time machine.

1009
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,062
Oh, wait. We do.

1010
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:29,981
Bowler Hat Guy?

1011
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:33,150
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1012
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:35,944
To make your dream come true.

1013
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:39,198
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1014
01:01:39,323 --> 01:01:41,826
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1015
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,786
Lewis!

1016
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:47,164
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1017
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:48,999
I know you're around here somewhere.

1018
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:52,837
Lewis!

1019
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,484
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1020
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:19,904
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1021
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:22,115
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1022
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,950
It doesn't work. Never did.

1023
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:25,117
Well, supposing it did,

1024
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,078
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1025
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:30,247
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1026
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,040
where might one find the "On" switch?

1027
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,209
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1028
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,503
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1029
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,254
then push this red button,

1030
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,714
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1031
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,174
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1032
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,343
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1033
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,845
Yes, of course.

1034
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,179
Doris?

1035
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,058
We had a deal!

1036
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,061
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1037
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,730
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1038
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,815
You still haven't figured it out?

1039
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,275
Figured out what?

1040
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,402
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1041
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,904
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1042
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,531
"Keep moving forward"?

1043
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,116
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1044
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,456
Are you saying

1045
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:16,000
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1046
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,753
Give the boy a prize.

1047
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,840
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1048
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,592
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1049
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,761
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1050
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:30,097
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1051
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:31,264
Keep going.

1052
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:33,601
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,394
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1054
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,188
But what does that have to do
with you?

1055
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:42,192
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1056
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:46,529
My old room!

1057
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:49,032
I think you mean our old room.

1058
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:52,201
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1059
01:03:52,326 --> 01:03:53,619
Mike Yagoobian!

1060
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:57,957
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1061
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,501
How did you end up like this?

1062
01:03:59,626 --> 01:04:04,423
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1063
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:07,175
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1064
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:14,057
a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.

1065
01:04:14,474 --> 01:04:17,351
We lost by one run because of me.

1066
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:18,561
Get him!

1067
01:04:18,686 --> 01:04:22,731
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1068
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:24,901
And we would have won!

1069
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:26,569
Do you understand?

1070
01:04:26,694 --> 01:04:29,322
For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.

1071
01:04:29,447 --> 01:04:32,575
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.

1072
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,411
This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.

1073
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:38,121
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1074
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:40,207
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1075
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:42,250
They all hated me.

1076
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:45,920
Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,

1077
01:04:46,045 --> 01:04:47,672
except me.

1078
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:49,716
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.

1079
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:51,051
- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,

1080
01:04:51,176 --> 01:04:53,178
- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!

1081
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:56,389
- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...

1082
01:04:56,514 --> 01:05:01,686
It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.

1083
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:03,187
It was yours.

1084
01:05:03,312 --> 01:05:06,523
If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,

1085
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:08,692
then I wouldn't have missed the catch,

1086
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:12,863
so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.

1087
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:18,370
Robinson, you stink!

1088
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:23,041
Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,

1089
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:25,918
I met her.

1090
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,256
We retreated to our villainous lair,

1091
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:34,509
where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.

1092
01:05:34,634 --> 01:05:38,054
Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,

1093
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:40,391
a slave to humankind,

1094
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:47,564
but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.

1095
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:55,655
However, you didn't see
her true potential.

1096
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,782
- Got it.
- So you shut her down,

1097
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:06,416
or so you thought.

1098
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:18,260
We both had a score
to settle with you,

1099
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:24,056
and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...

1100
01:06:24,057 --> 01:06:26,018
Well, we went with Doris',

1101
01:06:26,143 --> 01:06:30,731
but I made
a very, very important contribution.

1102
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:33,317
Together we made the perfect team.

1103
01:06:43,493 --> 01:06:44,494
Wilbur!

1104
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:47,288
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1105
01:06:47,414 --> 01:06:48,540
Yeah, Mom.

1106
01:06:52,126 --> 01:06:54,628
I went to your house,
snuck in the garage

1107
01:06:54,754 --> 01:06:56,506
and stole the time machine,

1108
01:06:59,509 --> 01:07:04,472
all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.

1109
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:11,854
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1110
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:14,731
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1111
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:17,234
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1112
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,486
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1113
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:22,239
Goob, I had no idea.

1114
01:07:22,364 --> 01:07:24,241
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1115
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:27,035
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1116
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,537
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1117
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,748
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1118
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:35,585
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1119
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,464
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1120
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:40,632
Let's see.

1121
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,635
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1122
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:47,556
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1123
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:54,312
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1124
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:05,698
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1125
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:13,998
No!

1126
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:19,670
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1127
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,507
But...

1128
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,634
I bet you're glad to see me.

1129
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,845
That's for not locking the garage door.

1130
01:08:30,346 --> 01:08:31,514
You know about that?

1131
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:33,015
I know everything.

1132
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,141
You gotta admit,

1133
01:08:34,266 --> 01:08:36,393
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1134
01:08:39,397 --> 01:08:41,858
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1135
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:52,368
Oh, no!

1136
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:55,872
Take a good look around, boys,

1137
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:58,708
because your future
is about to change.

1138
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:02,879
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1139
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:05,089
No. No, I can't.

1140
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,889
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1141
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:16,517
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1142
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,352
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1143
01:09:23,231 --> 01:09:24,524
Look, I messed up.

1144
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:27,736
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1145
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:28,904
but now it's up to you.

1146
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:32,407
You can do it, Dad.

1147
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:38,913
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1148
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:44,126
Wilbur.

1149
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:47,463
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1150
01:10:02,103 --> 01:10:04,230
Prepare to be amazed.

1151
01:10:04,355 --> 01:10:07,066
I call it the Memory Scanner.

1152
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:10,652
So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?

1153
01:10:10,778 --> 01:10:14,156
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.

1154
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:18,786
They're everywhere!

1155
01:10:21,163 --> 01:10:23,707
Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.

1156
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:26,626
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.

1157
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:29,879
No!

1158
01:10:35,635 --> 01:10:39,138
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1159
01:10:39,513 --> 01:10:42,641
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1160
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:45,302
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1161
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,984
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1162
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,952
Goob, stop!

1163
01:13:11,661 --> 01:13:12,745
You don't know what you're doing!

1164
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,955
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1165
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:16,208
She's using you, Goob,

1166
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,501
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1167
01:13:18,626 --> 01:13:20,420
What? What?

1168
01:13:25,758 --> 01:13:28,219
I am never going to invent you.

1169
01:13:34,516 --> 01:13:36,977
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1170
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:47,405
Doris?

1171
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:49,573
I thought she was my friend.

1172
01:14:21,687 --> 01:14:23,689
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1173
01:14:26,483 --> 01:14:27,985
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1174
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,152
Let him go.

1175
01:14:29,528 --> 01:14:32,031
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1176
01:14:32,156 --> 01:14:34,825
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1177
01:14:34,992 --> 01:14:36,744
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1178
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:38,412
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1179
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:40,747
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1180
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:42,290
I'll give you three good reasons.

1181
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:44,834
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1182
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,295
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1183
01:14:47,629 --> 01:14:50,883
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1184
01:14:53,176 --> 01:14:56,346
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1185
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,557
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1186
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,768
Goob!

1187
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:03,979
Goob.

1188
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:32,548
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1189
01:15:32,673 --> 01:15:34,258
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1190
01:15:34,383 --> 01:15:35,843
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1191
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,052
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1192
01:15:37,177 --> 01:15:39,804
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1193
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:43,683
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1194
01:15:43,808 --> 01:15:47,061
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1195
01:15:47,186 --> 01:15:48,939
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1196
01:15:49,064 --> 01:15:52,567
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1197
01:16:06,206 --> 01:16:07,957
Ratted out by the old lady.

1198
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,251
Harsh.

1199
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:16,174
Okay.

1200
01:16:26,684 --> 01:16:29,853
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1201
01:16:29,978 --> 01:16:31,813
Yeah, no kidding.

1202
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,357
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1203
01:16:34,483 --> 01:16:35,859
Yeah.

1204
01:16:38,654 --> 01:16:40,906
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1205
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:56,963
It was our first real invention.

1206
01:16:57,588 --> 01:16:59,381
It's the one that started it all.

1207
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:00,633
Wowie.

1208
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:05,346
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1209
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:08,099
Well, that depends on you.

1210
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:09,225
Nothing is set in stone.

1211
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:13,146
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1212
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:20,486
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1213
01:17:20,611 --> 01:17:24,865
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1214
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:28,660
Do we ever meet her?

1215
01:17:31,873 --> 01:17:33,791
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1216
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,669
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1217
01:17:36,794 --> 01:17:39,004
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1218
01:17:40,047 --> 01:17:43,175
That's because we are one smart kid.

1219
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,180
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1220
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:51,807
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1221
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,726
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1222
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,147
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1223
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,023
Hey, while I got you here,

1224
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:02,568
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1225
01:18:02,693 --> 01:18:07,239
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1226
01:18:07,364 --> 01:18:10,367
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1227
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:12,911
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1228
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:16,539
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1229
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:19,292
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1230
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:20,419
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1231
01:18:20,544 --> 01:18:23,380
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1232
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:26,884
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1233
01:18:27,009 --> 01:18:29,553
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1234
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,181
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1235
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:37,185
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1236
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,230
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1237
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:45,527
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1238
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:47,738
And I am.

1239
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,282
Then you're absolutely right.

1240
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:54,702
All right, I'm coming.

1241
01:18:55,245 --> 01:18:57,121
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1242
01:18:57,246 --> 01:18:59,040
They are your family, after all.

1243
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:29,902
Wait a minute.

1244
01:19:30,028 --> 01:19:32,113
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1245
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:33,406
I know.

1246
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:41,749
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1247
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:44,501
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1248
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:46,503
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1249
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:47,796
What?

1250
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:07,773
A deal's a deal.

1251
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:14,021
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1252
01:22:14,772 --> 01:22:17,941
Because I already have a family.

1253
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:30,745
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1254
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,915
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1255
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:36,751
I won't.

1256
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,837
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1257
01:22:38,962 --> 01:22:40,463
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1258
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:41,756
till you get it right.

1259
01:22:44,008 --> 01:22:45,634
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1260
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,011
Don't forget it.

1261
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:48,929
I don't think that's possible.

1262
01:22:50,389 --> 01:22:51,598
You better get going.

1263
01:22:52,391 --> 01:22:53,934
See you later, Wilbur.

1264
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:13,871
Wait a minute!

1265
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:24,465
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1266
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:25,632
What?

1267
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:29,928
That's it!

1268
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:40,813
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1269
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:43,149
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1270
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:48,070
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1271
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:51,365
I need a volunteer.

1272
01:23:54,702 --> 01:23:56,328
Now, just give me a date to input.

1273
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:57,871
Well, now, let's see.

1274
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:01,124
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1275
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:04,377
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1276
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:06,713
I know.

1277
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:09,090
Perfect!

1278
01:24:21,519 --> 01:24:24,522
- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.

1279
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,401
Oh! It works.

1280
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:30,987
- It works!
- It works.

1281
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:33,823
You look beautiful, Lucille.

1282
01:24:39,078 --> 01:24:40,247
Bud?

1283
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:43,458
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1284
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,376
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1285
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:48,379
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1286
01:24:48,504 --> 01:24:49,880
This invention is brilliant!

1287
01:24:50,005 --> 01:24:51,465
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1288
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,717
That was some show you put on.

1289
01:24:53,842 --> 01:24:57,304
You're a real special kid,

1290
01:25:00,098 --> 01:25:03,309
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1291
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:06,146
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1292
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:09,733
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1293
01:25:09,858 --> 01:25:11,234
No harm done.

1294
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:14,446
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1295
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,906
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1296
01:25:17,031 --> 01:25:21,911
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1297
01:25:22,036 --> 01:25:23,162
Really?

1298
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:26,999
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1299
01:25:27,124 --> 01:25:29,543
But nobody believes me.

1300
01:25:30,378 --> 01:25:32,463
They all think I'm crazy.

1301
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:36,593
You think I'm crazy, too.

1302
01:25:36,718 --> 01:25:39,721
No. No, I think you're right.

1303
01:25:43,224 --> 01:25:45,017
Over here? There he is.

1304
01:25:45,142 --> 01:25:48,354
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1305
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:51,064
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1306
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,443
Let it go

1307
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:56,654
Yeah.

1308
01:25:57,029 --> 01:26:00,032
Let it roll right off your shoulder

1309
01:26:00,157 --> 01:26:01,617
Don't you know

1310
01:26:03,327 --> 01:26:05,829
The hardest part is over

1311
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:07,581
Let it in

1312
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:11,459
Let your clarity define you

1313
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:13,169
In the end

1314
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,632
We will only just remember
How it feels

1315
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:30,436
Let it slide

1316
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,398
Let your troubles fall behind you

1317
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,316
Let it shine

1318
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,986
Until you feel it all around you

1319
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,822
And I don't mind

1320
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:45,783
If it's me you need to turn to

1321
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:48,161
We'll get by

1322
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:53,167
It's the heart that really matters
In the end

1323
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,295
Our lives are made

1324
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:59,131
In these small hours

1325
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,842
These little wonders

1326
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,886
These twists and turns of fate

1327
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:07,514
Time falls away

1328
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,850
But these small hours

1329
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:16,314
These small hours still remain

1330
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,025
All of my regret

1331
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,944
Will wash away somehow

1332
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,739
But I cannot forget

1333
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:28,158
The way I feel right now

1334
01:27:52,307 --> 01:27:54,016
The future has arrived

1335
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:57,353
The future has arrived

1336
01:27:58,562 --> 01:28:00,523
The future has arrived

1337
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,194
The future has arrived

1338
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:20,001
The future's arrived

1339
01:28:20,126 --> 01:28:21,669
Nobody can doubt

1340
01:28:21,794 --> 01:28:24,880
The future is what everything's about

1341
01:28:25,005 --> 01:28:27,800
It's better for you
And it's better for me

1342
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:31,304
It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be

1343
01:28:31,429 --> 01:28:33,389
The future has arrived

1344
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:37,518
The future has arrived today

1345
01:28:38,143 --> 01:28:39,728
The future's alive

1346
01:28:39,853 --> 01:28:41,355
Alive as can be

1347
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,856
Just open your eyes

1348
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:44,607
It's plain to see

1349
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:46,192
Just don't be afraid

1350
01:28:46,317 --> 01:28:48,111
Just keep going on

1351
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:51,030
One step at a time
And you can't go wrong

1352
01:28:51,155 --> 01:28:53,700
It's time to create

1353
01:28:53,825 --> 01:28:55,827
Time to grow

1354
01:28:55,952 --> 01:28:57,454
If you feel right

1355
01:28:57,579 --> 01:29:00,832
The world, yeah
She's changing

1356
01:29:00,957 --> 01:29:03,584
Don't it make you feel alive?

1357
01:29:04,627 --> 01:29:06,253
The future has arrived

1358
01:29:07,713 --> 01:29:10,299
The future has arrived today

1359
01:29:11,216 --> 01:29:12,760
The future's alive

1360
01:29:14,303 --> 01:29:16,972
The future is alive today

1361
01:29:24,564 --> 01:29:27,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1362
01:29:27,733 --> 01:29:30,611
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1363
01:29:30,736 --> 01:29:32,321
The future's arrived

1364
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:33,947
Nobody can doubt

1365
01:29:34,073 --> 01:29:37,409
The future is what everything's about

1366
01:29:37,534 --> 01:29:40,537
It's better for you
It's better for me

1367
01:29:40,662 --> 01:29:43,540
It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be

1368
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:46,376
It's time to create

1369
01:29:46,502 --> 01:29:48,045
Time to grow

1370
01:29:48,337 --> 01:29:50,213
If you feel right

1371
01:29:50,338 --> 01:29:53,466
The world, yeah
She's changing

1372
01:29:53,591 --> 01:29:56,761
And life's rearranging

1373
01:29:56,886 --> 01:29:58,805
Don't it make you feel alive?

1374
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:00,473
The future has arrived

1375
01:30:00,598 --> 01:30:02,141
The future has arrived

1376
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:06,145
The future has arrived today

1377
01:30:06,854 --> 01:30:08,730
The future's alive

1378
01:30:10,233 --> 01:30:12,818
The future is alive today

1379
01:30:13,444 --> 01:30:15,321
The future has arrived

1380
01:30:16,697 --> 01:30:19,533
The future has arrived today

1381
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:21,993
The future's alive

1382
01:30:23,286 --> 01:30:26,290
The future is alive today

1383
01:30:26,874 --> 01:30:28,459
The future has arrived

1384
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,796
The future has arrived today

1385
01:30:33,213 --> 01:30:35,174
The future's alive

1386
01:30:36,509 --> 01:30:39,178
The future is alive today

1387
01:30:40,012 --> 01:30:42,931
The future has arrived today

1388
01:30:43,056 --> 01:30:45,851
The future has arrived today

1389
01:30:46,393 --> 01:30:49,187
The future has arrived today

1390
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:52,523
The future has arrived today

1391
01:30:58,988 --> 01:31:04,202
Waiting to cross the Rubicon

1392
01:31:04,327 --> 01:31:09,040
Wondering what side I'm on

1393
01:31:09,457 --> 01:31:14,253
What are these visions
Of me as a young man

1394
01:31:14,378 --> 01:31:20,383
With one arm pointing
And the other arm holding your hand?

1395
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:25,305
Needing a plan to keep you near

1396
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:30,393
Blowing a horn so you can hear

1397
01:31:30,769 --> 01:31:35,565
If it was only my love and devotion

1398
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:40,237
This world would suddenly be
In a state of

1399
01:31:40,362 --> 01:31:44,741
Commotion

1400
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:49,704
Emotional commotion

1401
01:31:49,829 --> 01:31:54,960
Emotional commotion

1402
01:31:56,127 --> 01:32:00,632
Emotional commotion

1403
01:32:00,757 --> 01:32:03,301
Emotional commotion

1404
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,075
I never get around
Under the sun and the stars

1405
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:35,081
And I may be always frowning

1406
01:32:35,206 --> 01:32:39,460
But one day you will see
Under the sun and the stars

1407
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:45,341
You will turn around
And I'll be

1408
01:32:45,466 --> 01:32:49,596
In motion

1409
01:32:50,388 --> 01:32:54,934
Emotional commotion

1410
01:32:55,059 --> 01:33:00,940
Emotional commotion

1411
01:33:01,315 --> 01:33:05,652
Emotional commotion

1412
01:33:05,778 --> 01:33:11,409
Emotional commotion

1413
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:16,664
Emotional commotion

1414
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:23,378
Emotional motion
