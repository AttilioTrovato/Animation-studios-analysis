1
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,970
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,431
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,852
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,522
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,025
Breakfast.

6
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,194
Wait, maybe I should
have had breakfast.

7
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,990
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,910
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,620
I am lightning!

10
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,040
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,837
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

12
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,384
Get your antenna balls here!

13
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,142
Go, Lightnin'!

14
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,188
You got that right, slick.

15
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,008
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

16
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm Bob Cutlass, here with
my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

17
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,849
<i>We're midway through what may be
an historic day for racing.</i>

18
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,934
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

19
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,563
<i>If this gets more exciting,
they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

20
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:49,814
<i>Right you are, Darrell.</i>

21
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,150
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

22
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,318
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

23
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:59,407
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

24
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,242
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

25
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,786
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

26
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,122
<i>He's been Dinoco's
golden boy for years!</i>

27
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

28
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,003
<i>And, as always, in the second
place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

29
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,755
<i>He's been chasing that tailfin
his entire career.</i>

30
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,799
<i>Chick thought this was his year, Bob.</i>

31
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,677
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

32
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,346
<i>But the last thing he expected was...</i>

33
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,806
<i>...Lightning McQueen!</i>

34
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,517
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

35
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,228
<i>The rookie sensation came
into the season unknown.</i>

36
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:30,813
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

37
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:34,942
<i>Will he be the first rookie to win
a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

38
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,612
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

39
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,573
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

40
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,253
No, you don't.

41
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,850
What a ride!

42
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,437
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

43
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,026
I love you, Lightning!

44
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,028
Dinoco is all mine.

45
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,405
Trouble, turn three!

46
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,117
- Get through that, McQueen.
- A huge crash behind the leaders!

47
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,892
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

48
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,270
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

49
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,063
Not in one piece, that is.

50
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,371
Yeah!

51
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,415
Lightning!

52
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,752
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

53
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,297
Man, a spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

54
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,507
Yeah! Ka-chow!

55
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,844
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

56
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,180
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

57
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:32,018
While everyone else heads into the pits,
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

58
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,104
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

59
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,153
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

60
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,071
- McQueen made it through!
- What?

61
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,448
He's not pitting!

62
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,618
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

63
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,453
McQueen's not going into the pits!

64
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,123
The rookie just fired his crew chief.
That's the third one this season!

65
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,459
- He says he likes working alone.
- Go, go, go!

66
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,794
Looks like Chick got
caught up in the pits.

67
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:02,256
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

68
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,717
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

69
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,737
Come on, come on, come on!

70
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,164
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

71
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,958
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

72
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,169
You need tires, you idiot!

73
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,255
Looks like it's all gas-and-go's
for McQueen today.

74
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,840
That's right. No tires again.

75
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:49,011
That's a short-term gain, long-term loss,
but it's sure workin' for him.

76
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,472
He obviously knows
somethin' we don't know.

77
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,856
This is it, Darrell.

78
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,943
One lap to go and Lightning
McQueen has a huge lead.

79
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,737
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

80
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,115
We're gonna crown us
a new champion!

81
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,498
Checkered flag, here I come!

82
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,875
Oh, no! McQueen has blown a tire!

83
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,712
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

84
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,505
You fool!

85
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,135
McQueen's blown a tire!
McQueen's blown a tire!

86
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,761
Go, go, go!

87
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,647
He's lost another tire!

88
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,942
- King and Chick are coming up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

89
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,902
Come on.

90
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,990
I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

91
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,618
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet
from his Piston Cup!

92
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,960
The King and Chick rounding turn four.

93
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,091
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

94
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,927
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

95
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,387
Lightning!

96
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,682
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

97
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,227
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

98
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,354
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

99
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,287
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

100
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,915
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

101
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,459
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

102
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,502
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

103
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,254
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

104
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,758
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more
to racing than just winning.</i>

105
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,720
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

106
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,722
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

107
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,933
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

108
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,143
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

109
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,645
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

110
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,814
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

111
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,233
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

112
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,317
Get outta the shot.

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,028
Yo, Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

114
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,113
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

115
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,784
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

116
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,913
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

117
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,665
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

118
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:27,294
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

119
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,548
- Adiós, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

120
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,299
Oh, whatever.

121
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,385
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

122
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,763
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

123
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,057
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,685
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

125
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,396
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

126
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:50,025
Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look
in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

127
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,944
In your dreams, Thunder.

128
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,114
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

129
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,033
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

130
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,371
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

131
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,164
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

132
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,708
Right in the lens.

133
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,043
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

134
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:11,422
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

135
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:21,181
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

136
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,224
Thank you, King.

137
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:25,060
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

138
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,520
It's the least I could do.

139
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,815
Whatever happens, you're a winner to me,
you old daddy rabbit.

140
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,735
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

141
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,197
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

142
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,534
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

143
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,078
I love being me.

144
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,332
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

145
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,086
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

146
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,713
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

147
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,590
You got more talent in one lug nut

148
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,217
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

149
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,887
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

150
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,514
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

151
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,684
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

152
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,771
You ain't gonna win unless
you got good folks behind you,

153
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,941
and you let them do their job,
like they should.

154
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,944
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

155
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,946
Yeah...

156
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,060
Oh, Lightning!

157
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,314
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

158
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:55,985
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

159
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,695
Thank you, Mr. The King.

160
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,613
Ladies and gentlemen,

161
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,991
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

162
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,744
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.

163
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,204
Yes!

164
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,249
...we have a three-way tie.

165
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,842
Hey, McQueen,
that must be really embarrassing.

166
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,678
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

167
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,057
Piston Cup officials have determined
that a tiebreaker race

168
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:31,437
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

169
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,940
Well, thank you!
Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you!

170
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:38,694
Hey, rook, first one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself.

171
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,780
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

172
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,287
Oh, yeah!

173
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,002
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

174
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,713
Oh, we'll see who gets
there first, Chick.

175
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,259
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

176
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,220
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

177
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,473
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

178
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,558
Gotta make your personal appearance.

179
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,186
No. No! No, no, no, no!

180
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,730
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

181
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,400
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment,
new rear end formula!</i>

182
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:22,196
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty
bumper like Rust-eze.</i>

183
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,032
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

184
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,827
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

185
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,162
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

186
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,417
I met this car from Swampscott.

187
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,712
He was so rusty he didn't
even cast a shadow.

188
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,465
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

189
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,803
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

190
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,264
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

191
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,267
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

192
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:56,271
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

193
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,774
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

194
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,818
Can rust your bolts
and freeze your...

195
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,861
Hey, look! There he is!

196
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,905
Our almost champ!

197
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,615
Get your rear end in here, kid.

198
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,742
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

199
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,953
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

200
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,122
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

201
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,998
Yes, I know.

202
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,667
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

203
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,336
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

204
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,338
Looking good, Freddie!

205
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,882
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

206
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,468
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

207
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,595
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

208
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,973
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

209
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,059
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

210
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,145
because the track is always lit.

211
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,439
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

212
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lightning McQueen!

213
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,995
<i>Free Bird!</i>

214
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,373
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

215
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,333
ran a great race today.

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,086
And remember,
with a little Rust-eze...

217
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,255
And an insane amount of luck,

218
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:07,926
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

219
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,014
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

220
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,558
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

221
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,934
Just like this year!

222
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,813
Not on your life.

223
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,609
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

224
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,695
<i>California, here we come!</i>

225
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,489
Dinoco, here we come!

226
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,478
I needed this. Hello?

227
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:26,857
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

228
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,067
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

229
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,903
<i>It's such an honor to be your agent</i>

230
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,698
<i>it almost hurts to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

231
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:40,162
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in perpetuity.
Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

232
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,748
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

233
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,957
Thanks, Harv.

234
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,669
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

235
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,464
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

236
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,675
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you.</i>
- Right. Friends.

237
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,677
Yes, there's...

238
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,181
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

239
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,392
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

240
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,644
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

241
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,855
<i>Break bread with your </i>mishpocheh<i> here!</i>

242
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,024
That'd be great!
We should totally...

243
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,110
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

244
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,200
What? A minivan?

245
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,371
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling.</i>

246
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,956
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

247
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,793
- Old Mack needs a rest.
- <i>Absolutely not.</i>

248
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,254
<i>We're driving all night till we get to California.
We agreed to it.</i>

249
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,634
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

250
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,762
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

251
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,847
All those sleeping trucks.

252
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,642
<i>Hey, kid, I don't know
if I can make it.</i>

253
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,143
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

254
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,562
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

255
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,482
- <i>All night?</i>
- All night long.

256
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,605
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

257
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,733
We got ourselves a nodder.

258
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,075
Pretty music.

259
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,079
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

260
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,624
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

261
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,793
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

262
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,566
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

263
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:00,820
Gesundheit!

264
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,991
One should never drive while drowsy.

265
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,971
Mack!

266
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,228
Mack!

267
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,443
Mack!

268
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,321
Hey, Mack! Mack!

269
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,992
Mack!

270
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,702
Mack, wait for me!

271
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,421
Mack!

272
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,068
Mack! Mack!

273
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,698
Mack! Mack...

274
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,242
...wait up! Mack.

275
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,245
Mack! Mack!

276
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,497
What? You're not Mack.

277
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:39,377
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

278
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,380
Turn on your lights, you moron!

279
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,471
Mack... The Interstate!

280
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,946
Not in my town, you don't.

281
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,078
Oh, no.

282
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,330
Oh, maybe he can help me!

283
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:18,041
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

284
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,461
I haven't gone this fast in years.

285
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,339
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.

286
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,758
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

287
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,510
What in the blue blazes?

288
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,136
Crazy hot-rodder.

289
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:35,744
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

290
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,917
The sixties weren't good
to you, were they?

291
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,513
What? That's not the Interstate!

292
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,274
No, no, no, no, no, no!

293
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,032
I'm not the only one
seeing this, right?

294
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,117
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

295
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,535
- No!
- Hey!

296
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

297
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,123
My tires!

298
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:11,756
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

299
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:24,143
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

300
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,275
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

301
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,861
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

302
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,696
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

303
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,948
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for </i>Cargirl<i>?</i>

304
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,284
<i>Lightning, what's your strategy?</i>

305
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,246
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

306
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,126
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

307
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:52,171
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
- ...to race an unprecedented...</i>

308
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,799
<i>Sponsor stated they have
no idea where he is.</i>

309
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,222
I hope Lightning's OK.
I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.

310
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:05,560
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

311
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,479
<i>Lightning McQueen must
be found at all costs!</i>

312
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:12,734
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

313
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,862
Oh, boy.

314
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,990
Where am I?

315
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,200
Mornin', sleepin' beauty!

316
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,871
Boy, I was wonderin' when
you was gonna wake up.

317
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,665
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

318
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,627
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

319
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,632
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

320
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:38,801
I like you already. My name's Mater.

321
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,262
Mater?

322
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,265
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

323
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,685
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

324
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,148
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

325
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,274
What?

326
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:58,112
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

327
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,448
Where are you? Shoot!

328
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,075
You're in Radiator Springs.

329
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,536
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

330
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,456
Oh, great. Just great!

331
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:13,086
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

332
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,965
You know, I'd love to see
the rest of the town!

333
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,968
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

334
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,804
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

335
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,098
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

336
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,683
- Cool!
- Mater!

337
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,644
What did I tell you about
talkin' to the accused?

338
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,187
To not to.

339
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,692
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

340
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,902
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

341
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,822
"Later, Mater." That's funny!

342
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,827
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court
will come to order!

343
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,455
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

344
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,916
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

345
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,042
- Fascist!
- Commie!

346
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,795
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

347
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,630
I gotta get to California, pronto.

348
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,840
Where's your lawyer?

349
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:02,176
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

350
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,390
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

351
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,475
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

352
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,187
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

353
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,025
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.

354
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,484
Show-off.

355
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,864
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- All right,

356
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:26,200
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

357
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,327
I want his hood on a platter!

358
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,039
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

359
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:34,876
I'm gonna put him in jail
till the jail rots on top of him,

360
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,629
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

361
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,256
I'm...

362
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,135
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

363
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,597
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

364
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,307
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

365
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,642
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

366
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,186
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

367
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:58,232
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

368
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,735
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

369
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,237
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

370
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,239
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

371
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,493
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

372
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,163
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner.

373
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,165
What the...?

374
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:17,335
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

375
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,005
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

376
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,176
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

377
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,261
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

378
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:31,099
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

379
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,768
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

380
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:37,563
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

381
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,649
Ka-ching!

382
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,860
I'll keep that in mind.

383
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,446
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

384
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,116
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

385
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:49,826
You know her?

386
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,870
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

387
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,955
What?

388
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:58,126
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

389
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:02,004
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

390
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,756
What do you want, Sally?

391
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:07,135
Come on, make this guy fix the road.
The town needs this.

392
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,429
No. I know his type. Racecar.

393
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,557
That's the last thing this town needs.

394
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,145
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

395
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:21,149
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

396
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,650
Here she goes again.

397
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,403
Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel

398
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:29,115
strung on the necklace of Route 66,
the mother road!

399
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:32,994
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

400
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:36,038
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

401
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,290
Ignore him.

402
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,710
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

403
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,129
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

404
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,007
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

405
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,550
And if no one can get to you?

406
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,971
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

407
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,849
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

408
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:58,352
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

409
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,939
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

410
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,526
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

411
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,696
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town
and closes her station?

412
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,365
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

413
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:14,243
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

414
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:17,538
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

415
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,790
Lizzie, the guy left,
like, 15 years ago.

416
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,959
Then why are you
bringing him up, you lemon?

417
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,044
Oh, he can do it.

418
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,880
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

419
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,423
Fix the road!

420
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,093
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

421
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,681
Order in the court!

422
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:39,227
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

423
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,270
- Yeah!
- No!

424
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,688
Nice ruling.

425
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,235
I am so not taking you to dinner.

426
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:50,863
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

427
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,740
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

428
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,451
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

429
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,162
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

430
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:04,377
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

431
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,505
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

432
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,675
You'll fix the road
under my supervision.

433
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,718
What? This place is crazy!

434
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,929
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

435
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,015
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

436
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,100
What?

437
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:22,728
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

438
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,397
You gotta be kidding me.

439
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,149
You start there where the road begins.

440
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,528
You finish down there
where the road ends.

441
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,740
Holy shoot!

442
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

443
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,289
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

444
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:42,540
Five days?

445
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,543
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

446
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:48,587
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

447
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,173
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

448
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,475
Freedom!

449
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,318
Maybe I should've hooked
him up to Bessie...

450
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:14,405
...and then...
then took the boot off.

451
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,997
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

452
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,917
California, here I come! Yeah!

453
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,297
Oh, feel that wind.

454
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,341
Yes!

455
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,552
No. No, no, no.

456
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,138
No, no, no, no, no.
Outta gas?

457
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,223
How can I be outta gas?

458
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,561
Boy, we ain't as dumb
as you think we are.

459
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,646
But how did, how did... you...?

460
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,024
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

461
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,776
Ka-chow.

462
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,829
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

463
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:04,997
Hey, Sheriff.

464
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,208
- Why tires here?
- <i>Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

465
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,877
- They were better before.
- <i>Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

466
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,837
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

467
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,715
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

468
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,635
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

469
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,429
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

470
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,391
I get fluid built up in my engine block,

471
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:26,852
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

472
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,146
That's why we made him the judge.

473
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:33,484
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
<i>Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

474
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,902
Now, I'm not one to brag

475
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,322
but people come purty far to see me
get low on the "Mow-Mow".

476
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,701
- Man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

477
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,703
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

478
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,914
That ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

479
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,669
No, no, no!

480
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,088
That won't be necessary.

481
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:58,426
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

482
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,178
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

483
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,598
Where's he goin'?

484
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,102
He's a little bit shy,
and he hates you for killin' his flowers.

485
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,687
I shouldn't put up with this.

486
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,606
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

487
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,734
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

488
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,196
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

489
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,907
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

490
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:25,953
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

491
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,330
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

492
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,499
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

493
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,585
I must scream it to the world!

494
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:36,881
My excitement from the top
of some place very high!

495
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,467
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

496
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,511
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

497
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,223
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

498
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,647
Is that what I think it is?

499
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,484
Customers.

500
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,987
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

501
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,447
- OK!
- Customers?

502
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,158
It's been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

503
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,994
Make sure your "Open,
please come in" signs are out.

504
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:10,581
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

505
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,334
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

506
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:17,796
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

507
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,508
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

508
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:23,552
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

509
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,888
Legendary for its service
and hospitality.

510
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,014
How can we help you?

511
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:31,143
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

512
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,438
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

513
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,941
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

514
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,860
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

515
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:42,988
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

516
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:47,117
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

517
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,869
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

518
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:52,164
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

519
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:55,543
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

520
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,962
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

521
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,381
I do have a map over
at the Cozy Cone Motel.

522
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,592
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

523
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:07,388
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

524
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,933
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

525
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,937
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

526
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,188
No we just topped off.

527
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:20,109
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

528
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,653
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

529
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,073
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

530
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,285
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

531
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,662
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

532
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,080
Maybe ghost flames!

533
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,791
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

534
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,670
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

535
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,798
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

536
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,636
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

537
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,930
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

538
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:53,517
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

539
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,187
OK! Yes. You bet.

540
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:59,523
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

541
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,693
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

542
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,945
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

543
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,656
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,199
No, not really. But listen.

545
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,911
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

546
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,497
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

547
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:19,418
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

548
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

549
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,592
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

550
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,803
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

551
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,014
I'm becoming one of them!

552
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,310
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

553
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,312
They'll tell friends.
You'll see.

554
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,773
<i>We'll be back for our
Hank Williams marathon...</i>

555
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,567
- That's good.
- <i>...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

556
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:47,529
<i>Still no sign of Lightning McQueen.
Chick Hicks arrived in California</i>

557
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:51,075
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

558
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:54,244
<i>It's just nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

559
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:58,165
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

560
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,306
Yeah!

561
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,278
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

562
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,990
Let me get this straight.

563
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,993
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

564
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,789
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

565
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,291
I got a road to finish.

566
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,221
- He's done!
- Done?

567
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:56,640
It's only been an hour.

568
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,895
I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

569
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,856
Say thank you,
and I'll be on my way.

570
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:09,153
- That's all you gotta say.
- I'm the first one on the new road!

571
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:15,325
It rides purty smooth.

572
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:19,037
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

573
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,002
Red.

574
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:28,922
Who do you think you are?

575
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:32,301
Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go.
That was the deal.

576
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,804
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

577
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,348
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

578
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:42,102
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

579
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:47,941
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

580
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:51,779
- What?
- Me and you. Is that a joke?

581
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,239
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

582
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,992
If I win, you do the road my way.

583
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,619
Doc, what're you doin'?

584
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,788
I don't mean to be rude here,

585
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:04,625
but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what?
Three-point-five years?

586
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,211
Then I reckon you ain't
got nothin' to worry about.

587
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:11,965
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

588
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:16,220
Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race.

589
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:20,808
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

590
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:23,811
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

591
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,396
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

592
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,610
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin'...

593
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,445
...and no lollygaggin'.

594
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,072
Speed. I'm speed.

595
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,741
Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.

596
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:43,747
My friend Guido, he dream
to give a real racecar a pit stop.

597
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,249
Peet stop!

598
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,294
The race is only one lap, guys.

599
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,839
<i>Uno</i> lappo! Don't need any help.

600
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:55,759
- I work <i>solo mio</i>.
- Fine. Race your way.

601
00:43:57,094 --> 00:44:00,931
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

602
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,058
Gentlemen...

603
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:06,520
...start your engines!

604
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:15,654
- <i>¡Hijole!</i> Check that out!
- Whoa.

605
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,824
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

606
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,492
Luigi?

607
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,745
On your mark, get set...

608
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,039
<i>Uno</i> for the money,
<i>due</i> for the show,

609
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:31,837
<i>tre</i> to get ready, and <i>quattro</i> to...
I can't believe it. Go!

610
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,808
Doc... the flag means go.

611
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:48,228
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

612
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:51,023
Doc, what are you doing, man?

613
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:54,651
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

614
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,863
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

615
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,699
- Might need a little help.
- OK.

616
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:03,827
You got your tow cable?

617
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,079
Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable.
Why?

618
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:08,498
Just in case.

619
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,011
No, no, no, no, no!

620
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:23,555
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

621
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,600
Bad trip, man.

622
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:35,776
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

623
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,861
I'm confused.

624
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,364
You drive like you fix roads.

625
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,659
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

626
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,960
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

627
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:56,213
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

628
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,218
I can make a little turn on dirt.

629
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,719
You think?

630
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:07,265
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

631
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,810
Hey, <i>ése</i>!
You need a new paint job, man!

632
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,771
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

633
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,273
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

634
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:19,820
Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

635
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,488
Nah, not me, Flo.

636
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,991
I'm on one of them there special diets.

637
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:28,704
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

638
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,540
"You race like you fix roads."

639
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:36,378
I'll show him. I will show him!

640
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,016
Great! I hate it!

641
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:52,769
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

642
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,981
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

643
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:59,651
Radiator Springs. A happy place!

644
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,487
Oh, OK Bessie.
You think that's funny?

645
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:08,118
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

646
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:22,883
Wow.

647
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,885
Mornin', Sally!

648
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:30,182
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

649
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,309
Yes! Amazing!

650
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,062
Yeah!

651
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,650
Ramone!
Mama ain't seen you that low in years.

652
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:43,278
I haven't seen a road
like this in years.

653
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:47,491
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

654
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,743
<i>È bellissima!</i> It's beautiful!

655
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:53,580
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

656
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:55,791
Boy, I tell you what.

657
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:58,710
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

658
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:00,462
Doc, look at this!

659
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:03,423
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

660
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:07,010
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

661
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:10,055
Guido, look at Luigi!

662
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,390
This is <i>fantastico</i>!

663
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:15,936
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

664
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:20,315
Hey, Luigi, this new road makes
your place look like a dump.

665
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,235
That crazy old devil woman.

666
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,449
She's right!

667
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,118
Guido!

668
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,913
That punk actually did a good job.

669
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:40,001
Well, now... where the heck is he?

670
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:49,052
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

671
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:52,472
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

672
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:54,933
and asked me if he could
come down here.

673
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,394
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

674
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:00,313
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

675
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,316
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

676
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:09,489
Sheriff, why don't you go get
yourself a quart of oil at Flo's.

677
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,949
I'll keep an eye on him.

678
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:14,911
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

679
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,761
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

680
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,556
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

681
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,976
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

682
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:41,521
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

683
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,691
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

684
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,861
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

685
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,571
I'll put it simple.

686
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:53,783
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

687
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:00,290
Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

688
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,167
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

689
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,837
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

690
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:12,052
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

691
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,645
Turn right to go left.

692
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:34,282
Oh, that...

693
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:43,917
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

694
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,087
You know what? This crazy
thing happened... I went right!

695
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,548
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

696
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,552
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

697
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,980
- Oh, Guido, <i>è bellissimo</i>!
- <i>Che cosa?</i>

698
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:09,442
- It looks great! This is great!
- <i>Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

699
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,030
Oh, Lord.

700
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,740
Mater!

701
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,951
I need you to watch
the prisoner tonight.

702
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:21,329
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

703
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:24,249
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

704
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,793
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

705
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,299
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

706
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,926
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

707
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:38,263
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

708
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,640
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

709
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:42,726
You make-a such a nice new road.

710
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,478
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

711
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,147
Even though you not a Ferrari.

712
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:51,318
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

713
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:55,238
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

714
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,825
I like your style, eh?

715
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:02,495
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

716
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:06,166
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

717
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,751
Would you look at that?

718
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,170
Ramone, Ramone!

719
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,130
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

720
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:15,175
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

721
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:18,887
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

722
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:23,683
You buy one tire,
I give you seven-a snow tires for free!

723
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:26,603
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

724
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,399
Stop! Let me...

725
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:35,612
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

726
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,697
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

727
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:41,117
Stop, stop! That's cold!

728
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,703
Help! Please! Stop!

729
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,123
Thanks, Red.

730
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,626
What was that for?

731
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,836
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

732
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,380
If you do, you gotta be clean.

733
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:56,007
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

734
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,801
What, I...? I don't get it.

735
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,470
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

736
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,765
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

737
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,478
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

738
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:12,399
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

739
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,901
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

740
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,238
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

741
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,491
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

742
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,036
Yeah, it's like a clever little twist.

743
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,249
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

744
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:32,669
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

745
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,423
Figure that all out
on your own, did you?

746
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,843
Cone number one, if you want.

747
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:48,184
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

748
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,354
That's just a...

749
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,277
You saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

750
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,988
Gonna... Yeah.

751
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:07,287
You know, I once knew this girl Doreen.

752
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,872
Good-lookin' girl.

753
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,250
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

754
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,837
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

755
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,382
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

756
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:23,595
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

757
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:27,807
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

758
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:31,478
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

759
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,813
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

760
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:35,648
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

761
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,735
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

762
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:41,154
I can handle anything.

763
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:44,991
- Mater, I'm not doin' this.
- Oh, come on. You'll love it!

764
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:50,747
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

765
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,332
All right, listen.

766
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:56,419
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

767
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,338
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

768
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,299
Mater!

769
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,800
Wait, Mater!

770
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:05,929
OK, here's what you do.

771
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:09,390
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

772
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:11,976
And they do the rest. Watch this.

773
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,167
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

774
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:40,046
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

775
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,715
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

776
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,982
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

777
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,817
Oh, your turn, bud.

778
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,278
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

779
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,613
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

780
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:10,159
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

781
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:02,545
That's Frank.

782
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:24,776
Run!

783
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:26,819
Here he comes, look out!

784
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,453
Run! He's gonna get ya!

785
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:55,932
Customers!

786
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,021
No, no, no.

787
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,111
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

788
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:11,823
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

789
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:16,202
Oh, boy, you gotta admit
that was fun!

790
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,204
Oh, yeah... yeah.

791
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:21,374
Well, we better get you back
to the impound lot.

792
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:24,627
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

793
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:31,050
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

794
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:35,388
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

795
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:39,350
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

796
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:41,227
Where, where?

797
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:45,481
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

798
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:46,733
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

799
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:48,317
- Way.
- Come on, look...

800
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,820
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

801
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:52,530
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

802
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,449
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

803
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,576
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

804
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,161
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

805
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,246
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

806
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:03,583
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

807
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:08,588
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

808
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,840
You just watch this
right here, lover boy.

809
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:13,926
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

810
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,012
Mater? Mater!

811
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,681
Mater!

812
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,236
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

813
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:44,832
He's nuts.

814
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,377
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

815
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,882
Just need to know where I've been.

816
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:56,093
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

817
00:59:56,177 --> 01:00:00,181
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

818
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,476
Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.

819
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:07,063
What's so important about
this race of yours, anyway?

820
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:12,318
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

821
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,695
I've been dreaming
about it my whole life!

822
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,824
I'll be the first rookie
in history ever to win it.

823
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:21,452
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

824
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:23,162
with private helicopters.

825
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:26,499
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

826
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,751
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

827
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:34,173
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

828
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:37,426
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

829
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,431
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

830
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:47,103
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

831
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,981
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

832
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,816
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

833
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:55,862
I knew it.
I knowed I made a good choice!

834
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,780
In what?

835
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,616
My best friend.

836
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,749
See you tomorrow, buddy!

837
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:12,295
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,</i>

838
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:16,048
<i>K-i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!</i>

839
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:28,769
Number one. Number one...
Number one!

840
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,899
- This is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

841
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,444
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

842
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,654
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

843
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:41,824
- I mean, I wasn't like "scared" scared.
- No, of course not. No.

844
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:44,619
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

845
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,413
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

846
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,498
Something about a helicopter ride.

847
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,752
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

848
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,712
- Did you mean it?
- What?

849
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,797
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

850
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,926
First things first.
I gotta get outta here and make the race.

851
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:05,264
You know... Mater trusts you.

852
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,976
Yeah, OK.

853
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,771
- Did you mean that?
- What?

854
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:17,443
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

855
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:20,196
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

856
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:23,783
Yeah, OK. G'night.

857
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,664
Hey, thank you.

858
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,626
What did you just say?

859
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,504
You know, thanks for
lettin' me stay here.

860
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:40,466
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

861
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:44,095
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

862
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,640
- G'night.
- Good night.

863
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,747
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

864
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:15,668
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

865
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:35,730
No!

866
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:46,991
I gotta get outta here!

867
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,369
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

868
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:53,748
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

869
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:57,293
I just need my daily
gas ration from the Sheriff.

870
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:59,503
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

871
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,214
I've been trying to get
outta here for three days!

872
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:04,800
Hope you enjoyed the show!

873
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:20,191
Whoa, Doc.

874
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:23,986
Time to clean out the garage,
buddy, come on.

875
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:41,670
What?

876
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:45,591
He has a Piston Cup?

877
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,433
Oh, my gosh.

878
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,853
Three Piston Cups?

879
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,159
Sign says stay out.

880
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:15,579
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

881
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:18,749
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

882
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,836
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

883
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,463
Of course.
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

884
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,340
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

885
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,969
You used to hold the record for most wins
in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

886
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:32,805
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

887
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,599
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

888
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:39,103
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

889
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:49,655
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

890
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:51,490
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

891
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:54,827
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
That's your color!

892
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,622
- Yellow, baby.
- You smokin' hot!

893
01:05:58,706 --> 01:05:59,748
There he is.

894
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:02,835
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

895
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:08,841
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

896
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:11,510
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

897
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,846
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

898
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:17,183
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

899
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,351
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

900
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:23,022
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

901
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:26,942
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

902
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:29,361
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

903
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:31,947
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

904
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:34,283
Yeah, I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

905
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,785
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

906
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,704
He needs a new coat
of poly for sure!

907
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,166
Hey, hey! What are you doin'?

908
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,376
It's OK, Sheriff.
You can trust me, right?

909
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,296
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

910
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,591
I trust him.

911
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,844
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

912
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,221
Yeah, a drive.

913
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:58,390
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

914
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:01,185
No. No, we don't.

915
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:27,503
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

916
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:38,055
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

917
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,557
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

918
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,602
That's so too much!

919
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:48,065
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

920
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,150
I don't know.

921
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,032
Whoa! Yes.

922
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:49,186
Wow. What is this place?

923
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,230
Wheel Well.

924
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,608
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

925
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:00,989
This place?

926
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,662
Yeah, imagine.

927
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,041
Oh, imagine what it must
have been like to stay here.

928
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:14,920
You know, I don't get you.

929
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:18,257
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

930
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,509
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

931
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:24,763
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

932
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:28,392
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

933
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:31,854
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

934
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,274
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

935
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,109
And you know what?

936
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:40,821
It never felt... happy.

937
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:45,534
Yeah. I mean... really?

938
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,327
Yeah. So I left California.

939
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:50,706
Just drove and drove and
finally broke down right here.

940
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:54,251
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

941
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,337
Well, they all did. And I never left.

942
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:00,299
Yeah. You know, I understand.

943
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:03,177
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

944
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,014
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

945
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,435
I fell in love.

946
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,189
Yep.

947
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:18,817
- Corvette?
- No.

948
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:27,117
I fell in love with this.

949
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:42,883
Whoa. Look at that.

950
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,053
Look, they're drivin' right by.

951
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,347
They don't even know
what they're missing!

952
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:51,683
Well, it didn't used to be that way.

953
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,478
Oh, yeah?

954
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:58,440
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

955
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:00,567
Really?

956
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,362
Yeah. Back then,

957
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:06,281
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

958
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:08,867
How do you mean?

959
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:12,371
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

960
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:16,625
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

961
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,128
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

962
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:24,841
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

963
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,469
They drove on it to have a great time.

964
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,880
Well, what happened?

965
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:07,426
The town got bypassed just
to save ten minutes of driving.

966
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:37,182
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

967
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:40,018
I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

968
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:43,772
But one of these days we'll find
a way to get it back on the map.

969
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,526
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

970
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,403
I had a great time.

971
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:52,239
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

972
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:55,033
You're welcome.

973
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,667
Hey, listen, listen!

974
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,837
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

975
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,005
Wha... what?

976
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:26,398
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

977
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:38,869
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

978
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:42,539
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

979
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,916
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

980
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,003
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

981
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:50,589
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

982
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:52,632
There's one goin' this way.

983
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,802
I got it.

984
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,600
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

985
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:03,935
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

986
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:05,353
No, no, no, no, come here.

987
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:06,772
What are you doing?

988
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:09,566
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

989
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,235
...alone.

990
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:26,875
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

991
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:35,842
Come on, Doc, drive.

992
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:55,505
Yeah.

993
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:57,215
Wow.

994
01:17:57,299 --> 01:17:58,925
You're amazing!

995
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:03,138
What are you doin'?

996
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,931
Doc, wait!

997
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,229
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

998
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:17,319
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

999
01:18:17,402 --> 01:18:20,697
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1000
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,574
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1001
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:25,660
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1002
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:27,746
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1003
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:30,874
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1004
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:33,877
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1005
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:38,214
You think I quit?

1006
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,520
Right.

1007
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:55,774
Your big wreck in '54.

1008
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,777
They quit on me.

1009
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,447
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1010
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,408
You know what they said?
"You're history."

1011
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:08,536
Moved right on to the next
rookie standing in line.

1012
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:13,625
There was a lot left in me.

1013
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:17,379
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1014
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,884
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1015
01:19:24,052 --> 01:19:27,222
I just never expected
that that world would...

1016
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,516
...would find me here.

1017
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,186
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1018
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,270
No, I'm not.

1019
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:38,149
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1020
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:42,862
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1021
01:19:45,991 --> 01:19:47,701
I didn't think so.

1022
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:51,871
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1023
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:55,625
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1024
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,211
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1025
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,547
and your friends don't
even know who you are?

1026
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,258
Who's caring about only himself?

1027
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:06,136
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1028
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:22,986
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1029
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:25,530
Respect the classics, man.

1030
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:53,308
He's done.

1031
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,603
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1032
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,938
Good riddance.

1033
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,239
He's gone?

1034
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:11,326
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1035
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:21,086
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1036
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:24,130
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1037
01:21:24,214 --> 01:21:26,216
I'm glad he's gone!

1038
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,807
What's wrong with Red?

1039
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:37,268
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town

1040
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:39,395
and went to your big race to win

1041
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:43,233
the Piston Cup that you've always
dreamed about your whole life

1042
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:48,863
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1043
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:55,829
Wait a minute!

1044
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,999
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1045
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,794
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1046
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,548
Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort,
and we'll make up time.

1047
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:07,799
Thank you, Sheriff.

1048
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,968
But you know I can't go just yet.

1049
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,553
Well, why not?

1050
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:16,349
I'm not sure these tires can get me
all the way to California.

1051
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,433
Peet stop?

1052
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:20,770
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1053
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:24,023
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1054
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:26,818
<i>Grazie,</i> Mr. Lightning.<i> Grazie!</i>

1055
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:30,989
- Would you look at that!
- Our first real customer in years!

1056
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:34,659
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1057
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:38,580
for this is the most
glorious day of my life!

1058
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:42,667
All right, Luigi, give me the best set
of blackwalls you've got.

1059
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,085
No! No, no, no.

1060
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:47,547
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1061
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:53,011
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1062
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:54,596
But-a this...

1063
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:56,681
Whitewall tires!

1064
01:22:56,764 --> 01:23:01,936
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

1065
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,813
All right, you're the expert.

1066
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,816
Oh, and don't forget the spare.

1067
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,736
- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!

1068
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,042
What did Luigi tell you?

1069
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:27,587
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1070
01:23:28,338 --> 01:23:29,505
No.

1071
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:36,971
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1072
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:39,057
It's a conspiracy, man!

1073
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,559
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1074
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:44,896
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1075
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:47,106
OK, I'll take a case.

1076
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:14,092
Yeah.

1077
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:16,177
Ka-chow.

1078
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:19,347
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1079
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,182
Act natural.

1080
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:23,184
- Hi, Sally.
- <i>Buon giorno!</i>

1081
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:25,103
All right, what's goin' on?

1082
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:27,313
Ladies and gentlecars,

1083
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:31,359
please welcome the new
Lightning McQueen!

1084
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:33,945
What do you think?

1085
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:36,239
Radiator Springs looks
pretty good on me.

1086
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,116
I'll say.

1087
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,369
Ka-chow.

1088
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,997
You're gonna fit right in in California.

1089
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,959
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1090
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,877
Yeah, everybody except one.

1091
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:56,134
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1092
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:59,220
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1093
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:01,681
Now, what was I supposed
to do after that?

1094
01:25:26,456 --> 01:25:28,291
They fixed their neon!

1095
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:39,427
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1096
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:48,353
Just like in its heyday, right?

1097
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:51,773
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1098
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:20,635
Shall we cruise?

1099
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:23,054
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1100
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:24,555
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1101
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,976
I remember when Stanley first
asked me to take a drive with him.

1102
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,896
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1103
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,107
Of course, Mater.

1104
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:46,202
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1105
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:50,581
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1106
01:26:50,665 --> 01:26:54,085
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1107
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:05,721
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1108
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:08,099
Good evenin', you two.

1109
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:15,857
Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.

1110
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:23,739
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1111
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:29,454
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1112
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:32,206
Not that. That.

1113
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:34,625
Customers?

1114
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:37,420
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1115
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,839
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1116
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:43,301
It's the ghostlight!

1117
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:46,012
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1118
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:48,306
McQueen, over here!

1119
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:51,142
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1120
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:53,352
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1121
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:56,147
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1122
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,231
Stickers!

1123
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,484
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1124
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,986
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1125
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:05,281
but I was in charge of huntin'
him down if he tried to escape.

1126
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,949
Sally! Sally!

1127
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,076
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1128
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,870
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1129
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,455
Come on, give us some bolt!

1130
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:17,919
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1131
01:28:18,002 --> 01:28:21,380
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1132
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:25,301
You are a sight for sore headlights!

1133
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:28,095
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1134
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:30,306
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1135
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,683
<i>Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1136
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,311
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1137
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:39,857
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1138
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:43,194
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1139
01:28:43,486 --> 01:28:45,530
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1140
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:47,448
- Harv?
- Come on!

1141
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:50,201
- <i>Kid, I'm over here!</i>
- How you doin', buddy?

1142
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:52,954
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1143
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:55,206
- <i>How do you think I'm doing?</i>
- I can explain.

1144
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:59,710
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1145
01:28:59,794 --> 01:29:02,838
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1146
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:05,383
<i>That's just a figure of speech, by the way.
You signed a contract.</i>

1147
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,718
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1148
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:10,346
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1149
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,599
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- <i>Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1150
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:14,892
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1151
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:18,771
<i>While the world's been trying to find you
Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1152
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,565
- <i>Who are they gonna woo?</i>
- Chick!

1153
01:29:20,648 --> 01:29:24,235
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1154
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:26,487
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1155
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:30,199
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1156
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:33,536
- Hey, that's my bit!
- <i>You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1157
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:37,582
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1158
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,417
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1159
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,252
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1160
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:44,630
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1161
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,554
Sally, I... I want you to...

1162
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,348
Look, I wish...

1163
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:59,645
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1164
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:07,028
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1165
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:13,326
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1166
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:16,621
He's gonna have me fired if I don't
get you in the truck right now!

1167
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:19,457
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1168
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,751
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1169
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,131
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1170
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:29,300
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1171
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:32,637
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1172
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,805
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1173
01:30:40,645 --> 01:30:43,397
- <i>Come on, get in the trailer.</i>
- Where's the old McQueen?

1174
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:45,816
- The bolt!
- <i>That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1175
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,611
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1176
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,988
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1177
01:30:51,072 --> 01:30:54,075
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1178
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:59,080
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1179
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,589
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1180
01:31:08,673 --> 01:31:11,092
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1181
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:23,270
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1182
01:31:23,938 --> 01:31:27,066
Best for everyone or best for you?

1183
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:46,335
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1184
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:49,231
Hello, race fans, and welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1185
01:32:49,315 --> 01:32:51,609
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1186
01:32:51,692 --> 01:32:54,111
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1187
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:56,280
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1188
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:59,074
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1189
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:03,454
Tickets to this race are hotter than
a black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1190
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:06,123
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1191
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:09,502
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1192
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:12,797
You know I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1193
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,884
I never thought I'd see anything like this.
This is exciting!

1194
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,303
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1195
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:23,432
to watch what many experts are calling
"the race of the century."

1196
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:26,143
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1197
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:30,314
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1198
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:33,484
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1199
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:34,568
He's hot!

1200
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:37,321
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1201
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:40,491
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1202
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:43,077
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1203
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,080
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1204
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:48,916
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1205
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,127
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1206
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:57,174
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1207
01:33:57,258 --> 01:34:01,136
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1208
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,471
Sorry, pal.

1209
01:34:02,555 --> 01:34:06,809
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1210
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:10,437
I am speed.

1211
01:34:12,106 --> 01:34:13,315
Victory.

1212
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:15,568
One winner, two losers.

1213
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:23,158
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1214
01:34:27,955 --> 01:34:29,915
Hey, Lightnin'! You ready?

1215
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:32,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1216
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,893
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1217
01:34:48,976 --> 01:34:51,562
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1218
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:54,023
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1219
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:56,483
- It is?
- Not really.

1220
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:29,016
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1221
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:31,393
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1222
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:34,605
Missing all week, and then he
turns up in the middle of nowhere!

1223
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:37,066
In a little town called
Radiator Springs.

1224
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:40,194
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1225
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:44,490
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1226
01:35:45,783 --> 01:35:48,118
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1227
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:51,080
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1228
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:54,124
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1229
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:57,378
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1230
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:06,303
Shoot!

1231
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:09,056
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys!
Let's go racin'!

1232
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:17,314
Come on, you can do it!

1233
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:19,441
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1234
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:24,321
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1235
01:36:24,405 --> 01:36:27,157
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1236
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,495
Chick slammed the door on him!

1237
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:33,956
Chick's not making it
easy on him today.

1238
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,666
Man, he lost so much momentum,

1239
01:36:35,749 --> 01:36:38,085
and now he's gonna have
to chase him back down!

1240
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:49,596
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1241
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:56,186
Just me and the old man, fellas.

1242
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,272
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1243
01:37:00,774 --> 01:37:05,029
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1244
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:06,530
I don't think I...

1245
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:09,324
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1246
01:37:09,575 --> 01:37:11,118
Doc?

1247
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:16,373
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1248
01:37:16,457 --> 01:37:20,210
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1249
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,212
You said you'd never come back.

1250
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:25,883
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1251
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:28,844
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1252
01:37:32,806 --> 01:37:36,310
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1253
01:37:36,393 --> 01:37:39,646
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1254
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:41,732
Now, get back out there!

1255
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:46,904
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1256
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:49,281
You're goin' up against
professional pit crews.

1257
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:52,534
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1258
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:54,286
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1259
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:57,790
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1260
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:11,386
- Is that?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1261
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:15,224
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1262
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:17,684
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1263
01:38:17,768 --> 01:38:20,395
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1264
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:23,148
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1265
01:38:23,232 --> 01:38:26,568
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1266
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:33,200
<i>Wow, this is history in the making.</i>

1267
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:36,203
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1268
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:37,663
Hey, Doc!

1269
01:38:37,746 --> 01:38:41,917
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1270
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:50,717
- McQueen passes them on the inside!
- But he's still nearly a lap down.

1271
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:53,595
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1272
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,557
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1273
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,225
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1274
01:38:58,308 --> 01:39:01,186
Hey, shrimpie, where did
McQueen find you, huh?

1275
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:04,731
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1276
01:39:05,858 --> 01:39:08,485
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1277
01:39:08,569 --> 01:39:11,738
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1278
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:28,964
Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh?

1279
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:32,384
Well, what do you think of this?

1280
01:39:32,718 --> 01:39:34,052
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1281
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:38,640
What?

1282
01:39:38,724 --> 01:39:40,517
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1283
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:46,523
I taught him that. Ka-chow!

1284
01:39:46,607 --> 01:39:49,359
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1285
01:39:49,443 --> 01:39:51,153
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1286
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:54,740
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1287
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:01,580
Look at that boy go out there!

1288
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:12,090
No, you don't.

1289
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:17,137
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1290
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:20,641
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1291
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:24,019
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1292
01:40:26,313 --> 01:40:28,065
We gotta get him back out there fast

1293
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:31,068
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1294
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:33,320
Guido! It's time.

1295
01:40:37,616 --> 01:40:39,952
Hey, tiny, you gonna
clean his windshield?

1296
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:50,796
I don't believe it!

1297
01:40:50,879 --> 01:40:53,006
That was the fastest
pit stop I've ever seen!

1298
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:55,634
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car out!

1299
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:57,427
It's gonna be close.

1300
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:00,097
Yeah, baby!

1301
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,016
<i>He's back in the race!</i>

1302
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:05,352
Peet stop.

1303
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,689
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1304
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:26,832
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1305
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:29,209
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1306
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:33,088
A hundred and ninety-nine laps,
and, baby, it all comes down to this!

1307
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:34,423
This is it, kiddo.

1308
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,967
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1309
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:39,469
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1310
01:41:39,553 --> 01:41:40,971
Go!

1311
01:41:43,682 --> 01:41:44,808
We'll see about that!

1312
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,894
McQueen's going inside!

1313
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:53,775
- Chick and The King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1314
01:42:04,745 --> 01:42:07,039
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1315
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:10,083
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1316
01:42:16,882 --> 01:42:19,343
Lightning McQueen is
gonna win the Piston Cup!

1317
01:42:19,426 --> 01:42:21,553
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1318
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:26,850
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1319
01:42:37,194 --> 01:42:38,278
Oh, no!

1320
01:42:57,631 --> 01:42:59,132
Yeah!

1321
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:03,637
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1322
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,057
What's he up to, Doc?

1323
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:18,777
What are you doin', kid?

1324
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:22,114
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1325
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:28,245
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1326
01:43:28,328 --> 01:43:31,915
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1327
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:34,084
It's just an empty cup.

1328
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:38,755
Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?

1329
01:43:38,839 --> 01:43:40,382
He's not really pushin' him.

1330
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:42,509
He's just givin' him
a little bump draft.

1331
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:47,597
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1332
01:43:47,681 --> 01:43:49,683
That's what I call racin' right there.

1333
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:08,952
- <i>Bravo il mio amico!</i>
- Way to go, buddy!

1334
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:11,621
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1335
01:44:11,705 --> 01:44:16,251
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1336
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:21,715
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1337
01:44:21,798 --> 01:44:23,175
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1338
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:26,219
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1339
01:44:26,303 --> 01:44:29,431
Hey, how come the only one
celebrating is me, huh?

1340
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:31,725
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1341
01:44:32,642 --> 01:44:35,395
Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1342
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:38,773
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1343
01:44:38,857 --> 01:44:40,317
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1344
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:41,985
- Boo!
- Boo!

1345
01:44:42,068 --> 01:44:45,155
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1346
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:47,365
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1347
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:55,749
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1348
01:44:58,168 --> 01:45:00,587
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1349
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,672
You're The King! Yeah!

1350
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:16,561
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1351
01:45:19,773 --> 01:45:22,400
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1352
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:24,277
Thanks, Doc.

1353
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:26,696
Hey, Lightnin'.

1354
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:29,449
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1355
01:45:30,367 --> 01:45:33,370
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1356
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:36,248
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1357
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:42,379
But I didn't win.

1358
01:45:42,462 --> 01:45:46,258
Lightnin', there's a whole lot more
to racin' than just winnin'.

1359
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:48,885
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1360
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:51,930
buzzards used to circle the car!

1361
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,933
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1362
01:45:55,016 --> 01:45:58,770
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1363
01:46:00,313 --> 01:46:02,023
I'm gonna stick with them.

1364
01:46:02,107 --> 01:46:05,151
Well, I sure can respect that.

1365
01:46:05,235 --> 01:46:06,403
Still, you know,

1366
01:46:06,486 --> 01:46:10,323
if there's ever anything I can
do for you, just let me know.

1367
01:46:10,407 --> 01:46:12,951
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1368
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:18,081
Actually, there is one thing.

1369
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:24,296
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1370
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,803
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1371
01:46:35,432 --> 01:46:37,726
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1372
01:46:40,854 --> 01:46:44,274
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1373
01:46:44,357 --> 01:46:45,358
to get tires.

1374
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:49,613
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1375
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:54,909
Guido! There is a real Michael
Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1376
01:46:54,993 --> 01:46:57,287
A real Ferrari!

1377
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:59,456
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1378
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:03,043
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1379
01:47:04,336 --> 01:47:10,300
Wow. <i>Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

1380
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:28,109
Just passin' through?

1381
01:47:28,193 --> 01:47:30,487
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1382
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,823
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1383
01:47:33,907 --> 01:47:37,661
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1384
01:47:37,744 --> 01:47:40,163
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1385
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:43,083
Really? Well, there goes the town.

1386
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:45,669
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1387
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:49,839
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1388
01:47:49,923 --> 01:47:52,092
blah, blah, blah.

1389
01:47:52,509 --> 01:47:55,512
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

1390
01:47:55,595 --> 01:48:00,225
<i>K-i-s-s-... i-n-t!</i>

1391
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,519
Great timing, Mater!

1392
01:48:02,602 --> 01:48:05,605
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly!

1393
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,109
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1394
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:12,112
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1395
01:48:12,195 --> 01:48:15,031
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1396
01:48:15,907 --> 01:48:17,575
Nah.

1397
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:20,704
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1398
01:49:33,735 --> 01:49:36,738
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1399
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:41,576
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1400
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:44,621
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1401
01:49:44,704 --> 01:49:48,750
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1402
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:52,295
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1403
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:56,174
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1404
01:50:02,722 --> 01:50:05,266
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1405
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:08,394
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1406
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:14,609
Doc! Doc!

1407
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:19,072
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1408
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:39,175
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1409
01:50:39,259 --> 01:50:42,679
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1410
01:50:42,762 --> 01:50:46,599
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1411
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:49,727
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1412
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:51,813
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1413
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:55,108
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1414
01:50:58,278 --> 01:50:59,362
Look at this!

1415
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:01,573
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1416
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:04,784
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1417
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:08,371
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look?

1418
01:51:15,003 --> 01:51:16,296
Oh, dang.

1419
01:51:21,467 --> 01:51:24,971
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

1420
01:51:25,054 --> 01:51:30,143
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

1421
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:32,437
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

1422
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,733
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

1423
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:39,152
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

1424
01:51:39,235 --> 01:51:42,572
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1425
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:45,199
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1426
01:51:45,658 --> 01:51:49,913
<i>We're banished, genius!
Stuck here in this wasteland without chains!</i>

1427
01:51:49,996 --> 01:51:53,750
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

1428
01:51:53,833 --> 01:51:56,127
<i>You're still not listening!</i>

1429
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:01,841
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

1430
01:52:02,133 --> 01:52:06,262
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1431
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:08,389
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

1432
01:52:08,473 --> 01:52:09,807
<i>Circus cars?</i>

1433
01:52:09,891 --> 01:52:12,352
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

1434
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:14,938
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

1435
01:52:15,021 --> 01:52:17,023
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

1436
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:18,232
Wait a minute here.

1437
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:20,777
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

1438
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,404
What kind of a cut-rate
production is this?

1439
01:55:49,235 --> 01:55:53,906
Oh, for the love of Chrysler,
can we please ask someone for directions?

1440
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:58,244
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
