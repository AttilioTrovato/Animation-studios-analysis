1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,677
Aah!

2
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,786
Aah!

3
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,688
Mahtim!

4
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,319
Mahtim!

5
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,246
Mahtim!

6
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,989
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

7
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,533
First off, I'd like
to thank this board...

8
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,827
for taking the time
to hear my proposal.

9
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,995
Now, we've all heard
of the legend of Atlantis...

10
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,331
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic...

11
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,458
that was home
to an advanced civilization...

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,002
possessing technology
far beyond our own...

13
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,380
that, according
to our friend Plato here...

14
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,841
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event...

15
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,509
that sank it
beneath the sea.

16
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,429
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

17
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,055
It's just a myth, isn't it?

18
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,348
Pure fantasy.

19
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,768
Well, that is
where you'd be wrong.

20
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,895
10,000 years
before the Egyptians...

21
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,896
built the pyramids...

22
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,983
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine...

23
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,193
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

24
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,862
Well, no.
No, not for them.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,864
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree...

26
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,783
that Atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind...

27
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,202
more powerful than steam,
than... than coal.

28
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,495
More powerful than
our modern...

29
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,872
internal combustion engines.

30
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,625
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis...

31
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,502
find that power source...

32
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,379
and bring it back
to the surface.

33
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,632
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text...

34
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,886
that describes a book called
the Shepherd's Journal...

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,055
said to have been
a first-hand account...

36
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,390
of Atlantis
and its exact whereabouts.

37
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,477
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text...

38
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,229
historians have believed
the Journal resides in Ireland.

39
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,191
But after
comparing the text...

40
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,194
to the runes
on this Viking shield...

41
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,613
I found that
one of the letters...

42
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,156
had been mistranslated.

43
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,575
So, by changing this letter...

44
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,702
and inserting
the correct one...

45
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,079
we find that
the Shepherd's Journal...

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,705
the key to Atlantis...

47
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,709
lies not in Ireland,
gentlemen...

48
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,753
but in Iceland.

49
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,296
Uhh!

50
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,756
Pause for effect.

51
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:19,301
Gentlemen, uh,
I'll take your questions now.

52
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,014
Uh, would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment?

53
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,061
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.

54
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,856
Yeah. Uh, just... just a second.

55
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,032
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.

56
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,414
How's that?
Is that better?

57
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,458
Uh-huh. Yeah.
You're welcome.

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,960
And don't
let it happen again!

59
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,378
All right, bye.

60
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,714
Now, as you can see
by th...

61
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,051
by this, um, map... map,
uh, that... that...

62
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,928
ahem... that I've drawn,
I plotted the route...

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,430
that will take myself
and a crew...

64
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,640
to the southern coast of Iceland
to retrieve the Journal.

65
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:08,934
Ah, showtime.

66
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,354
Well, this is it.

67
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,189
I am finally getting
out of the dungeon.

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,227
"Dear Mr. Thatch,
this is to inform you...

69
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,729
"that your meeting today
has been moved up...

70
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,773
"from 4:30 P.M.
To 3:30 P.M."

71
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,816
What?

72
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,320
"Dear Mr. Thatch,
due to your absence...

73
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,863
"the board has voted
to reject your proposal.

74
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,574
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."

75
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,534
They can't
do this to me!

76
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,370
I swear,
that young Thatch...

77
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,288
gets crazier every year.

78
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,707
If I ever hear the word
"Atlantis" again...

79
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,292
I'll step
in front of a bus!

80
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,877
Ha ha ha!
I'll push you!

81
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,045
Mr. Harcourt!

82
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,671
Good Lord!
There he is!

83
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,048
Members of the board...
uh, wait!

84
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,675
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!

85
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,666
Head for the hills!

86
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,178
Where is a guard
when you need him?

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,389
Mr. Harcourt, you
gotta listen to me, sir!

88
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,766
Uh, sir?

89
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,021
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!

90
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,608
Sir, I-I have new evidence
that... Please, Mr. Harcourt!

91
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,069
Stop! Sir, if you...
Could you hold...

92
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,487
Thank you very much.
Look at...

93
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,240
This museum funds
scientific expeditions...

94
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,785
based on facts,
not legends and folklore.

95
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,037
Besides, we need you here.

96
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,415
- We depend on you.
- You do?

97
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,916
Yes! What with winter coming...

98
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,043
that boiler's going to need
a lot of attention.

99
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,336
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!

100
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,381
But there...
there's a journal!

101
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,259
It's in Iceland!
I'm sure of it this time!

102
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,013
Sir, I really hoped
it wouldn't come to this...

103
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:14,435
but this is... uhh...
a letter of resignation.

104
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,814
If you reject my proposal,
I'll... Whoa!

105
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,691
I'll quit!

106
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,447
I mean it, sir.

107
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,449
If you refuse
to fund my proposal...

108
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,658
You'll what?

109
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,285
Flush your career
down the toilet...

110
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,578
just like
your grandfather?

111
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,580
You have a lot
of potential, Milo.

112
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,166
Don't throw it all away
chasing fairy tales.

113
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,626
But I can prove
Atlantis exists!

114
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,295
You want to go
on an expedition?

115
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,173
Here. Take a trolley
to the Potomac and jump in!

116
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,468
Maybe the cold water will
clear your head. Heinz!

117
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,643
I'm home.

118
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,772
Fluffy?
Here, kitty.

119
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,568
Milo James Thatch?

120
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,113
Who... who are you?
How did you get in here?

121
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:12,493
I came down the chimney.
Ho, ho, ho.

122
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,244
My name is
Helga Sinclair.

123
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,538
I'm acting on behalf
of my employer...

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,167
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you.

125
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,002
Are you interested?

126
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,921
Your... your...
your employer? Heh.

127
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,339
Who is your employer?

128
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,148
This way, please.

129
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,942
And don't drip
on the Caravaggio.

130
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:46,985
Step lively.

131
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,862
Mr. Whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting.

132
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,200
You will address him as
"Mr. Whitmore" or "Sir."

133
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,952
You will stand unless
asked to be seated.

134
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,537
Keep your sentences short
and to the point.

135
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,746
Are we clear?

136
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,543
And relax.

137
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,837
He doesn't bite... often.

138
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,554
Grandpa?

139
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,973
Finest explorer I ever met.

140
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,475
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.

141
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,353
Join me in a little yoga?

142
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,355
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.

143
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,565
Did you really
know my grandfather?

144
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,693
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus
back in Georgetown.

145
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,903
Class of '66.
We stayed close friends...

146
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:31,071
till the end of his days.

147
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,157
Even dragged me along...

148
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,992
on some of his
danged fool expeditions.

149
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,536
Thatch was crazy
as a fruit bat, he was.

150
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,829
He spoke of you often.

151
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,956
Funny. He... he never
mentioned you.

152
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:41,957
Oh, he wouldn't.

153
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,292
He knew how much
I liked my privacy.

154
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,670
I keep a low profile.

155
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,756
Mr. Whitmore, should I be
wondering why I'm here?

156
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,923
Look on that table.

157
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,593
Ah!

158
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,261
It's for you.

159
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,056
It's... it's from my grandfather.

160
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,766
He brought that package
to me years ago.

161
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,601
He said if anything
were to happen to him...

162
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,602
I should give it to you...

163
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,603
when you were ready...

164
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,272
whatever that means.

165
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,107
It...

166
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,943
It can't be.
It's the Shepherd's Journal.

167
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:12,738
Mr. Whitmore,
this journal is the key...

168
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,282
to finding the lost
continent of Atlantis!

169
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,410
Atlantis! Ha ha ha!
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

170
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,745
No, no, no.
Look... look at this.

171
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,247
Coordinates. Clues.
It's all right here.

172
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,957
Yeah, looks like
gibberish to me.

173
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,459
That's because it's
been written in a dialect...

174
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,835
that no longer exists.

175
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,077
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.

176
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,131
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

177
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,633
It's not gibberish to me.

178
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,884
Ah, it's probably a fake.

179
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,429
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather
would have known...

180
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,431
if this were a fake.
I would know.

181
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,476
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in...

182
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,603
that this is the genuine
Shepherd's Journal.

183
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,771
All right,
all right.

184
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,855
So what do you want
to do with it?

185
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,440
Well, I'll... I'll...
I'll get funding.

186
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,983
I mean, I'll... The museum...

187
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:50,984
They'll
never believe you.

188
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,904
I'll show them!
I will make them believe.

189
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,947
Like you did today?

190
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,324
Yes! Well, no.
How did you...

191
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,201
Forget about them,
OK? Never mind!

192
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,120
I will find Atlantis
on my own.

193
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,913
I mean, if I have
to rent a rowboat!

194
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,708
Congratulations, Milo.

195
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,419
This is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

196
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,003
But forget the rowboat, son.

197
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,924
We'll travel in style.

198
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,638
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

199
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:20,681
Why?

200
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,391
For years your granddad
bent my ear...

201
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,934
with stories
about that old book.

202
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,310
I didn't buy it for a minute.

203
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,603
So finally I got fed up...

204
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,855
and made a bet
with the old coot.

205
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,815
I said, "Thatch, if you
ever actually find...

206
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,858
"that so-called journal...

207
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,443
"not only will I
finance the expedition...

208
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,986
"but I'll kiss you
full on the mouth."

209
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,028
Lmagine my embarrassment...

210
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,406
when he found
the darn thing.

211
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,533
Now I know your
grandfather's gone, Milo...

212
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,869
God rest his soul,
but Preston Whitmore...

213
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,287
is a man who keeps his word.

214
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,288
You hear that, Thatch?

215
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,456
I'm going to the afterlife...

216
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,791
with a clear conscience,
by thunder!

217
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,509
Your grandpa was a great man.

218
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,511
You probably don't
realize how great.

219
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:03,474
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down...

220
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
made a laughingstock of him.

221
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,853
He died a broken man.

222
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,231
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof...

223
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,733
that'd be enough for me.

224
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,612
Ah, Thatch.

225
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,072
What are we
standing around for?

226
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,114
We got work to do.

227
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,699
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know,
in order to do...

228
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,409
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

229
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,358
Taken care of!

230
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,412
You'll need engineers
and... and geologists.

231
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,414
Got 'em all.
The best of the best.

232
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,958
Gaetan Moliere,
geology and excavation.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,502
The man
has a nose for dirt.

234
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,253
Vincenzo Santorini,
demolitions.

235
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,464
Busted him out
of a Turkish prison.

236
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,174
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.

237
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,509
She's forgotten more
about engines...

238
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,052
than you or I will ever know.

239
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,845
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

240
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,846
Where was it?

241
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,556
Iceland.

242
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,558
I knew it!
I knew it!

243
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,686
All we need now is
an expert in gibberish.

244
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,647
So it's decision time.

245
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,732
You can build on the foundation
your grandfather left you...

246
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,776
or you can go back
to your boiler room.

247
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,240
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.

248
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,951
All right. OK. I-I-I'll
have to quit my job.

249
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,703
It's done.
You resigned this afternoon.

250
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,704
- I did?
- Yep.

251
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,705
Don't like
to leave loose ends.

252
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,331
Um, my apartment.
I have to give notice.

253
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,916
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?

254
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,126
- Packed.
- My books?

255
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,794
- In storage.
- My cat?

256
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,880
My gosh.

257
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,799
Your granddad had a saying.

258
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,134
"Our lives are remembered...

259
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,386
by the gifts
we leave our children."

260
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,765
This journal
is his gift to you, Milo.

261
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,394
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?

262
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,646
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.

263
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,022
You will not regret this.

264
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,110
Boy, I am so excited,
l-I-I-I can't even hold it in.

265
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,244
Carrots.
Why is there always carrots?

266
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,787
I didn't even eat carrots.

267
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,999
Attention.
All hands to the launch bay.

268
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,002
To whoever took the "L"
from the Motor Pool sign...

269
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,755
ha ha, we are
all very amused.

270
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,674
Excuse me?
I need to, uh, report in?

271
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,009
Yes, Mr. Thatch?

272
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,635
Aah!
Uh, it's you!

273
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,596
Blondie, I got a bone
to pick with you.

274
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,638
Hold that thought.

275
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,223
What is it this time, Cookie?

276
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,894
You done stuffed my wagon full
to bustin' with non-essentials.

277
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:16,356
Look at all this...
cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.

278
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,651
What in the cockadoodle
is cilantro?

279
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,028
And what is this?

280
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,154
That would be lettuce.

281
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,323
Lettuce? Lettuce?!

282
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,148
It's a vegetable, Cookie.

283
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,993
The men need
the four basic food groups.

284
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,078
I got your
four basic food groups!

285
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,122
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!

286
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,667
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.

287
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,921
Attention.
All hands to the launch bay.

288
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,006
Final loading in progress.

289
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,393
Hey, Junior.

290
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,311
If you're lookin'
for the pony rides...

291
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,896
they're back there.

292
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,231
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

293
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,858
You dropped
your dy-dy-dy-dynamite.

294
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,943
Heh heh heh.

295
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,570
What else have you,
uh, got in there?

296
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:08,534
Oh, eh, gunpowder,
nitroglycerin, notepads...

297
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,912
fuses, wicks, glue, and...

298
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,706
paper clips.
Big ones.

299
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,625
You know, just,
uh, office supplies.

300
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,960
Milo! Where you been?

301
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,253
I want you to meet
Commander Rourke.

302
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,588
He led the Iceland team
that brought the Journal back.

303
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,090
Milo Thatch.

304
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,592
Pleasure to meet the grandson
of old Thaddeus.

305
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,303
I see you got that journal.
Nice pictures, but...

306
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,305
I prefer a good western myself.

307
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,432
Pretty impressive, eh?

308
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,935
Boy, when you settle a bet,
y-you settle a bet.

309
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,603
Well, your granddad
always believed...

310
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,981
you couldn't put a price
on the pursuit of knowledge.

311
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,483
Well, uh, believe me
this'll be small change...

312
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,609
compared to the value
of what we're gonna...

313
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,736
learn on this trip.

314
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,113
Yes, this should be
enriching for all of us.

315
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,865
Attention,
all personnel.

316
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,951
Launch will commence
in 15 minutes.

317
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,369
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.

318
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,370
It's time.

319
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,623
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!

320
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,958
Rig ship for dive!

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,084
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.

322
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,045
Lieutenant, take her down.

323
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,629
Diving officer,
submerge the ship.

324
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,506
Make the depth 1-5-0 feet.

325
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,508
Make the depth 1-5-0 feet.

326
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,094
Dive, dive!
Five degrees down bubble.

327
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,804
Take us down.

328
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,139
Attention.

329
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,558
Tonight's supper
will be baked beans.

330
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,352
Musical program to follow.

331
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,063
Who wrote this?

332
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,152
Aah!

333
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,812
You have disturbed the dirt.

334
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,158
- Uh, pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!

335
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,536
Dirt from around the globe,
spanning the centuries!

336
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,162
What have you done?

337
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,415
England must never
merge with France!

338
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,750
- What's it doin' in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.

339
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,210
Who are you?
Who sent you? Speak up!

340
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,546
- Me? I'm, uh...
- Bah! I will know soon enough.

341
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:26,922
Hey, hey, hey!
Let go!

342
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,007
Do not be such a crybaby.
Hold still.

343
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,260
Aha! There you are.

344
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,887
Now tell me your story,
my little friend.

345
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,931
Parchment fiber from
the Nile circa 500 B. C.

346
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,516
Lead pencil, number 2.
Paint flecks...

347
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,892
of a type used
in government buildings.

348
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,144
You have a cat,
short-haired Persian...

349
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,187
two years old,
third in a litter of seven.

350
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,356
There are all
the microscopic fingerprints...

351
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,816
of the mapmaker.

352
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,944
And linguist.

353
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,852
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!

354
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,157
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!

355
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,826
Uh-oh. Sat in the dirt,
didn't you?

356
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:57,458
Moliere, now what
have I told you...

357
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,038
about playing nice
with the other kids?

358
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,373
Get back. I've got soap,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

359
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,459
Back, foul creature!

360
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,044
Back to the pit
from which you came!

361
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,379
The name's Sweet.

362
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,089
Joshua Sweet.
Medical officer.

363
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:10,340
Yeah, Milo Thatch.

364
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,259
Milo Thatch.
You're my 3:00.

365
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,802
Well, no time like the present.

366
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,345
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?

367
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,680
The catalog says
that this little beauty...

368
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,557
can saw through a femur
in 28 seconds.

369
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm bettin' I can
cut that time in half.

370
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,643
Now, stick out your
tongue and say "ahh."

371
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,062
Oh, no, really,
I have a... Aah.

372
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,396
So, where you from?

373
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,773
Really? I have
family up that way.

374
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,649
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?

375
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,778
Me? I hate fishing.
I hate fish.

376
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,779
Hate the taste,
hate the smell...

377
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,238
and hate all them
little bones.

378
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,240
Here, I'm gonna need you
to fill these up.

379
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,617
With what?

380
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,411
Will Milo Thatch
please report to the bridge?

381
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,412
Thank you.

382
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,082
I mean, uh, uh,
nice meeting you.

383
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,333
Uh-huh. Nice meeting you, too.

384
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,757
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"

385
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,467
And he says to me... Oh.

386
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,178
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.

387
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,597
Sir, we're approaching
coordinates.

388
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,641
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...

389
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,309
All right,
let's have a look around.

390
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,395
Aye, sir.
Set course to 2-4-0.

391
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,355
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

392
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,232
Come right 2-4-0.

393
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,360
Welcome to the bridge,
Mr. Thatch.

394
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:12,486
OK, everybody...

395
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,238
I want you
to give Mr. Thatch...

396
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,739
your undivided attention.

397
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,118
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me OK?

398
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,207
Heh, OK, uh, how...
how 'bout some slides?

399
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,001
The... the first slide is
a depiction of a creature.

400
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,712
A creature so frightening...

401
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,505
that sailors were said
to be driven mad...

402
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,382
by the mere sight of it.

403
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:35,342
Hubba, hubba.

404
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,845
Uh, I'm sorry.
That's... wrong.

405
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,722
Geez,
I used to take lunch money...

406
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,889
from guys like this.

407
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,391
Anyway, this, uh... OK.

408
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,310
This is an illustration
of the Leviathan...

409
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,813
the creature guarding
the entrance to Atlantis.

410
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,304
With something like that...

411
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,692
I would have white wine,
I think.

412
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:53,318
It's a mythical sea serpent.

413
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,820
He's described
in the Book of Job.

414
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,988
The... the Bible says...

415
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,614
"Out of his mouth
go burning lights...

416
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,366
sparks of fire shoot out."

417
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,493
But more likely it's
a carving or a sculpture...

418
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,536
to frighten
the superstitious.

419
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,080
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?

420
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,488
When do we dig?

421
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,750
Actually, we don't have to dig.

422
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,157
You see, according
to the Journal...

423
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,211
the path to Atlantis
will take us down a tunnel...

424
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,547
at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve...

425
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,215
into an air pocket
right here...

426
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,592
where we'll find
the remnants...

427
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,719
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to Atlantis.

428
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,345
Kind of like the grease trap
in your sink.

429
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,973
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.

430
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,266
Hard to believe
he's still single.

431
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,935
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.

432
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,771
Captain, you'd better
come look at this, sir.

433
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,272
OK, class dismissed.

434
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,899
Give me exterior lights.

435
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,241
Look at that.

436
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,369
There are ships here
from every era.

437
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,770
Commander, I think
you should hear this.

438
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:12,314
"Predeshtem logtu
nug... nah geb."

439
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,379
Commander?
Commander?

440
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,402
"Enter the lair
of the Leviathan."

441
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,403
Commander?

442
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,530
"There you will find the path
to the gateway."

443
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,572
Commander?

444
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,657
Yes, Mrs. Packard.
What is it?

445
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,742
I'm picking up something
on the hydrophone...

446
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,120
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.

447
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,131
What is it?
A pod of whales?

448
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,924
Uh-uh. Bigger.

449
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:39,925
It sounds metallic.

450
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,989
Could be an echo off
one of the rocks.

451
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,012
Do you want to do my job?
Be my guest.

452
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,973
Is it just me,
or is that getting louder?

453
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,313
Well, whatever it was,
it's gone now.

454
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,149
Helmsman!
Bring us about.

455
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,608
Tighten our search
pattern and slow us to...

456
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:01,697
Out of the way!

457
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:10,956
Tell Cookie
to melt the butter...

458
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:11,957
and break out the bibs.

459
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,293
I want this lobster served up
on a silver platter.

460
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,879
Load the torpedo bays!
Subpod crews, battle stations!

461
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,922
Battle stations!

462
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,467
Steady, boys.

463
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,509
Don't panic.

464
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,268
Jiminy Christmas!
It's a machine!

465
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,232
Wait, wait! Uhh!

466
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,318
Launch subpods!

467
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,861
Subpods away!

468
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,284
Fire!

469
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,207
We're free.
All ahead full.

470
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,171
Fire torpedoes!

471
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,422
Fire torpedoes!

472
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,436
Get me the bridge!

473
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,563
Sir, it's
engineering on four.

474
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,690
Rourke!
We took a big hit down here...

475
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,317
and we're taking on
water fast.

476
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,361
I don't want to be around
when it hits the boilers.

477
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:23,612
How much time do we have?

478
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,364
20 minutes,
if the bulkhead holds.

479
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:27,700
You better make that five.

480
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,326
You heard the lady.
Let's move!

481
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,869
Move!
Where? Move where?

482
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,037
Packard, sound the alarm!

483
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,372
He took his suitcase?

484
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:35,249
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's comin' back.

485
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,084
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.

486
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,711
No, no, I'll call you.

487
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,132
All hands,
abandon ship.

488
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,968
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!

489
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,804
Come on! Everybody grab
a seat and buckle in.

490
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,764
Lieutenant,
get us out of here!

491
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:54,935
Lieutenant!

492
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,186
I'm working on it!

493
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:06,238
Hang on.

494
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,001
Where to, Mr. Thatch?

495
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,545
We're looking for a big
crevice of some kind.

496
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,744
There! Up ahead.

497
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,007
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.

498
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,259
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.

499
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,635
Right behind you!

500
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,514
Sacre bleu!

501
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,016
We're getting killed
out here!

502
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,486
Look out!

503
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,240
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.

504
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,326
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!

505
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,802
Seven hours ago,
we started this expedition...

506
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,139
with 200 of the finest
men and women I've ever known.

507
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,433
We're all that's left.

508
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,643
I won't sugar-coat it,
gentlemen.

509
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,812
We have a crisis on our hands.

510
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,022
But we've been up this
particular creek before...

511
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,192
and we've always come through,
paddle or no paddle.

512
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,570
I see no reason
to change that policy now.

513
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,573
From here on in,
everyone pulls double duty.

514
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,701
Everyone drives,
everyone works.

515
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,995
Looks like all our chances
for survival...

516
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,246
rest with you, Mr. Thatch.

517
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,373
You and that little book.

518
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,584
We're all gonna die.

519
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,033
OK, people.
Saddle up.

520
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,088
Lieutenant, I want this convoy
moving five minutes ago.

521
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,298
Moliere, you're on point.

522
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,383
No, Vinney,
Audrey's taking the oiler.

523
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,801
You know the rules.
I want you 50 yards...

524
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,543
behind that truck at all times.

525
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,596
And, Packard,
put out that cigarette.

526
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:47,066
Are you sure you're checked
out on this class of vehicle?

527
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,276
- Uhh...
- Can you drive a truck?

528
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,738
Pfft! Heh heh.
Of course I can drive a truck.

529
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,239
I mean, sure,
you got your steering...

530
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,064
and your gas
and your brake...

531
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:01,955
and, of course, this metal,
uh, looking... thing.

532
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,999
OK, so it was a bumper car
at Coney Island...

533
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,459
but it's the same
basic principle!

534
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,926
Come on!

535
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,094
Sorry abou...
sorry about that.

536
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,553
Come on, civilian!

537
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,596
Oof.

538
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,486
Ahh.

539
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,863
You didn't just
drink that, did you?

540
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,905
- Mm-hmm.
- That's not good.

541
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,156
That's nitroglycerin.

542
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,366
Don't move.

543
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,118
Eh, don't breathe.

544
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,288
Don't do anything,
except pray maybe.

545
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,330
- Boom!
- Aah!

546
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,021
Yeah.

547
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,244
Good night! Will you
look at the size of this!

548
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:06,622
It's gotta be half a mile
high at least.

549
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,207
It... it must have
taken hundred...

550
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,085
no, pfft, thousands of years
to carve this thing.

551
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,466
Hey, look,
I made a bridge.

552
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,259
It only took me,
like, what?

553
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,553
10 seconds, 11, tops.

554
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,990
Looks like we have
a little roadblock.

555
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,575
Vinny,
what do you think?

556
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:47,037
I could unroadblock that
if I had about 200 of these.

557
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,499
Problem is I only
got about... 10.

558
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,584
Plus, you know,
five of my own...

559
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,170
and a couple of cherry bombs...

560
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,131
a road flare.

561
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,259
Hey, too bad we don't have
some nitroglycerin, eh, Milo?

562
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,096
Looks like we're
gonna have to dig.

563
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,474
It will be my pleasure.

564
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,982
Aah!

565
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,280
Oh! Stupid!

566
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,823
You are stupid!

567
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,107
I don't understand it.

568
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,119
I just tuned this thing
up this morning.

569
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,120
Um...

570
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,955
It looks like
the rotor's shot!

571
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,165
I'm gonna have
to pull a spare...

572
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,374
from one
of the trucks.

573
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,126
- Can l...
- No toques nada!

574
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,252
I'll be right back.

575
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,179
She lives!

576
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,056
Hey, what'd you do?

577
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,224
Well, you know,
the boiler in this baby...

578
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,602
is a Humac model P54/813.

579
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,730
Now we got the 814
back at the museum.

580
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,066
The heating cores
on the whole Humac line...

581
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,151
have always been a little,
you know, temperamental...

582
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,362
so sometimes you gotta... boom!

583
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,488
Persuade 'em a little.

584
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,114
Yeah, yeah,
thank you very much.

585
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,199
Shut up.

586
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,119
Two for flinching.

587
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,162
Ooh!

588
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:19,046
This is it.
It's gotta be.

589
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,507
All right,
we'll make camp here.

590
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,549
Why is it glowing?

591
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,677
Pah! It is a natural
phosphorescence.

592
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:29,139
That thing is going to keep me
up all night, I know it.

593
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,641
Come and get it!

594
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,019
For the appetizer,
Caesar salad...

595
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,063
escargot...

596
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,940
and your Oriental
spring rolls.

597
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,983
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.

598
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,235
Knock yourself out.

599
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,862
There you go, Milo.

600
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,656
Put some meat
on them bones.

601
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:48,659
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.

602
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,828
You like it?
Well, have some more.

603
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,705
You're so skinny,
if you turned sideways...

604
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,623
and stuck out your tongue
you'd look like a zipper.

605
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,917
You know, we've been
pretty tough on the kid.

606
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,252
What do you say
we cut him some slack?

607
00:31:58,304 --> 00:31:59,795
Yeah, you're right.

608
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,964
Hey, Milo! Why don't
you come sit with us?

609
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,216
Really? You don't mind?

610
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,592
Nah. Park it here.

611
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,094
Gee, this is great.

612
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,095
I mean, you know...

613
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,763
it's an honor to be
included in your...

614
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:17,396
- Mole!
- Ah, forgive me.

615
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,440
I could not resist.

616
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,567
Hey, Milo, don't you ever
close that book?

617
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,569
Yeah, you must've read it
a dozen times by now.

618
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,655
I know, but this... this
doesn't make any sense.

619
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,615
See, in this passage
here, the shepherd...

620
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,221
seems to be leading
up to something.

621
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:31,785
He calls it
the heart of Atlantis.

622
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,496
It could be the power source
the legends refer to.

623
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,790
But then it just...
it cuts off.

624
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,292
It's almost like
there's a missing page.

625
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,044
Kid, relax.

626
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,420
We don't get paid overtime.

627
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:42,796
I know, I know.

628
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,715
Sometimes I get
a little carried away.

629
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,800
But, hey, you know, that's what
this is all about, right?

630
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:50,637
I mean, discovery,
teamwork, adventure.

631
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,806
Unless, maybe...

632
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:55,934
you're just in it
for the money.

633
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,019
- Money.
- Money.

634
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:58,020
- Money.
- Money.

635
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,928
I'm gonna say...
money.

636
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,525
Well, I guess I set
myself up for that one.

637
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,778
What, is something
wrong with your neck?

638
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,905
Oh, yeah, I must've
hurt it when...

639
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:08,947
Aah! Ow!

640
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,115
Better?

641
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,700
Yeah!

642
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,827
Hey, how'd you learn
how to do that?

643
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,871
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.

644
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,081
Born and raised with 'em.

645
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,165
My father was an army medic.

646
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,292
He settled down
in the Kansas Territory...

647
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,335
after he met my mother.

648
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:22,284
No kidding.

649
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,463
Nope. I got a sheepskin
from Howard U.

650
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,632
And a bearskin
from old Iron Cloud.

651
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,634
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.

652
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,136
One day I'm studying gross
anatomy in the classroom...

653
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:33,680
the next I'm sewing up
Rough Riders on San Juan Hill.

654
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,099
Main course.

655
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,850
I couldn't eat another bite.

656
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:37,893
I'm watching
my weight.

657
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,019
Ha ha ha, don't you worry.

658
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,855
It'll keep
and keep and keep.

659
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,359
Thank God I lost my sense
of taste years ago.

660
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,408
Aren't you going
to pitch up your tent?

661
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,201
Uh, I did.

662
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,496
I guess I'm still
a little rusty at this.

663
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,112
I haven't
gone camping since...

664
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,749
well, the last time
my grandpa took me.

665
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,835
I never got to meet
your grandfather.

666
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:03,836
What was he like?

667
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,327
Where do you start?

668
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,329
He was like a father
to me, really.

669
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,508
My parents died
when I was a little kid...

670
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,385
and he took me in.

671
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,431
What?

672
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,161
Well, I was
just thinkin'.

673
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,851
One time, when I was eight,

674
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,269
we were hiking along
this stream...

675
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,689
and I saw something
shining in the water.

676
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:25,514
It was a genuine arrowhead.

677
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,152
Well, you'd think I'd found
a lost civilization...

678
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,070
the way Grandpa
carried on about it.

679
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,113
It wasn't
until I was older...

680
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,531
that I realized
that the arrowhead...

681
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:33,741
was just
some compressed shale...

682
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,325
mixed with zinc pyrite
that had fractured...

683
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,785
into an isosceletic
triangulate.

684
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,872
That is so cute!

685
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,541
Say, Audrey,
uh, no... no offense...

686
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,752
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic...

687
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,587
of a multimillion dollar
expedition?

688
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,589
Well, I took this job
when my dad retired.

689
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,631
But the funny thing was...

690
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,550
he always
wanted sons, right?

691
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,427
One to run his machine
shop and the other...

692
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,429
to be middleweight
boxing champion.

693
00:34:55,471 --> 00:34:57,806
But he got my sister
and me instead.

694
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,559
So, what... what happened
to your sister?

695
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,228
She's 24 and 0, with a shot
at the title next month.

696
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,397
Anyway, I'm saving up...

697
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,441
so my Papí and I
can open another shop.

698
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,443
Forget your jammies,
Mrs. Packard?

699
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,236
I sleep in the nude.

700
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:12,654
You're gonna
want a pair of these.

701
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,573
She sleepwalks.

702
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,367
Well, as far as me goes...

703
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,369
I just like
to blow things up.

704
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,411
Come on, Vinny...

705
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,996
tell the kid the truth.

706
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,583
My family owned
a flower shop.

707
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,627
We would sell roses...

708
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:30,089
carnations, baby's breath,
you name it.

709
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,590
One day, I'm making...

710
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:35,469
about three dozen corsages
for this prom.

711
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,721
You know, the one
they put on their wrist.

712
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,432
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"

713
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,976
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"

714
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,770
It's a nightmare.

715
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:48,357
Anyway, I guess there
was this leak next door...

716
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,275
of gas or what. Boom!

717
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,777
No more Chinese laundry.

718
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,279
Blew me right through
the front window.

719
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,949
It was like a sign from God.

720
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,326
I found myself that boom.

721
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,457
What's Mole's story?

722
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,396
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.

723
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,294
Audrey, don't tell him.
You shouldn't have...

724
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,505
told me, but you did.
And now I'm telling you...

725
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:12,965
you don't wanna know.

726
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,706
The redhead's got a gun.

727
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,888
Ahh, ooh.

728
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,557
Ah! Aah!

729
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,933
Holy... Whoa!

730
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:12,524
Fire.

731
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,695
Fire!

732
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,821
Fire!

733
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,324
Fire!

734
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,367
Fire!

735
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,701
I'm gonna kill him.

736
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,453
Thatch, go back to bed.

737
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,374
Get some water
on that fire!

738
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,416
No time!

739
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,834
Get us into those caves!

740
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,002
Move it!
Move it! Move it!

741
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:39,385
Ya-ha!
Gertie, pull!

742
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,724
Milo, jump!
Right now!

743
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,149
Aah! Aah!

744
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,415
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

745
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,716
Whoa! Whoa!

746
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,218
Aah!

747
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:24,680
Aah!

748
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,651
All right, who's not dead?
Sound off.

749
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,363
Danged
lightnin' bugs...

750
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,198
done bit me
on my sit-upon.

751
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,826
Somebody's gonna have to
suck out that poison.

752
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,828
Now don't everybody
jump up at once.

753
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,873
Audrey,
give me a damage report.

754
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:52,875
Not as bad as it
could have been.

755
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,752
We totalled
rigs two and seven...

756
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,962
but the digger looks
like it'll still run.

757
00:38:57,755 --> 00:39:00,007
Lucky for us we landed
in something soft.

758
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,885
Pumice ash.
We are standing...

759
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,845
at the base
of a dormant volcano.

760
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,475
It just keeps going.

761
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,226
Maybe that's
our ticket outta here.

762
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,270
Maybe not.

763
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:17,649
The magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano...

764
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,474
effectively blocking the exit.

765
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:22,321
I got the same problem
with sauerkraut.

766
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,906
Hold on. Back up.

767
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,657
Are you sayin'
this whole volcano...

768
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,034
can blow at any time?

769
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:28,327
No, no, no, no.

770
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,329
That would take
an explosive force...

771
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:32,373
of great magnitude.

772
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,004
Maybe I should
do this later, huh?

773
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,173
If we could blow the top
off of that thing,

774
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,509
we'd have a straight
shot to the surface.

775
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,010
Mr. Thatch,
what do you think?

776
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,512
Mr. Thatch?

777
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,722
Thatch?

778
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:38,689
Hey, wait!

779
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:45,571
Who... who are you?
Where are you going?

780
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,572
Come back!

781
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,040
Hey, wait a minute!

782
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,042
Who are you?

783
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,112
Sweet mother
of Jefferson Davis!

784
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,614
It's beautiful.

785
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,991
Milo, I gotta
hand it to you.

786
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,159
You really came through.

787
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,164
Uh, I take that back.

788
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,792
Holy cats!
Who are these guys?

789
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,711
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!

790
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:44,963
I seen this back
in the Dakota.

791
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,758
They can smell fear
just by looking at ya.

792
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,051
So keep quiet.

793
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,143
I think it's
talking to you.

794
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,463
Ita, sum amice viator.

795
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,215
Dices linguam Romae.

796
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:30,092
Parlez-vous francais?

797
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:31,176
Oui, monsieur!

798
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,469
They speak
my language!

799
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:34,096
Pardon,
mademoiselle?

800
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:37,391
Ah, voulez-vous...

801
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:38,892
Ooh, I like her.

802
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,602
Hmm! 'Bout time
someone hit him.

803
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:41,854
I'm just sorry
it wasn't me.

804
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,679
Buenos dias.
Guten tag!

805
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:46,900
How do they know
all these languages?

806
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,445
Their language must be
based on a root dialect.

807
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,852
It's just like
the Tower of Babel.

808
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,615
Well, maybe English
is in there somewhere.

809
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,577
We are explorers
from the surface world.

810
00:42:56,629 --> 00:42:58,704
We come in peace.

811
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:02,291
Welcome to the city
of Atlantis.

812
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,752
Come. You must speak
with my father now.

813
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:06,879
Squad "B," head back to
the shaft...

814
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,921
and salvage what you can.

815
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:08,922
Yes, sir!

816
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,278
We'll rendezvous
in 24 hours.

817
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,592
Let's move it.
You heard him.

818
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,597
I'm so excited!

819
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,610
Now, what's
really amazing is that...

820
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:30,944
if you deconstructed
Latin, you overlaid it...

821
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:31,893
with a little Sumerian...

822
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,489
throw in a dash
of Thessalonian...

823
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,449
you'd be getting close to their
basic grammatical structure.

824
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:36,898
Or at least you'd be
in the same ballpark...

825
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,163
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.

826
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:44,625
Commander, there were not
supposed to be people down here.

827
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:46,126
This changes everything.

828
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,379
This changes nothing.

829
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,255
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!

830
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:50,315
Your Majesty?

831
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,400
On behalf of my crew...

832
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:54,361
may I say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city.

833
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:55,988
Ahem. Uh, excuse me?
Commander?

834
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,573
You presume much...

835
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,491
to think you are
welcome here.

836
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:02,494
Oh, sir, we have come
a long way looking for...

837
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:04,621
I know what you seek...

838
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,999
and you will not
find it here.

839
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,501
Your journey has been in vain.

840
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,671
But we are peaceful explorers,
men of science.

841
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:16,675
Heh heh heh.
And yet you bring weapons.

842
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:21,346
Our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter.

843
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:26,351
Some obstacles cannot be removed
with a mere show of force.

844
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,187
Return to your people.

845
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:31,398
You must leave Atlantis at once.

846
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,525
Oh, Your Majesty,
be reasonable.

847
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,319
Sir...
Not now, son.

848
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:38,322
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.

849
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:43,911
May I respectfully request
that we stay one night, sir?

850
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:46,747
That would give us
time to rest, resupply...

851
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:49,500
and be ready to travel
by morning.

852
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:54,546
Hmm. Very well.
One night. That is all.

853
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:56,799
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.

854
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,600
Mmm. Your heart
has softened, Kida.

855
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,102
A thousand years ago...

856
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,312
you would have
slain them on sight.

857
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:12,554
A thousand years ago,
the streets were lit...

858
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,567
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food...

859
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:16,944
at the edge
of a crumbling city!

860
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,570
The people are content.

861
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,364
They do not
know any better!

862
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:23,283
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.

863
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,911
The kings of our past
would weep...

864
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,830
if they could see
how far we have fallen.

865
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,499
- Kida.
- Lf these outsiders...

866
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,210
can unlock the secrets
of our past...

867
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:35,462
perhaps we can
save our future.

868
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,090
What they have to teach us...

869
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,551
we have already learned.

870
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:42,918
Our way of life is dying.

871
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,681
Our way of life
is preserved.

872
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:49,810
Mmm. Kida, when you
take the throne...

873
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:51,603
you will understand.

874
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:55,858
So, how'd it go?

875
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,944
Well, the King and his daughter
don't exactly see eye to eye.

876
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,321
She seems to like us OK,
but the King...

877
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:02,698
I don't know, I think
he's hiding somethin'.

878
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,410
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

879
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:08,203
Someone needs to
talk to that girl.

880
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,204
I will go!

881
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,789
Someone with good people skills.

882
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,832
I will do it!

883
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,042
Someone who won't
scare her away.

884
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,043
I volunteer!

885
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,086
Someone who can
speak the language.

886
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,568
For the good
of the mission, I will go!

887
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,008
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.

888
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:25,596
Go get 'em, tiger.

889
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,937
OK, Milo, don't take
no for an answer.

890
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,314
"Look, I have
some questions for you...

891
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:37,107
and I'm not leaving this city
until they're answered!"

892
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,234
Yeah, that's it.
That's good, that's good.

893
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,992
I have some
questions for you...

894
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,494
and you are not
leaving this city...

895
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:49,870
until they are answered.

896
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,622
Yeah, well, l... OK.

897
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,165
Shh!
Come with me.

898
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,842
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.

899
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,595
You are a scholar, are you not?

900
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,180
Judging from your
diminished physique...

901
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,348
and large forehead...

902
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,849
you are suited for nothing else.

903
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,559
What is your
country of origin?

904
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,186
When did the flood
waters recede?

905
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,354
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.

906
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:16,438
I got a few questions
for you, too.

907
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,731
So let's do this, OK?

908
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:18,816
You ask one,
then I'll ask one...

909
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:19,858
then you, then me, then...

910
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,485
Well, you get it.

911
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,530
Very well.
What is your first question?

912
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,782
Well, OK, uh,
how did you get here?

913
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,242
Well, I mean,
not you personally...

914
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:29,660
but your... your culture.

915
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,162
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?

916
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:35,249
It is said that the gods became
jealous of Atlantis.

917
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,252
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.

918
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:41,255
All I can remember
is the sky going dark...

919
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:44,717
and people shouting
and running.

920
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:48,178
Then, a bright light,
like a star...

921
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,097
floating above the city.

922
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:53,225
My father said it called
my mother to it.

923
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,436
I never saw her again.

924
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,708
I'm sorry. If it...
if it's any consolation...

925
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,940
I-I know how you feel,
because I lost my...

926
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:03,068
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Whoa, back up!

927
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,403
Wh... what... what are
you telling me...

928
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:06,071
that you remember
because you were there?

929
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,562
No, that... that's impossible...

930
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,241
because, I mean,
that would make you...

931
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:13,412
you know,
8,500-8,800 years old.

932
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:14,455
Yes.

933
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:18,876
Oh, well, hey, uh, pfft!
Lookin' good.

934
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,128
Just, uh, ahem...

935
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,588
You got another question for me?

936
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,924
Yes. How is it you found
your way to this place?

937
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,760
Well, I'll tell you,
it wasn't easy.

938
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,262
If it weren't for this book,
we never would have made it.

939
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,222
OK, second question.

940
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:33,807
Legend has it
that your people possessed...

941
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,517
a power source of some kind
that enabled them...

942
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,311
You mean you can
understand this?

943
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:38,729
Yes, I'm a linguist.

944
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:40,189
That's what I do,
that's my job.

945
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,357
Now, getting back
to my question...

946
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,765
This, right here,
you can read this?

947
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,362
Yes, yes, I can read Atlantean,
just like you.

948
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,532
You can't, can you?

949
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:51,784
No one can.

950
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:53,285
Such knowledge
has been lost to us...

951
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,745
since the time
of the Mehbelmok.

952
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:56,538
Oh, the Great Flood.

953
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,040
Show me.

954
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,124
OK, uh...

955
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,922
"Follow the narrow passage
for another league.

956
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,465
There you will find
the fifth marker."

957
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:09,968
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?

958
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,762
Boorish, provincial...

959
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:13,305
and you speak it
through your nose.

960
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:14,890
Yeah, gotta work
on that.

961
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:16,892
Here, let me
show you something.

962
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,816
What? It looks like
some sort of vehicle.

963
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,984
Yes. But no matter
what I try...

964
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,194
it will not respond.

965
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:29,405
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.

966
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:30,489
OK, let's see
what we got here.

967
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,743
OK. "Place crystal into slot."

968
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,203
Yes, yes,
I have done that!

969
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,872
"Gently place your hand
on the inscription pad."

970
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:40,165
- Yes!
- OK, did you...

971
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,166
turn the crystal
one-quarter turn back?

972
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,157
Yes. Yes!

973
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,711
While your hand was
on the inscription pad?

974
00:50:43,763 --> 00:50:45,587
Ye... No.

975
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:48,340
Ah, well, see, there's
your problem right there.

976
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,508
That's an easy thing
to miss.

977
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,634
You know, you deserve credit...

978
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:53,053
for even... even
gettin' this far.

979
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,222
OK, uh, give it a try.

980
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,899
Yeah, you got
that right.

981
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:08,485
Oh, th... this is great!
With this thing...

982
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:11,030
I could see the whole city
in no time at all.

983
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,490
Wonder how fast it goes.

984
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,001
So, who's hungry?

985
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,047
By the way, we were never
properly introduced.

986
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,214
My name's Milo.

987
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,425
My name is Kidagakash.

988
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,427
Ki-Ki-Kidamaschnaga.

989
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,721
Uh, hey,
you got a nickname?

990
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,546
Kida.

991
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,726
OK, Kida.
I can remember that.

992
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:44,938
Wow.

993
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,958
What is wrong?

994
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,712
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
got something in my eye.

995
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,090
You know, my grandpa
used to tell me stories...

996
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,967
about this place
as far back as I can remember.

997
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,553
I just wish he could be
standing here with me.

998
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:32,986
Ah! Ah! Ee-yah!

999
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,740
Tell me more about
your companions.

1000
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,659
Your physician,
he is called Cookie?

1001
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:40,536
No, that's Sweet.
What is?

1002
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:41,578
The doctor.
He's Sweet.

1003
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,038
Oh, he is kindly.

1004
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,665
No, no, no, that...
that's his name.

1005
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:46,114
His name is Kindly?

1006
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,377
No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.

1007
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:52,339
So all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly?

1008
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,800
No. Well,
I-I'm sure some are.

1009
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,177
Ours is, but that's
not a requirement.

1010
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,220
You're missing the point.

1011
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,471
You are confusing me.

1012
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:02,433
Wow. Look at all
those tattoos.

1013
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,268
Shoot. That
ain't nothin'.

1014
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,477
Look here what I got.

1015
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,439
All 38 United States.

1016
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,274
Watch me make
Rhode Island dance.

1017
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:12,026
Go on, baby,
dance. Dance.

1018
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,528
There you go.

1019
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:29,543
Cookies are sweet,
but yours is not.

1020
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,880
Sweet is kindly,
but that is not his name.

1021
00:53:32,932 --> 00:53:36,175
Audrey is sweet,
but she is not your doctor.

1022
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:40,637
And the little digging
animal called Mole...

1023
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:41,847
he is your pet?

1024
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:42,890
Close enough.

1025
00:53:45,476 --> 00:53:47,519
Oh, don't forget
to eat the head.

1026
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,645
That's where all
the nutrients are.

1027
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:10,209
You know, Kida...

1028
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,377
the most we ever hoped
to find...

1029
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,962
was some crumbling buildings,
maybe some broken pottery.

1030
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:18,008
Instead, we find a living,
thriving society.

1031
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,760
Heh heh. These guys
are kinda cute

1032
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:21,011
when they're not, you know...

1033
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:23,722
formed into a fiery
column of death.

1034
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:25,057
We are not thriving.

1035
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,725
True, our people live...

1036
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,602
but our culture is dying.

1037
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:31,855
We are like a stone
the ocean beats against.

1038
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,107
With each passing year...

1039
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:35,067
a little more of us
is worn away.

1040
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:37,361
I wish there was
something I could do.

1041
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:41,031
I have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help.

1042
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,574
There is a mural here...

1043
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,952
with writing
all around the pictures.

1044
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,829
Yeah, well, you came
to the right guy.

1045
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,122
OK, let me see.

1046
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,249
Let's start with
this column right here.

1047
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,336
Uh, well, this,
uh, uh, Kida?

1048
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:58,132
Uh, heh,
what are you doin'?

1049
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,883
You do swim,
do you not?

1050
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:01,260
Oh, I swim pretty girl.

1051
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,511
Pr-pretty good!
Pretty good.

1052
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,595
Sw... Good, swim good.

1053
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,347
Pretty good.
I swim pretty good.

1054
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,851
Good. It is a fair distance
to where we are going.

1055
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:11,729
Hey, you are talkin'
to the belly flop champ...

1056
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,480
at Camp Runamuck.
Oof!

1057
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:17,484
Come on, we're...
we're wasting time.

1058
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,573
Why don't you
lead the way...

1059
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:25,492
because I have
no idea where we're going.

1060
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,848
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...

1061
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,641
Good. Follow me.

1062
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,158
This is amazing!

1063
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,743
A complete history
of Atlantis!

1064
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:09,787
It's just like
Plato described it.

1065
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:12,956
Well, he was off
on a few details, but...

1066
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,124
The light I saw.

1067
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,210
The star in the middle
of the city.

1068
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,587
What does the writing
say about that?

1069
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:19,963
I don't know yet.

1070
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,882
But we're gonna find out.

1071
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:22,925
Come on.

1072
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:04,216
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?

1073
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,342
It's the heart of Atlantis!

1074
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,386
That's what the shepherd
w-was talking about.

1075
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:09,471
It wasn't a star, it was...
it was some kind of crystal...

1076
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:12,016
uh, like these!
Don't you get it?

1077
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,727
The power source
I've been looking for...

1078
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,270
the bright light you remember...

1079
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,480
- they're the same thing!
- That cannot be.

1080
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,065
It's what's keeping
all these things...

1081
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:22,735
you, all
of Atlantis alive.

1082
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,319
Then where is it now?

1083
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,320
I don't know,
I don't know.

1084
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:26,321
You'd think something
this important...

1085
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:27,781
would have been
in the Journal, but...

1086
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:31,035
Unless...
The missing page.

1087
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:37,875
You have a nice swim?

1088
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:43,297
Hey, guys, what's going on?

1089
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,008
What's... what's with
all the guns?

1090
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,635
Guys?

1091
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,056
I am such an idiot.

1092
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:53,807
This is just another
treasure hunt for you.

1093
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,309
You're after the crystal.

1094
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:57,478
Oh, you mean this?

1095
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,229
The heart of Atlantis.

1096
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,315
Yeah. About that...

1097
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:03,192
I would've told you sooner...

1098
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,152
but it was strictly
on a need-to-know basis...

1099
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,404
and, well, now you know.

1100
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,281
I had to be sure
you were one of us.

1101
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:11,325
Welcome to the club, son.

1102
00:58:11,377 --> 00:58:13,327
I'm no mercenary.

1103
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:16,705
Whoa!

1104
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,672
Uhh!

1105
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:27,049
Mercenary?

1106
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:30,344
I prefer the term
"adventure capitalist."

1107
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:32,179
Besides, you're the one
who got us here.

1108
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:33,764
You led us right
to the treasure chest.

1109
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,557
You don't know what
you're tampering with, Rourke.

1110
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,810
What's to know?
It's big. It's shiny.

1111
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:39,228
It's going to make us
all rich.

1112
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:40,646
You think it's
some kind of a diamond...

1113
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:41,980
I thought it was
some kind of a battery...

1114
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:43,315
but we're both wrong.

1115
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:44,983
It's their life force.

1116
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,111
That crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive.

1117
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,821
You take that away,
and they'll die.

1118
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,989
Well, that changes things.

1119
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:52,574
Helga, what do you think?

1120
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:55,160
Knowing that,
I'd double the price.

1121
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,912
I was thinking triple.

1122
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:59,331
Rourke, don't do this.

1123
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,793
Academics. You never want
to get your hands dirty.

1124
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,086
Think about it.

1125
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:06,338
If you gave back
every stolen artifact...

1126
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,548
from a museum...

1127
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,508
you'd be left
with an empty building.

1128
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,344
We're just providing
a necessary service...

1129
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,763
to the archeological
community.

1130
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:16,223
Not interested.

1131
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,684
I got to admit,
I'm disappointed.

1132
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:21,812
You're an idealist,
just like your grandfather.

1133
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:24,648
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.

1134
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,526
For once,
do the smart thing.

1135
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:32,322
I really hate it
when negotiations go sour.

1136
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,203
Let's try this again.

1137
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,335
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.

1138
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:48,756
Tell them to drop
their weapons... now!

1139
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,969
Spread out!
Search everywhere!

1140
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:56,638
You're not applying
yourself, son.

1141
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,848
There's got to be
something else.

1142
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,933
Well, there isn't.
It just says...

1143
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:02,728
"The heart of Atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king."

1144
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,438
Well, then maybe
Old King Cole here...

1145
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,398
can help us
fill in the blanks.

1146
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,566
How about it, chief?

1147
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,109
Where's
the crystal chamber?

1148
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:11,111
You will destroy yourselves.

1149
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:13,405
Maybe I'm not being clear.

1150
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:15,157
Ohh!

1151
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:19,661
Rourke, this was not
a part of the plan.

1152
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,121
Plan's changed, doc.

1153
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,748
I'd suggest
you put a bandage...

1154
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,832
on that bleeding heart
of yours.

1155
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,001
It doesn't suit a mercenary.

1156
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:29,630
Well, as usual,
diplomacy has failed us.

1157
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,465
Now I'm going
to count to 10...

1158
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:33,592
and you're going to tell me
where the crystal is.

1159
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,761
1...

1160
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:36,804
2...

1161
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,098
9...

1162
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,391
t...

1163
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:48,941
The heart of Atlantis...

1164
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,984
lies in the eyes of her king.

1165
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,986
This is it.
We're in.

1166
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:54,071
Rourke, for the last time...

1167
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,406
you've got to listen to me.

1168
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:56,949
You don't have
the slightest idea...

1169
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,367
what this power
is capable of.

1170
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:01,286
True, but I can think
of a few countries...

1171
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:04,289
who'd pay anything
to find out.

1172
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:08,669
Hurry. Get on.

1173
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:29,940
Jackpot.

1174
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:37,031
Ohh.

1175
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:42,494
The kings of our past.

1176
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,750
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.

1177
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,126
We got a schedule
to meet.

1178
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:56,925
Um...

1179
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,261
Kida...

1180
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:00,846
I'm sorry.

1181
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,194
Come on,
let's get this over with.

1182
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,320
I don't like this place.

1183
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:18,322
All right, Thatch,
what's next?

1184
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,491
OK, there's
a giant crystal...

1185
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,076
hovering 150 feet
above our heads...

1186
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,535
over a bottomless pit
of water.

1187
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,204
Doesn't anything
surprise you?

1188
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:26,705
The only thing
that surprises me...

1189
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,374
Mahtim.

1190
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:29,833
That thing's
not on the truck yet.

1191
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,293
Now move it!

1192
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:32,711
I don't know
how to move it.

1193
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,214
I don't even know
what's holding it up there.

1194
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:38,425
Ahh.

1195
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:44,515
Talk to me, Thatch.
What's happening?

1196
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,724
Look, all it says here...

1197
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:47,893
is that the crystal
is alive somehow.

1198
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,478
It... I don't know
how to explain it.

1199
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,730
It's their deity.
It's their power source.

1200
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,691
Speak English,
professor.

1201
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,484
They're part of it.
It's a part of them.

1202
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:57,361
L... I'm doing
the best I can here.

1203
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:58,529
Well, do better.

1204
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,030
Oh, I know.
Why don't you translate...

1205
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:02,491
and I'll wave the gun around.

1206
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,584
What did she say?

1207
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,628
I don't know.
L... I didn't catch it.

1208
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,562
Hold your horses, lover boy.

1209
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:39,690
Kida.

1210
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:43,819
Kida.

1211
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:12,097
No, don't.
Don't touch her.

1212
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,948
All right, step back.

1213
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,534
Sergeant,
keep those people back.

1214
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,579
You heard him.
Step back.

1215
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,331
I'm warning you.

1216
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:38,999
So...

1217
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,460
I guess this is
how it ends, huh?

1218
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,420
Fine. You win.

1219
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,464
You're wiping out
an entire civilization...

1220
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:46,799
but, hey...

1221
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,175
you'll be rich.

1222
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:49,635
Congratulations, Audrey.

1223
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,261
Guess you and your dad
will be able...

1224
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,473
to open up that
second garage after all.

1225
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,684
And, Vinny, you can start
a whole chain of flower shops.

1226
01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:59,019
I'm sure your family's
going to be very proud.

1227
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:01,438
But that's what
it's all about, right?

1228
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:03,315
Money.

1229
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:05,192
Get off your soapbox, Thatch.

1230
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:07,903
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.

1231
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:09,655
We're just helping it along.

1232
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:11,031
Commander, we're ready.

1233
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:12,324
Yeah, give me a minute.

1234
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:14,034
I know
I'm forgetting something.

1235
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:16,954
I got the cargo,
the crystal, the crew...

1236
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,832
Oh, yeah.

1237
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,460
Look at it this way, son.

1238
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,838
You were the man
who discovered Atlantis...

1239
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:28,549
and now you're part
of the exhibit.

1240
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,101
Let's move, people.

1241
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:40,519
That was an order,
not a suggestion.

1242
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:42,104
Let's go!

1243
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:23,604
We're all going to die.

1244
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:30,152
Oh, you can't
be serious.

1245
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,528
This is wrong,
and you know it.

1246
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,906
We're this close
to our biggest payday ever...

1247
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,367
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience.

1248
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,494
We've done a lot of things
we're not proud of...

1249
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:41,622
robbing graves,
plundering tombs...

1250
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:42,998
double parking...

1251
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,084
but nobody got hurt.

1252
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,378
Well, maybe
somebody got hurt...

1253
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:49,213
but nobody we knew.

1254
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:51,840
Well, if that's
the way you want it, fine.

1255
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:53,550
More for me.

1256
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,137
P.T. Barnum was right.

1257
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:17,574
We can't let him
do this!

1258
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:18,659
Wait a second.

1259
01:09:33,632 --> 01:09:35,300
OK, now you can go.

1260
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:37,970
Milo,
you better get up here.

1261
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:42,558
How's he doing?

1262
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,643
Not good, I'm afraid.

1263
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,270
Internal bleeding.

1264
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,063
There's nothing more
I can do.

1265
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:49,565
What a nightmare.

1266
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,431
And I brought it here.

1267
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,860
Ah, don't go
beating yourself up.

1268
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,029
He's been after that
crystal since Iceland.

1269
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,614
The crystal.

1270
01:09:57,656 --> 01:09:59,158
Sweet, that's it.

1271
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,659
These... these crystals...

1272
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,411
they have some sort
of healing energy.

1273
01:10:02,453 --> 01:10:04,329
I've... I've seen it work.

1274
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,539
No.

1275
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:07,583
Where is my daughter?

1276
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,668
Well, she... she...

1277
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,003
Mmm.

1278
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:12,504
She has been chosen...

1279
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,506
like her mother before her.

1280
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:15,758
What?

1281
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:17,176
In times of danger...

1282
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,261
the crystal
will choose a host...

1283
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,846
one of royal blood...

1284
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,473
to protect itself...

1285
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,224
and its people.

1286
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:25,768
It will accept no other.

1287
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:28,187
W-Wait a minute.
Choose?

1288
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,272
So this thing is alive?

1289
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,024
In a way.

1290
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,109
The crystal thrives...

1291
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:35,736
on the collective emotions...

1292
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,530
of all who came before us.

1293
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:42,117
In return,
it provides power...

1294
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,537
longevity, protection.

1295
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:46,747
As it grew...

1296
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,875
it developed
a consciousness of its own.

1297
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:54,505
In my arrogance...

1298
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:57,091
I sought to use it
as a weapon of war...

1299
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:01,637
but it's power proved
too great to control.

1300
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,931
It overwhelmed us...

1301
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:07,017
and led to our destruction.

1302
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,936
That's why you hid it
beneath the city...

1303
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:11,230
to keep history
from repeating itself.

1304
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:14,566
And to prevent Kida
from suffering the same fate...

1305
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,902
as my beloved wife.

1306
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,237
What do you mean?
Wh...

1307
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,905
What's going to happen
to Kida?

1308
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:23,242
If she remains bonded
to the crystal...

1309
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:27,955
she could be lost to it forever.

1310
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:32,543
The love of my daughter
is all I have left.

1311
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,962
My burden
would have become hers...

1312
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,380
when the time was right...

1313
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,173
but now...

1314
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:39,883
it falls to you.

1315
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,261
Me?

1316
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,054
Return the crystal.

1317
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:48,079
Save Atlantis.

1318
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:50,728
Save my daughter.

1319
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:11,040
Hmm.

1320
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:13,208
So, what's it going to be?

1321
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,878
Excuse me?

1322
01:12:15,919 --> 01:12:18,297
I followed you in,
and I'll follow you out.

1323
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:19,840
It's your decision.

1324
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:21,258
Oh, my decision?

1325
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,301
Well, I think we've seen
how effective...

1326
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:23,761
my decisions have been.

1327
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:25,095
Let's recap.

1328
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:27,306
I lead a band
of plundering vandals...

1329
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:28,682
to the greatest
archeological find...

1330
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,017
in recorded history...

1331
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:32,311
thus enabling
the kidnap and/or murder...

1332
01:12:32,353 --> 01:12:33,562
of the royal family...

1333
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,022
not to mention
personally delivering...

1334
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,774
the most powerful force
known to man...

1335
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,598
into the hands
of a mercenary nutcase...

1336
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,527
who's probably going
to sell it to the Kaiser!

1337
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,738
Have I left
anything out?

1338
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,281
Well, you did
set the camp on fire...

1339
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,449
and drop us
down that big hole.

1340
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,658
Thank you.

1341
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,786
Thank you very much.

1342
01:12:52,373 --> 01:12:53,999
Of course,
it's been my experience...

1343
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,125
when you hit bottom...

1344
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,336
the only place
left to go is up.

1345
01:12:57,378 --> 01:12:59,296
Who told you that?

1346
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:02,341
A fella by the name
of Thaddeus Thatch.

1347
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,226
Where are you going?

1348
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:13,811
I'm going after Rourke.

1349
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,312
Milo, that's crazy.

1350
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,189
I didn't say
it was the smart thing...

1351
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,149
but it is the right thing.

1352
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,780
Come on. We better make sure
he doesn't hurt himself.

1353
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:29,076
Milo, what do you think
you are doing?

1354
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,327
Just follow my lead.

1355
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,917
Wow.
I'm impressed.

1356
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,377
It's simple.
All you got to do...

1357
01:13:38,419 --> 01:13:39,712
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, OK?

1358
01:13:39,764 --> 01:13:41,296
No, no, wait!

1359
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:45,801
Gently.

1360
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:47,011
Just gently.

1361
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:49,555
Hey, Milo,
you got something sporty?

1362
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,181
You know, like a tuna?

1363
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:52,474
How is this done?

1364
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,601
All you got to do
is use the crystals.

1365
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:55,936
Kida showed me.

1366
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,024
Half-turn right,
quarter-run back.

1367
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:02,026
Keep your hand
on the pad.

1368
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,363
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.

1369
01:14:08,741 --> 01:14:11,076
I'm so excited.

1370
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,789
All right, this is it!

1371
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,458
We're going to rescue
the princess.

1372
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:19,251
We're going to save
Atlantis.

1373
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,878
Or we're going to die trying.

1374
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,504
Now let's do it!

1375
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:48,072
I love it when I win.

1376
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:05,297
OK, here's the plan.

1377
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:06,965
We're going to come in
low and fast...

1378
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,467
and take them by surprise.

1379
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,010
Well, I've got
news for you, Milo.

1380
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:12,846
Rourke is never surprised,
and he's got a lot of guns.

1381
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,807
Great. Well, do you have
any suggestions?

1382
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:17,017
Yeah.
Don't get shot.

1383
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:25,984
There they are!

1384
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,444
We've got company!

1385
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,948
Take off!

1386
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,333
Take her up!

1387
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,384
Holy smokes!

1388
01:15:50,426 --> 01:15:52,636
You told me
he only had guns.

1389
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,638
What I said was,
he's never surprised.

1390
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,735
OK, now things
are getting good.

1391
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,319
Vinny! Heads up!

1392
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,697
We can't let them reach
the top of that shaft!

1393
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:15,701
Aah!

1394
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:29,840
Vinny, new plan.

1395
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:31,592
You and me, we're going
to be decoys.

1396
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:33,802
Audrey, Sweet, fly up
underneath that thing...

1397
01:16:33,844 --> 01:16:34,845
and cut her loose.

1398
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:36,096
We're on it.

1399
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:40,726
Lieutenant!

1400
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,819
I though you said
this thing...

1401
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,363
could cut through
a femur in 28 seconds!

1402
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:53,655
Less talk, more saw.

1403
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:05,834
Uhh!

1404
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,253
Looks like somebody's
working overtime.

1405
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:12,800
Come on, girl.
Time's up.

1406
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,218
Whoa!

1407
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,803
All right, Milo,
this is it.

1408
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:18,222
Any last words?

1409
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:21,225
Yeah. I really wish I had
a better idea than this!

1410
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,231
We're losing altitude.

1411
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,399
Lighten the load.

1412
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,650
Unh!

1413
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:31,777
That's it, unless
someone wants to jump.

1414
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,737
Ladies first.
Uhh!

1415
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,744
You said
we were in this together!

1416
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:41,912
Uhh!

1417
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:44,248
You promised me
a percentage!

1418
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,583
Next time,
get it in writing.

1419
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,377
Aah!

1420
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:50,003
Nothing personal.

1421
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:51,880
Unh! Yaah!

1422
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,465
Aah!

1423
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:57,636
- Uhh!
- Unh!

1424
01:17:57,678 --> 01:17:59,888
- Aah!
- Uhh!

1425
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,598
Well, I have
to hand it to you.

1426
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,256
You're a bigger
pain in the neck...

1427
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,185
than I would have
ever thought possible.

1428
01:18:07,312 --> 01:18:09,898
I consider myself
an even-tempered man.

1429
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,942
It takes a lot
to get under my skin...

1430
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,235
but congratulations...

1431
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:15,988
you just won
the solid-gold kewpie doll.

1432
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,242
Uhh...

1433
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:24,830
Uhh! Uhh!

1434
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,959
Nothing personal.

1435
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:40,679
Tired, Mr. Thatch?

1436
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,680
Hyah!

1437
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:44,767
Aw, that's a darn shame...

1438
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:47,853
because I'm just
getting warmed up.

1439
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:51,607
Aah!

1440
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:59,156
Aah! Aah!

1441
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,536
Aah!

1442
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,376
Thank heaven.

1443
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:11,460
Whoa!

1444
01:19:23,681 --> 01:19:25,182
Uhh!

1445
01:19:25,224 --> 01:19:26,308
Ahh.

1446
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,268
Oh, great!

1447
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:35,484
Ahh.

1448
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:42,825
The volcano...

1449
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,868
she awakes!

1450
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,704
Hey, I had nothing
to do with it.

1451
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,789
This here would be
a good place not to be.

1452
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,124
No, wait.
We got to get her back...

1453
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:51,500
or the whole city
will die.

1454
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:53,043
And if we don't get
out of here, we'll die.

1455
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:55,045
It's the only way
to reverse this.

1456
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:56,839
Just do it!

1457
01:20:07,057 --> 01:20:09,143
Milo, no!

1458
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:17,026
Go!

1459
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:20,946
Aah!

1460
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:25,200
Whoa!

1461
01:20:34,752 --> 01:20:35,669
Whoa!

1462
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:53,645
The fissure...
it is about to eject...

1463
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:55,773
its pyroclastic fury!

1464
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,941
Milo, Mole says
the wall's going to blow!

1465
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,693
Unh! Uhh!

1466
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,593
Uhh.

1467
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,729
Milo?

1468
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:13,489
Atlantis will honor
your names forever.

1469
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,908
I only wish there was more
we could do for you.

1470
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,493
Uh, you know, thanks anyway...

1471
01:25:17,534 --> 01:25:20,120
but I think we're good.

1472
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,165
They'll take you
as far as the surface.

1473
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:25,084
We are really going
to miss you, Milo.

1474
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,336
You know, I'm going
to reopen the flower shop...

1475
01:25:27,378 --> 01:25:30,547
and I'm going to think of
you guys every single day...

1476
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:33,384
Monday through Friday,
9:00 to 5:00...

1477
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:35,042
Saturday until 2:00.

1478
01:25:35,094 --> 01:25:38,222
Sunday... I'm going to take
Sunday off probably, and...

1479
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,265
Maybe I'll go in for
a couple of hours, you know...

1480
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:42,893
but August...
I'm going to take August.

1481
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:45,646
I ain't so good
at speechifyin'...

1482
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,023
but I wanted you to have this.

1483
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:50,401
It's the bacon grease
from the whole trip.

1484
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,111
Cookie, l...

1485
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:54,279
Aw...

1486
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:59,326
Ah-ah.
2 for flinching.

1487
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:00,828
See you, Milo.

1488
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,830
Hey, Milo!
Heh heh!

1489
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,416
Mole.

1490
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:08,794
Mole. Wow.
Hey, well...

1491
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:10,337
good-bye, Mole.

1492
01:26:10,379 --> 01:26:11,630
Now, you sure
you want to stay?

1493
01:26:11,672 --> 01:26:13,048
There's
a hero's welcome...

1494
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:14,758
waiting for the man
who discovered Atlantis.

1495
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,136
Ah, I don't think the world
needs another hero.

1496
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:19,263
Besides, I hear
there's an opening down here...

1497
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,806
for an expert in gibberish.

1498
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:23,142
You take good care of
yourself, Milo Thatch.

1499
01:26:23,194 --> 01:26:25,477
Yeah.
You, too, Sweet.

1500
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,021
Come here.

1501
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,689
Unh!

1502
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:31,316
Sweet, uh, before you go,
could you...

1503
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:32,359
No problem.

1504
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,445
Ah. Oh. Thanks.

1505
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:36,697
Ha ha ha!
Oh, you're getting a bill.

1506
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:38,198
Can we go home now?

1507
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,117
Come on, y'all.
Let's get one last shot...

1508
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,452
in front of the fish.

1509
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:44,038
Say "Gochk."

1510
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,956
Gochk.

1511
01:26:51,045 --> 01:26:53,130
Now, let's go
over it again...

1512
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:54,631
just so we got it straight.

1513
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:56,383
You didn't find anything?

1514
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:58,469
Nope. Just a lot of rocks...

1515
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,637
and fish...
little fish.

1516
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:02,598
Sponges.

1517
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,016
What happened to Helga?

1518
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:06,894
Well, we lost her when a flaming
zeppelin come down on her.

1519
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:08,145
Missing.

1520
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:10,230
That's right.
And Rourke?

1521
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:11,357
Nervous breakdown.

1522
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:13,025
You could say
he went all to pieces.

1523
01:27:13,067 --> 01:27:15,903
In fact, you could say
he was transamorgafied...

1524
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,696
and then busted
into a zillion...

1525
01:27:17,748 --> 01:27:19,990
Ahem.
He's missing, too.

1526
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:22,201
What about Milo?
Went down with the sub.

1527
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:27,081
Ah ha ha!

1528
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:28,832
Lord, give me strength.

1529
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:30,793
Ohh.

1530
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:32,711
I'm going to miss
that boy.

1531
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:35,047
At least he's
in a better place now.

1532
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:44,264
Dear Mr. Whitmore...

1533
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:47,393
I hope this piece of proof
is enough for you.

1534
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:45,969
They'll try
to hold you back

1535
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:53,268
And they will say
you're wrong

1536
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:57,773
But they will never
understand

1537
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:01,527
The journey
that you're on

1538
01:30:01,579 --> 01:30:04,947
Mm-hmm

1539
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:08,701
They'll try
to change your mind

1540
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:13,747
They'll try to change
your heart

1541
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:15,874
Oh, yeah

1542
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:20,254
But they will never
understand

1543
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,840
Who you are

1544
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:26,051
And you'll still
believe

1545
01:30:26,103 --> 01:30:28,262
Still believe

1546
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:31,077
And you know

1547
01:30:31,129 --> 01:30:33,851
You must go

1548
01:30:33,892 --> 01:30:39,189
Where the dream
takes you

1549
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:44,486
Where your heart
longs to be

1550
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:46,687
Oh

1551
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:50,492
When you finally
find that place

1552
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:56,373
You'll find
all you need

1553
01:30:56,415 --> 01:31:01,712
Where the dream
takes you

1554
01:31:01,754 --> 01:31:04,089
Where the dream takes you

1555
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:06,425
Oh, whoa

1556
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:12,097
There's something
in your soul

1557
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:16,101
Something in your soul

1558
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:20,064
That won't be denied

1559
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:23,859
It's the faith to dream
that keeps

1560
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:27,071
The dream alive

1561
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:30,074
So you'll still believe

1562
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:32,743
Still believe

1563
01:31:32,785 --> 01:31:35,287
And you know

1564
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:37,539
You must go

1565
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:41,460
Where the dream takes you

1566
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:43,796
Where the dream takes you

1567
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:49,051
Where your heart longs to be

1568
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:55,015
When you finally
find that place

1569
01:31:55,057 --> 01:32:00,562
You'll find all you need

1570
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:03,774
Where the dream takes you

1571
01:32:03,816 --> 01:32:08,946
Go where your heart
is meant to be

1572
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:11,782
And you may find

1573
01:32:11,824 --> 01:32:14,702
Somebody there

1574
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:19,373
Someone to share your dream

1575
01:32:19,415 --> 01:32:21,125
Oh, oh, oh

1576
01:32:21,177 --> 01:32:22,835
Whoa, whoa

1577
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,619
Oh

1578
01:32:25,671 --> 01:32:27,276
All right

1579
01:32:27,328 --> 01:32:28,882
All right

1580
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:33,971
When you finally
find that place

1581
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:38,559
You'll find all you need

1582
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,813
Where the dream leads you

1583
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:44,857
Your dream
will lead you on

1584
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:49,987
Only your heart
can see

1585
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:52,448
Oh, yeah

1586
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:56,493
There's a world
that waits for you

1587
01:32:56,535 --> 01:32:59,246
You're not alone

1588
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:02,207
You'll find your home

1589
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:03,751
Where the dream takes you

1590
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:07,588
Try to change your mind

1591
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:10,507
Where the dream takes you

1592
01:33:10,559 --> 01:33:13,385
Try to change your heart

1593
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,262
Where the dream takes you

1594
01:33:15,304 --> 01:33:20,267
But you must go

1595
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:21,685
Where the dream
takes you
