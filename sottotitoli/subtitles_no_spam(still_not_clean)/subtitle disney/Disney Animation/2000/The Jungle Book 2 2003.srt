724
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,665
I thought that perhaps maybe you have seen the boy.

Me? Uh, no. Ha.

726
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,879
Well, you know his future is in that village.

727
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,381
Yes.

728
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,594
I just wish I knew where he was.

729
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,723
Yeah. Whew, sorry. Huh!
Man, wish I could help you out, Baghee.

730
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,060
Oh! Enough games, Baloo.
Now give me the boy.

731
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,063
Baghee, Baghee, Baghee, Baghee.
I can explain.

732
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,898
I can explain. I...

733
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,109
Can explain, but I don't have to,

734
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,488
'cause you can plainly see Mowgli is not here.

735
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,032
I'm all alone.

736
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:31,706
(SIGHS) I know he's around here
somewhere, and he can't hide forever.

737
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,875
Well, he won't get past you, Baghee.

738
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,126
Hmm.

739
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,881

Wow, the whole village looking for me?

We can't let nobody see you.

747
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,775
I thought they were mad.

Shanti?

753
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,542
You definitely don't want her to find you.

755
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,008
No.

We can't let anyone find us, especially that girl.

Come on, Baloo. We gotta get moving.
Lay low, hunker down, hibernate, like.

Now, Mowgli,

759

what if that girl tracks us down?

760
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,065
What are you gonna do?

761
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,943
Then... Then you're gonna
have to scare her.

762
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,196
(MUFFLED) Scare her?
Has the milk run out of your coconut?

763
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,908
No, she's terrified of wild animals.

764
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,495
In case you haven't noticed, kid, I'm no wild animal.

You can do it, Baloo.

00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,464
You're the one that taught me, remember?

769
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:07,177
You scrunch up your eyes like this,
and show your teeth like this,

No, no, no, no. Like you mean it.

Trust me. That'll do it.

780

Well, in that case, Mowgli, consider that girl scarified.

Now, don't you worry.

I got a place downriver.
It's the perfect hideout.
