1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,516
<i>Evening star is shining bright,</i>

2
00:00:57,178 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>So make a wish and hold on tight,</i>

3
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:09,114
<i>There's magic in the air tonight,</i>

4
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:14,985
<i>And anything can happen.</i>

5
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:18,742
<i> Just in that moment,
the ugly little frog </i>

6
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:22,893
<i> looked up with his sad,
round eyes and pleaded: </i>

7
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:25,514
<i>Oh, please, dear princess,</i>

8
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>Only a kiss from you
can break this terrible spell,</i>

9
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,678
<i>that was inflicted on me
by a wicked witch.</i>

10
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:35,100
There comes my favorite part.

11
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:41,431
And the beautiful princess
was so moved by his desperate plea,

12
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:46,461
that she stooped down,
picked up the slippery creature,

13
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,097
leaned forward,

14
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,362
raised him to her lips,

15
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,477
and kissed that little frog.

16
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:01,537
Than the frog was transformed
into a handsome prince.

17
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:05,503
They were married and lived
happily ever after.

18
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,962
The end.

19
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,459
Yay! Read it again, read it again!

20
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,976
Sorry Charlotte, it's time for us
to be headin' home.

21
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,668
Say good night, Tiana.

22
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:20,035
There is no way,
in this whole wide world ...

23
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,264
I would ever, ever, ever I mean never
kiss a frog. Yuck!

24
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:26,193
Is that so?

25
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,899
Here comes your prince charming, Tia.
Come on, kiss.

26
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,109
- No! Yes, Yes!
- Stop it!

27
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,062
- I won't, I won't, I won't!
- I would do it.

28
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,507
I would kiss a frog.

29
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,079
I would kiss a hundred frogs,

30
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,489
if I could marry a prince
and be a princess.

31
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:49,388
You girls, stop tormentin'
that poor little kitty.

32
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:52,758
Poor little thing.

33
00:02:56,548 --> 00:03:00,597
- Evenin' Eudora!
- Daddy, Daddy, look at my new dress.

34
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:05,322
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hah,hah,  look at you. Why, I'd expect nothin' less

35
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,331
from the finest seamstress in New Orleans.

36
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,359
Uuh, I want that there.

37
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,799
- Oh, no sugar come on.
- I want that one.

38
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:14,521
- Please, please, please, please!
- Eudora.

39
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:16,909
You suppose you can
web something up like that ?

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,108
- Anything for my best customer.
- Yeah!

41
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,844
Come along, Tiana.
Your Dad should be home from work by now.

42
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,113
Aah, now princess, you gettin'
that drift but that's it.

43
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:28,658
No more Mr. Pushover.

44
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:33,992
- Now who wants a puppy?
- I do! I do! He's so cute!

45
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,603
Mmm,  gumbo smells good Tiana.

46
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:04,825
- I think it's done, Daddy.
- Yeah. Are you sure? -Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,465
- Absolutely positive?
- Yes!

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,243
Okay, I'm about to put
this spoon in my ...

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,853
-Wait!

50
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:18,324
-Done.

51
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,312
- What?
- Well, sweetheart ...

52
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,813
This is the...

53
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,199
The best gumbo I've ever tasted.

54
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,723
Come here. Eudora, our little girl's got a gift.

55
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:33,082
- I coulda have told you that.
- A gift this special

56
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,928
just gotta be shared.

57
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,362
Hey everybody I made gumbo.

58
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,645
<i> Uuuh, that's smells good </i>

59
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:44,153
<i> You know the thing about good food? </i>

60
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,915
<i> It brings folks together from all walks of life. </i>

61
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:51,930
It warms them right up and it
puts little smiles on their faces.

62
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,767
And when I open up my own restaurant,
I tell you, people are gonna lined up

63
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,902
for miles around,
just to get a taste of my food.

64
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,424
- Our food!
- That's right, baby.

65
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,202
Our food.

66
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,682
- Daddy, look.
- Where're you goin'?

67
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,861
Charlotte's faity tale book said,

68
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:21,150
if you make a wish on evening star
it shoulda come true.

69
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,627
- Hmmh, won't you wish on that star, sweetheart?
- Yes, you wish and you dream

70
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,666
with all your little heart.

71
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:32,968
But you remember dear Anawet,
that old star can only take you part of a way.

72
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:36,868
You got to help him with some hard work of your own.
And then...

73
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,438
Yeah you can do anything
you said you mind to.

74
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,262
Just promise your Daddy one thing?

75
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:49,642
That you'll  never, ever lose sign
what is really important.

76
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:51,839
Okay?

77
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,672
See you in the morning, baby cakes.

78
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,396
Get some sleep.

79
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,325
Please, please, please.

80
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,294
Aaaaaaah!!!

81
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:55,567
Well Miss Tiana rough night for tips
but every little penny counts.

82
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,946
Don't you worry, Daddy ...

83
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,001
We'll be there soon.

84
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,621
Goodnight Cal's,

Well, keep 'em comin' 'til I pass out.

00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:51,459
- Oh Tia! Tia, Tia, Tia!!

137
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,177

A little worthy advice:

147
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:30,625
My Mom always said that the quicks way
to a man's heart is through his stomach.

148
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,892
- That's it.
- What just happened?

149
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:37,680
Oh, Tia, you are Bonafide genius.

150
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:41,523

of your man-catching beignets

This is it!

00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:49,837
Just look at it, Mama.
Doesn't just make you wanna cry?

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,610
Yes.

171
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:57,816
The main D. gonna be right where you are stayin'.
And over here, a gourmande kitchen.

172
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,252
And hang up from the ceiling
a big, old crystal chandelier.

173
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,853
You are your Daddy's daughter, all right.

174
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,243
He used to go on and on about
this old sugar mill too.

175
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,969
Baby cakes, I'm sure, this place
is gonna be just wonderful.

176
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,176
But it's a shame you're working so hard.

177
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,637
But how can I let it now
when I'm so close.

178
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:19,957
I got to make sure all that
hard work means something.

179
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:21,352
Tiana!

180
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:25,887
Your Daddy may not have gotten place you always wanted
but he had something better.

181
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,429
He had love.

182
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,768
And that's all I want
for you, sweetheart.

183
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,400
To me you and prince charming
end dance out until y'all happily ever after.

184
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:40,183
I don't have time for dancing.

185
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,871
<i> That's just gonna have to wait a while </i>

186
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,306
How long we're talkin' about here?

187
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:49,133
<i> Ain't got time for messing around </i>

188
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,523
<i> And it's not my style </i>

189
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,548
I want some grandkids.

190
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:59,738
<i> This whole town can slow you down
People taking the easy way </i>

191
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,587
<i> But I know exactly where I'm going </i>

192
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:06,369
<i> And getting closer, closer, every day </i>

193
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,053
<i> And I'm almost there </i>

194
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,219
<i> I'm almost there </i>

195
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,759
<i> People down here think I'm crazy, </i>

196
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,342
<i> but I don't care </i>

197
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:21,911
<i> Tribes and tribulations </i>

198
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,273
<i> have had my share </i>

199
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:30,023
<i> There ain't nothing gonna stop me now
cause I'm almost there </i>

200
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,867
<i> I remember Daddy told me : </i>

201
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:41,105
<i> Fairytales can come true </i>

202
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:47,139
<i> You gotta make 'em happen
it all depends on you </i>

203
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:50,439
<i> So I work real hard each and every day </i>

204
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:54,137
<i> Now things for sure are going my way </i>

205
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:59,686
<i> Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through </i>

206
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,435
<i> And I'm almost there </i>

207
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:05,971
<i> I'm almost there </i>

208
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,043
<i> People gonna come here from everywhere </i>

209
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,549
<i> And I'm almost there, </i>

210
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,619
<i> I'm almost there </i>

211
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:29,990
<i> There's been tribes and tribulations </i>

212
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,646
<i> You know I've had my share </i>

213
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:36,746
<i> But I've climbed the mountain,
I've crossed the river </i>

214
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,522
<i> And I'm almost there, </i>

215
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,354
<i> I'm almost there </i>

216
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:47,181
<i> I'm almost there ! </i>

217
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:06,447
- Excuse me!
- You need a hand in there, buddy?

218
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,701
Achedanza... (Cool)

219
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:29,001
Sir ... I've been looking for you
everywhere.

220
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,761
What a coincidence, Lawrence.

221
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,024
I've been avoiding you everywhere.

222
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:37,113
- We are going to be late for the Masquerade.
- Listen, Lawrence, listen.

223
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,083
It's jazz, that's the music.

224
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,605
It was born here.

225
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,219
It's beautiful, no?

226
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,728
No.

227
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,277
Oh, dance with me, fat man.

228
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,360
Get loose, Lawrence.

229
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,895
- We supposed to be at La Bouff's estate by now.
- Yes, yes, yes. But first ...

230
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:59,793
I buy everyone here a drink.

231
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:02,777
With what?

232
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,767
At this point you have
two choices:

233
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,738
Woo and marry richa lady or ...

234
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,524
Get a job.

235
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:17,797
All right, fine but first...
We dance.

236
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,856
- This is idiocy.
- For someone who can't see his feet,

237
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,383
you're very light on them!

238
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,200
It's perfect. You're finally getting
into the music!

239
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:30,925
Do you get my joke?

240
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:33,568
Because your head is, it is in the tuba!

241
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,858
- Get me out!
- All right. Hold on.

242
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:43,862
Degrading. I never been
so humiliated.

243
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,162
Hello?

244
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:48,787
Gentlemen.

245
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,835
Enchantée.

246
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:54,497
A tip of the hat from Dr. Facilier.

247
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,785
How y'all doin'?

248
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:00,877
Tarot readings, charms, potions ...

249
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,410
Dreams made real!

250
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:06,746
- Achedanza! (Cool)
- Were I a betting man...And I'm not,

251
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:10,752
- I stay away from games of chance...
- Sir! - I'd wager...

252
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:15,451
I'm in the company of visiting royalty.

253
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,831
Lawrence, Lawrence!

254
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:20,097
This remarkable gentleman
has just read my palm!

255
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,087
Or this morning's newspaper?

256
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,970
Sir, this chap is obviously a  charlatan.

257
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:31,964
- I suggest we move on to a less...
- Don't you disrespect me little man!.

258
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:36,226
<i> Don't you derogate or deride! </i>

259
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:40,335
<i> You're in my world now, Not your world </i>

260
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:44,673
<i> And I've got friends on the other side! </i>

261
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:49,105
<i> He's got friends on the other side... </i>

262
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,489
<i> That's just an echo, gentlemen. Just a little
somethin' we have here in Louisiana, </i>

263
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,107
<i> a little parlor trick. Don't worry.... </i>

264
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,104
<i> Sit down at my table </i>

265
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:00,002
<i> Put your minds at ease </i>

266
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:05,671
<i> If you relax it will enable me to do
anything I please </i>

267
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,610
<i> I can read your future </i>

268
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,384
<i> I can change it 'round some, too </i>

269
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,672
<i> I'll look deep into your heart and soul </i>

270
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,869
<i> (you do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?) </i>

271
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,973
<i> Make your wildest dreams come true! </i>

272
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:24,451
<i> I got voodoo, I got hoodoo,
I got things I ain't even tried! </i>

273
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,916
<i> And I got friends on the other side. </i>

274
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,994
<i> He's got friends on the other side... </i>

275
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:36,037
<i> The cards, the cards, the cards will tell </i>

276
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:39,577
<i> The past, the present, and the future
as well </i>

277
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:44,612
<i> The cards, the cards,
just take three </i>

278
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,954
<i> Take a little trip into your future with me! </i>

279
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:56,227
<i> Now you, young man, are from across the sea </i>

280
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:01,918
<i> You come from two long lines of royalty </i>

281
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,846
<i> (I'm a royal myself on my mother's side) </i>

282
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:08,085
<i> Your lifestyle's high </i>

283
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:11,214
<i> But your funds are low </i>

284
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:15,047
<i> You need to marry a little honey
whose daddy got dough </i>

285
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,487
<i> Mommy and daddy cut you off, huh playboy? <i>

286
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,318
-Yeah, sad but true.

287
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:22,516
<i> Now y'all gotta get hitched,
but hitchin' ties you down. </i>

288
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:25,012
<i> You just wanna be free.
Hop from place to place. </i>

289
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,868
<i> But freedom... takes green! </i>

290
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,462
<i> It's the green, it's the green,
it's the green you need </i>

291
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:37,369
<i> And when I looked into your future
It's the green that I see! <i>

292
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:41,140
<i> On you little man,
I don't want to waste much time <i>

293
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,919
<i> You been pushed around all your life </i>

294
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:49,168
<i> You been pushed around by your mother
and your sister and your brother. <i>

295
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:52,065
<i> And if you was married... </i>

296
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,754
<i> You'd be pushed around by your wife </i>

297
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:59,409
<i> But in your future, the you I see </i>

298
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:03,838
<i> It's exactly the man you always wanted to be! </i>

299
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,304
<i> Shake my hand. </i>

300
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,520
<i> Come on, boys </i>

301
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:12,646
<i> Won't you shake the poor sinner's hand? </i>

302
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,062
<i> -Are you ready?
-Are you ready?</i>

303
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,116
<i> -Are you ready? </i>

304
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,962
<i> -Transformation central!
-Transformation central! </i>

305
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:30,029
<i> -Reformation central!
-Reformation central! </i>

306
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:31,882
<i> Transmogrification central! </i>

307
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:34,209
<i> Can you feel it? </i>

308
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:38,886
<i>You're changin', You're changin'
You're changin', all right!</i>

309
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:42,222
<i> I hope you're satisfied </i>

310
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,911
<i> But if you ain't
Don't blame me </i>

311
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:51,533
<i> You can blame my friends on the other side! </i>

312
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,991
<i> You got what you wanted! </i>

313
00:21:55,465 --> 00:22:03,639
<i> But you lost what you had!
Hush... </i>

314
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:22,683
Ah, Senator Johnson!
Hey, Jimmy.

315
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:25,589
I hope you leavin' some of the beignets
so you can stitch once.

316
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:26,929
No, pipe and hot.

317
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:29,784
Stella, excuse me...
Stella, no, no.

318
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,684
Okay, but just one.

319
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,591
But Miss Charlotte ...

320
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:38,643
You said later two hours?

321
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,812
Travis! When a woman says later,

322
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:45,682
she really means not ever!
Now run along.

323
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:49,692
There are plenty of young fillies
dyin' for you to waltz them into a stupor.

324
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:52,654
- Gimme that napkins! Quick!
- What on earth for?

325
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,597
I swear, I'm sweatin' like a sinner in church!

326
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:58,807
- Oh, Tia, is gettin' to be so late.
- There's still a few stragglers.

327
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:02,212
This is a failure. Tia, my prince is never comin'.

328
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,971
- Now, Lottie...
- I never get anything I wish for!

329
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:06,545
Lottie, wait!

330
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:10,254
- Just calm down and take a deep...
- Maybe I just got to wish harder.

331
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,335
Please, please, please
please, please ...

332
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:17,456
Lottie, you can't just wish
on a star expecting ...

333
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,310
<i> Ladies and gentlemen! </i>

334
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:21,440
</i> His Royal Highness, <i>

335
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:24,081
<i> Prince Naveen. </i>

336
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,835
Good Evening, Tiana.
Marvelous party.

337
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,334
Evening, Mr. Fenner.
And. .. Mr. Fenner.

338
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,241
- I'm smelling meanies.
- Gonna be the House specialty,

339
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:20,668
once I signed those papers
you're brought.

340
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,406
-Yes ...
-About that...

341
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:26,215
- You were outbid.
- What?

342
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,505
The fella came in offering
a full amount of cash.

343
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,421
Less you can tap his offer
by Wednesday.

344
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,057
You can kiss that place goodbye.

345
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:37,682
You know how long it took
me to save that money?

346
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:43,141
Exactly! Which is why a
little woman of your background ...

347
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:46,251
woulda had a hands full, trying to run
a big business like that.

348
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,483
You better off, will y'all,  yeah!

349
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:50,634
- No, wait a minute!
- No more meanies, no!

350
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:53,747
No. .. hold on a minute!
You..you come back!

351
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:02,810
Tia, time to get prince
charmed with those man-catchin' being...

352
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:05,533
- What happened?
- I. .. I ...just.

353
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:11,102
Oh, you poor dear. Oh, Prince Naveen,
We will be right back, sugar.

354
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,080
I got just a dress for you.

355
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:17,840
Oh, Tia, honey, did you see the way
he danced with me?

356
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,469
A marriage proposal,
can be far behind.

357
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:23,986
Thank you, Evening star!

358
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:28,858
You know, I was taught to think
that wishing on stars was just for...

359
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:32,009
Babies an' crazy people.

360
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:35,953
Look at you!

361
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,875
Aren't you just as pretty as
a magnolia in May?

362
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,618
Seems like only yesterday
we were ...

363
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:47,075
Both little girls, dreaming
our fairy tales dreams.

364
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:50,378
And tonight they're finally coming true!

365
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:54,110
Well...back into the fray!

366
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,223
Wish me luck.

367
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,963
<i> Oh,  Naveen ...</i>

368
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,088
<i>Almost...</i>

369
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,520
<i> Almost there </i>

370
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,477
<i> People would come here from everywhere </i>

371
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,435
<i> I was almost... </i>

372
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,175
<i> There. </i>

373
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:45,269
I can not believe I'm doing this.

374
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:51,425
Please... Please... Please!

375
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,101
Very funny.

376
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,113
So, what now?

377
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:06,972
I reckon you want a kiss?

378
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:10,999
Kissing would be nice, yes?

379
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:15,669
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

380
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:18,461
I did not mean to scare you, I...
Wait, no , no...

381
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:20,876
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

382
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,209
You know, you have a very strong arm, princess.

383
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:26,218
Ok, please! Put the monkey down.

384
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:29,179
- Stay back, or I'll... I'll...
- Please, please, please...

385
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,229
Ah, oh well...allow me to introduce myself:

386
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,027
I'm Prince Naveen.

387
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,008
... of Maldonia.

388
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,850
A prince?
But I didn't wish for any...

389
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:47,784
Hold on, if you're the prince, then...

390
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,600
then who was that

391
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:52,696
waltzing with Lottie on the dance floor?

392
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:59,497
All I know, is one minute I am a prince,
charming and handsome, cutting-a-rug, and the next thing I know,

393
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,655
...I am tripping over these.

394
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:05,786
Wait, wait, wait...
Wait!

395
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:07,267
I know this story!

396
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,989
Di Frogie Prutto!

397
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,583
- The Frog Prince?
- Yes, yes, yes...

398
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,469
My mother had the servants

399
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,272
read this to me every night.

400
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,692
Yes, yes...

401
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:20,568
this is exactly the answer!

402
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,468
You ...

403
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,041
- You must kiss me!
- Excuse me?

404
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:28,881
You will enjoy it, I guarantee.
All women enjoy the kiss...

405
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,349
of Prince Naveen.

406
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:32,859
Come, we pucker.

407
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:35,987
That's new.

408
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,608
Look, I'm sorry.
I'd really like to help you, but I just...

409
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,789
Do not kiss frogs.

410
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:47,813
Wait a second!
But...On the balcony, you ask me...

411
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,202
- I didn't expect you to answer!
- Oh, but you must kiss me.

412
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,090
Look, besides being unbelievably handsome,

413
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:57,212
I also happened to come from
a fabulously wealthy family.

414
00:28:57,214 --> 00:29:01,904
Surely, I can offer you some type of reward
or a wish I could grant perhaps...

415
00:29:02,188 --> 00:29:03,871
Yes?

416
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,474
Just...

417
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,110
- One kiss?
- Just one.

418
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,722
Unless you beg for more.

419
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:29,154
Ok Tiana, you can do this...
Just a little kiss, just a little kiss.

420
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:30,793
Ok!

421
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,680
You don't look there much different.

422
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:53,285
But how did you get way up there?
And how did I get way down here, in all this!

423
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:59,527
- Easy princess, do not panic.
- What did you do to me?

424
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:03,680
- I...I'm green and I'm...and I'm slimy!
- No, no, no ...

425
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,057
- This is not slime.
- What?

426
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:06,404
You're secreting mucus.

427
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:33,021
Stella!

428
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:34,644
Get that frogs!

429
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:37,785
- Run!
- I can't run, I'm a frog.

430
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,239
Then hop!

431
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:43,366
Calm boy, calm you monster dog!

432
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,849
En garde!

433
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,749
Look out! Get out of the way.

434
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,246
- Where are we going?
- Excuse me!

435
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,782
- I can't see a thing.
- Me neither, can I?

436
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,721
- Wait, Stella...
- Get up!

437
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:03,518
- Stella, it's me, Tiana!
- Tiana?

438
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:09,613
Stella just talked to me!
The dog just spoke to me!

439
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:12,267
You know, if you are going to let
every little thing bother you...

440
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:16,139
It's going to be  very long night!

441
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,942
Oh dear?

442
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:29,472
- You are so quiet?
- You let him go!

443
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:34,338
The poor dear frog was scarfing , so
I loosened the lid, and....

444
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,014
How do I ever get tangled
up in all this voodoo madness?

445
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,328
I can't get through with this.

446
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:53,436
- You wear this ...this ghostly flinger!
- Amulet!

447
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,618
Anything happens to this ...

448
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,325
I'm gonna need...

449
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,846
Fun fact about voodoo, Larry.

450
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,174
Can counter a thing for myself.

451
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:10,973
Besides ... you and I both know the
real power in this world ain't magic.

452
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:12,664
It's money.

453
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,825
Lots of it.

454
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,843
- It's true.
- Aren't you tired of living on a smidgens,

455
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:23,469
While all those fat cats in their fancy cars
don't give you so much of a sideway's glance ?

456
00:32:23,948 --> 00:32:26,833
Yes...
I am.

457
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,879
All you got to do is marry
Big Daddy's little princess ...

458
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,764
And we will splittin' that juicy
La Bouff fortune right down in the middle.

459
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,644
Sixty-forty
like i said.

460
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:38,610
But ...

461
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:41,723
- What about Naveen?
- You little slip-up...

462
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,201
We will be a minor bump in the road,

463
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:47,496
so long as we got
the prince's blood in this.

464
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,347
Voodoo?

465
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:59,053
You mean to tell me this all happened
because you were messing with the Shadow Man?

466
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:01,195
He was very charismatic!

467
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:03,897
It serves me right for wishing on stars.

468
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,368
The only way to get what you want in this
world is through hard work.

469
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:08,686
Hard work?

470
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:11,998
Why... why would a princess
need to work hard?

471
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,605
Huh? Oh, I'm not a princess.
I'm a waitress.

472
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:19,118
A waitress? Well no wonder the kiss
did not work!

473
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,643
You lied to me!

474
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,110
- I...I never said I was a princess.
- You never said you were a w... a waitress!

475
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,805
You were wearing a crown.

476
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,048
It was a costume party,

477
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,901
- You spoiled little rich boy.
- Oh, oh yes, oh ye?

478
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,985
Well, the egg is on your face, alright,

479
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:35,130
because I do not have any riches!

480
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:38,267
- What?
- I am completely broke.

481
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,126
You said ...

482
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:59,943
- You were fabulously wealthy!
- No, no, no.

483
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:02,020
My parents are fabulously wealthy.

484
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:04,835
But they cut me off for being a...
Leech! Leech!

485
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:08,054
You're broke, and you had
the gall to call me a liar?

486
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:14,054
It was not a lie!
I fully inte...Aaah!

487
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,657
I fully intend to be rich again!

488
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,190
Once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff'
and she will help me!

489
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,880
- You a prince?
- obviously!

490
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,977
She'll help you!

491
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:32,739
All right then.

492
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,257
Once you two are married,

493
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,678
you are gonna keep your promise

494
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,115
- and get me my restaurant, right?
- Whoa, oh, not so fast.

495
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:40,349
I made that promise to a beautiful princess,

496
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:43,313
not a cranky wai...
Why are those logs moving?

497
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,809
Those aren't logs!

498
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:53,349
I got glimpse on a big one.

499
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:08,511
<i> - C'mon, come here!
- Come here you tasty one mussel! </i>

500
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,125
Where did they go?

501
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,441
Lower the vine.

502
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:15,761
Find your own tree.

503
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:18,306
- There he is.
- I've seen him! I've seen him!

504
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:23,366
Okay, help me get out of this swamp and once
I married Charlotte, I shall get you your restaurant.

505
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,916
You gonna taste so good you
wasted invaluable rat!

506
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,042
Quick, quick, pull me up!

507
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,497
You can hop ...

508
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,779
-but you can't hide.
-We got all night!

509
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,067
Well, waitress, looks like
we going to be here for a while.

510
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:39,693
So we may as well get ...

511
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,417
comfortable.

512
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:43,753
Take your slimes away from me.

513
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:46,504
I've told you ...
It is not slime!

514
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,845
It is mucus.

515
00:35:57,776 --> 00:36:00,233
Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.

516
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,605
Gators are gone.

517
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,420
We got to get back to New Orleans ...

518
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:06,340
And undo this mess you got us into.

519
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:09,657
I was not the one  parading around
with your phony baloney tiara.

520
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:13,425
Music de paddle bile.

521
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:15,484
Could use a little help!

522
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:19,132
I will play a little louder.

523
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:24,165
How about a little less piggin' and a ...

524
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:31,325
I know that tune!
Dippermouth Blues.

525
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,078
- Play it, brother!

526
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:50,161
- Where you've been all my life?!
- Where did you learn to play like that?

527
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:53,402
Well, the Bajou's is
the best jazz school in the world.

528
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:55,014
All the greats play the riverboats.

529
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:59,518
Oh, Louis give anything to be up there
jammin’ with the big boys.

530
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,871
- So why don't you?
- Oh, I tried once.

531
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,304
It didn't end well.

532
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,845
It is been a real pleasure meetin' you, Louis.

533
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:20,659
And thank you for coming and
for not eatin' us.

534
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:22,072
We best be on our way.

535
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:24,154
Where are you goin'?

536
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:27,809
- To find somebody to break the spell.
- What spell?

537
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,930
Brace yourself, my skilly friend,

538
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:31,732
We are not frogs ...

539
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:35,472
- We are humans.
- What?

540
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,679
You are serious?

541
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,379
I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia.

542
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,912
And she is Tiana, the waitress.

543
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,487
Do not kiss her.

544
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,112
Now just a second.

545
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:52,275
This corny here got himself turned
into a frog by a voodoo man and now ...

546
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:55,440
Voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do.

547
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,975
- Mama, hoodie ?
- Mama Odie.

548
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:00,202
She is the voodoo queen of the Bajou.

549
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:04,623
She got magic and spells
of kind a voodoo .

550
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,409
Could you take us to her?

551
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:09,143
To the deepest, darkest
part of a Bayou??

552
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:13,920
Facing raser sharks, prick ambushers,
and trappers, and hunters with guns?

553
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:16,163
No.

554
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,319
Watch and learn.

555
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:25,372
Louis, that's too bad we can not
help you with your dream.

556
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:29,977
If only you were smaller...
less toothy.

557
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:33,712
You can play jazz to adoring crowd
without scaring them.

558
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:36,257
Anyway, enjoy your loneliness, my friend!

559
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:37,896
Abenaza.

560
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:40,839
Cute, but it's not gonna...

561
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:44,469
Hey guys, I just had me
a crazy idea.

562
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,364
What about if I ask Mama Odie
to turn me human?

563
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,685
Louis, you are a genius.

564
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,922
Hallelujah!

565
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,454
<i> If I were a human being </i>

566
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,700
<i> I'd head straight for New Orleans </i>

567
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:03,193
<i> and I'd blow this horn
so hot and strong </i>

568
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:05,234
<i> like no one they'd ever seen </i>

569
00:39:05,236 --> 00:39:09,707
<i> Louis Armstrong, Mister Sydney Bechet </i>

570
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,900
<i> All the boys gonna step aside </i>

571
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:14,210
<i> when they hear this old Alligator play </i>

572
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:15,559
<i> Listen! </i>

573
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,576
<i> When I'm human </i>

574
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,641
<i> as I hope to be </i>

575
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:30,120
<i> I'm gonna blow this horn
till the cows come home </i>

576
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:32,697
<i> and everyone's gonna bow down to me! </i>

577
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:34,633
<i> Thank you! Thank you! </i>

578
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,086
<i> Aw, thank you! I love you too baby! </i>

579
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:42,993
<i> When I'm myself again
I want just the life I had </i>

580
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,385
<i> Aye </i>

581
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:46,091
<i> that doesn't sound too bad </i>

582
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,163
<i> a redhead on my left arm </i>

583
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:50,511
<i> a brunette on my right </i>

584
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:53,126
<i> a blonde or two to hold a candle </i>

585
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,799
<i> that seem just about right
Eh, Louis? </i>

586
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:57,438
<i> Life is short
when you're done, you're done </i>

587
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,833
<i> we're on this Earth to have some fun </i>

588
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:02,230
<i> - and that's the way things are
- Say it, brother! </i>

589
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:04,249
<i> When I'm human,  </i>

590
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:06,291
<i> and I'm gonna be </i>

591
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:08,663
<i> I'm gonna tear it up like I did before </i>

592
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,044
<i> that's a royal guarantee </i>

593
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:13,338
You are getting married!

594
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:17,584
All right. I just have to leave a
string of broken hearts behind me.

595
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,834
<i> Your modesty becomes you </i>

596
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,042
<i> and your sense of responsibility </i>

597
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,549
<i> I worked hard for everything I got </i>

598
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:26,562

599
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,688
<i> When I'm a human being </i>

600
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:30,823
<i> at least I'll act like one </i>

601
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:33,520
<i> if you do your best

602
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:35,644
<i> good things are sure to come your way </i>

603
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,952
<i> What you give is what you get! </i>

604
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:40,299
<i> My daddy said that
and now I'll never forget </i>

605
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:42,631
<i> and I amend it to you </i>

606
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:44,781
<i> When we're human </i>

607
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,643
<i> and we're gonna be </i>

608
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,507
<i> I'm gonna blow my horn! </i>

609
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,965
<i> I'm gonna live the high life! </i>

610
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,854
<i> I'm gonna do my best
to take my place in the sun </i>

611
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:04,820
<i> When we're human! </i>

612
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,626
Oh, Prince Naveen, dear.

613
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:23,341
I am positively mortified you had
to endure that frog fiasco last night.

614
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:29,159
Well, when you’re next in line for the throne,
you’re poised like a panther,

615
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,778
ready to expect the unexpected.

616
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:40,507
- Y-your ear?
- What?

617
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:49,524
Oh, there's pesky mosquitoes...
everywhere.

618
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,435
Get in here!

619
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:57,618
Please, Miss Charlotte, I can no longer
ignore the throbbing of my...

620
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,143
Heart.

621
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:05,887
Even though our time together's been brief,
it's been heavenly.

622
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:09,243
Let it...Place, Prince Naveen,

623
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,775
You got me blushin' 'til I...

624
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:18,098
Would you do me the honor of becoming
Princess of Maldonia?

625
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:21,581
Are you serious?

626
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,512
As the plague.

627
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:24,825
Yes!

628
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,242
Oh, I most definitely will marry you!

629
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:29,135
Oh, there's so much to plan!

630
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,967
The guest list! The dress! The music!
The flowers! The shoes!

631
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:36,235
We're gonna have ourselves
a Mardi Gras weddin'.

632
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,051
No!

633
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,549
What we do now?

634
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:48,681
Because somebody let
our frog prince go, Larry ...

635
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:53,141
I'm reduced to ask for help from
my friends on the other side.

636
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,979
- Now, that restaurant of yours, is it gonna have étouffée?
- Jambalaya, gumbo ...It's gonna have it all!

637
00:42:58,982 --> 00:43:02,726
- It's gonna have it all!
- I always wanted to try red beans and rice,

638
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:05,676
- Muffulettas, po' boys...
- Stop Louis.

639
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,819
You two are making me so very hungry.

640
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,796
Interesting.

641
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:17,029
What are you doing?

642
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:19,472
You are frightening the food.

643
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:24,162
This is harder than it looks.

644
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,898
What? Oh, no!
No, no, no!

645
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:43,616
There is no way I'm kissing a frog
and eating a bug on the same day. .

646
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:02,299
- Hello
- What are you doin'?

647
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,361
- Stop moving!

648
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:07,087
- You are making this very difficult.
- Y'all found anything to eat yet, ah?

649
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,486
Oh, my!

650
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:11,096
Hang on. Old Louis gotta comin'.

651
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:12,965
No, no, no, no ...

652
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:16,319
How's that?

653
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,059
This could be a little better.

654
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,748
You know what this needs? A shaft stick!
Be right back!

655
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:27,769
- This is all your fault!
- My fault... my fault ...

656
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:30,654
Let me tell you something. I was...

657
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:32,414
Well, look at you!

658
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:36,845
Girl, I guess you and your boyfriend
got a little carried away, am I right, am I right?

659
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:40,795
- No, no, no, that's not possible!
- ... I am the prince of Maldonia!

660
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:44,146
Let me shine a little light on the situation.

661
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,877
'cuse me. One more time now.

662
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,862
That's cool.

663
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:00,336
Oh, it's ok baby, I'm not gonna explode me.
I ain't no fire cracka!

664
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:02,564
Got my big butt roundness.

665
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:06,581
Right. Women like a man
with big back porch.

666
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:09,860
Oh you know...
You are done this a real goof of somethin'.

667
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:11,248
Nobody's going to help?

668
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:13,431
- Oh, dear!
- Hang on, cap'.

669
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:15,371
I'm just..

670
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:18,471
Get the noise comin' out.

671
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:23,533
<i>I'll catch the fish. Get one, get two.</i>

672
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,209
<i>Aroun' a  fishing time</i>

673
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:32,311
‘Bout time I introduce myself.

674
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,168
My name Raymond,
but everybody call me Ray..

675
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:39,199
Pardon me, but your accent...
It's funny, you know?

676
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:43,072
Ok Jimbrah'.
Born branded the Bayou.

677
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,947
You must be a new around here, ah ?

678
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,350
Actually, we're from the place ...

679
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:49,972
Far, far away from this world.

680
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:52,453
Go to bed. Y'all from Shreveport ?

681
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:57,161
No, no, no.
We are people!

682
00:45:57,163 --> 00:46:00,743
The prince charming here got himself turned
into a frog by a voodoo witch doctor.

683
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:02,471
Well, there you go.

684
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:05,039
And we are on a way to Mama Odie's,
we think maybe she could...

685
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:07,150
Mama Odie?

686
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,954
You are headin' the wrong direction,cher.

687
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:12,554
Now what kinda chucklehead told
y’all to go thisa way?

688
00:46:12,556 --> 00:46:14,134
I found the stick!

689
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,074
Louis ...

690
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,516
Ray here says you've been taking us
in the wrong direction.

691
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:26,846
I was ...listen,
I was confused by the topography and...

692
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:29,791
The geography and choreography.

693
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,809
Fist rule the Bayou. Never take
the rescue from a gator.

694
00:46:34,987 --> 00:46:38,133
Me and my relations those
will help you yard the way.

695
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:40,953
Achedanza! (Cool).

696
00:46:40,955 --> 00:46:44,747
Cousin Randy, You are ready for
the Bayou Zydeco.

697
00:46:44,749 --> 00:46:46,615
Ready when you are, cousin Ray!

698
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:49,498
Alright, Lulu!

<i> There goes Mimi!

708
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,714
<i> Grandma Ma, </i>

709
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,124
<i> you're light on! </i>

710
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,759
<i> We all gon' pool together </i>

711
00:47:23,892 --> 00:47:25,994
<i> Down here that's how we do! </i>

00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,485
<i> Me for them, and them for me, </i>

713
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:30,365

724
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:06,198
Friends, I know I'm in hack to
you all pretty deep already,

725
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:11,200
but it seems or little froggy prince lost his way.

726
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:14,216
And I need your generous assistance getting him back.

727
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:18,930
Hahaha, I hear you. Now, what's in it for you?

728
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:20,451
Well...

729
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:26,063
As soon as I dispose of "Big Daddy" La Bouff,
then I'm gonna run this town.

730
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:32,969
I'll have the entire city of New Orleans
in the palm of my hand.

731
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:39,145
And you'll have all the wayward souls
your dark little hearts desire.

732
00:48:44,377 --> 00:48:46,259
You all love that, don't you?

733
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:50,331
So, we got ourselves a deal?

734
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:06,333
Hahaha! Now we're cooking!
We're gonna find ourselves a frog.

735
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:11,659
Search everywhere: The bayou, the quarter...
bring him to me alive.

736
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:13,632
I need his heart pumping...

737
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:15,536
For now.

738
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:17,387
Allez, tout de suite!

739
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:38,294
- Ray will take you the rest of way!
- Nice meetin' you all!

740
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,883
- Bye, Bye pooky!
- Adieu, bye, bye amis.

741
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:44,363
And don't forget to tell Angela
that Ray said Bonjour!

742
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,404
- That's your girl?
- Oh, no, no, no ...

743
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:52,845
- My girl...does Evangeline.
- Evangeline?

744
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:56,468
She is the most prettiest
butterfly ever did glow.

745
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,225
You know, I talk to Evangeline
almost every night.

746
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:03,548
She is kind of shy, not say much.

747
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:09,413
But I know in my heart
someday we gonna be together.

748
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:13,289
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Yes, so sweet ...

749
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:16,657
Just do not settle down so quickly, friend.

750
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:19,389
There are plenty of fireflies
in this world.

751
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:21,533
What?

752
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:25,684
Prick ambushers got me ...

753
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:28,320
Get down, get down!

754
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:33,092
Darkness ... it's closin' in.
I'm so cold.

755
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:35,175
Will you hold still, big baby?

756
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,786
I touched you.

757
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:46,132
Oh, take a look at that two jumpers.

758
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:51,055
I can taste the frog legs already...

759
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,257
With a sauce picante, right Pa?

760
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,244
Will you keep quiet!

761
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,927
Oh, my thought is exactly the same.

762
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:07,822
It's time to catch up some frogs.

763
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:19,320
You know, waitress, I finally
figured out what is wrong with you.

764
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:23,506
- Have you, now?
- You do not know how to have fun.

765
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:25,650
There. Somebody had to say it.

766
00:51:25,653 --> 00:51:29,576
Thank you, 'cause I figured out
what your problem is too.

767
00:51:29,578 --> 00:51:31,664
I am... too wonderful?

768
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:36,167
No, you're a no-count, polandering,
lazy bump on a log.

769
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:38,938
Ahaha... Killjoy.

770
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,766
- What'd you say?
- Ah, nothing.

771
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,832
- Stick in the mud.
- Listen here, mister.

772
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:48,013
This stick in the mud has had to
work two jobs her whole life

773
00:51:48,015 --> 00:51:50,165
while you've been sucking on a silver spoon

774
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:53,206
chasing chamber maids around your...
your ivory tower!

775
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,037
Actually, it's polished marble.

776
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,168
Uh, I got me one, boys!

777
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,186
Get the little one over there.

778
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:14,642
The hunt was good today, yes indeed?

779
00:52:15,588 --> 00:52:16,996
Hunters with guns!

780
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:23,376
Look at his big frog legs.
I will mixed them...

781
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:27,797
Oh, no, no, no.
A bug gotta do what a bug gotta do!

782
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:40,890
I think I got chipped my favorite tooth.

783
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:48,034
Here I come, Two Fingers, I'll help.

784
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,116
Pa, we got one.

785
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,221
Be on quiet y'all.

786
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:59,945
- What happened to yours?
- Shut your preaft, Darnell.

787
00:53:00,283 --> 00:53:01,743
I'm free!

788
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:19,115
Pa, did you hear that suspicious tide?

789
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:23,868
Yeah ...
I surely did.

790
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:30,743
What you two cockin' head...?

791
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,714
Just miss it there.

792
00:53:35,203 --> 00:53:38,442
I will make them dessert legs.

793
00:53:39,677 --> 00:53:41,696
- Come on, go.

794
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:43,648
Stop.

795
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:47,854
No, no, no, you idiot, don't shoot.

796
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:52,316
Watch this.

797
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,285
Missed it!

798
00:54:00,244 --> 00:54:01,852
Get out of way!

799
00:54:13,809 --> 00:54:17,687
These two ain't like no frogs
I've ever seen.

800
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:21,087
- They're smart.
- And we talk, too.

801
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,268
You alright there, little bud?

802
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:38,651
Oh, I'm fine...
but your breath done killed me to death!

803
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,920
Would you mind?

804
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,233
I got you cover, brah.

805
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:48,752
Ah, much obliged, PeeWee.
Now how about ...

806
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:50,629
The other side.

807
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:56,244
And we talk too. I like that!
You are secretly funny.

808
00:54:56,246 --> 00:54:59,266
- Not a stick in the mud?
- W-well I was...

809
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:01,865
- Say it. -Co... - Say it.
- All right... You're not exactly...

810
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:05,276
- I can't hear you, I'm sorry. What?
- ...a complete stick deep in the mud.

811
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:08,766
Easy!
Easy!

812
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:10,196
I get this one in there, in it,  now hold on.

813
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:16,361
Sug', I know we got to get to
Mama Odie lingering split but ...

814
00:55:16,364 --> 00:55:20,486
This particular extract provocation
grant take a while, yeah.

815
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:24,103
- Oh, poor Louis.
- You know what would make me feel better?

816
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:28,223
Crawfish snuged in Remoulade Sauce.

817
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,709
- Slow down!
- Got a lil more!

818
00:55:29,711 --> 00:55:32,354
Some banana foster
sprinkled with brollies.

819
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:37,247
- How about swamp gumbo?
- That'll do.

820
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,618
Sounds delicious! I'll start with free dinner cocktail
and something to nibble on, while I wait, thanks.

821
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:47,257
No, no, no, no, Your Royal Highness.
- What's a matter?

822
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,106
- You are gonna to mince this mushrooms.
- To do what?

823
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:51,855
Mince the mushrooms.

824
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:54,047
Hop, to it!

825
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,657
- This is ridiculous.
- Are you mincing?

826
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:59,075
All right ...
Relax.

827
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,819
One!

828
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:14,170
Step aside, Mister.

829
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,279
Watch ...
And learn.

830
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:22,375
- All right.

831
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:29,534
- There you go.
- You know, I never done anything like this before.

832
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:30,342
- Really?

833
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:32,066
All right.

834
00:56:32,101 --> 00:56:34,426
But, when you are livin' in a castle
everything is done for you:

835
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:38,820
all the time they dress you, they feed you,
drive you...

836
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,233
Brush your teeth!

837
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,353
Aw, poor baby.

838
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:49,422
I admitted it was a charmed life, until the day
my parents cut me off, and suddenly I realized...

839
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:51,545
I don't know how to do anything.

840
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,103
Well hey ...

841
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:02,007
You've got to make some descent mushrooms mincer, ok?

842
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:07,280
- Oh, you think so?
- Keep practicing and I just might hire you.

843
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:08,600
- Really?
- No.

844
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,554
Come on ...

845
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:13,492
What was that?!
That was below the frog belt...

846
00:57:30,397 --> 00:57:34,341
You said hello and he said what.
And you said:

847
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,197
Get a ugly face in...

848
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:41,545
- Anyone for seconds?
- That was magnificent...

849
00:57:41,547 --> 00:57:43,730
You truly have a gift.

850
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:46,565
Well!
Thank you!

851
00:57:48,563 --> 00:57:54,638
There she is.
The sweetest firefly of all creation.

852
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:55,976
Evangeline?

853
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:59,249
I want to meet this girl, where she is?

854
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:04,262
How can you miss her,
she glows right up there, in front of you.

855
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:10,377
<i> Look how she lights up the sky </i>

856
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:15,822
<i> Ma belle Evangeline </i>

857
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:17,665
Oh, that ain't no firefly, that's a...

858
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:21,343
<i> So far above me yet I </i>

859
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:27,390
<i> Know her heart belongs to only me </i>

860
00:58:28,002 --> 00:58:31,328
<i>- J t'adore. - I adore you.
- Je t'aime. - I love you.</i>

861
00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:33,300
<i> -Evangeline
- I'm just translating!  </i>

862
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:36,468
<i> You're my queen of the night </i>

863
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:39,685
<i> So still, so bright </i>

864
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:44,351
<i> To someone as beautiful as she </i>

865
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:51,184
<i> Who loves someone like me
- No, no. I don't dance. </i>

866
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:56,231
<i> - Love always finds a way, it's true
- I've never danced. </i>

867
00:58:56,234 --> 00:59:02,703
<i> - And I love you Evangeline
- If I can mince, you can dance. - Oooh, yeah! </i>

868
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,902
<i> Love is beautiful </i>

869
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:27,681
<i> Love is wonderful </i>

870
00:59:28,513 --> 00:59:33,254
<i> Love is everything, do you agree? </i>

871
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:34,168
<i> Mais oui! </i>

872
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:40,106
<i> Look how she lights up the sky </i>

873
00:59:41,284 --> 00:59:47,073
<i> I love you, Evangeline </i>

874
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,557
Ah, Lottie's goodness for a heck of a dance partner.

875
00:59:59,624 --> 01:00:03,175
We ...
Best we pushin' on.

876
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,418
- Tiana!
- Naveen!

877
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:16,298
No, no, no.

878
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:40,615
Not bad for a 197 year old blind lady.

879
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:48,374
Now, which one of you naughty kiddy been messing
with the Shadow Man?

880
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,184
We so glad we found you Mama Odie.

881
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:56,836
Ray and Louis here been tellin' us all about you.

882
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:01,130
We've been travelling quite a long way.
And you can't imagine what we've been through. And we...

883
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:04,585
- And we heard that you ...
- Juju!

884
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:10,148
Come on, over here,
you bad boy.

885
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:13,207
Give a little sugar now.

886
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:18,637
You just dooz your mama, don't you?

887
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:22,631
Good to see you again, Ray.

888
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:25,649
- How's your grandmama?
- Oh, she's fine.

889
01:01:25,651 --> 01:01:29,004
Got in a little trouble for flashing
the neighbors again.

890
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:33,637
- Ouh! I like that gal's spunk.
- Mama Odie ...

891
01:01:35,123 --> 01:01:38,382
- We don't want to take too much of your time.
- You want some candies?

892
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:41,744
- No, not really.
- No, no thank you.

893
01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:45,765
Well now, that's too bad. This is a special candy.

894
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:49,427
- Woulda turn y'all human.
- No, no, no, please.

895
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:52,424
I'm just messing with y'all.

896
01:01:52,427 --> 01:01:55,419
How on earth did you know that we want to turn back...

897
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:01,656
- Mama Odie?
- Juju!

898
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:04,986
Why didn't you tell me my gumbo was burnin'?

899
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:09,207
You sure this is the right blind voodoo lady
who lives in the boat in the tree in the bayou?

900
01:02:09,243 --> 01:02:10,705
Pretty sure.

901
01:02:11,446 --> 01:02:14,557
- I can't believe this,
got to do everythin' around here.

902
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,137
- Mama Odie, if you ...
- Taste it.

903
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,607
- Well?
- Hit it hard with a couple of shots of Tabasco,

904
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:23,817
and it's the bee's knees!
Now, can we...

905
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,280
- Juju!

906
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:33,143
That's got some zydin' to it.

907
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,293
I guess that's what we needed.

908
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:39,310
Now, you figured out what you need?

909
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,182
It's just like you said, Mama Odie.
We need to be human.

910
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:48,880
You only got to say she was blankly?
You want to be human ...

911
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:51,923
But you blind to what you need.

912
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:55,490
What we want, what we need ...
It's all the same thing, yes?

913
01:02:55,756 --> 01:02:58,320
It's the same thing?
No!

914
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,101
You listen to your Mama now.

915
01:03:02,966 --> 01:03:04,727
<i> Don't matter what you look like </i>

916
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:07,144
<i> Don't matter what you wear </i>

917
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,827
<i> How many rings you got on your finger </i>

918
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:12,641
<i> We don't care
- No we don't care </i>

919
01:03:12,777 --> 01:03:14,460
<i> Don't matter where you come from </i>

920
01:03:14,948 --> 01:03:16,850
<i> Don't even matter what you are </i>

921
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:20,671
<i> A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat
Had 'em all in here </i>

922
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:24,037
<i> We had 'em all in here
And they all knew what they wanted </i>

923
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:26,278
<i> What they wanted me to do </i>

924
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:29,011
<i> I told 'em what they needed </i>

925
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:31,616
<i> Just like I be telling you </i>

926
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,026
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

927
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:36,196
<i> Find out who you are </i>

928
01:03:36,587 --> 01:03:38,982
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

929
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:41,241
<i> It really ain't that far </i>

930
01:03:41,502 --> 01:03:43,836
<i> When you find out who you are </i>

931
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,171
<i> You'll find out what you need </i>

932
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:50,048
<i> Blue skies and sunshine guaranteed </i>

933
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,901
<i> You got to dig
- Dig </i>

934
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,201
<i> You got to dig
- Dig </i>

935
01:03:56,736 --> 01:04:00,969
<i> Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You wanna be rich again </i>

936
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:05,632
<i> That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then? </i>

937
01:04:05,635 --> 01:04:07,099
<i> No! </i>

938
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:10,975
<i> Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart </i>

939
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:15,926
<i> All you need is some self-control
Make yourself a brand new start </i>

940
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:18,190
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

941
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:20,495
<i> Don't have far to go </i>

942
01:04:20,497 --> 01:04:23,050
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

943
01:04:23,795 --> 01:04:25,887
<i> Tell the people Mama told you so </i>

944
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:30,837
<i> Can't tell you what you'll find
Maybe love will grant you peace of mind </i>

945
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:33,942
<i> Dig a little deeper and you'll know </i>

946
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:37,339
<i> - Miss Froggy,
- Ma'am ? </i>

947
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,860
<i> - Might I have a word?
- Yes, Ma'am. </i>

948
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,582
<i> You's a hard one,
that's what I heard </i>

949
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:49,895
<i> Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through </i>

950
01:04:50,663 --> 01:04:54,984
<i> You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him you got in you </i>

951
01:04:54,987 --> 01:04:57,421
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

952
01:04:57,746 --> 01:04:59,737
<i> For you it's gonna be tough </i>

953
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:02,309
<i> You got to dig a little deeper </i>

954
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:05,112
<i> You ain't dug near far enough </i>

955
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:09,564
<i> Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll find out what you need </i>

956
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,390
<i> Blue skies and sunshine guaranteed </i>

957
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:17,990
<i> Open up the windows
Let in the light children </i>

958
01:05:17,993 --> 01:05:19,722
<i> Blue skies and sunshine </i>

959
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,424
<i> Blue skies and sunshine </i>

960
01:05:22,774 --> 01:05:27,998
<i> Blue skies and sunshine </i>

961
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:32,185
<i>Guaranteed...</i>

962
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:45,131
Well, Miss Froggy?
Do you understand what you need now, child?

963
01:05:45,134 --> 01:05:47,348
Yes! I do, Mama Odie.

964
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:51,901
I need to dig a little deeper and work
even harder to get my restaurant.

965
01:05:54,324 --> 01:05:56,844
All right y'all, one more time.

966
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:59,574
<i> It don't matter what you look like
It don't...</i>

967
01:05:59,894 --> 01:06:03,010
Nobody goin' to sing with Ray?
Okay.

968
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:09,093
Well, if you swell on bein' human
there's only one way.

969
01:06:10,854 --> 01:06:14,251
<i> Gumbo, gumbo in the pot, </i>

970
01:06:14,532 --> 01:06:16,303
<i> We need a precious. </i>

971
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:18,322
<i> What we got?! </i>

972
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:25,929
- Lottie? But she is not a princess!
- Oh, shut and look at gumbo!

973
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:31,786
That's right ... Big Daddy
is king of Mardi Gras parade.

974
01:06:32,373 --> 01:06:34,223
So, that makes Lottie...

975
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,173
- A princess.
- Does that count?

976
01:06:38,209 --> 01:06:43,327
Yes it does, but only 'til midnight,
when Mardi Gras is over.

977
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:49,266
Hop-Lone, you only got 'til the end
to got that princess to kiss you.

978
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:50,859
Once she does ...

979
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:56,168
- You both turnin' human.
- Midnight?

980
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,940
- That doesn't give us much time at all.
- What about me, Mama?

981
01:06:58,942 --> 01:07:01,966
I want to be human too,
so I can play jazz with the big boys.

982
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:06,409
I want fingers, and toes, and a belly button,
Not the kind that sticks out, but the kind that goes in…

983
01:07:06,412 --> 01:07:10,727
Big Jaws, you dig little deeper,
you'll find everythin' you need.

984
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,039
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon...

985
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,920
You got a river to run here, darling.

986
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:17,388
- Y'all best get to swimmin'.
- Wait...

987
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:19,922
I've got a better idea.

988
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,035
They got guns!

989
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:43,685
Bam, that is one Killer Diller costume.

990
01:07:44,722 --> 01:07:46,379
Hey dale, can you blow that horn?

991
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:52,576
- Come on, stay in with us.
- We play on Mardi Gras.

992
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,123
We can miss this.
Little Louis gonna finally play with the big boys.

993
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:06,021
Naveen, you comin'?

994
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:08,997
I'll catch up with you later.

995
01:08:25,777 --> 01:08:29,415
Oh, Evangeline ... why I can't just look
Tiana in the eyes and say:

996
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:33,614
I will do whatever it takes
to make all your dreams come true, because ...

997
01:08:34,422 --> 01:08:35,792
Because I love you.

998
01:08:35,793 --> 01:08:39,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cap'.
You are makin' googoo eyes on my girl?

999
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:43,458
Got you!
I will make some shoes out of you.

1000
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,134
Ray, I'm not in love with Evangeline
I am in love with Tiana.

1001
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:52,293
- I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. You come here, you...
- I can't no longer marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff.

1002
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:55,282
- You will be so happy together.
- I will find another way to get Tiana a restaurant.

1003
01:08:55,318 --> 01:08:58,269
- You coulda have a cute, little ted frog.
- I'll get job, maybe two.

1004
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:00,917
- Maybe three?
- I can't wait to tell her.

1005
01:09:02,019 --> 01:09:06,902
- No, no, no. I must tell her. Alone.
- Right, you bet...

1006
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:13,859
- Where are you taking me?
- Oh, I just...

1007
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:17,596
wanted to show you little something to
celebrate our last night together as frogs.

1008
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:29,289
Oh... All my years.
No one's ever done anything like this for me.

1009
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:34,875
I - it is too much, isn't it? Um...

1010
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:38,051
- Thank you, Bow.
- I thought it was a nice touch.

1011
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:42,325
Pretend you did not see that.
Please, please sit down.

1012
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,533
- What's this?
- Ta-da!

1013
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:48,950
- You minced!
- I did!

1014
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,485
You have had quite an influence on me.

1015
01:09:51,797 --> 01:09:55,065
Which is amazing because I have dated
thousands of women and...

1016
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:58,671
No, like two, three... just other women!

1017
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:02,319
A-and anyway, you could not be more different!
You know, you are - you are practically,

1018
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,896
one of the guys!

1019
01:10:03,897 --> 01:10:07,108
No no no! You are not a guy!
Let me begin again! Uh...

1020
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:11,533
Ha... I am not myself tonight. Tiana!

1021
01:10:11,658 --> 01:10:13,202
Sorry, that was loud.

1022
01:10:13,884 --> 01:10:16,312
This is a disaster.

1023
01:10:16,555 --> 01:10:18,102
No, it's cute.

1024
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:23,322
- Tiana ... I ...
- There it is!

1025
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,003
Your restaurant?

1026
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,490
Oh, can you just picture it?
All lit up like the Fourth of July.

1027
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,751
Yes, jazz pouring out from every window.

1028
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:35,424
- It should be elegant.
- You should keep it loose, don't get it let

1029
01:10:35,426 --> 01:10:36,768
Swing.

1030
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,158
- You know good ukulele players.
- Really? You let me perform?

1031
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,725
I'll talk to the owner ...
Owner says...yes.

1032
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:49,319
Folks are gonna be comin' together from all
walks of life just to get a taste of our food.

1033
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:51,275
Our food?

1034
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,688
Oh no, no, no. My Daddy...

1035
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,623
He always wanted open this restaurant.

1036
01:10:58,813 --> 01:11:00,832
He died before he could see it happened.

1037
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:06,785
But tomorrow ... with your help.
Our dreams are finally comin' true.

1038
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:10,639
- Tomorrow?
- If I don't deliver that money first thing tomorrow,

1039
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,601
I lose this place forever.

1040
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:18,101
Tiana, I love ...

1041
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:27,060
The way you light up
when you talk about your dream.

1042
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,190
A dream that it is so beautiful
I ...

1043
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:33,046
I promise ...

1044
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:35,727
I will do whatever it takes to make it come true.

1045
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:41,667
Port of New Orleans.
All ashore.

1046
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,972
I. .. I'll go run up the boys.

1047
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,644
Evangeline ...

1048
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:04,362
I've always been so sure about what i wanted.
But now ...

1049
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:07,649
What do I do?

1050
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:10,342
Please tell me.

1051
01:12:16,186 --> 01:12:17,797
Prince Naveen, darlin'.

1052
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,047
You better hurry up.

1053
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:22,871
Don't wanna be late for
our Mardi Gras weddin'.

1054
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,767
<i> Getting dressed </i>

1055
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,274
Just a few moments, my dear Charlotte.

1056
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:30,345
<i> Okay, honeylame.
We'll been waitin' in the packwood. </i>

1057
01:12:30,772 --> 01:12:32,980
Daddy, start the car!

1058
01:12:33,274 --> 01:12:35,850
Oh, heavens ... I'm doomed.

1059
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,151
No, Larry. I'm the one who's doomed.

1060
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,466
Less me get that frog's blood...

1061
01:12:45,798 --> 01:12:47,394
No!

1062
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:50,774
We are back in business, boys.

1063
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:53,887
Get your filthy hands off me.

1064
01:12:54,088 --> 01:12:55,868
Lawrence?

1065
01:12:56,562 --> 01:12:58,575
Hold still, Your Eminence.

1066
01:13:04,868 --> 01:13:06,268
<i> Ray </i>

1067
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:07,654
Haven't seen Naveen?

1068
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:11,526
- Look at you, where's the ring at?
- What are you talking about?

1069
01:13:12,913 --> 01:13:15,346
Well, if captain say nothing
I ain't gonna say nothing.

1070
01:13:15,348 --> 01:13:18,884
Because old Ray sealed up tight as a drum
you ain't got nothin' out of me, no!

1071
01:13:18,886 --> 01:13:20,856
- Ray?
- Okay, captain ain't gonna marry Charlotte

1072
01:13:20,858 --> 01:13:21,725
he gonna marry you.

1073
01:13:21,726 --> 01:13:24,140
soon as he get himself kissed, and you
both turn human, he go find a job,

1074
01:13:24,142 --> 01:13:25,504
get you that restaurant.

1075
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:29,020
- I said too much, didn't I?
- You said just enough, Ray!

1076
01:13:29,022 --> 01:13:30,856
Thank you, Evangeline.

1077
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:44,286
He was trying to propose,
that's what all that fun was about.

1078
01:13:44,288 --> 01:13:47,484
And here I thought, all he wanted
was to marry a rich girl.

1079
01:13:47,892 --> 01:13:50,272
Sug', what are we looking for in here?

1080
01:13:50,274 --> 01:13:53,732
You just keep your eyes at one of
of the biggest godies float

1081
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:59,945
with a Mardi Gras princess
about to kissed herself a ...a frog.

1082
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:06,533
<i> Dear beloved, we are gathered here
tonight in this fine celebration </i>

1083
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:12,423
<i> to join together this prince and
this young woman in holy matrimony. </i>

1084
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:17,719
Oh, no, this can't be right, darlin'.
Then how you can still be a frog?

1085
01:14:18,077 --> 01:14:19,563
Mama Odie...she's...

1086
01:14:36,111 --> 01:14:40,106
I know what we've seen with our eyes but...

1087
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:46,285
If we just go back there
we gonna find that your fairy tale come true.

1088
01:14:46,288 --> 01:14:48,600
Just because you wish for somethin',
doesn't make it true.

1089
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:53,785
- It's like my Evangeline always said to me ...
- Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray!

1090
01:14:53,788 --> 01:14:57,630
A big ball of hot air a million miles from here.

1091
01:14:58,813 --> 01:15:00,776
Open your eyes now!

1092
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,618
Before you get hurted.

1093
01:15:11,244 --> 01:15:15,174
She's just big in a broken heart...
That's all it is.

1094
01:15:16,456 --> 01:15:21,199
Come on Evangeline.
We gonna show sug' the truth.

1095
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:26,272
<i> If any of you, object to the union
of this two people <i>

1096
01:15:26,309 --> 01:15:29,771
<i> speak now or forever hold your plea. </i>

1097
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:32,208
Me, Me, I object.

1098
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:37,551
<i> Do you, Prince Naveen, take
Charlotte to be your wife ...</i>

1099
01:15:37,588 --> 01:15:39,077
Cap, what are you doing, son?

1100
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:45,443
<i> ...as long as you both shall live? </i>

1101
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:49,214
What? I do ...
Yes, I'm for it.

1102
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:52,117
Is that you, cap?

1103
01:15:52,118 --> 01:15:54,082
Ray, get me out of this box!

1104
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,315
I can't hear you,
I'll go get you out of this box.

1105
01:15:57,317 --> 01:16:02,423
<i>...as long as you both shall live? </i>

1106
01:16:02,879 --> 01:16:04,231
Oh, I do.

1107
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:08,655
<i> Then so, by the power invested in me
by the state of Louisiana </i>

1108
01:16:08,658 --> 01:16:10,076
I now pronounce you ...

1109
01:16:10,452 --> 01:16:12,419
Man and. ..

1110
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:13,223
Prince Naveen!

1111
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:22,908
- Goodness gracious! Are you all right?
- I just need a moment to compose myself.

1112
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,769
Cheese and crackers!

1113
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:27,051
Lawrence, why are you doing this?

1114
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:30,100
It's payback for all those years of...

1115
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:32,521
- Humiliation.
- Get your royal a...

1116
01:16:32,523 --> 01:16:35,094
back on that wedding cake
and finish this deal.

1117
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,158
What is he doing?
Stop him!

1118
01:16:39,138 --> 01:16:40,818
I got him.

1119
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:42,963
He got me too!

1120
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:46,795
- Gimme that!
- Stay on the side!

1121
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,654
Ray?

1122
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,205
<i> Hey, why did you stop? </i>

1123
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:10,807
- Sug'? Sug'?
- Ray?

1124
01:17:10,809 --> 01:17:13,778
This proves what we saw
ain't what we thought we saw.

1125
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,498
- What is this?
- It's voodoo, hydeco?

1126
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:19,012
The Shadow Man, he's been usin' voodoo...

1127
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:24,608
You can't let Shadow Man get this, no matter what.
Now run girl, run!

1128
01:17:24,977 --> 01:17:27,691
Do not make me light my butt.

1129
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:34,716
I got lightin' on me.
Come here, you!

1130
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:37,492
Ok, come!

1131
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,375
Ray!

1132
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:54,102
What ...

1133
01:17:54,906 --> 01:17:56,284
Ray?

1134
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,369
Back off! Or I'm gonna break this
into a million pieces.

1135
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:32,308
Naveen?

1136
01:18:36,134 --> 01:18:41,453
Now, isn't this whole life better than hoppin'
around bayou for the rest of your life??

1137
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:43,830
Shadow Man?

1138
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:46,938
Got a head to you, Tiana.

1139
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,999
When you dream, you dream big.

1140
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:55,970
Just look at this place! Gonna be the crown
jewel of the cursancy.

1141
01:18:57,304 --> 01:19:00,533
And all you got to do,
to make this reality

1142
01:19:00,873 --> 01:19:03,637
It's handle that little talisman of mine.

1143
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:08,605
No.
This-this is not right.

1144
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:13,364
Come on, darlin'?
Think of everything you sacrificed.

1145
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:17,422
<i> - Girl, all you ever do is work.
- I told y'all she wouldn't come. </i>

1146
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:21,056
Think of all those maecenas who doubted you.

1147
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:27,603
<i> - You ain't never gonna get enough for the dang payment.
- Woman of your background, you better off will y'all. </i>

1148
01:19:28,437 --> 01:19:30,650
And don't forget your poor Daddy.

1149
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:36,505
<i> - Now, that was one hard working man.
- See you tomorrow, James! </i>

1150
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:39,780
Double, sometimes triple shifts.

1151
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:44,917
Never let know how bone tired,
beat darlin' really was.

1152
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,898
<i> - Daddy!
- Hey, babby cakes. </i>

1153
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:55,143
Shame on that hard work, didn't amount
much more than a busted up, old gumbo pot.

1154
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:58,260
And a dream that never get off the back porch.

1155
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:00,002
But you ...

1156
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:05,579
You can give your poor Daddy
everything he ever wanted.

1157
01:20:07,505 --> 01:20:09,367
Come on, Tiana.

1158
01:20:10,059 --> 01:20:12,310
You're almost there.

1159
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,440
My Daddy never did get what he wanted.

1160
01:20:23,474 --> 01:20:25,160
But he had what he needed.

1161
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,482
He had love.

1162
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:31,355
- Never lost a sight what was really important.
- Easy with that! Careful!

1163
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,109
And neither will I.

1164
01:20:41,223 --> 01:20:46,001
Y'all should've taken my deal.
Now you will spend the rest of your life

1165
01:20:46,004 --> 01:20:48,490
bein' a slimy little frog!

1166
01:20:49,163 --> 01:20:52,023
I got news for you, Shadow Man!

1167
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:54,545
It's not slime, it's mucus!

1168
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:59,774
No! No!

1169
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:04,658
How am I ever gonna pay back my debt?!

1170
01:21:06,782 --> 01:21:09,910
<i> - Friends!
- Are you ready? </i>

1171
01:21:10,304 --> 01:21:15,527
<i> - No! I'm not ready at all! In fact, I got lots more plans!
- Are you ready? </i>

1172
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:18,853
This is just a minor setback in a major operation!

1173
01:21:19,517 --> 01:21:22,486
As soon as I whip up another spell,
we'll be back in business!

1174
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:25,297
I still got that froggy prince locked away!

1175
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,612
I just need a little more time.

1176
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:30,903
No! No, please, no!

1177
01:21:32,716 --> 01:21:34,086
Just a little more time!

1178
01:21:36,409 --> 01:21:39,479
I promise I'll pay y'all back! I promise!

1179
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:57,693
<i> Prince! Prince Naveen </i>

1180
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:01,893
Your shini', retirin' bride,
completely is gettin' anxiety.

1181
01:22:04,276 --> 01:22:06,504
Hello, darling!

1182
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:10,655
<i> Miss La Bouff </i>

1183
01:22:10,988 --> 01:22:12,288
<i> Please down here. </i>

1184
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:17,807
Let me to introduce myself.
I am the real Prince Naveen!

1185
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:21,044
Of Maldonia.

1186
01:22:21,738 --> 01:22:23,599
Did you say prince?

1187
01:22:25,826 --> 01:22:30,184
- Boys, drag this maggot down to the Parish prison.
- I'm completely innocent.

1188
01:22:30,187 --> 01:22:31,861
The Shadow Man bamboozled me.

1189
01:22:32,493 --> 01:22:35,623
Goodness gracious!
This is so much to absorb.

1190
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,084
Let me see if I got this right.

1191
01:22:37,692 --> 01:22:41,815
If I kiss you before midnight,
you and Tiana will turn human again,

1192
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:45,689
and then we gonna get ourselves married
and live happily ever after!

1193
01:22:45,692 --> 01:22:47,986
- The end!
- Yeah, more or less.

1194
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:52,765
But remember, you must give Tiana all
the money she requires for her restaurant.

1195
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:54,510
Because Tiana ...

1196
01:22:57,712 --> 01:22:59,618
She is my Evangeline.

1197
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:03,268
Anything you want, sugar.

1198
01:23:04,426 --> 01:23:06,169
Pucker up, buttercup!

1199
01:23:09,322 --> 01:23:10,922
<i> - Wit!
- Tiana? </i>

1200
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:13,429
- Tiana?
- Don't do this.

1201
01:23:13,544 --> 01:23:15,647
I have to do this and we are running out of time!

1202
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:18,597
- I won't let you!
- It's the only way to get you your dream!

1203
01:23:19,123 --> 01:23:20,532
My dream?

1204
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,849
My dream wouldn't be complete...

1205
01:23:23,696 --> 01:23:25,117
Without you in it.

1206
01:23:29,444 --> 01:23:30,936
I love you, Naveen.

1207
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:38,856
- Warts and all?
- Warts and all.

1208
01:23:44,451 --> 01:23:48,865
All my life, I read about true love and fairytales, and...

1209
01:23:50,028 --> 01:23:53,133
Tia, you found it!

1210
01:23:54,818 --> 01:23:57,690
I'll kiss him! For you, honey!

1211
01:23:57,863 --> 01:23:59,946
No marriage required.

1212
01:24:03,233 --> 01:24:04,791
Oh my word!

1213
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:07,575
M-maybe that ol' clock's a little fast!

1214
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:18,563
I'm so sorry!

1215
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:23,152
<i> Tiana! Naveen! </i>

1216
01:24:26,068 --> 01:24:27,582
Louis, what is it?

1217
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:30,705
- Shadow Man lay poor Ray low!
- Ray?

1218
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:32,720
He's hurtin' awful bad.

1219
01:24:48,258 --> 01:24:49,758
Hey, sug'!

1220
01:24:50,276 --> 01:24:54,869
- How come, y'all still ...
- We are stayin' frogs, Ray.

1221
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:56,788
And we are stayin' together.

1222
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:02,988
Oh, I like that very much.

1223
01:25:05,386 --> 01:25:08,632
Evangeline like that too.

1224
01:27:08,482 --> 01:27:11,803
So, by the power invested in me ...

1225
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,827
I now pronounce you frog and wife.

1226
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:21,988
Get to it, Hop Lone,
and give your lovely bride some sugar.

1227
01:27:21,991 --> 01:27:23,345
Congratulations!

1228
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,176
This gonna be good!

1229
01:28:07,697 --> 01:28:11,904
Like I told y'all, kissing a princess
breaks the spell.

1230
01:28:11,906 --> 01:28:15,347
Once you became my wife,
that made you ...

1231
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,798
A princess.

1232
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,677
You just kissed yourself a princess!

1233
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,494
And I'm about to do it again!

1234
01:29:19,098 --> 01:29:20,568
<i> In the South Land there's </i>

1235
01:29:20,604 --> 01:29:22,039
<i> A city </i>

1236
01:29:22,636 --> 01:29:24,678
<i> Way down on the river </i>

1237
01:29:25,512 --> 01:29:28,584
<i> Where the women are very pretty </i>

1238
01:29:28,587 --> 01:29:31,313
<i> And all the men deliver </i>

1239
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:35,071
<i> They got music
It's always playin' </i>

1240
01:29:35,277 --> 01:29:38,204
<i> Start in the day time, go all through the night </i>

1241
01:29:38,421 --> 01:29:41,442
<i> When you hear that music playin' </i>

1242
01:29:41,478 --> 01:29:44,465
<i> Hear what I'm saying and make it feel alright </i>

1243
01:29:45,153 --> 01:29:47,920
Who would've thought the prince
woulda had a younger brother.

1244
01:29:48,995 --> 01:29:52,870
- How old did you say you were?
- I'm six and a half.

1245
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:56,859
Well, I waited this long.

1246
01:29:57,763 --> 01:30:00,429
<i> Grab somebody, come on down </i>

1247
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:03,887
<i> Bring your paintbrush, we're painting the town </i>

1248
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:08,237
<i> There's some sweetness going around </i>

1249
01:30:09,174 --> 01:30:24,090
<i> Dreams do come true in New Orleans. </i>

1250
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:29,090
