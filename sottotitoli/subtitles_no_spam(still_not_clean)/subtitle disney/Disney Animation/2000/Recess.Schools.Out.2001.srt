eventually became
secretary of education...

trying to get rid of recess again.

it was nationwide.

823

- The girl whose name is in here... Luna Pergum.

Lunae Perigeum is no lady.
It's an event. Look.

839
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,330
Once a month, the moon reaches the point
where it's closest to the Earth...

840
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,100
Lunar perigee, which in this case
happens to be 12:22 tomorrow afternoon.

841
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,770
Maybe that's when that doctor guy is gonna
shoot his laser at the moon and blow it up.

842
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,780
Close guess,
but I have another theory.

843
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:56,310
When I was up at space camp, I observed
some abnormalities in the moon's position.

844
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,680
I couldn't figure out what was
causing it, but now it all makes sense.

845
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,850
Dr. Benedict's device is not a
laser beam at all. It's a tractor beam!

846
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,590
You mean he's gonna plow the moon's
surface? Whatever will he plant?

847
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,290
Not a tractor, you goombah.

850
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,200
Theoretically,
if a powerful tractor beam...

851
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:19,210
were shot at the moon
exactly at lunar perigee,

852
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,470
it could move the moon
into another orbit.

853
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,480
Move the moon? But why
would anybody want to do that?
