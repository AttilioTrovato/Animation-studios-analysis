1
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:08,964
So there I was,
face to face with the biggest,

2
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:11,836
meanest leopard on this side
of the Serengeti. And...

3
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:14,968
You roared so loud,
his spots flew clean off.

4
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:17,410
Dad, I've heard this
like a billion times.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,449
Do you know the one where
I made the laughing hyenas...

6
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,507
Cry? Yep.

7
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,450
- The croc attack?
- Dad.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,420
OK. Think.

9
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,650
Yeah, you do that.

10
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,750
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

11
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:33,625
here's one I know you haven't heard.

12
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:39,157
It all started in the little place
I like to call...

13
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:42,827
...the wild.

14
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:48,102
<i>They were the fastest wildebeests</i>
<i>on the savannah.</i>

15
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:51,410
<i>We're talking fast.</i>

16
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,575
<i>All the other lions</i>
<i>had given up the hunt hours ago,</i>

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,413
<i>except your old man.</i>

18
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,216
<i>Fortunately, I knew a short cut.</i>

19
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,594
<i>I thought I had 'em.</i>
<i>Until the dust cleared.</i>

20
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:10,526
<i>Classic wildebeest trap.</i>

21
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,531
<i>So, what did you do next?</i>

22
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,263
<i>- What did I do?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:17,829
<i>That's when I gave them the roar.</i>

24
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,856
<i>- That's it?</i>
<i>- Hold on a sec.</i>

25
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:38,087
<i>I only thought it was over.</i>

26
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:42,530
<i>But they had a secret weapon.</i>

27
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:45,533
<i>He was the biggest wildebeest</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,468
<i>- He was 14 feet tall!</i>
<i>- Fourteen?</i>

29
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:54,033
<i>I meant 1,401 feet tall!</i>

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,010
<i>Cool.</i>

31
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,070
<i>And he had two... No, four</i>

32
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:02,083
<i>of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.</i>

33
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,283
- Whoa!
<i>- His breath was red hot!</i>

34
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,947
<i>I mean, green.</i>

35
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:10,322
<i>And he hated the environment.</i>

36
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,362
<i>To pull this off, I knew I was</i>
<i>gonna have to dig deep,</i>

37
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,420
<i>deeper than I ever had before.</i>

38
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:17,432
<i>So I swallowed my fear,</i>

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,695
<i>sucked in the biggest breath I could.</i>

40
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,100
<i>Dad, I'm ready!</i>

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,364
<i>- You got it?</i>
<i>- I got it!</i>

42
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:24,099
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!

43
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,801
Roar, son!

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,168
Story of my life.

45
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:56,797
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.

46
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey, come on. That was much better.

47
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:02,340
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.

48
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,677
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.

49
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:10,150
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.

50
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,655
- OK. Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.

51
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:16,214
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.

52
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,021
Maybe it's something technical.

53
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:21,154
Maybe you're not opening your mouth
wide enough. Like this.

54
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,893
Dad, thanks for the technical help,

55
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:28,300
but if you wanted me to roar like you,
you'd take me to the wild.

56
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:32,171
Hold on a second. We've got
everything we could ever want here.

57
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,232
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,607
- It's boring.
- Boring?

59
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,976
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.

60
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,447
But don't worry. I finally figured out

61
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,746
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?

62
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,514
The pigeons say
those green boxes go there.

63
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:48,352
Those boxes are bad news. Stay away.

64
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:51,018
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,

65
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:53,789
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.

66
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:56,889
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!

67
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,263
It's a rat!

68
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,063
Get that rat off my baby!

69
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,433
A rat?

70
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,231
Hello!

71
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,899
Silly, silly rat.

72
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,403
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little!

73
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:20,079
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby
I've ever seen!

74
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:22,818
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,927
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."

76
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:30,795
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...

77
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,994
- Octave.
- Octave!

78
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:37,966
You ready to cheer me and your old man
as we capture our fifth straight

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,373
turtle-curling title?

80
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:45,343
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?

81
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,978
So, you really think
it dropped an octave?

82
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,280
Absolutely.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,380
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.

84
00:04:56,325 --> 00:05:00,318
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol. I'll stick with the nuts.

85
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,424
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.

86
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:06,593
He's 11, but he's still roaring
at a nine-year-old level.

87
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,830
Little help here, Sammy?

88
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:13,969
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high,

89
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,568
with all those stories
about Samson the Wild.

90
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:20,945
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.

91
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:25,283
OK. I'm not gonna argue with someone
who can use my tail as dental floss.

92
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,687
- You got something right there.
- Where?

93
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,352
- No, no, other side.
- Here?

94
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,520
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.

95
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,129
<i>Attention, friends.</i>

96
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:38,564
<i>Stop by the gift shop and get</i>
<i>the most popular plush in America:</i>

97
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:40,568
<i>Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.</i>

98
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:44,037
- Look, honey! The crazy thing talks!
<i>- I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

99
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:48,304
<i>That's right. He's so cuddly.</i>
<i>And better yet, he likes you.</i>

100
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:53,906
Finally.

101
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:57,248
And the zoo will officially be ours
in T-minus three...

102
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,747
...two...

103
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,450
...and showtime!

104
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,258
Here I come!

105
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,819
Who put that bar there?

106
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:15,927
That tickles!

107
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,839
- Did too!
- Did not!

108
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,137
- Did too!
- Did not!

109
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,438
Out of my way, ya bum!

110
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,445
There's that moth-eaten koala!

111
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:28,005
I've told you flamingos
a hundred times, walk.

112
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,018
- How about an autograph?!
- Don't...

113
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:32,486
Birds! Find the string on his back!

114
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:35,649
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.

115
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,722
Off my co-captain, now.

116
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:40,261
Sorry, Samson.

117
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,724
That didn't hurt.

118
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:46,791
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.

119
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:51,533
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...

120
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:52,596
Perfect, right?

121
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,907
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.

122
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,379
Watch where you're goin', you big!

123
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,419
Bridget.

124
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:13,121
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.

125
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:19,457
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.

126
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,799
It goes around your left hoof.

127
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,600
Did you get that out of the trash?

128
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,936
You did! You trash-picker!

129
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,569
I'm not a trash-picker. I'm a recycler.

130
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,614
That's a lot more romantic. Isn't it?

131
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,308
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.

132
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,851
Romantic? Don't mention
romance to me, Benny.

133
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,353
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.

134
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,821
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.

135
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,689
Benny, only the female
orb-weaver spider

136
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,160
will date a male
one-twentieth her size.

137
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,697
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.

138
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,331
But at least he dies happy.

139
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:58,630
Let's get Ryan, dude!

140
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,369
Dude! We said that at the same time!

141
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,377
Dude.

142
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:11,382
Hey! Hey, Ryan.

143
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,854
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?

144
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:18,723
Come on, Ryan. We need you.
You're our biggest fan.

145
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:23,891
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!

146
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,901
Thanks, man. Right back at ya!

147
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,130
You were saying, Dad?

148
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:32,038
Listen. About this afternoon,
I was just trying...

149
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:35,406
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?

150
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,979
OK. I'll... see you there, then.

151
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,650
Come on, dude.

152
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:55,390
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?

153
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,625
Eze. Duke.

154
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,759
Man, he always guesses.

155
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:03,635
We're gonna stalk the gazelles
while everybody's at the game.

156
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:07,608
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!

157
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,143
The Ryanator.

158
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm comin' down.

159
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:16,179
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!

160
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:17,685
Now eyeball-free!

161
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:20,847
We're into the final period
of the curling championships

162
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,255
and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.

163
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,628
What a beauty!

164
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:27,753
Yeah, sweep!

165
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,062
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!

166
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,068
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!

167
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,900
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.

168
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,462
What? "Tough to beat"?

169
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,940
That's just the way we like it,
right, guys?

170
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,776
I can't believe this!

171
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:49,579
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!

172
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:51,950
We cannot lose to flightless birds!

173
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:56,287
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.

174
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,758
As long as we stay focused.

175
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,591
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh! I know!

176
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:04,758
Maybe he's sulking 'cause
he lives in his father's shadow

177
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,960
and he roars like a schoolgirl.

178
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,970
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!

179
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,132
Nigel! Nigel! Will you sign my dolly?

180
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,732
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.

181
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,402
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

182
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:19,879
- You're so cuddly! We love you!
- That's it! I am not cuddly!

183
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:23,315
I'm a vicious jungle animal
from the streets of London!

184
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,512
- Fear me!
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

185
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,248
- Help me!
- Girls! Put him down.

186
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:30,519
I am not a doll!

187
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,890
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!

188
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,657
Nigel! Get your paws off my girlfriend!

189
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,699
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!

190
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,498
<i>Really nice day!</i>

191
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:47,406
What is up with
Samson's team tonight? Brutal!

192
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:48,807
Benny?

193
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:51,072
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?

194
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,408
I do!

195
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,843
What was that?

196
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,317
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Benny, baby.

197
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,616
- Get off my nose.
<i>- I'm so cuddly, I like you!</i>

198
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,519
- Stop saying that!
<i>- G'day, mate!</i>

199
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,285
Cannonball!

200
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,660
Next year, I should just coach.

201
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,227
Check it. The Thomson gazelle.

202
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,098
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.

203
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:18,196
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.

204
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:21,572
Let's get a closer look
at these slim jims.

205
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:24,134
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.

206
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,204
Maybe we should just
go to the game.

207
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,546
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.

208
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:32,610
Yeah, if he were our age,
he would so be rockin' out with us.

209
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,657
He'd be in there,
runnin' 'em down like they were...

210
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:38,887
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.

211
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,053
Ready, man?

212
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:41,852
We'd better not.

213
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,524
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna stop us?

214
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,398
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!

215
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,937
The whole series
comes down to this throw!

216
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:52,940
There's no tomorrow! It's do or die!

217
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:54,498
Ya know what I mean.

218
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:57,568
Guys, I know we're down,
but we're gonna pull this out

219
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,546
'cause we're gonna use...

220
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
...the secret play.
- The secret play!

221
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:06,449
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!

222
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,547
Larry, the first part of the secret play

223
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,182
is keeping it secret.

224
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,590
- OK.
- Follow my lead.

225
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,288
I'm going to need
a double effort from everybody.

226
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:17,127
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.

227
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,759
- Good. Ready, and...
- Break!

228
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:21,862
Quiet.

229
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,428
On three, dude. One, two...

230
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,905
No!

231
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,846
Now you did it, Ryan.

232
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,446
Feelin' mean, Donald?

233
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:41,819
Bring it on!

234
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,256
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!

235
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:46,419
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.

236
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:48,986
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!

237
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:54,434
Samson, it's a shame your little brat
isn't here to see you lose.

238
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:58,098
I can't... hold it!

239
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:01,233
Oh, no! What are you doin'?

240
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:06,807
And here comes Samson. Look at that guy.

241
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,850
Is he a beauty or what?

242
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,976
Larry! Bridget! Sweep!

243
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,645
What a recovery!

244
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,690
He's sendin' in Bridget
and Larry to do the job!

245
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:17,850
Sweep faster, Larry! Sweep, sweep!

246
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,689
- I am!
- Come on, man!

247
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,195
Team Penguin
is sending their ace, Victor...

248
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:24,926
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?

249
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,128
Nigel, how are we looking?

250
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:31,263
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.

251
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,672
This is cheating
and you will die for this.

252
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,471
I can't hear you, Nigel.

253
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,138
Move left a bit...

254
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:41,013
OK. Move left and hit!

255
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,712
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!

256
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,519
What a move!

257
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:55,192
Folks, we are inches away
from the greatest upset

258
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,528
in turtle-curling history!

259
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,067
- Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes!
- No!

260
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:02,160
Looks like Samson might have choked!

261
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,366
- Nice!
- Yes!

262
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,136
Unbelievable!

263
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,407
Samson and his team
have clinched the title!

264
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,313
- No, wait! I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?

265
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:18,376
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!

266
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:22,014
Stampede? Stampede!

267
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,624
Please! Stop!

268
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:38,500
Watch out!

269
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,413
Dude. Busted.

270
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:48,210
Catastrophic.

271
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,342
Told you I'd come to the game.

272
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,852
You think this is funny?

273
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,218
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!

274
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,756
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

275
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:58,418
Chasing the gazelles
or costing us the game?

276
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:00,518
All you do is sit up
in your tree and sulk.

277
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,564
- If you just...
- What's the problem?

278
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,531
Is all this because you can't roar?

279
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,062
Ryan, I didn't mean that.

280
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,606
Know what I'm doing
when I'm sulking in my tree?

281
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:16,235
I'm thinking how great it would be
if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.

282
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,805
Ryan, I didn't...

283
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,747
'Cause it would make being
Ryan the Lame a lot easier.

284
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,648
Ryan, I'm sorry.

285
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:27,211
Ryan! Please don't...

286
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,154
...leave.

287
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,557
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.

288
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,426
And you were worried
he wouldn't show up.

289
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,501
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.

290
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,042
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.

291
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,375
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?

292
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:54,745
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?

293
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:57,341
I'm saying you
have to tell him the truth.

294
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,354
I don't think I could do that, Benny.

295
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:02,014
I mean...

296
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,888
What's he gonna think of me
when he finds out?

297
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,417
I don't know.

298
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:09,760
But if you don't tell him...

299
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,163
...you're gonna lose him, Sammy.

300
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:03,046
The green boxes.

301
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,957
OK, they're all loaded up!

302
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,331
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!

303
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:30,166
I changed my mind! I don't wanna go!

304
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,267
Help!

305
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,932
Ryan.

306
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:37,501
Help me!

307
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,103
Watch out!

308
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:41,675
Sam!

309
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,615
- Wait for us!
- Dad!

310
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,585
- Ryan!
- Dad!

311
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:47,645
Don't let them take me!

312
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:50,156
- No!
- Ryan!

313
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,214
Help!

314
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:55,253
- No!
- Dad! Help me!

315
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,195
Ryan!

316
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:08,342
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.

317
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,970
Get me... the pigeons.

318
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:16,514
I am wanting snake eyes!

319
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:18,485
Come on, baby.

320
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,180
Come on, just throw it.

321
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,250
Thanks.

322
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:32,129
Hamir! You are the
great loser of all time!

323
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,135
What offerings must I make, I wonder?

324
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:36,795
Hamir! Hamir!

325
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:38,635
Get a grip on yourself!

326
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:44,143
Benny! I am needing till Friday
before I am paying you back!

327
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,679
No, no. It's Ryan.

328
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,716
He's in one of those green boxes
and they took it away!

329
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:50,216
We've got to find him!

330
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:53,083
That is not good! Not good at all!

331
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:57,150
I know! I know!

332
00:19:57,225 --> 00:20:00,160
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!

333
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:04,360
The green boxes go to the big water

334
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,957
where stiff lady
with spikes on her head...

335
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:09,868
- Hamir? I can't understand...
- Spikes!

336
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:13,601
Just tell me where the green boxes go.

337
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:17,111
Stiff lady, spikies?

338
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:19,940
Yes, like my wife says,

339
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:23,883
the truck takes them to her! To her!

340
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:29,584
Though I hate telling bad news,
there is more bad news to tell.

341
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:34,994
When the sun rises, the green boxes
leave on boat-boat and never return!

342
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:40,262
I am sorry for this. I really am.

343
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:43,234
Hello?

344
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:48,000
No. Not good. Not good.

345
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:49,873
You always say that.

346
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:52,345
I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'.

347
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,348
Like a broken record here.

348
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,213
OK. When do we leave, Sammy?

349
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,615
Yeah, when do we leave?

350
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:01,281
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.

351
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:04,416
This is now a rescue mission
and I am the only one going.

352
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:06,960
We'll come too! We're not afraid.

353
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,290
Are we, guys?

354
00:21:08,363 --> 00:21:10,092
Afraid? No.

355
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,895
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."

356
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,663
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.

357
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:17,296
Not that I'll ever have
one of my own at this rate.

358
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,205
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,

359
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,641
"We will fight them... with peaches."

360
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,106
Yeah. Anyway.

361
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,241
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me? OK.

362
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:32,775
If you don't mind
being hunted down, shot at...

363
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:34,481
...stuffed...
- OK!

364
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,581
...or worse, then fine.

365
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:40,025
I have a recurring nightmare
about taxidermy and spot remover.

366
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:43,997
Well, they have to catch us
before they can stuff us and I'm fast.

367
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:47,159
Nobody's leaving but me. Got it?

368
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,803
- You're the boss.
- You bet.

369
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,634
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.

370
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,333
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.

371
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:55,876
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.

372
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:58,811
Now that they're out of the picture,
what's the plan?

373
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:25,372
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.

374
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,964
I got it all taken care of.

375
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,977
I know this city...

376
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,535
...like the back of my paw.

377
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:35,014
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue,
couple lefts, couple rights,

378
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,108
bada-boom, past Broadway and...

379
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,645
You're there!

380
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,760
What are you doing here?

381
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:53,529
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!

382
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:56,593
She said,
"We're gonna help you find Ryan."

383
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:58,434
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.

384
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,906
I've got popcorn up my bum.

385
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,806
Do I look trashy in this?

386
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:04,805
OK, here's my...

387
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,337
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?

388
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,579
I only have until sunrise
before Ryan is taken away forever!

389
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:14,053
And now I have to worry about you three?

390
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,424
All right, fine. When do we
get off of this thing, Benny?

391
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,824
Benny's here?

392
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:21,885
Yeah, he's right there.

393
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,124
Benny?

394
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:26,161
Benny!

395
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,765
Great. Now what am I gonna do?

396
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,900
Guys! Guys! I think we should duck!

397
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,102
What is she saying?

398
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:38,839
She said, "Duck down!"

399
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:40,244
Duck!

400
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,415
I am not in the mood
for a game of footsie

401
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,751
or hoofsie or pawsie or...

402
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,983
That wasn't my paw. It was this!

403
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:54,393
I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

404
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:57,454
It'll light the way to Ryan.

405
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:02,791
The walls are moving.

406
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:04,525
Right, right. The walls...

407
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,896
The walls are moving!

408
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,992
Larry, hold your breath!

409
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,366
Larry, stay straight!

410
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,706
Everybody out!

411
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:18,211
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...

412
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,685
This is definitely not good. Samson!

413
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:29,655
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!

414
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:31,021
Larry!

415
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:36,760
The garbage! It lives!

416
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:43,565
Guys?

417
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:46,038
OK, anybody? I'm freakin' out.

418
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,707
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?

419
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,537
We're over here, Nigel.

420
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:54,548
Right. I'll be there in a minute.

421
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:56,880
Think. What did Benny say?

422
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:00,182
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.

423
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:02,086
Bridget, can you see the green lady?

424
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:04,124
I'm looking, I'm looking,

425
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:07,025
but I can't see over anything
for a change.

426
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,791
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?

427
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,695
Is that you, Larry?

428
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:12,926
Up here, Nige.

429
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,401
You're a very furry snake.

430
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,405
Guys... We don't want
to draw attention to ourselves.

431
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,372
Dogs. This should be fun
for you, Samson.

432
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,039
Nigel! Grab Bridget!

433
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:30,311
- What?
- Run!

434
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:35,789
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

435
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:38,587
Shouldn't you be
tearing them to shreds?

436
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,892
All part of the plan. This maneuver's
known as the Serengeti Slip.

437
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:45,489
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.

438
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:51,093
What next?

439
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,368
Page 11?

440
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:57,903
Go on, you mutts!

441
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,311
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.

442
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:05,409
Taken you to a... To a disco!

443
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:07,780
Larry, improvise!

444
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:12,121
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.

445
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:15,492
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!

446
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,724
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.

447
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,324
You're a lion. Be a lion.

448
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:24,394
Look at that guy!

449
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,368
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.

450
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:31,770
OK...

451
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:33,575
- Larry, coil!
- Check!

452
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,946
- Sam!
- I improvised. Now jump!

453
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:44,355
- Down there?
- Yes!

454
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,431
We're leaving, Larry!

455
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:11,341
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there,

456
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,411
why didn't you just do
what you did in the wild?

457
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,480
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them

458
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:18,149
or lionify them?

459
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:20,592
I don't have time
to fight dogs, Bridget.

460
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:22,856
We have to find Ryan, remember?

461
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,023
What is this stinky place?

462
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:27,260
It...

463
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,394
...appears to be a human bathing area.

464
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,405
You mean humans
don't lick themselves clean?

465
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:33,940
Disgusting!

466
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:37,876
They're hopeless. It is hard to believe
they are at the top of the food chain.

467
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:41,711
I can't imagine beginning the day
without licking myself.

468
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,274
No hurry, but is there a plan?

469
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:46,752
Of course there's a plan.

470
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:49,221
We follow this water to the big water,

471
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,349
and then we find the lady with...

472
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:59,023
Larry, either your stomach is growling
or something in it is growling.

473
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,761
Wasn't me.

474
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,496
What?

475
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:14,274
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy! Twins!

476
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,816
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now,
'cause these guys

477
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:19,352
are seeming to have acid reflux
or something!

478
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,980
Everybody... stay calm.

479
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,614
- Calm?
- Not good.

480
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:29,592
Yo. Boo!

481
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,929
I'm gonna say,
it looks like you and your crew here

482
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,866
are a little far from your borough.

483
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,734
Far from your borough! I love it.

484
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,468
We're going to the big water.

485
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,942
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.

486
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:48,078
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.

487
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:54,653
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.

488
00:29:54,722 --> 00:29:57,520
- No idea. You?
- Doesn't even register.

489
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:00,186
- You're battin' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...

490
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,260
Make your bloody mind up.

491
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:07,133
The big female
with the spikes on her melon!

492
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:08,532
They're tourists.

493
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:12,164
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.

494
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,105
First take the Broadway culvert.

495
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:17,372
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?

496
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:20,107
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!

497
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,649
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?

498
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,275
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!

499
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:27,185
The Wall Street culvert
is blocked with construction.

500
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,813
- That is true.
- All right.

501
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,448
Guys, you gonna help or not?

502
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:33,255
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.

503
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,522
We're one big family, right?

504
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:37,860
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...

505
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:41,493
You done runnin' your mouth yet,
Carmine? Are ya?

506
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:45,300
I apologize. He never got over
being flushed down the toilet.

507
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,329
Yeah.

508
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:51,071
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last
ten minutes in this neighborhood.

509
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,578
It's a jungle down here.

510
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,945
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What? No.

511
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:57,416
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!

512
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,147
How ya doing?

513
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,416
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

514
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:07,719
I've seen a lot of those things
floatin' here in the sewer.

515
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,693
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.

516
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,757
Just wait for me!

517
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:24,372
Are we in the right place?

518
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,845
Any place without
two hilarious alligators

519
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:28,848
seems a move in the right direction.

520
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:33,785
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.

521
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:38,317
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.

522
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:42,419
And it's sunrise,
which means we're a tad short on time.

523
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:44,862
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.

524
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:47,560
It's gotta be around here,
so I need you to...

525
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,967
Yeah. So we should
shout out if we see a box

526
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:52,198
that looks like the ones over there.

527
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,601
It hasn't left yet! We can make it!

528
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:57,576
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!

529
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:04,442
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?

530
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:07,885
Run!

531
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,119
No!

532
00:32:15,196 --> 00:32:16,788
No!

533
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:18,456
Ryan's on that thing!

534
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:20,090
We've got to stop it!

535
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,294
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!

536
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,861
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!

537
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,509
I failed. Again.

538
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:36,709
I only count one failure.

539
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:39,412
It's big, but it's just one.

540
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:43,514
Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya.

541
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,354
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?

542
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,526
It's a human and I do not
think he works for the zoo.

543
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,161
Perhaps now
is a good time to improvise.

544
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:57,568
What?

545
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:07,080
Great! One problem down...

546
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:08,614
Far out.

547
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,207
Cool.

548
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:13,149
One disaster to go.

549
00:33:21,295 --> 00:33:24,059
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!

550
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,292
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?

551
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,063
None of us. We're animals. Great!

552
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:44,009
- Hold on, Larry. Do that again.
- Do what?

553
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,212
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!

554
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,881
But I don't know my opposites!

555
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,314
No, Larry, like this!

556
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:02,302
I think I've got it.

557
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,569
Well, that was easy.

558
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,840
Oh, dear. Has anyone
got any eucalyptus wipes?

559
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:13,072
This isn't so difficult.

560
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:16,139
I'm the lion of the sea!

561
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,741
Well done, sir.

562
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:22,016
Captain of our team
and now captain of this vessel.

563
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,113
You're brilliant.

564
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,957
I hate to be Miss Negative,
but in this melee,

565
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,962
we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.

566
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,160
- What, nothing?
- Nothing. He's gone.

567
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:37,167
No.

568
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,705
There! Nelson! The green boxes!

569
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:51,081
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!

570
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:53,245
And my love!

571
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,721
Let's go in!

572
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,383
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun. To the north.

573
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:03,521
Starboard... Leftboard.

574
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:05,258
Just follow my finger.

575
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:07,527
Please. You guys
wouldn't know the answer

576
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:10,001
if it fell from the sky
and hit you in the head.

577
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,061
Oh, my! It's a bat! It's a bat!

578
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,130
Get it off me! Get it off me!

579
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,244
- Benny!
- Benny?

580
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:19,540
Geese!

581
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:24,484
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.

582
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:27,243
Benny, you made it!

583
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:32,185
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.

584
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,193
Even not-so-best friends,

585
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:36,695
who knock you off
a speeding garbage truck.

586
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:39,927
Excuse me, but I begged them
to go back and get you.

587
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,989
Just so you know.

588
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:44,037
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat
from up there?

589
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:47,164
Well, it just so happens
I saw it heading that way.

590
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,708
And we're in luck!

591
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:51,711
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!

592
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:54,646
Experts at intercontinental travel.

593
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:56,376
Hey, birdie, OK,

594
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,285
is it true that Canada has lax
immigration policies for koalas?

595
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,755
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.

596
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:07,055
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?

597
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:10,062
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.

598
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,258
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?

599
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:17,426
Hey, Benny, thanks.

600
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:23,374
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned
when you fell off the truck.

601
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:31,415
Bet you didn't know
I could ride geese, did you?

602
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:33,851
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.

603
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:40,021
Sammy? We going to the wild now?

604
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:42,756
I think we are, Larry.

605
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,290
I can't take it anymore.

606
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,294
He's taunting us! Listen!

607
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:53,299
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!

608
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,962
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?

609
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:59,335
The crew,
they're on the verge of mutiny.

610
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:00,498
Nigel, please.

611
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:03,099
If you don't give us
ice creams pretty quick,

612
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,906
you're gonna walk the plank, sir!

613
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:06,970
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,

614
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:09,641
I'm getting off this
death cruise right now.

615
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,583
Iceberg! Permission
to go down with the ship, sir.

616
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:18,420
Hang on! Stuff that!

617
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,757
Run! Swim!

618
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:22,955
Nigel?

619
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,329
Look, I'm a starfish.

620
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,527
Guys, look.

621
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:32,060
Gosh. Must feel like a lifetime
since you've been here.

622
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:35,074
Yeah... a lifetime.

623
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,151
What the heck?

624
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:50,452
Wow! Look!

625
00:38:50,524 --> 00:38:53,925
They're releasing the green boxes
back into the wild.

626
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,188
- Larry.
- Guys,

627
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:57,787
they're putting animals
inside the green boxes.

628
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,992
I just can't figure out why.

629
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:03,093
It's a tunnel to another dimension,
can't you see?

630
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,967
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?

631
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,301
It's all right, Nigel.

632
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:08,773
Think it has anything to do with that?

633
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:13,645
Hang on a second. Either I'm starving
or Larry is making sense.

634
00:39:13,714 --> 00:39:17,115
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.

635
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:33,897
Ryan?

636
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:36,666
Ryan!

637
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:41,035
Oh, no!

638
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,031
Ryan!

639
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:48,108
We've got to move fast!

640
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,911
Ryan!

641
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,620
Ryan! Ryan!

642
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,954
Ryan! Where are you, buddy?

643
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:04,889
Ryan!

644
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,660
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!

645
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:09,031
I was so close. He was right there!

646
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:11,264
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!

647
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:15,604
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.

648
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,166
I don't want to run anymore.

649
00:40:17,244 --> 00:40:19,804
Good. 'Cause frankly,
you need a good sports bra.

650
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,848
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.

651
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:24,816
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.

652
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,819
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?

653
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,320
I mean, he got it! Let's go!

654
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:30,720
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!

655
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:33,987
I'm not designed for this! I want a car.

656
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,597
Hey, guys, I found him! Ryan!

657
00:40:41,435 --> 00:40:43,062
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

658
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,401
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?

659
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:49,465
Yeah, now that I think about it,
he did come through here. Hello?

660
00:40:49,543 --> 00:40:52,444
Come on out, baby lion! Your dad's here!

661
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:55,778
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!

662
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:01,616
Funky. I was under the impression
you had Ryan's scent,

663
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:04,179
not this olfactory insult.

664
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:05,418
I...

665
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:09,394
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator
instincts must've kicked in since,

666
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,454
you know, I haven't eaten for a while.

667
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:12,965
Exactly!

668
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,831
You never know when those
instincts are gonna kick in.

669
00:41:15,903 --> 00:41:17,495
Excellent. Fantastic!

670
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:19,436
We get to see the legend in action.

671
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,565
I'd love to,
but we just don't have time.

672
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:24,907
We got the time, Sammy. Just...

673
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:27,242
And then you do this. And then this bit.

674
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:30,139
Rip him apart!

675
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:32,645
The horror.

676
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,890
I can't bear to watch! But I have to.

677
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:48,064
Go on. Get out of here.

678
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:50,330
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.

679
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:53,134
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?

680
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:56,506
No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts.

681
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:59,273
Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me?

682
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:02,406
Beat me up a little,
then pounce when I get my hopes up?

683
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,177
How exciting.

684
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:06,082
Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far.

685
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:09,816
Hey! I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.

686
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,881
My flesh has fruity wood notes!

687
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,725
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.

688
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,320
You call this wild?

689
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:20,730
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!

690
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:24,703
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!

691
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:27,604
Maybe I should hide
behind the koala for protection.

692
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:30,302
While we're at it,
could you slap me in the face?

693
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:31,776
No. What are you, a twit?

694
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:34,245
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother! I'm leaving.

695
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:36,441
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!

696
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,609
It's a lion with moral issues!

697
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,784
And I've had it with you too!

698
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,516
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!

699
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:46,451
Teensy question.

700
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:49,859
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.

701
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,727
That hyrax back there?

702
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:54,062
It was sort of like
you couldn't eat him.

703
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:58,571
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.

704
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,506
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that you're...

705
00:43:01,575 --> 00:43:03,008
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.

706
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:06,136
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...

707
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,410
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...

708
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:11,280
The wild?

709
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:17,387
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.

710
00:43:17,457 --> 00:43:18,890
What?

711
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,957
I'm just a phony.

712
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,758
Truth is I can't protect you out here.

713
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,298
Please just go back to the boat.

714
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,631
I've got to find my son.

715
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:38,501
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle
with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.

716
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:41,513
Actually, I'm nine inches,
but other than that, yes.

717
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:43,515
So that means...

718
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,983
We are going to die!

719
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,189
Hey, guys! Guys!

720
00:43:53,093 --> 00:43:54,958
Will the three of you calm down?

721
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:56,461
How could he lie to us?

722
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,191
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.

723
00:43:58,265 --> 00:44:01,132
Maybe he lied 'cause he
didn't want to tell us the truth.

724
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:03,663
OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever.

725
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:05,864
Let's just go back to the boat, then.

726
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:09,375
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!

727
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:12,037
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Where you goin'?

728
00:44:12,112 --> 00:44:14,580
Stop right there! Stop!

729
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:17,583
Bridget, if you go, I'm...

730
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:19,585
I'm breaking up with you.

731
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:21,814
We were never going out
in the first place.

732
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:23,378
Then we're taking a break.

733
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:24,947
- Nigel!
- All right!

734
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:28,786
Hey, listen!

735
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:32,229
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.

736
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,826
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.

737
00:44:35,902 --> 00:44:38,564
And... so is Ryan.

738
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,635
OK, OK, focus, Samson.

739
00:44:45,712 --> 00:44:49,307
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.

740
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:52,910
I mean, how big
can this place be, anyway?

741
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:03,996
Ryan!

742
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:21,504
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?

743
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:26,417
You remind me
of my buddy back home.

744
00:45:26,486 --> 00:45:30,115
A bloodthirsty monster!

745
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,452
Where? Where?

746
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:34,153
He's a killer! Get away from my baby!

747
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,360
Calm down, lady!

748
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:40,832
Won't anyone save my baby?

749
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,564
Bye-bye.

750
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:51,106
Ryan! Ryan!

751
00:45:51,178 --> 00:45:52,440
Sammy!

752
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:54,980
I wasn't meant for the wild.

753
00:45:55,048 --> 00:45:57,676
I was made to nibble and be elegant

754
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:00,379
and to appear in children's books
as the letter G.

755
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:02,547
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?

756
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:05,216
It's just leaves and vines and...

757
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:07,655
Oh, that's my foot.

758
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,786
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.

759
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:12,127
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.

760
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,934
Oh, I see. All right, OK, yeah.

761
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:19,961
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.

762
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,974
Nigel! I gave you an order.

763
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:25,011
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?

764
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:26,409
Nigel.

765
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:29,613
That's not funny, Nigel.

766
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:32,083
- He's gone! We're doomed.
- Nigel!

767
00:46:32,152 --> 00:46:36,088
First Ryan, then Samson,
and now Nigel!

768
00:46:36,156 --> 00:46:37,714
I do believe in zoos.

769
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:40,157
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.

770
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:42,957
- Don't panic. I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!

771
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:45,190
I say we fan out and circle.

772
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:48,200
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.

773
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:49,929
Run for your lives, everybody!

774
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:54,030
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?

775
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:59,637
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.

776
00:46:59,713 --> 00:47:02,807
That means they don't hunt. They graze.

777
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,812
But they're licking their chops.

778
00:47:04,885 --> 00:47:07,115
I'll take the one with the funny knees.

779
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:09,621
The funny knee?

780
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:11,554
Benny, no!

781
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:19,023
Benny?

782
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:21,795
Get them.

783
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:25,671
Just, hey, back off. I'm sorry,

784
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:28,401
I'm not that kind of koala bear.

785
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,472
Right.

786
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:39,877
Excuse me? Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you,

787
00:47:39,953 --> 00:47:42,751
but do you speak koala?
<i>Sprechen Sie koala?</i>

788
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,623
Right.

789
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:54,928
Could you possibly not go
towards the big smoking thing?

790
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:58,270
<i>G'day, mate</i>
<i>G'day, mate</i>

791
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:00,966
<i>G'day, mate</i>
<i>G'day, mate</i>

792
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,838
<i>G'day, mate</i>
<i>G'day, mate</i>

793
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:06,037
What a strange place for a party.

794
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:16,185
Very good, very organized.

795
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:19,887
Can I use your toilet?

796
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:22,758
<i>I'm having a</i>

797
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,558
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really nice day</i>

798
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:26,656
<i>Really nice day</i>

799
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:27,859
<i>I'm having a</i>

800
00:48:27,934 --> 00:48:29,765
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really nice day</i>

801
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:31,565
<i>Really nice day</i>

802
00:48:31,638 --> 00:48:34,698
<i>- Why don't you all</i>
<i>- Tickle away, tickle away</i>

803
00:48:34,774 --> 00:48:39,575
They're frighteningly
horrible monster beasts...

804
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:41,375
...but they're not bad dancers.

805
00:48:41,448 --> 00:48:43,916
<i>I'm so cuddly</i>
<i>I like you</i>

806
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:46,452
<i>I'm so cuddly</i>
<i>I like you</i>

807
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,319
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

808
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,449
<i>- I'm having a</i>
<i>- Really nice day</i>

809
00:48:52,525 --> 00:48:53,822
Oh, no!

810
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:56,794
<i>Tickle away</i>
<i>Tickle away</i>

811
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,263
<i>I'm so cuddly, I like you</i>
<i>Good day</i>

812
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,801
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.

813
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,134
Leader. Prophet.

814
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:07,935
Choreographer.

815
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:11,773
And with your help... carnivore!

816
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:16,111
No! Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!

817
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:17,843
This is not fair.

818
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:33,391
Oh, I get it. A yoga retreat.

819
00:49:35,535 --> 00:49:37,196
Ryan!

820
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:42,570
You can do this. Use your instincts.

821
00:49:51,707 --> 00:49:53,698
Follow your instincts.

822
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:06,086
Use your instincts.

823
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:08,850
OK.

824
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:10,858
Down this way.

825
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:15,189
This way.

826
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:43,958
A lion cub.

827
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,023
We must tell Kazar.

828
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:51,255
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.

829
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,028
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

830
00:50:57,172 --> 00:51:01,199
Thank you very much,
but I'm afraid I've got to run.

831
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:02,709
Koalas are very busy bees.

832
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:05,246
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...

833
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,509
For centuries,
we've watched our brethren

834
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,017
perish at the claw of the lion.

835
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:13,782
Today, we put our hooves down.

836
00:51:13,855 --> 00:51:18,815
No longer will we dwell
at the bottom of the food chain.

837
00:51:18,894 --> 00:51:22,227
Well, yes. I should say so.

838
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:26,666
There were those who doubted
that you'd arrive to lead us.

839
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:29,797
But I always believed in the Omen.

840
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:33,534
The Omen! Right. Remind me again?

841
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:35,873
Sent down by the gods years ago...

842
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:40,871
Oh, no! Not you!

843
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:58,896
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

844
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,237
Oh, Great Him,

845
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:10,438
you must lead us
in our transformation from prey...

846
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:13,809
...to predator.

847
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:17,912
Hold it. I am the Great Him?

848
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:22,555
- The Great Him?
- Him.

849
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:28,419
So this is all your fault!
That's it! You!

850
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:30,522
- Kazar!
- Kazar! Don't listen to him!

851
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,033
- Kazar! Over here!
- Kazar! Over here!

852
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:36,264
How dare you interrupt my audience
with the Great Him!

853
00:52:36,338 --> 00:52:39,705
But... but we found a lion cub!

854
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:43,043
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?

855
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:45,579
With big hair? Well, a mullet, really.

856
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:49,139
Oh, Great Him,
you brought two lions with you?

857
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:51,481
Well, like any Great Him,

858
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:53,987
I travel with an entourage.

859
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:58,489
Worry not, Your Himness,
I shall have Blag bring the lions here.

860
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,122
And he better not screw this up,
like you screwed up my dance number!

861
00:53:03,198 --> 00:53:05,325
I lost count for one verse.

862
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,766
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

863
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:12,401
Why do we even bother rehearsing?

864
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:16,100
A good chorus line
is so hard to put together.

865
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:20,246
Take to the skies!

866
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:22,249
We're taking! We're taking!

867
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:26,980
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

868
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:29,785
Bring us those lions!

869
00:53:33,261 --> 00:53:37,630
The gods celebrate
the fulfillment of the prophecy.

870
00:53:37,699 --> 00:53:40,293
We stamp our hooves

871
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:43,202
in praise of the Great Him!

872
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:45,102
Holy moly!

873
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:47,368
<i>Holy moly</i>
<i>Holy moly</i>

874
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:50,639
You are our king!

875
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:09,860
Looky, looky who's there.

876
00:54:10,932 --> 00:54:12,194
Surprise!

877
00:54:14,803 --> 00:54:16,168
No!

878
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:20,174
Sorry we're late for dinner!

879
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,583
That's pathetic!

880
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:34,214
Get off!

881
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:36,257
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!

882
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:41,756
- Ryan!
- No!

883
00:54:43,098 --> 00:54:44,827
I'm coming, son!

884
00:54:46,468 --> 00:54:48,163
Dad?

885
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:50,101
- Help!
- Let's scram!

886
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:52,072
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?

887
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,768
- I can't believe it! I found you.
- How'd you find me?

888
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:56,868
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

889
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:58,879
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.

890
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,278
It's OK, son.

891
00:55:00,348 --> 00:55:02,976
And then I escaped,
and I ran into the jungle...

892
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,747
...then those vultures came
and tried to kill me.

893
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:08,449
You wouldn't have been scared. I was.

894
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,889
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

895
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,927
Listen.

896
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:16,021
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!

897
00:55:16,665 --> 00:55:18,292
Run!

898
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:21,458
Dad, you should be chasing them!

899
00:55:21,536 --> 00:55:23,936
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!

900
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:26,337
But now's your chance
to show me for real!

901
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:31,874
This way!

902
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:39,845
- Dad? What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!

903
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:48,522
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?

904
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:50,622
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!

905
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,326
You could kick their rumps!

906
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,961
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens! Get back here!

907
00:55:56,037 --> 00:55:58,130
Ryan! I can't fight them.

908
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,803
What do you mean?

909
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:04,971
I was young...

910
00:56:05,046 --> 00:56:07,173
...still just a cub.

911
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:10,380
Ladies and gentlemen.

912
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,613
Children of all ages.

913
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:16,020
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!

914
00:56:16,091 --> 00:56:20,027
Witness the greatest day
in our young lion's life!

915
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:23,997
The day he discovers his roar!

916
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,760
Dad, I can't do it!

917
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,324
Now, go!

918
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:31,304
Listen as Samson
unleashes a roar so mighty,

919
00:56:31,373 --> 00:56:34,831
it launches a wildebeest
clear off the savannah!

920
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:41,815
Samson! Dig deep!

921
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:55,552
I should have known.

922
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,691
If you'd been born in the wild,
you'd know how to roar.

923
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:01,093
Dad?

924
00:57:02,237 --> 00:57:04,831
Dad! Dad!

925
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:06,840
Please!

926
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:11,111
Dad.

927
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:14,239
When they shipped me to the zoo,
I never wanted anyone to know

928
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:18,548
where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.

929
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,713
I should have told you sooner.

930
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:24,225
But... all those stories you tell?

931
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:27,193
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

932
00:57:27,262 --> 00:57:30,288
Everything you told me was a lie?

933
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:34,834
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.

934
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,738
Help!

935
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,773
Ryan!

936
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:43,536
Ryan! Run!

937
00:57:45,914 --> 00:57:47,939
Not so fast, Tigger.

938
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:51,347
Dad!

939
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,189
Ryan!

940
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:56,689
Dad!

941
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:02,028
- Help!
- Ryan.

942
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,088
Help! Dad!

943
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:07,225
- Ryan.
- Dad! Help me!

944
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:18,178
What?

945
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:22,473
Wait! What? What? Wait!

946
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,814
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey!

947
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,349
Get off me!

948
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,490
What is goin' on here?

949
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,586
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.

950
00:58:35,664 --> 00:58:37,461
Wait. You guys think I'm a?

951
00:58:37,532 --> 00:58:40,558
<i>- Achtung,</i> Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.

952
00:58:40,635 --> 00:58:42,603
<i>- Ja.</i>
- Roll! Roll!

953
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:44,764
What the? Hey!

954
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:47,501
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!

955
00:58:47,575 --> 00:58:49,634
I'll give you something to roll about!

956
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:55,581
It's a good thing
Bridget didn't see that!

957
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,642
Bridget? Larry! They're gone.

958
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:00,949
I gotta find them!

959
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:03,616
No! I gotta find Samson first!

960
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:05,159
No! First...

961
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,523
Sam. Sam!

962
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:25,837
Bridget! Larry!

963
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:27,677
Oh, Ryan! You're alive!

964
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:29,740
Good to see you guys.

965
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,286
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.

966
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:35,117
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.

967
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:38,552
What are you guys doing here?

968
00:59:38,626 --> 00:59:40,890
We came here
with your father to find you.

969
00:59:40,962 --> 00:59:44,454
And he's probably out there
right now lookin' for us.

970
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,430
I wish he were.

971
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:50,266
But some of these wildebeests
pushed him off a cliff.

972
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,896
- What?
- What?

973
00:59:51,973 --> 00:59:55,374
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.

974
00:59:55,443 --> 00:59:57,343
Oh, Ryan.

975
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,676
I'm sorry I got you into this.

976
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:03,479
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased
with what I brought you.

977
01:00:03,551 --> 01:00:06,019
What's this? Where's the other lion?

978
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:09,784
Right. Well, I was gonna tell you,
there was this cliff and...

979
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:14,126
Why are you looking at me like that?

980
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:17,926
That's twice you've been
out of step today, Blag!

981
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:19,261
You klutz.

982
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:21,996
You know we can't ascend
to the top of the food chain

983
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,130
until we eat a lion!

984
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:29,767
Well, at least there'll
be enough for my ascension.

985
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:31,368
What about the rest of us?

986
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:34,279
Step-kick, pivot-kick!

987
01:00:39,754 --> 01:00:41,915
Ouch! I twisted a hoof!

988
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,153
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.

989
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:49,560
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!

990
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:55,065
Why did I let him go off by himself?

991
01:00:55,136 --> 01:00:59,232
He couldn't catch a cold,
much less his own lunch.

992
01:01:00,842 --> 01:01:02,434
Bet I could catch you.

993
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,841
Please.

994
01:01:03,912 --> 01:01:07,040
My natural predator
is fuel inject... What?

995
01:01:07,115 --> 01:01:10,380
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!

996
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:13,784
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?

997
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:16,715
I lost Ryan.

998
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:20,090
There were too many. They just took him.

999
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,823
Who? Who took him?

1000
01:01:22,897 --> 01:01:26,458
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!

1001
01:01:26,534 --> 01:01:28,399
They got Larry and Bridget too.

1002
01:01:28,469 --> 01:01:31,734
Couldn't fight, couldn't...

1003
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:33,398
Come on, Sam. You're a lion.

1004
01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:35,601
You come from a long line of kings.

1005
01:01:35,677 --> 01:01:37,941
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.

1006
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:40,003
But fighting's in your blood!

1007
01:01:40,081 --> 01:01:43,517
No. I'll never be a real lion.

1008
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:46,486
Wrong! You are a real lion.

1009
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:48,454
Doesn't matter where you're from:

1010
01:01:48,523 --> 01:01:51,356
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.

1011
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:53,360
It's what's in here.

1012
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:55,726
That determines who you are!

1013
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:58,288
At least, that's what you
always told your son.

1014
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:00,857
Now he's out there, Sammy,

1015
01:02:00,935 --> 01:02:03,961
and he needs you.

1016
01:02:04,038 --> 01:02:06,563
Who else is gonna
teach him how to roar?

1017
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:12,378
That's it, Sammy.

1018
01:02:17,752 --> 01:02:19,014
That's it.

1019
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:28,323
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.

1020
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:30,990
Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us!

1021
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:34,466
Except that we have no idea
where we're going!

1022
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,231
Follow your instincts.

1023
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:38,966
Follow your instincts.

1024
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,306
- What is that?
- My... instincts?

1025
01:02:47,248 --> 01:02:49,876
- Benny?
- You're almost there.

1026
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:52,548
That settles it, then.

1027
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,283
My mother definitely drank pool water
when she was pregnant with me.

1028
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:57,881
Benny, look.

1029
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:00,325
The freaks with hooves!

1030
01:03:00,395 --> 01:03:01,726
Ryan's in there.

1031
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:05,159
You can't just barge in. That's suicide!

1032
01:03:05,233 --> 01:03:08,760
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.

1033
01:03:08,836 --> 01:03:11,828
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.

1034
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:15,364
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!

1035
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:18,640
Fool! You blew our cover!
Men! Scatter!

1036
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:21,842
Not so fast!

1037
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:25,352
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.

1038
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,785
Who are you guys?

1039
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:29,550
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak. He's Camo.

1040
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,787
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?

1041
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,226
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.

1042
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,389
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.

1043
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:40,901
It's not like I told them our plan
is to use them to defeat Kazar's...

1044
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:43,802
Listen, just tell me,
did they take my son in there?

1045
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,668
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.

1046
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,971
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!

1047
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:51,477
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this? Men!

1048
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:54,310
Hey! No! Stop! Sammy!

1049
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:58,682
- Idiot! That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret. This one's confidential.

1050
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,687
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.

1051
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:04,555
Super-secret.
Top-secret. This is ultra-secret!

1052
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:06,115
Enough! No more!

1053
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:09,823
Show 'em the super-top-secret
"no more?" Gotcha!

1054
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:10,921
No!

1055
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:14,098
I got an idea.

1056
01:04:17,972 --> 01:04:20,998
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.

1057
01:04:21,075 --> 01:04:23,475
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.

1058
01:04:23,544 --> 01:04:25,978
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.

1059
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:28,572
Oh, my.

1060
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:45,063
You have got to be kidding me.

1061
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,938
Nigel, I don't know
what you're trying to pull,

1062
01:04:57,011 --> 01:04:59,070
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!

1063
01:05:00,014 --> 01:05:02,073
Why, you little...

1064
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,845
Silence, again!

1065
01:05:03,918 --> 01:05:07,319
You do not speak to me!

1066
01:05:07,388 --> 01:05:08,821
Nigel, what's the deal?

1067
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,825
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?

1068
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:15,420
Yes, we shall! What's on the menu?

1069
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:16,895
Them.

1070
01:05:18,032 --> 01:05:19,556
Oh, no.

1071
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:22,296
Eat friends and be god,
don't eat friends...

1072
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,702
God, friends, god, friends. God, I...

1073
01:05:24,772 --> 01:05:26,364
Well, that was subtle.

1074
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:27,601
Prepare the meat fire!

1075
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:32,837
Wait!

1076
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:38,047
We cannot cook them without...

1077
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:40,579
...onion!

1078
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:44,113
Onions. Onions. Onions.

1079
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:47,226
Well, that was fast.

1080
01:05:47,295 --> 01:05:49,422
Let the ritual begin.

1081
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:54,865
Move it!

1082
01:05:54,936 --> 01:05:57,234
I am so mad at you!

1083
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:02,604
Wait! We also need... hats!

1084
01:06:04,078 --> 01:06:07,707
Do we not have the party hats of death?

1085
01:06:07,782 --> 01:06:09,340
I've got mine!

1086
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:13,080
And before the feast, we must all...

1087
01:06:13,488 --> 01:06:15,080
What the?

1088
01:06:15,957 --> 01:06:17,185
...levitate...

1089
01:06:17,258 --> 01:06:19,123
...and spin uncontrollably!

1090
01:06:19,193 --> 01:06:21,787
And feel a bit sick.

1091
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:24,028
How do I stop this thing?

1092
01:06:24,098 --> 01:06:25,827
- Guys.
- Benny?

1093
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,925
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!

1094
01:06:28,836 --> 01:06:30,770
We've got a plan. Follow me.

1095
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:33,432
- We?
- I can fly!

1096
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:36,966
Oh, Great Him,
we are humbled by your power.

1097
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:40,912
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!

1098
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:45,511
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!

1099
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:48,077
Major malfunction! Abandon ship!

1100
01:06:56,664 --> 01:07:00,065
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.

1101
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:02,796
Great Him, it's another miracle!

1102
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:06,067
You've delivered us a real lion!

1103
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,267
Blag, your luck has turned.

1104
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:12,676
Thanks to the Great Him,
we shall all ascend tonight.

1105
01:07:12,747 --> 01:07:15,739
Nigel, we've got
to create a distraction.

1106
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:17,948
Hang on a sec!

1107
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:20,681
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!

1108
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:23,918
Ready? Stand back...

1109
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:27,586
...as the Great Me attacks the lion

1110
01:07:27,662 --> 01:07:31,189
over 73 times my size!

1111
01:07:34,936 --> 01:07:38,099
Dad? My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!

1112
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:39,969
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!

1113
01:07:43,911 --> 01:07:45,378
Whack, whack, whack!

1114
01:07:45,446 --> 01:07:46,845
- Dad!
- What? Ryan!

1115
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:51,213
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!

1116
01:07:56,057 --> 01:07:59,288
At long last,
the cosmic balance has shifted.

1117
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,158
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!

1118
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,130
And predator has become prey!

1119
01:08:04,198 --> 01:08:06,826
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!

1120
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:09,734
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies

1121
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:11,931
who's at the top of the food chain!

1122
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:16,209
Let's eat the brat first.

1123
01:08:16,544 --> 01:08:19,536
Over my dead body!

1124
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:34,988
Yeah.

1125
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,122
Dad!

1126
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:44,230
He's gonna kill Samson
if we don't do something!

1127
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:47,001
Why don't we use the secret play?

1128
01:08:47,074 --> 01:08:50,840
I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid.

1129
01:08:50,911 --> 01:08:53,243
No! It's brilliant!

1130
01:08:53,314 --> 01:08:56,078
They laughed at me
when I spoke of the Omen.

1131
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,779
But look who's laughing now!

1132
01:09:05,326 --> 01:09:08,193
Little to the left. Yeah.
No! Little to the right!

1133
01:09:08,262 --> 01:09:11,026
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!

1134
01:09:11,265 --> 01:09:12,664
Ding!

1135
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:14,728
Fire!

1136
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:24,671
We gotta find something bigger!

1137
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:27,213
I know where we can
find something bigger.

1138
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:33,249
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!

1139
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:34,948
You should have stayed at home.

1140
01:09:35,022 --> 01:09:38,287
Now our shrine will become your tomb.

1141
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:39,724
Fire!

1142
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,966
Ryan!

1143
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:51,327
Ryan!

1144
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:55,400
I don't typically eat dessert

1145
01:09:55,476 --> 01:09:57,603
before the main course!

1146
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:00,706
Get away from my son!

1147
01:10:10,157 --> 01:10:11,317
Ryan.

1148
01:10:17,932 --> 01:10:21,129
Ryan, are you still with me?

1149
01:10:21,202 --> 01:10:25,400
It's OK, Dad. I just want you to know

1150
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:30,035
I'm sorry you didn't have a father
like the one I have.

1151
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:31,772
Ryan.

1152
01:10:34,448 --> 01:10:36,279
How touching.

1153
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,183
But then, last words usually are.

1154
01:10:41,355 --> 01:10:42,583
Finish them.

1155
01:10:51,465 --> 01:10:53,023
What are you doing?

1156
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,900
I command you to attack them,
like true predators!

1157
01:10:56,971 --> 01:11:00,304
We're tired of pretending
to be something we're not.

1158
01:11:00,374 --> 01:11:04,504
But most of all, we're tired of you.

1159
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,442
Blag. Fine.

1160
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:12,418
I'll kill them myself!

1161
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:21,450
Dad, remember what you
always told me in your stories:

1162
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:22,928
Dig deep.

1163
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:44,449
Oh, yeah, baby!

1164
01:12:06,507 --> 01:12:07,838
Let's go.

1165
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:10,001
Yeah.

1166
01:12:10,077 --> 01:12:12,637
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!

1167
01:12:12,713 --> 01:12:16,410
And for the record,
I've always hated your choreography.

1168
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:19,317
It's so... '80s.

1169
01:12:21,322 --> 01:12:22,721
That's right! Run!

1170
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:25,315
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!

1171
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:27,383
I will hunt you down!

1172
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:31,628
Everyone! To the boat!

1173
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:33,462
Top of the food chain, Ma!

1174
01:12:33,534 --> 01:12:36,833
Top of the food chain...

1175
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:40,840
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

1176
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:43,274
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>
<i>I'm so cuddly!</i>

1177
01:12:51,886 --> 01:12:54,184
Hurry! We're never gonna make it!

1178
01:12:54,255 --> 01:12:56,985
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters! Push!

1179
01:12:58,092 --> 01:13:01,391
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!

1180
01:13:12,873 --> 01:13:16,400
At least I saw the wild
before it disappeared.

1181
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:18,968
I can still see it. It's right...

1182
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:21,981
Here. I found my roar.

1183
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:25,041
We both did, son.

1184
01:13:25,753 --> 01:13:30,122
You know, Dad, this'll be our first
story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.

1185
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,454
I don't think anybody's
gonna believe it.

1186
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:37,364
Incoming!

1187
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:44,697
<i>I'm so cuddly!</i>

1188
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:47,900
<i>Cuddly! I'm so cuddly!</i>

1189
01:13:47,975 --> 01:13:50,967
I know you're cuddly. But can you float?

1190
01:13:53,914 --> 01:13:55,973
<i>- I'm having a</i>
<i>- Really nice day</i>

1191
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,915
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really nice day</i>

1192
01:13:57,985 --> 01:13:59,919
Step-kick left!

1193
01:13:59,987 --> 01:14:01,682
<i>Really nice day</i>

1194
01:14:01,755 --> 01:14:02,744
Step-kick right!

1195
01:14:04,058 --> 01:14:06,458
- Splendid.
- No! Smashing. Hey!

1196
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:08,927
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?

1197
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:11,191
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.

1198
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:14,132
Hey, look, everyone! I'm a secret agent!

1199
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:18,929
Bridget, I get it. You're more
than a tall, lanky goddess.

1200
01:14:19,006 --> 01:14:21,065
You're a strong, independent female.

1201
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:23,666
You don't need to be defined
by your relationship

1202
01:14:23,744 --> 01:14:26,042
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.

1203
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,583
What was that?

1204
01:14:30,651 --> 01:14:34,553
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Bridget, baby.

1205
01:14:34,622 --> 01:14:36,180
Oh, yeah yeah!

1206
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:37,917
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really nice day</i>

1207
01:14:37,992 --> 01:14:38,981
Look out!

1208
01:14:41,996 --> 01:14:44,362
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

1209
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:47,798
Yes! Did y'all see that? Check this!

1210
01:14:47,868 --> 01:14:51,099
Go, Blag! Go, Blag! Go, Blag!

1211
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:53,002
Hey, Blag.

1212
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:56,565
- No parkin' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?

1213
01:14:56,644 --> 01:14:57,906
Dad?

1214
01:14:57,978 --> 01:15:00,469
Make some room there, big guy!

1215
01:15:02,116 --> 01:15:04,607
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really, really nice day</i>

1216
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:06,846
Yeah!

1217
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:10,988
Pretty crazy, right? Pretty wild!

1218
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:16,058
Well, technically, it...

1219
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,496
It's awesome.

1220
01:15:18,565 --> 01:15:20,863
Yes, right.

1221
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:23,835
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on! Everyone!

1222
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:29,834
This is gonna be a long ride home.

1223
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,468
<i>I'm havin' a</i>

1224
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:35,538
<i>Really nice day</i>
<i>Really nice day, really nice day</i>

1225
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:38,517
<i>- I'm having a</i>
<i>- I'm so cuddly, I like you</i>

1226
01:15:38,585 --> 01:15:40,052
<i>G'day</i>

1227
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,850
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?

1228
01:15:45,926 --> 01:15:47,518
Just get out.

1229
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:49,528
Sorry about that, everybody. Sorry.

1230
01:15:49,596 --> 01:15:51,029
Hello.

1231
01:15:52,066 --> 01:15:53,727
Do carry on.

1232
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,592
Come on!

1233
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:24,196
All right,
everybody exit in an orderly...

1234
01:21:24,264 --> 01:21:26,289
All right, single file! Keep it...

1235
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:31,468
I seem to do a lot of falling
and screaming in this adventure.
