1
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:01,521
Some things start out big...

2
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:05,359
and some things start out small.

3
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,694
Very small.

4
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,364
But sometimes the smallest thing...

5
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,492
can make the biggest changes of all.

6
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,572
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

7
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,951
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!

8
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,331
Plio, be careful.

9
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,498
Dad, get over here.

10
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:23,588
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go when stuff's happening.

11
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:34,974
- Well, what is it?
- It was an egg.

12
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,060
Look!

13
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:40,980
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea.

14
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,941
Vicious, flesh-eating.

15
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:48,571
- Looks like a baby to me.
- Babies grow up.

16
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,783
You keep that thing,
one day we'll turn our backs--

17
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,328
It'll be picking us out of its teeth.

18
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,916
Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

19
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,461
- So, what do we do?
- Get rid of it!

20
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:11,428
What has gotten into you?

21
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:15,265
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

22
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,769
I'm sorry, little one.

23
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,689
Okay, get rid of it.

24
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,901
All right, I will.

25
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,667
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

26
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,071
Here.

27
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:17,160
It's okay.
We'll teach him to hate meat.

28
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,792
Watch his head.

29
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,128
I-I mean, watch it.
He could bite.

30
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:37,972
This monster's got no teeth.
What's he gonna do, gum us to death?

31
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:43,269
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

32
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:47,065
Does that look like a monster to you?

33
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:28,022
Let me out! Let me out!

34
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,653
Hair ball!

35
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,698
That was great! Get him!

36
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,118
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

37
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,453
I can't take it!
There are too many of you!

38
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,873
Come on! Pick on somebody
your own size. Stop!

39
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:48,877
Help! All right, get up, get up, get up!
Hold it! I-- No, stop it! Stop it!

40
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:53,381
Oh, no--

41
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:01,222
Aladar? You're not dead.

42
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:05,977
- No!
- All right, guys, break it up.

43
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,148
Remember the courtship? You're
gonna miss seeing all that smooching.

44
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,233
- Oh!
- Oh, Mom!

45
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,153
That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here!

46
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,535
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

47
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,081
Go find Zini.
He's rehearsing pickup lines.

48
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,417
Let's hope he's found some new material.

49
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,880
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

50
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,884
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

51
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,763
Girls, I'm known
as the professor of love...

52
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,265
and school's in session!

53
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,476
Yeah, I still got it.

54
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,645
I hope it's not contagious.

55
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:51,356
I'm a raging epidemic of romance.

56
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:55,860
Come on, hot stuff. Let's get going. You
don't wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk.

57
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:59,405
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear
the mating advice of an old monkey.

58
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,867
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I heard that in his
day that old monkey was quite a swinger.

59
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,786
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah.

60
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,456
- To hear him tell it, he put the prime in primate.
- Really?

61
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,542
Okay, boys, gather 'round.

62
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,045
Listen and learn from the master.

63
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,464
Now, girls, don't jump into the trees...

64
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,967
after the first boy with a cute back flip.

65
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,886
It's more fun if you keep them guessing.

66
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,223
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

67
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,894
You're never going to forget this day,
so make it one to remember.

68
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:34,607
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

69
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,860
Come on, guys.
We don't wanna let 'em down.

70
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:41,906
- Go on, now! Chest out, chin up!
- Whoo!

71
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:47,245
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

72
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,248
With my charm and your brains, no problem.

73
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,591
Hey, girls, look what
just pulled into town.

74
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,761
- Hey, ladies!
- Your buffet table of love.

75
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,848
- Right here, right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

76
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:10,393
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

77
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,478
- Whoa!
- Wow!

78
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,982
Zini!

79
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:49,390
You're missing all the action, pal.
Come on.

80
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:53,603
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action! Whoo!

81
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,145
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

82
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,230
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.

83
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:23,359
With the ladies, before you know it
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.

84
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:28,865
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

85
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:33,327
No, we have two.

86
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,588
Well, it's never really
been his best event.

87
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,841
- He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar.

88
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:50,303
If only there was someone
on the island for you.

89
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,097
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

90
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:58,269
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

91
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,236
Whoa!

92
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:24,754
- What are they?
- I don't know.

93
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:01,666
- Dad?
- Something's wrong.

94
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,629
Aladar, where's Suri?

95
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,131
She's up in the tree.

96
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,878
Come on! Go, go! Come on!

97
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:50,089
- Mom!
- Suri!

98
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,842
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

99
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:56,387
- Mom!
- Suri, where are you?

100
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,311
Run, Aladar! Run! Run!

101
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,783
Yar, come on!

102
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:21,329
- Zini, jump! Jump!
- Zini, jump!

103
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,707
- Zini!
- Hold on!

104
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,103
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

105
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:31,107
Aladar! Over here!

106
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:06,076
Oh, Suri. Easy. Easy.

107
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,955
They're all gone.

108
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,416
Shh, shh.

109
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,544
I'm here.

110
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:18,797
Come on.
We can't stay here.

111
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:25,906
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

112
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,158
- Look!
- Whoa!

113
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,828
- Did you see that?
- What?

114
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,997
- I did.
- Me too!

115
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,958
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

116
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,169
- Leave it alone-- Hey!
- Shh, Dad!

117
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:42,298
- I-It's scaring Suri here.
- No, it's not.

118
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,217
Everyone just be quiet.

119
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:58,248
- Yar, grab on!
- I can't reach!

120
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,428
Aladar, they're stopping!

121
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,307
Huh?

122
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,938
Stay out of my way!

123
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:24,566
You heard Kron.
Move it!

124
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,586
Watch it!

125
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,269
Zini, get your head down!

126
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:33,385
Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me
know if that gets you there any faster.

127
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:39,808
Keep those little legs movin', Url,
or you'll get left behind.

128
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,863
Look at all the Aladars!

129
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,450
I-If you're even thinking
of joining them--

130
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,496
Hang on! Hang on!

131
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:31,026
Kron. There is a more protected spot
further down the--

132
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,113
We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

133
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:52,881
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at
your nesting grounds now.

134
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:58,303
All this pushing and shoving about,
just for a place to sleep.

135
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,889
I'm not used to this kind of behaviour.

136
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:05,644
Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

137
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,063
Oh, I could not possibly.

138
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,941
Uh, uh, shoo, shoo.

139
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,943
Will you come on, Baylene?

140
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,613
You wanna get to the nesting grounds
alive? Show some backbone.

141
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,074
Hey there!

142
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:23,495
Oh, sorry about that. Uh, it's just
we overheard you talking, and, um--

143
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,210
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

144
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:34,631
He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

145
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:41,388
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.

146
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,056
Excuse me?

147
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,312
Um, he's my grandfather,
a couple times removed.

148
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,898
Try a couple of species removed.

149
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:54,109
Uh, uh, uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.

150
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,570
We're all that's left.

151
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,364
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.

152
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,617
Baylene's the last of her kind.

153
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,870
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

154
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:08,582
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds.

155
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,711
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

156
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,297
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

157
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,259
Will we find anybody
that looks like us there?

158
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:23,513
Oh, the last few days
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

159
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,016
Who knows what we'll find.

160
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,436
The hard job now is just getting there.

161
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,189
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

162
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:37,319
- Kron, the herd's head honcho.
- We can hardly keep up.

163
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,615
A-An older woman like myself, it's--
Well, it's positively indecent.

164
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,284
Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

165
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,912
Oh!

166
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:54,336
Hey! What's his problem?

167
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,340
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

168
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,385
Uh, excuse me.
Kron! You got a second?

169
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:05,722
- Get lost, kid.
- Relax, Bruton.

170
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:13,522
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

171
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:17,275
Why aren't you uphill with the--

172
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,820
Uh, young bloods?

173
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,032
Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

174
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,952
I guess they-- they're having
a hard time keeping up.

175
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,746
So, you know, maybe
you could slow it down a bit.

176
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:35,919
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

177
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:40,215
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

178
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,427
Hey, they need help back here.

179
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,763
Watch yourself, boy.

180
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:51,351
Don't worry.
That's how my brother treats newcomers.

181
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,021
No matter how charming they are.

182
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:57,065
You sure know how to
catch a girl's eye there, stud.

183
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,486
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

184
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,490
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

185
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:09,995
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

186
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,248
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

187
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,418
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my--

188
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:19,838
No, Yar, she's right-- better to keep
our heads down with this bunch...

189
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,008
than get 'em bitten off by those things.

190
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:28,013
Well, you just consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

191
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,877
Hey, wake up. Enough with the beauty
sleep. You're ravishing already.

192
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,340
Hey! Hello! Anybody in there?

193
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,094
Zini, what are you doing?

194
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:10,180
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

195
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,891
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

196
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,269
Something's up. The herd's gathering
without us. Let's check it out.

197
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:20,690
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

198
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,151
Come on, get up.
On your feet.

199
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,655
The charm never stops around here.

200
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,950
- You say something?
- Uh, no. No, sir.

201
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:37,833
Unless you got a death wish, you and
that little parasite better get moving!

202
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,546
Sheesh, is that guy ugly, or what?

203
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,551
Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend.

204
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:54,975
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about: Neera.

205
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,604
Scaly skin, yellow eyes, big ankles.

206
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,732
Yeah. I made
a real impression on her.

207
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:06,319
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

208
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,364
- "The love monkey"?
- Oh, baby!

209
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,751
That, children,
is what's known as a jerkosaurus.

210
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,257
And with that, the ice is broken.

211
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,395
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.

212
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,773
We stop for nothing and no one.

213
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,279
If this is your first crossing, listen up.

214
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:53,033
There is no water
till we reach the other side.

215
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:58,038
And you'd better keep up, 'cause if
a predator catches you, you're on your own.

216
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,998
Move out!

217
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,052
Oh, my goodness.
It looks like a very long walk.

218
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:16,806
And hot. If you smell somethin'
sizzlin', it could be me.

219
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,592
- We're moving too slow.
- I'll pick up the pace.

220
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,729
Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit.

221
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:09,192
That's all I need:
a monkey on my back.

222
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:53,361
On your feet, Eema.
We can't let those things eat you.

223
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,864
They're out there waiting.

224
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,789
The lake!

225
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:49,793
- We made it?
- It's just over that-- that hill, baby.

226
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh, thank goodness.

227
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,756
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

228
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,468
Well, it's time to refresh my memory.

229
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:30,250
Ooh, I'm just gonna
walk right into that lake...

230
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,461
until the water's up to my eyeballs...

231
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:36,714
and soak it all in.

232
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,895
Maybe the rains collected somewhere else.

233
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,234
What do you want us to do?

234
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,863
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

235
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,788
Enough!
You have to be strong now!

236
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:13,042
The nesting grounds are only
a few days away! Keep moving!

237
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:18,298
Kron, we've never gone this long
without water.

238
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:21,259
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

239
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,679
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

240
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:36,524
What, they're moving already?
Oh, we'll never keep up.

241
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,234
There was water here.

242
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,236
Always water here before.

243
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:47,327
We always had water.
Always.

244
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,622
And-- And plenty of mud.

245
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:56,586
Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won't wait. We must carry on.

246
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,925
You gotta get up!

247
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:08,681
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

248
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,700
Baylene, don't move.

249
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,994
Uh, what is it? What's wrong?

250
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,624
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do.

251
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,126
Lift your foot, Baylene.

252
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,885
Now press down.

253
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:52,475
I always did like big girls!

254
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,853
- Water.
- Oh, my goodness!

255
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,529
- Water! Come on!
- They found water.

256
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,785
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

257
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,179
Kron, look.
All we had to do was dig and--

258
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,808
Good.
Now get out of the way.

259
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:49,032
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

260
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,755
Eema!

261
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:11,054
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

262
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:25,109
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

263
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:28,446
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

264
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,837
Let's get out of here.

265
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,909
Now, you come out on three.

266
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:18,746
One, two, three!

267
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,544
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

268
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,421
Hey, hey, what's going on?

269
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:31,426
The little Aladars haven't had anything
to drink. I think they're scared of me.

270
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:34,011
Well, who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

271
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:39,767
Come on over, guys.

272
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,061
Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.

273
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:46,190
And proud of it. Come on.
He's gonna find you some water.

274
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:03,499
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

275
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:10,423
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.
Knock it off.

276
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,675
Let's-- Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork.

277
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,096
Ready?
One, two, three.

278
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,183
Press!

279
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:25,104
Good job, Suri.

280
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:27,607
So, where are your parents, anyway?

281
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,026
A lot of us are on our own now.

282
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,449
- You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.

283
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,288
I'm Aladar, the jerkosaurus.

284
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,541
Oh. Sorry about that.

285
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:49,629
- Probably right.
- Dad, wake up.

286
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,631
Huh?

287
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:54,801
- Why did you help that old one?
- What else could we do?

288
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:57,428
Leave her behind?

289
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:01,474
Oh, you mean you actually--

290
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,851
Well, that happens all the time.

291
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,646
- You don't survive if you're not--
- Strong enough.

292
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:09,148
Well, yeah.

293
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:11,776
Is that you talking, or your brother?

294
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:19,325
Everything's so different.
I-- I don't know what to think any more.

295
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,995
Look, Neera, we watch out for each other...

296
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,082
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

297
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:29,335
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not.

298
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,838
But it's all I know.

299
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,716
So, um-- Oh, water.

300
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,344
I'll, uh, get you some water.

301
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,305
- Can I try?
- Sure. Just press.

302
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,896
- Hmm.
- Oops!

303
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,274
- Sorry.
- No, you--you first.

304
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:55,069
One down and--

305
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:57,613
Well, one down.

306
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,055
Kron! Carnotaurs!

307
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:25,558
What?
They never come this far north.

308
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,686
The fireball must've driven them out.

309
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,403
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!

310
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:39,906
Move the herd out, double-time!

311
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,836
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

312
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,091
Kron! What's going on?

313
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:02,094
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

314
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:05,431
But the others in the back,
they'll never make it.

315
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:10,019
- They'll slow down the predators.
- You can't sacrifice them like this!

316
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,941
Hold it! That could be
you back there, or you!

317
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:23,532
If you ever interfere again, I'll kill you.

318
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:29,956
Stay away from him!

319
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:37,046
Aladar, no! You just--
Just go. I'll be okay.

320
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,138
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

321
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,140
- Carno-what?
- Carnotaur.

322
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:51,143
A mouth full of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

323
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:55,022
Come on, you guys, get on, get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

324
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:57,858
Go on.

325
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:00,569
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

326
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,406
Aladar, slow down!

327
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,458
Oh, joy. Blisters.

328
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,294
I've got blisters on my blisters.

329
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:02,590
You don't wanna know where I got blisters.

330
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:05,092
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

331
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:08,888
- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

332
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:12,892
- Okay, what the second worst thing it could be?
- Two carnotaurs!

333
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,144
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
- That's it! I'm gone!

334
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:19,065
Everybody! We don't know for sure. It
could be the herd. Let's check it out.

335
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:21,567
Goodness. Goodness gracious!

336
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:33,412
Oh, it's Bruton.

337
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:37,458
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

338
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,681
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs.

339
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:56,519
- Oh, we should keep moving.
- We can't just leave him here.

340
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,771
We can if we move fast enough.

341
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:03,484
Hey, uh, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

342
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:07,113
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.

343
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:10,407
- Now get away from me.
- Suit yourself.

344
00:49:32,805 --> 00:49:36,225
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

345
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,154
It's dark, but at least it's dry.

346
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:52,491
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

347
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,869
Ouch! Sorry, Url.

348
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:57,746
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?

349
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:01,625
Ahem.
We appear to have a visitor.

350
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,697
You coming in, or what?

351
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,533
What is it with you?

352
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:37,578
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

353
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:40,706
Now come on. On your feet.

354
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:06,023
Uh, you can lie down with us.
It's warmer.

355
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:16,784
May I remind you that he's one of them?

356
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:20,246
Well, looks like he's one of us now.

357
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:32,091
Who booked this trip, anyway?

358
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:34,760
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

359
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:38,639
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

360
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:41,183
You tell him, Eema.

361
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:52,444
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

362
00:51:52,528 --> 00:51:56,699
If you could sleep that deep, honey,
you'd be dead.

363
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:03,914
This plant grew on our island.

364
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:07,626
It will make you feel better.

365
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:22,725
Why is he doing this,
pushing them on with false hope?

366
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:25,853
It's hope that's gotten us this far.

367
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:30,065
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

368
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:34,820
- I've accepted mine.
- And what is your fate?

369
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,489
To die here.

370
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:42,202
- It's the way things are.
- Only if you give up, Bruton.

371
00:52:42,286 --> 00:52:45,581
It's your choice, not your fate.

372
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:52,087
Well, the plant will help.

373
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:40,719
- Wow.
- Shh. Carnotaurs.

374
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,852
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

375
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:44,116
Go, go! Hurry!

376
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:48,454
Move it, Eema!

377
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:57,546
Aladar! Aladar! Oh, no!

378
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,806
I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

379
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:45,093
Bruton!

380
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:57,940
Bruton! No!

381
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,204
Bruton!

382
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:33,559
You did what you could.

383
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:40,000
It's okay, little ones.

384
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,711
We're going to make it.

385
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:12,115
Okay, okay, let's do it again. Let's do
it again. Um, I spy with my little eye--

386
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:15,827
- A rock.
- You got it again! Ooh, you are good!

387
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:20,791
Well, I'll tell you what I spy--
A dead end.

388
00:58:26,755 --> 00:58:31,176
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

389
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:37,099
- Hold on a moment.
- Zini, what is it?

390
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:40,936
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah!

391
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,535
- Get a load of that!
- Good show!

392
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:59,955
Everybody stand back!
We're out of here!

393
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:08,797
Run!

394
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,800
Aladar, look out!

395
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:21,226
No!

396
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:59,264
Aladar, we'll go back.

397
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:03,018
Back to what? It's gone.

398
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:05,604
We're not meant to survive.

399
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:10,525
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

400
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:13,653
And how dare you waste that
good fortune by simply giving up?

401
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:18,033
Well, shame on you.
Shame on you, shame on you.

402
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:22,454
The worst of it is,
you allowed an old fool like me...

403
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:25,540
to believe I was needed,
that I still had a purpose.

404
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:29,294
And do you know what?
You were right.

405
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:31,797
And I'm going to go on believing it.

406
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,259
And I, for one, am not willing to die here.

407
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:28,270
Oh, dear.

408
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:49,332
The nesting grounds.
It's-- It's untouched.

409
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:16,484
- Our new home.
- And it comes with a pool!

410
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:26,828
Cannonball!

411
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,749
Ha. Amateur.

412
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:34,169
Look out below!

413
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:54,147
Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?

414
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,525
Not to mention Neera.

415
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:02,364
They'll get here soon enough.

416
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,412
- Oh, no.
- Eema?

417
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,293
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

418
01:03:15,377 --> 01:03:18,922
That is the way we used to get in here.

419
01:03:24,928 --> 01:03:26,972
They'll never make it over that.

420
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:31,685
Aladar, wait, wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

421
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:34,562
Let him try.

422
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:39,609
I hope Kron's in a listening mood.

423
01:03:57,085 --> 01:03:59,462
Stay here.

424
01:04:04,676 --> 01:04:07,387
We'll find a way around it.

425
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,016
In the morning, we'll climb it.

426
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,078
We have to keep trying.

427
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:17,999
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

428
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:20,585
Now, let's go home!

429
01:05:31,054 --> 01:05:33,973
- You'll make it, won't you, boys?
- No!

430
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:38,520
Watch them. They're tough.
If they can do it, so can you!

431
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:50,532
Kron!

432
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:54,244
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur's coming!

433
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,958
- Keep moving!
- Stop!

434
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,585
I've been to the valley.
There's a safer way.

435
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,008
- Go on, show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

436
01:06:09,092 --> 01:06:13,221
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where? Straight to the carnotaurs?

437
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:17,016
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

438
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,561
There's a sheer drop on the other side.

439
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:25,650
You're gonna kill the herd! I know a way to
the valley, and everybody can make it!

440
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,403
Now follow me!

441
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:32,115
Kron!

442
01:06:33,408 --> 01:06:36,411
They're staying with me!

443
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:39,622
All right, let's go.

444
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:35,470
Neera!

445
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:36,698
He's led that monster right to us!
This way!

446
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:40,034
No! Don't move!

447
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:44,205
If we scatter, he'll pick us off.
Stand together.

448
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,999
Kron!

449
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:34,857
No. No.

450
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,809
Kron.

451
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,868
Welcome home.

452
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:29,907
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

453
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:34,245
I'd say it's been a few years
since you hatched an egg.

454
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:37,665
You're right.
So let me practise on your head.

455
01:13:37,748 --> 01:13:41,877
Look!
Somebody wants to meet you.

456
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:52,013
Oh, aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see.

457
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:55,975
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

458
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:59,353
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

459
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:03,774
Oh! Oh, happy day.

460
01:14:03,858 --> 01:14:07,778
- Well done, little one.
- Come here, you little rascal.

461
01:14:07,862 --> 01:14:10,865
Let me get a good look at you.

462
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:17,663
Yep, you're your father's son, all right.

463
01:14:17,747 --> 01:14:22,001
Hey, look what I found!
New neighbours!

464
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,796
Any of you ladies up for a game of,
uh, "monkey in the middle"?

465
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,216
Easy, now! Easy! Hey! Whoo!

466
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:23,688
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

467
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:28,234
One thing is certain--
Our journey's not over.

468
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:32,196
We can only hope that in some small way...

469
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:35,324
our time here will be remembered.
