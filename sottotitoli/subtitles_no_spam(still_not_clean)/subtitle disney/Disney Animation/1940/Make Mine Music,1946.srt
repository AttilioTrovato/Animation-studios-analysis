-1:59:04,397 --> -1:59:06,277
Hi everyone, how are you?

2
-1:59:06,340 --> -1:59:08,121
I'm Mariana Di Girolamo,

3
-1:59:08,184 --> -1:59:10,770
from my house,
here in Chile.

4
-1:59:10,980 --> -1:59:15,152
And I'm Ema in 'Ema'
the new film by Pablo Larraín.

5
-1:59:15,251 --> -1:59:19,605
Stick around after the film
as I'll be answering a few questions.

6
-1:59:19,957 --> -1:59:21,464
Stay safe!

7
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,050
Come in.

8
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:26,717
Hi.

9
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,009
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,092
Are you crazy?
I told you not to come to my office.

11
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,842
I called you 20 times.

12
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,425
I told you I wouldn't answer.
Why did you call me?

13
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,425
How's my son?

14
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,759
He isn't your son.
Not anymore.

15
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,759
Know what you have left?
Dyed hair and a shit husband.

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,634
I'm still his mom.

17
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:57,092
No, you know what you still are?
A spoiled brat.

18
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,092
You should've been given back.

19
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,634
I'm his mom...

20
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,509
- Not legally!
- What'll happen to him?

21
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,259
Know what's gonna happen?

22
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,675
In a couple of years he'll be 12.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,550
He'll escape from Child Protective Services
and he'll rob you at gunpoint.

24
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,050
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:15,592
He'll steal your car
and you'll report him...

26
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,651
- And he'll go to jail.
- Jail? Please!

27
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,776
Polo won't go to jail.
What are you saying?

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
You don't think so?

29
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,342
- Could you tell him that I love him, please?
- No.

30
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,467
I'm not going to
because I'm a bad liar.

31
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,467
Let me give you some advice...

32
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,050
Just stick to your fucking dancing.

33
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,134
Buy a doll. Dress it up.

34
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,110
Because what you want isn't a child.

35
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:37,175
You want a child who does nothing.
Stiff as a board.

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,175
How is he?
Tell me something.

37
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,967
I don't know, for heaven's sake!

38
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,050
Surely he has another mom
who's better than you.

39
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,592
- Was he adopted by another family?
- No idea.

40
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,360
- Is he up for adoption again?
- I have to go, enough.

41
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,050
- Tell me, please, goddammit.
- I don't know.

42
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:56,509
Marcela!

43
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:57,925
Look, listen to me.

44
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:00,759
You're young, ok?

45
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,365
You have your whole life ahead of you.
You'll forget all this.

46
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,384
But don't come to my office again.

47
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,925
Let's finish this.
The end, bye.

48
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:56,634
Do you like it?

49
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,092
No.

50
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:07,259
And that one?

51
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,675
I like her natural hair,
like it was before.

52
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:14,717
Sorry, Carlos.

53
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,675
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok. Enough apologies.

54
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,842
Remember when Pauli went to a concert
in Playa Ancha and came back bald?

55
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,300
- She looked gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

56
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,425
I have no energy, goddammit.

57
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:32,759
You can't be sad your whole life.

58
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,717
Things happen. It was an accident.

59
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,735
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

60
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,717
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't an accident.

61
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,509
It's not gonna happen again.

62
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,509
You have to do what lizards do.

63
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,842
What do lizards do
when their tail is cut?

64
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,967
They get disoriented.

65
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,509
They're fucked up.

66
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,217
I can't, I can't do it.

67
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,634
- Press the button.
- She's sedated.

68
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,759
- What is she sedated with?
- Morphine.

69
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,759
Why would you think they're
gonna give her morphine?

70
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,610
Then they only gave her a little,

71
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:34,300
- They should give her at least 30ml.
- What do you know?

72
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,610
- I think they're gonna ask us to give blood.
- Gross.

73
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,884
I can donate... one liter.

74
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,360
Nonsense, Ema. At best they'd
let you donate half.

75
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:46,300
It's my blood.
I do what I want with my blood, Mom.

76
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,092
You'll be fine.

77
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,675
You'll be fine.

78
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,467
One day you'll forgive us.

79
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:05,134
Forgive me. Ema. And Polo.

80
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,134
It feels like it's nighttime
and there's a fire.

81
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,175
Oh, yeah?

82
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,342
It could be a giant that stomps
and makes an earthquake!

83
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,884
Don't stop bouncing.

84
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:04,009
3, 4, 5, 6...

85
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:05,592
7, stop.

86
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,759
Stretch your arms, hug yourself.

87
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:29,300
Right now.
Polo is shedding tears of rage.

88
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:30,884
Because you abandoned him.

89
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,509
We abandoned him.
It's our fault.

90
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,092
Yes, maybe it is.

91
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,634
But it's very hard.

92
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,592
It's so hard because it hurts a lot more.

93
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,759
To be abandoned by your mother.

94
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,884
Yes, a woman's betrayal is much harder.
Yes...

95
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:51,842
By a bad woman.

96
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,675
By a bad mother.

97
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,550
No, I think...

98
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:01,967
Just when Polo was starting to trust you,
you abandoned him.

99
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,425
We both abandoned him.

100
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:05,592
Both...

101
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,842
He's a child.

102
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:25,592
You loved that we all slept in the same bed
so you wouldn't have to fuck me.

103
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,360
I would've adopted a younger boy, but...

104
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:31,592
Who was going to give you a child?

105
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:35,967
You taught him to set things on fire.

106
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,925
You wanted him to burn the house down.

107
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:45,425
So I'd have to... I don't know.

108
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:47,842
Give him back.

109
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,217
He burned your sister's face.

110
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:12,300
They thought you were infertile
from getting something and not treating it.

111
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,175
So it's your fault, Gastón.

112
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,717
That we had to do all this shit and
that we adopted a child with a mustache.

113
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,550
It's your fault
that we couldn't stand him.

114
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,342
And it's your fault
that my whole body hurts.

115
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,360
And that people
look at us in public.

116
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:34,842
Like we suffocated a dog
with a plastic bag.

117
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:58,009
Do you know why Polo loved you?

118
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,800
- Because he thought you were beautiful.
- No.

119
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,967
Yes.

120
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:07,050
When we went to pick him up,
he called you "beautiful."

121
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,550
"Hey beautiful, come here."

122
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,509
And you got closer.

123
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,634
You got in his face.

124
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:19,050
You got closer and flirted all the time.
The grins, everything.

125
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,759
You put your tongue on his teeth.

126
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,425
You undressed in front of him.

127
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,842
That time you put
your nipple in his mouth.

128
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,009
He was my son.

129
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:35,009
My son can suck my whole body
if he wants.

130
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:37,425
No...

131
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:40,259
No, you don't do that to a child.

132
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,259
- You fucked up my life.
- And you fucked me up.

133
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,592
I was a little girl and you
didn't take care of me.

134
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:50,550
Infertile pig.

135
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:00,675
- Let's do it again.
- The deer.

136
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,675
And together, legs together.

137
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,634
- Yes.
- The deer.

138
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,634
Sorry to change the subject.
But I don't know what to do.

139
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,050
Or whether to talk to the guidance
counselor or the department head.

140
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,360
But we need tools
to explain it to the children.

141
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:20,134
What's going on with Polo Valderrama.

142
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,425
- With whom?
- Polo Valderrama, a fourth grader.

143
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,217
Ah... What happened?

144
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:33,175
Child Protective Services called.
They're removing Polo from school.

145
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:35,217
Child Protective Services?
Why?

146
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,259
He's sick.

147
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:39,342
What happened?

148
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,717
They gave him back.

149
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,425
No.

150
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:45,300
- Oh, no?
- No.

151
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,550
Then I was wrong.

152
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,842
I don't like to get into
people's personal lives.

153
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,217
I'm worried about
how to explain it to the children.

154
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:58,009
Because they're asking.

155
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,259
And...

156
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:04,342
I don't want to tell them
"You know what?"

157
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,300
"Polo's parents
don't love him anymore."

158
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,259
"He misbehaved, so they gave him back."

159
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,884
Polo's no longer an adopted child.
He's an orphan again.

160
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,675
You know?
I don't know how to explain it.

161
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:19,509
Is that true?

162
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:21,842
Yeah.

163
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:24,384
Did you give him back?

164
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,467
That's why he isn't here,
because he isn't your son anymore.

165
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:30,759
That's what I want to explain.

166
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,550
What a shame.

167
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:39,300
It'd be better to say that Polo went to
live with family in Santiago.

168
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,467
No, we can't say that.

169
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:44,467
She'll still be teaching here.

170
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,259
Will you keep working here, Ema?

171
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:48,967
Sure, it's my job.

172
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,717
I have to work, too.

173
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:56,217
But I don't know if I can keep doing it.
Seeing your face everyday...

174
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,717
Your face... Your hair.

175
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,675
Are you stupid?
Don't you realize what we're saying?

176
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:07,800
I think Ema should take medical leave.

177
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
- What's in it?
- I don't know.

178
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,634
Some kind of domestic violence.

179
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,860
- I don't know.
- You're leaving now?

180
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:17,425
- Yes, I have an audition.
- What?

181
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,509
- Ok, with a guy or a girl?
- I don't know.

182
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,009
- I have to pay like 300 bucks.
- Ok, last one.

183
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,693
- Is there ice left?
- Yeah, I'll go get it.

184
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:28,009
- Do you have to call?
- Just a text.

185
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Ema.

186
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,592
Mati.

187
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,592
Gastón.

188
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:51,759
I'm sorry, Sonia.

189
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:53,967
It must've been last week.

190
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,634
Tell them it was me.
A performance. A...

191
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,717
Everyone knows it was Polo.

192
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,050
- What's it to you?
- They're going to scream.

193
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,217
- Who?
- All of them, the bad dancers.

194
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,092
We'll leave together. I'll distract them.

195
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,300
And you throw the cat in the street.

196
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,384
Our little boy, Ema...

197
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,634
Holy shit.
What did we do?

198
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,925
What if we get another child?

199
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,300
Ema.

200
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,092
No, it's not my fault.

201
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,384
It wasn't my fault.

202
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,509
- We're going to be ok, right?
- We're fine.

203
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,068
- Oh yeah? We're fine.
- We're ok.

204
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:54,550
We don't need anything,
people love us.

205
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,925
Do you know who's fine?
Polo.

206
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,443
- He's happy.
- Yeah, he is.

207
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,675
Because he's no longer with us...

208
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,717
I'm going to tell everyone that...

209
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,509
I don't know... That...

210
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,967
It was something
that we did with Polo.

211
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,884
That we kept stuffed animals in
a refrigerator.

212
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,509
And it was for him

213
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:23,217
and since we saw it...
We got sad and that's why we're leaving.

214
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,050
No, it's not necessary.

215
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:31,009
They're drunk, they won't realize,
they're having fun.

216
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,759
Yeah...

217
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,592
Yes, I also think
that Polo is realizing it now.

218
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,884
He's absorbing everything, you know?

219
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,300
We are doing it for him.

220
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,050
Because he needs a dad and a mom.

221
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:48,009
Who love him like he's never been
loved in his whole fucking life.

222
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,717
You don't realize it,
but you're beautiful.

223
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,342
You're gorgeous.

224
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,550
And I'm very lucky to be with you.

225
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,467
What if we have a quickie?

226
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:11,425
No.

227
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,800
You are a human condom.

228
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,009
You'll never give me a son.

229
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,675
A real son.

230
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,342
I gave you a son.

231
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:27,675
A real one.

232
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,967
And you just threw him out.

233
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:38,884
Remember when Polo took your hand
and put it on his chest?

234
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,092
And he said "Mommy."

235
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:44,675
"Don't leave me, Mommy."

236
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,509
"I close my eyes,
and I feel like you'll leave."

237
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:53,634
"Don't leave me,
don't abandon me."

238
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:56,717
He asked for your forgiveness.

239
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,092
I love you.

240
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,467
I love you too. I'm sorry.

241
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:17,175
I'm so sorry.

242
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,050
Forget it.

243
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:20,276
- I forgive you
- Yes.

244
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I love you.

245
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,425
How long Polo lived here?

246
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:58,134
- Only 10 months.
- No it was more.

247
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,009
He was a year with us at least.

248
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:04,384
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

249
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:05,985
- Nothing is going on?
- No.

250
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,259
Do you know what's going on?

251
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,675
I did you two a favor.

252
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:12,842
- A favor?
- Of course I did.

253
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,009
We paid you.

254
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:17,360
- What the fuck did you say?
- Hey! No.

255
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:18,860
- Marcela please leave.
- Say it again.

256
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,401
I said we paid you.

257
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:23,610
Nobody wants to adopt these
Colombian or Venezuelan children.

258
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,735
- Don't say that, it's not true.
- Polo was 7 years old.

259
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,884
6...

260
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:30,443
Nobody wanted to adopt him?
We did.

261
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,550
Thanks to me.

262
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:33,860
You manipulated the report for money.

263
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,592
That's not true.
Check my bank account.

264
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,842
All I did was receive the report.

265
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:42,675
And change the sex.

266
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,818
- And what did it say there?
- Oh, don't you know?

267
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,342
I know, but tell me again.

268
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:48,842
- You want me to remind you?
- Yes.

269
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:52,509
Homosexual behaviors. Exhibitionism.

270
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,342
Sexual brutality.

271
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:57,884
- Shows with blood.
- It was for a performance.

272
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:00,818
It was just a scene, it's not real.
It's not real life.

273
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,217
It's fiction.
That's my job.

274
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:06,276
We rehearse something, we act it out.

275
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,134
Gastón is not gay.

276
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:09,550
This guy?

277
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,675
I just want you to understand.

278
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,175
That the system is made to
cut people like you out.

279
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,634
And I am the system, motherfuckers.

280
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:27,425
So all those meetings you
had with social workers.

281
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,134
With the psychologists.
They asked us things.

282
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,717
"Are they crazy?"
No, they aren't.

283
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,175
"Do they want to play with dolls?"
No, how could you?

284
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:40,384
"She's very young for him."
It doesn't matter.

285
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:41,526
It's all good.

286
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,985
"But he's weird."
You're weird.

287
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,009
What else?
It didn't matter either.

288
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:52,175
Until the external evaluator came in.

289
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,068
And who saved you?
Everything went wrong.

290
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,467
And who saved you?
I did.

291
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:57,675
I saved you.

292
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
We gave the child up for
adoption, for God's sake.

293
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:02,300
And then what?

294
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:06,050
Then the child tests you
because he's intelligent.

295
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,425
And the problems start.

296
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,842
He tells you that you aren't his mom,
because you're not!

297
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:15,925
And then he sets the house on fire,
burns his aunt's face. So what?

298
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:20,134
Nonetheless, they're normal things.

299
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,842
I told you, didn't I?

300
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:25,300
All he wants is that,
in spite of all the shit he does,

301
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:28,675
You tell him you still love him.

302
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:33,401
Polo grew up and learned
and now he's calmed down.

303
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,509
Understand?

304
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:35,967
And what did you do?

305
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:39,509
You gave him back,
you put him up for adoption again.

306
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,800
And now he's exposed
to any old psychopath.

307
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:45,634
And?

308
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:50,884
Maybe not, hopefully not.

309
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:53,134
I hope he's well.

310
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:57,550
I hope he's with a good family,
that he has a cell phone.

311
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,509
That he's warm
and safe in his bed.

312
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:03,384
Drinking strawberry milk.

313
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:07,509
- Did you see him?
- It's none of your business.

314
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,675
Get it through your thick skull!

315
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,884
Unbelievable.

316
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,800
I don't know.

317
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:19,217
Perhaps you're not cut out
to be a mother.

318
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:22,592
And neither are you, fucking psycho!

319
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:24,592
You're completely insane.

320
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:27,050
Fix your rotten heads.

321
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,967
Before adopting children.

322
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:34,384
What was that?

323
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,050
- What?
- See what you did?

324
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:42,925
Me?

325
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,259
You went to Child Protective Services.
They told you not to.

326
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:47,509
Why?

327
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:49,009
I do what I want.

328
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:51,217
Exactly.
You can't do whatever you want.

329
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,193
You can't do whatever you want.

330
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:56,009
Dammit. Nobody can stand you now.
You're unbearable!

331
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:58,592
Nobody in the company can stand you.

332
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,384
- Nobody can stand me?
- No!

333
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,735
Nobody can stand you,
you don't realize it.

334
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,967
I don't give a fuck.
She just told you.

335
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,526
You provoked all this shit.

336
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,425
Everybody knows it.

337
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:10,675
Everyone.

338
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:32,884
Thanks, sweetie.

339
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,759
- You can stay as long as you want.
- Thank you.

340
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,092
Where am I gonna sleep?

341
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,634
Here.

342
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,259
- Where is Gastón?
- Fuck Gastón.

343
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,092
Fuck Gastón.

344
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:11,300
Don't be rude, Mom.

345
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,009
I took you three by the hands
when you were little.

346
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:22,342
I squeezed you really hard
and I said that we'd always be together.

347
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,634
I don't remember that.

348
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:27,634
When your dad left.

349
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:30,759
I don't remember.

350
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:36,092
I told you to look out for eachother.
Always stick together.

351
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:37,925
And where do you all live now?

352
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,259
All together.

353
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,592
You all sleep in the same bed.
One on top of the other.

354
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:46,592
I don't believe that you said that...

355
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,134
How old was I?

356
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,925
Four.

357
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,092
I don't believe you, Mom.

358
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,092
Moms always have to be
with their daughters.

359
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,259
Because children make a family.

360
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:06,634
And moms can never be
separated from their children.

361
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:10,425
That's how the world's always been
and how it should stay.

362
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,134
What should I do, Mom?

363
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,342
Do what I would do.
That's what you have to do.

364
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,967
- Was he violent toward you?
- No.

365
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,300
He's not well. That's all.

366
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,342
He has those typical male dilemmas.

367
00:33:33,717 --> 00:33:35,050
Hm, I know what you mean.

368
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,259
And he agrees with this?

369
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:39,342
I don't know.
I'd have to ask him.

370
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:43,259
- Ok, but what would he say?
- It'll seem wrong to him.

371
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,717
- He's in love.
- With you?

372
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,384
Yeah.

373
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:51,384
With me.

374
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,675
Yes, of course.

375
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,675
I mean. What a pity.
Poor guy.

376
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,759
- Poor him?
- Yes, of course.

377
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:02,842
He's twelve years older than me.

378
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,842
- Twelve?
- Twelve.

379
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:09,009
Well then, he can go to Hell.

380
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:17,550
- Have you ever been with an older man?
- Me?

381
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:23,592
- Sorry.
- No, it's ok.

382
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:25,300
It's just...

383
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:28,384
I don't usually talk about myself.

384
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:30,884
I don't like it.

385
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,259
I mean, it's not that,
it's just that nobody can stand me anymore.

386
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,592
I can stand you.

387
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:39,384
If you want.

388
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:42,425
I have to do that,
because you're paying me.

389
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:44,509
There's a problem.

390
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:47,175
I don't have money.

391
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,175
To pay you.

392
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,467
So we have a problem.

393
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,550
Because lawyers
we charge for our work.

394
00:34:57,092 --> 00:34:58,092
We're terrible.

395
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:01,009
Yeah, but it's just a divorce.

396
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,009
You fill out a form, I sign it.

397
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,217
That's it, easy.

398
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,634
You're too much.

399
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:15,634
I can wash your clothes.
I could cook for you.

400
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:18,175
Iron.

401
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,384
Pick your kids up from school.
Do you have kids?

402
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:24,175
Yes.

403
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:26,134
I can sing.
I can also dance.

404
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,592
- I can walk your dogs.
- Please, dance.

405
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:35,550
I'm just kidding.

406
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,217
I'm just messing with you.

407
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,467
What are you doing?

408
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:00,509
And what style is that?

409
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:01,842
Reggaeton.

410
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:06,009
You're getting your son back, right?

411
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:10,175
I don't know.

412
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:12,925
Hopefully.

413
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,842
Amazing. How exciting.

414
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,467
Awesome.

415
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:22,318
Ema, you're going to battle.

416
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,485
Maybe we won't see
your beautiful body again.

417
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,800
So we'll say goodbye now.

418
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,193
If you need us to commit a crime,
just call us.

419
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,425
Whatever you need.

420
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:34,550
We'll be nearby.

421
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,800
It's the right thing.
Isn't it?

422
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,009
Of course.

423
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,884
Will someone kiss me goodbye?

424
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:09,550
The fuel is called Napalm.
It's a mixture of kerosene and diesel.

425
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,425
Mom.

426
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,634
She likes to buy contraband at the port.

427
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,300
They sold it to her as a
rat killer for the farm.

428
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,759
- To poison them?
- To burn them alive.

429
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,634
- Then Gastón took it.
- Oh right.

430
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:27,300
He wanted to do this performance,
to get on a boat.

431
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,342
And burn another boat while
we danced on the pier.

432
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,300
But it didn't work.

433
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,967
- Watch out.
- Be careful with that.

434
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:43,800
- And it feels good?
- Incredibly good.

435
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:45,384
How good?

436
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:50,050
Imagine an elephant trunk blasting
a stream of boiling water for 20 seconds.

437
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:51,342
Amazing.

438
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:57,675
Male dinosaur cum.

439
00:38:58,134 --> 00:38:59,134
Delicious.

440
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,925
The way it was before:

441
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,050
People burned trees then planted
new seeds so they could eat.

442
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,634
Burn in order to sow again.

443
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:54,110
Well, the car is hers.
We parked it here.

444
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,526
We went to a friend's house
where we're staying nearby.

445
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,800
- Is the car yours?
- Yes.

446
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:00,110
- How long have you had it?
- Years.

447
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:01,384
- A long time?
- Yes.

448
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:05,675
- Did you ever have any problems with it?
- It was old, but it worked.

449
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,217
Do you have any suspicions?
What do you think happened?

450
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:12,818
- Trashy people from the hill.
- What does that mean?

451
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:13,842
Anarchists.

452
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:16,592
- Are you from Valparaíso?
- No.

453
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,842
- How long have you been here?
- Years.

454
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:23,259
- So you live here.
- Yes, but we weren't born here.

455
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:26,384
How long have you been a firefighter?

456
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,550
That's not relevant right now.

457
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,259
Hi.

458
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:29,842
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

459
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,675

460
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:05,467

466
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,592
How long have you two known eachother?

467
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:23,925
Not long.

468
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:26,050
Anibal put out the fire.

469
00:44:28,925 --> 00:44:30,675
With the hose.

470
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,634
Like a superhero.

471
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,134
Some days I am.
At night I work here.

472
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,651
Great, because we don't
have money to pay.

473
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:41,842
Nothing, nil.
Dine and dash.

474
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:46,675
After we met,
I went home with that smell.

475
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,550
My burnt smell is different than yours.

476
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:03,009
You have to get all the smells
from the day. Mine's like gas, see?

477
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,884
Hey, just you. Hey, no.

478
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:10,467
Hey, stop!
People are watching.

479
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,259
We have to be discrete.

480
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,342
Do you want another drink?

481
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,092
Who's the prettiest?

482
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:24,800
You're all beautiful, truly unbelievable.

483
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:28,675
Who's the prettiest?

484
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
Laura. Let's see.
You have to let them by.

485
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:46,342
Sonia, when they come,
you have to let them by.

486
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:49,592
They're not the dancers.
We're the dancers.

487
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:51,217
- It all fell apart.
- Come on.

488
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:54,967
Stop!

489
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,717
We've reached the point
where we're lost, right?

490
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,967
The point of... baaaam!

491
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:06,759
Did you bring something
to cover yourself up?

492
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:09,509
Can someone give her something?

493
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,634
Come on. You come running
from over there and you look naked.

494
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:16,592
And what about you?
Are you gonna do it?

495
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:19,134
- Or not?
- Sure.

496
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:21,592
So, how do we finish?

497
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:23,259
Final position, please.

498
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:26,342
The position
before all this chaos started.

499
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,675
If you're gonna do it then finish it here.

500
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:30,134
Where did I finish it?

501
00:46:30,884 --> 00:46:33,509
- Wherever, I don't know.
- Here.

502
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:34,634
Let's do it again?

503
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,675
Did the choreographer come today?

504
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:38,759
I'm just saying.

505
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:41,634
We're paying attention.
Now give us the cues.

506
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:44,134
You know what? Get out of here.
Really, get out.

507
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,259
We can't work like this.

508
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:48,759
Just get out.

509
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:51,925
Gastón.
Are you going to talk or not?

510
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:59,342
Or should I speak?

511
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,175
I don't know, but we have
to solve this mess.

512
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:04,967
Look.

513
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,175
I understand that you hate me now.

514
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,550
But I also understand.

515
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:15,509
When Ema spends 4 nights
in a row without sleep.

516
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:18,134
Crying. Saying "I can't."

517
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,693
"I can't, I feel like I'm killing him."

518
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:22,259
And I ask her "Killing him?"

519
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,175
She says "Yes."

520
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,509
"I feel that Polo is my son."

521
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,425
"I love him, but I'm not his mother."

522
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,342
It was you?
Yeah...

523
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:38,842
I fell for it.

524
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:42,592
I completely fell for it.

525
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:47,818
- Gastón.
- Now I see you.

526
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:50,259
I see all of you and...
You're my family.

527
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:52,634
We're family.
Although dysfunctional.

528
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,717
And I wonder, damn it, where's Polo?

529
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,217
Where is he?

530
00:47:56,759 --> 00:47:59,634
I mean, he should be here.
He should be taking the jackets.

531
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:02,134
And making a pallet in the corner.

532
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:04,884
The way he used to.
Like a puppy taking a nap.

533
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,550
Do you remember how he laughed?

534
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,967
The good times he had with all of you.

535
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:13,342
Because my son is Colombian.
He dances well.

536
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:15,842
Colombians are great fucking dancers.

537
00:48:22,134 --> 00:48:25,342
I need you to understand this.

538
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,134
You're firing her, dude.

539
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,675
- No, I'm not firing her.
- Yes, you are.

540
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:32,009
But it doesn't matter because
this shit ends here.

541
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:35,235
Sorry, but who are you?
Who gave you the authority to say that?

542
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:36,467
I'm leaving then.

543
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:38,776
Keep doing your fucking folklore.

544
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,342
- Great, if you don't like it then leave.
- I'm leaving voluntarily, idiot.

545
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:44,568
Then voluntarily grab your stuff and go.

546
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,175
The problem is that Ema isn't
leaving voluntarily.

547
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:49,425
No, before I wasn't.
But now I want to leave.

548
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,634
- Go somewhere else to dance reggaeton.
- You shut up.

549
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,675
You're a tourist here.

550
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:02,259
A typical cruise tourist who takes photos
and thinks they know the history of the port.

551
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,550
Go out on the street.

552
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,967
When's the last time you moved your ass?

553
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:12,467
You have this idea of an imaginary
street that existed 100 years ago.

554
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,717
You play beautiful music in the port
so it looks like Paris.

555
00:49:16,175 --> 00:49:18,092
It was never like that.

556
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,568
That's why everything has to be destroyed.

557
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:21,943
Other music has to be danced.

558
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:24,134
Something that scares a tourist like you...

559
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,050
- Push her hair inside.
- Yes.

560
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,092
- Very pretty.
- I swear you look beautiful.

561
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:30,842
Really.

562
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,818
You can't tell.
I swear it looks real.

563
00:49:32,842 --> 00:49:35,068
- Are you sure?
- Yes, totally.

564
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:37,193
I wouldn't recognize you on the street.

565
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:39,735
I swear. You can pull it.
Look, it's great quality.

566
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:40,759
It's hurting her.

567
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,568
No it isn't, don't be silly.

568
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:46,134
Look, when she feels that the wig
is part of her, then it will start to hurt.

569
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,860
- Mom, that'll never happen.
- Yes it will, it's on your head.

570
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:50,401
- Look at it.
- You look cute.

571
00:49:50,425 --> 00:49:53,485
It looks horrible, like doll hair!

572
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:56,092
- Hey, don't talk to me like that.
- It looks like doll hair!

573
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,360
You're overreacting!
Don't beat yourself up.

574
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:00,193
- Why shouldn't I?
- You're overreacting.

575
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:01,884
- Dammit, Mom!
- It's not my fault.

576
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:03,717
I'm deformed.
I look like a dog.

577
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:06,467
It's not my fucking fault.

578
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:09,800
I wasn't the fool who poured alcohol
on my face and burned it.

579
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:12,634
It was that unwanted fucking bastard.

580
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:16,425
Why did you give him back?

581
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:20,634
We didn't give Polo back
because he burned your hair.

582
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:25,009
Then why did you do it?

583
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,634
All this time you thought we gave
him back because of you?

584
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:35,092
He tried to kill me.

585
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:37,634
- He tried to kill me.
- He was a kid.

586
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:39,842
He was playing with matches.

587
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:43,068
Then why didn't he try to kill you?

588
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:45,217
- He tried to do many things.
- To kill you?

589
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,300
I don't think so.

590
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,985
- I'm not asking for it. I'm offering it.
- What?

591
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,884
- What?
- Huh?

592
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,509
I've been doing it
since I was a little girl.

593
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:01,300
I take him into the bathroom,
pull down his pants,

594
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,318
And I grab it.
Without sucking it.

595
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:04,467
Absolutely no sucking.

596
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:06,842
- But it's your idea, right?
- Yes, it is.

597
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:09,300
But sometimes the guy
is a little tense.

598
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,925
A little violent.

599
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,884
- I can't believe it.
- And what else?

600
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,092
- Then I take his hand.
- Ok?

601
00:51:16,134 --> 00:51:19,467
I take him into the stall.
I close the door and stare at him.

602
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:22,759
And I say:
"Please don't tell anyone."

603
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,800
"I've never done this before."

604
00:51:25,884 --> 00:51:29,592
I act like I'm stupid
and I start going at it.

605
00:51:29,884 --> 00:51:32,759
- I say, "Don't stick it in. I'm on my period."
- Unbelievable.

606
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,550
- Ok
- It really works.

607
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:38,009
The dick is one thing.

608
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:41,592
But the anthropological interest
is to look at their face.

609
00:51:41,884 --> 00:51:43,592
They change, drastically.

610
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:46,884
They get a stupid look on their faces.
Like little boys.

611
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,300
They show their true colors, you know?

612
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,842
And then they fall in love.

613
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:55,800
They call me, they write to me.
I don't answer.

614
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,592
- Really?
- Then he starts to fall apart.

615
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,842
He suffers, he cries.

616
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:05,592
He becomes nothing...
I'm not interested in sex.

617
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,384
I'm interested in emotion.

618
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:10,050
I like the mess.
The twisted power it has.

619
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:12,759
How do we know you don't blow him?

620
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:15,759
Because you have to be
in love to do that.

621
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,175
- What's love?
- I'm love.

622
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:19,884
Ema got turned on.

623
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,967
I was already horny.

624
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:25,717
- Have you thought about me?
- All the time.

625
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,092
And about you.

626
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:31,384
About you.

627
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:33,717
About you.

628
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:36,092
About you.

629
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,342
I have two sisters and my dad died.

630
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:56,592
How did he die?

631
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,467
- Sorry.
- It's ok, I want to tell you.

632
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:01,967
He was addicted to poker.

633
00:53:02,134 --> 00:53:06,800
He lost everything, ran away, threw
himself into the sea, drowned and died.

634
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:09,467
He was even taking pills.

635
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:12,384
Nobody gave him mouth-to-mouth.

636
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,509
Do you know how to do that?

637
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:20,425
Mouth-to-mouth breathing?
Of course.

638
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,675
- Did you feel that?
- Yes.

639
00:53:29,884 --> 00:53:32,634
- Did you like it?
- You saved my life.

640
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:39,259
I'm married, Ema.

641
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,967
Me too.

642
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:46,717
Actually, I just hired a lawyer
to start the divorce.

643
00:53:50,884 --> 00:53:52,634
I haven't done this in a long time.

644
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,467
God damn.

645
00:53:57,384 --> 00:54:04,092
I'm like that.
I'm always thinking about good and evil.

646
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,509
And I always opt for the good.

647
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:13,342
Well, there's a problem. I'm evil.

648
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,009
Oh, yeah?

649
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:17,134
Yes.

650
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:20,259
- I've been with a lot of women.
- How many?

651
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,134
- A lot.
- And?

652
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:29,884
I've heard that before. "I'm evil".

653
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:35,467
So many women say they're perverse.

654
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,217
Or evil, the worst. Why?

655
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:42,092
- Ok, and I said that?
- Yes.

656
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,092
I'm going to horrify you.

657
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:51,610
- Horrify me?
- When you know what I'm doing and why.

658
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:53,342
You will be horrified.

659
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,592
Why wait? Scare me now.

660
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:01,759
I sleep with my mom.

661
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,592
In the same bed.

662
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,425
Very childish, right?

663
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:11,175
- Not at all. I'd do the same.
- Why don't you?

664
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:13,175
Because I don't have a mom.

665
00:55:17,925 --> 00:55:19,610
And I have to sleep with my wife.

666
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:22,717
Well, what a pity.
Your wife is going to sleep alone tonight.

667
00:55:23,425 --> 00:55:25,634
- Are we going to sleep together?
- Right here.

668
00:55:27,509 --> 00:55:29,259
- Do you have any diseases?
- No.

669
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:30,717
Me neither.

670
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:32,800
And I didn't bring a condom.

671
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,467
How do you like it?

672
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:21,384
Do you like her?

673
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:24,800
Yes.

674
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,800
But she always wants to talk about you.

675
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,759
I thought you were going
to sleep with a man now.

676
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:34,217
I thought about that, too.

677
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,634
But I like her.

678
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,384
- Thanks.
- She wanted it.

679
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:43,259
She asked for my permission, actually.

680
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:45,967
Oh, that was nice.
It's good.

681
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:48,009
Send me your friend to be with me.

682
00:56:48,217 --> 00:56:49,550
Go ahead.

683
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:51,925
She's pretty.
Look at her...

684
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,967
But I can also sleep with
someone if I want to.

685
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:01,675
Maybe I already slept with someone.

686
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:04,925
Maybe I'm already dating someone.

687
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:07,925
You already did it?

688
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,509
I met someone.

689
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,175
- Are you gonna tell me everything?
- Everything.

690
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:19,217
What happens if you like him a lot?

691
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:23,050
I'm sure I'll like him a lot.

692
00:57:24,134 --> 00:57:25,342
What does he look like?

693
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,592
I don't know.
I haven't seen him naked yet.

694
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:31,717
But he has big fingers like bananas.

695
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,550
We're married.

696
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,717
We have children.

697
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,592
This is a separation with children.

698
00:57:40,217 --> 00:57:43,901
Remember when the doctor made
you go into that room with some porn.

699
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:46,467
And you came out with your
little bottle of semen.

700
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:51,675
I liked the waiting room
and seeing the men with their women.

701
00:57:53,009 --> 00:57:55,842
And then you came out with red lips.

702
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:59,634
After orgasming into
in that sweaty little bottle.

703
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,175
Awesome.

704
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,842
With that look of failure.
It was so great.

705
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:09,342
"Oh, don't leave me Mommy."

706
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,550
"Oh Mommy, don't leave me alone."

707
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,092
"Hold my hand."

708
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:17,717
"Hey, Mom."

709
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,592
"Mommy Ema".

710
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,134
"I love you."

711
00:58:24,425 --> 00:58:29,509
I'm going to make sure you
never forget what he told you.

712
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:43,675
You have to go back to the house.

713
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:46,259
For what?

714
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:49,384
You can't leave me here alone.

715
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:53,443
You leave me alone.
You start dancing to that shitty music.

716
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,592
All just to piss me off.

717
00:58:56,009 --> 00:58:57,259
You leave me out.

718
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:03,509
After something so terrible.
So frightening.

719
00:59:03,592 --> 00:59:05,009
Like what we did.

720
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:08,009
We have to stick together.

721
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:10,592
At least for two years.

722
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:22,634
- This hand looks great.
- Oh, really?

723
00:59:23,384 --> 00:59:27,092
The other one isn't very good.
So I'll only charge you 300 bucks.

724
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,884
Thank you.

725
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:33,342
- And how much for the feet?
- It's on the house.

726
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,050
So generous, thanks.

727
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:39,134
- You have a thief's hands.
- Why?

728
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,550
Long fingers.

729
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:46,050
Do you like working here?

730
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:48,717
I have to earn money.

731
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:54,342
How much will the divorce cost?

732
00:59:57,092 --> 01:00:00,509
100 haircuts and 300 manicures.

733
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,050
Deal.

734
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:05,425
Hey.

735
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,467
Tell your friend that we have
something special for locals.

736
01:00:10,384 --> 01:00:11,800
What's that?

737
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,634
It's a group thing.

738
01:00:14,342 --> 01:00:16,425
Delicious but very dirty.

739
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:55,092
- I won't leave my family.
- It's okay.

740
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:58,884
Do you want me to leave them?

741
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,050
Absolutely not!

742
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,342
- Beg me.
- What?

743
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:04,842
- To leave my family.
- No.

744
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:10,759
- I'm not like that.
- And what are you like?

745
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:14,759
When I got married, I thought.

746
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:17,717
"With this woman...
I'll start a civilization".

747
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,568
- And it didn't work out?
- No.

748
01:04:19,592 --> 01:04:22,259
My wife is a mountain.
She doesn't move, she creaks.

749
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,842
She fell in love with me.

750
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,800
She says I'm like a Teddy bear.

751
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:28,009
- Is that good?
- No, I don't think so.

752
01:04:28,592 --> 01:04:30,592
My wife sleeps naked, and so do I.

753
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:33,175
But she sleeps on top of me.
It suffocates me.

754
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:35,842
And I wake up gasping, so I thought:

755
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:39,634
"With her strength and my courage,
we can create a town."

756
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,300
A culture.

757
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:45,717
- You're not ashamed to say that?
- But it's true.

758
01:04:45,884 --> 01:04:49,175
I don't mind falling apart
or disappearing.

759
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,300
That's why I'm not afraid of you.

760
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:55,509
Why would you be afraid of me?
I like you.

761
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:57,925
I'm going to take care of you.

762
01:04:58,092 --> 01:05:01,175
I'm going to take my clothes off
and sleep under you.

763
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:51,384
I bet all the people in the hills
think we're all sluts, dancing like this.

764
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:53,217
They love it.

765
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:57,360
I don't know.
I think we have to go to the street more.

766
01:06:57,384 --> 01:07:00,217
They think we do this for them,
but we do it for us.

767
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:06,342
Are you going to come
to all the rehearsals?

768
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,009
I'm reading.

769
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:13,901
See how many people
came to see you?

770
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,592
Maybe it's people with bad taste.

771
01:07:15,717 --> 01:07:17,759
They don't like this music.

772
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:20,217
It disgusts them, imagine that.

773
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:23,967
You should learn it.
People who dance well, fuck well.

774
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,842
I can dance well.

775
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,717
Are you gonna fuck?

776
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:32,675
- Is he your husband or not?
- It doesn't matter.

777
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,425
The problem is that he isn't so good.

778
01:07:41,884 --> 01:07:44,092
I'm happy, Ema.
I'm delighted.

779
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,592
- But a little worried honestly.
- What?

780
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:47,884
Worried.

781
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:50,943
Why are you dancing to this shitty music?

782
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:53,818
- Must I explain?
- Don't explain, it's embarrassing!

783
01:07:53,842 --> 01:07:56,884
- What music?
- This crap you're doing.

784
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:00,509
What?

785
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:02,217
What do you expect?

786
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:05,217
What do you mean?

787
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,509
It's prison music.

788
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,634
It's music to listen to in prison.

789
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:13,342
The whole damn day.

790
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:15,259
To keep you from thinking.

791
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,967
To forget about the prison you're in
and recreate it in your mind.

792
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:21,401
To forget about the bars
you have in front of you.

793
01:08:21,425 --> 01:08:22,425
That's it.

794
01:08:23,384 --> 01:08:25,401
It's a hypnotic rhythm that
turns you into a fool.

795
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:27,509
It's an illusion of freedom.

796
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:31,425
So that people don't think.
Yes, no, sex, drugs, yes.

797
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,759
Heroine yes, orgies yes.

798
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:36,259
But the next day, boom!
You have to go to work.

799
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,509
And you were convinced by someone.

800
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,717
That if you moved your little hips,
you'd be freer.

801
01:08:42,217 --> 01:08:43,651
But no. Not at all.

802
01:08:43,675 --> 01:08:45,634
It's falling asleep in defeat.

803
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:46,842
Living in Ibiza.

804
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,134
Picking up and moving to LA,

805
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:51,568
To take selfies there all the time.

806
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:54,675
And to do exactly the same thing.
It's a culture of violence.

807
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:57,884
Where women
become purely sexual objects.

808
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:01,443
And men are beasts who
always screws women over.

809
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:04,550
All while trying to fuck them.

810
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,884
That's just what they want.
That's the rhythm.

811
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:11,759
"Don't rebel, don't think.
Give it to me, give it to me."

812
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:16,342
I can't believe you're dancing
reggaeton, for Christ's sake!

813
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:20,259
Everything we studied and felt.
Everything we've practiced.

814
01:09:20,384 --> 01:09:21,568
And with you!

815
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:25,259
All those damn fights we had.
All the struggles.

816
01:09:25,342 --> 01:09:28,509
How we laughed at all of them!
You laughed at all these girls.

817
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:33,384
The very same ones.
Laughing your ass off, huh.

818
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:35,800
Screw them! Screw reggaeton.

819
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:38,009
Fuck everything!

820
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,217
I'm sick of this.

821
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:44,967
Polo liked reggaeton.

822
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:48,300
Who is Polo?

823
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:52,842
You saw us dancing and you said...

824
01:09:53,134 --> 01:09:54,134
“Nice.”

825
01:09:55,967 --> 01:09:57,050
What's nice?

826
01:09:58,259 --> 01:09:59,634
I don't know what that means.

827
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:02,967
I guess you do.
Because you're smarter than us, right?

828
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:05,610
The only thing I know is...

829
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:07,717
I don't like what I feel
when I see something nice.

830
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,884
Now I like dancing much more.
Because it's like fucking, happy.

831
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:13,925
With a flushed face, cussing.

832
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:15,509
Hot, crazy, sexy, moving.

833
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,050
And all of the sudden, bam!
I'm surrounded by people.

834
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:20,634
And they're all as horny as me.

835
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,800
Moving as if they were fucking.
But with music.

836
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,384
It's delicious, motherfucker.

837
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:28,550
That's life.
And I dance life.

838
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:30,550
Today, you're alive and you're here,

839
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:34,092
Because someone at some
point got hot and had an orgasm.

840
01:10:34,675 --> 01:10:37,092
And today, that orgasm can be danced.

841
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:43,092
- How was I?
- Good.

842
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,526
- Did you like it?
- Yes, very much.

843
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,842
Was it good?

844
01:11:15,092 --> 01:11:17,842
<i>♪ Between your body and mine ♪</i>

845
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:23,134

855
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,884
- This is dance?
- Yes.

856
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:56,592
Here it says you resigned in October,
that's half a semester.

857
01:13:57,509 --> 01:14:00,050
I had a family tragedy, but I'm fine now.

858
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,342
Oh, that's good.

859
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:05,175
I can do anything.
Administrative work, whatever.

860
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:09,342
We had a teacher who taught folk dancing.

861
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,776
- How about that?
- Yes, I can do that, too.

862
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,884
I don't like that kind of dance.
I find it very old-fashioned.

863
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,235
The children look dressed up.

864
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,967
In those wool hats
doing that dance, called...

865
01:14:20,259 --> 01:14:22,550
- Like the trot of Tarapacá.
- Tarapaqueño.

866
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:23,842
Tarapaqueño, yes.

867
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:26,800
I don't like those things.
I find them very old-fashioned.

868
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:29,259
It's not what I like to teach, so it's ok.

869
01:14:29,717 --> 01:14:31,925
- What do you like to teach?
- Freedom.

870
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,009
I teach children to move freely.

871
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:39,550
That's good.

872
01:14:39,925 --> 01:14:44,134
Because they learn to be
expressive with their bodies.

873
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:47,842
With their small arms,
or with an expressive spine.

874
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:51,175
Because they're always sitting,
looking at their phones.

875
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:54,360
They always express
themselves with their bodies.

876
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:56,134
When they fight, dance, play.

877
01:14:56,467 --> 01:15:01,425
Great! Because they learn
to rebel against control.

878
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,300
To rebel against authority.

879
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:07,384
- I'm sorry, that's not my goal.
- No, no, relax.

880
01:15:07,759 --> 01:15:11,925
I'm not a dictator. Not at all.

881
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,342
It's just that...

882
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,300
I hate all that discipline.
I can't stand it.

883
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:19,342
You shouldn't tell anyone that,
because here I am...

884
01:15:19,634 --> 01:15:21,509
- Principal.
- Yes, the principal.

885
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,467
I have to rule with an iron fist,
you know?

886
01:15:24,675 --> 01:15:26,509
Sometimes people aren't what they seem.

887
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,717
Totally. I'm bipolar.

888
01:15:29,009 --> 01:15:31,259
I love what you're telling me.

889
01:15:32,009 --> 01:15:34,026
Sorry, I know this is
another kind of meeting.

890
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:36,259
But that's what I think,
I'm just saying.

891
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,759
But I love it.

892
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:41,842
- Do they practice every day?
- Every day.

893
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:46,009
- You have strong abs?
- Right now, yes, very.

894
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:47,800
Very strong.

895
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:49,467
I've always liked to dance.

896
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:53,550
It's a way of rebelling against my mother.
She's crazy and conservative.

897
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:57,175
All my life she told me I was ugly.
"Little girl, you are so ugly."

898
01:15:57,342 --> 01:15:59,759
"You're ugly."

899
01:16:00,384 --> 01:16:01,884
Do you think I'm ugly?

900
01:16:04,717 --> 01:16:05,717
No.

901
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,884
She forced me to take ballet classes.
Then I left.

902
01:16:10,884 --> 01:16:13,776
And I started dancing again because
I fell in love with a choreographer.

903
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,384
Head over heels in love.

904
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:18,800
In the end, everything was worth it.
For the children.

905
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:20,509
I understand you...

906
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:24,175
because for a long time.
I was a very famous musician's girlfriend.

907
01:16:24,425 --> 01:16:26,300
But I can't tell you his name.

908
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:30,175
Artists are so intense, huh?

909
01:16:30,884 --> 01:16:32,592
How do you do it?

910
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:35,342
They're mad, they're crazy people.

911
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,193
You have to compliment them.

912
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:40,092
And tell them that they're the best
thing in the universe.

913
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,925
That's where I went wrong.

914
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,175
It's just that I didn't have your...

915
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:51,509
- Your wisdom.
- I don't know anything.

916
01:16:52,634 --> 01:16:53,717
Yes, you do.

917
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,592
You know much more than all these people.

918
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:01,925
You'll have to take a test.

919
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,134
Although you're an excellent teacher.

920
01:17:06,675 --> 01:17:08,634
I don't draw very well, sorry.

921
01:17:09,509 --> 01:17:10,925
What's this?

922
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,901
A house.

923
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:14,634
- And that?
- Flowers.

924
01:17:14,925 --> 01:17:16,592
And who waters the flowers?

925
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,092
- They have water.
- Oh, ok.

926
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:25,217
- Was I supposed to draw people?
- No.

927
01:17:25,384 --> 01:17:29,425
- You said a house, and I drew one.
- Yeah, sure.

928
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,151
- Sometimes houses have people inside.
- It does, but they're not home.

929
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:35,592
- Where are they?
- At a party.

930
01:17:38,592 --> 01:17:41,009
- Is this part of the evaluation?
- What?

931
01:17:41,134 --> 01:17:43,634
Having to explain everything.

932
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:46,800
You don't want that
to be in the evaluation?

933
01:17:47,759 --> 01:17:50,384
I don't want to interfere with your work,
I'm sorry.

934
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:53,985
- Are you interfering with my work?
- I don't know.

935
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:55,134
No.

936
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:56,467
Sorry.

937
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,467
Why isn't there any food here?

938
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:05,550
I don't know.

939
01:18:08,967 --> 01:18:11,342
- Don't you want to answer?
- I want to.

940
01:18:12,967 --> 01:18:16,550
- I don't want you to think it's a sad house.
- Why?

941
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,693
Because I don't want you to think...

942
01:18:18,717 --> 01:18:21,759
That I'm antisocial or depressed
or something like that.

943
01:18:22,592 --> 01:18:26,134
There's a list of everything that
should appear in this drawing.

944
01:18:27,134 --> 01:18:31,134
I compare that list with your drawing
and that's how I get a score.

945
01:18:32,592 --> 01:18:34,384
Have I done well?

946
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:36,259
I have to look at the list.

947
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,717
Isn't there a test that measures honesty?

948
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,217
Yes, but I'm not familiar with it.

949
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:47,050
How absurd.

950
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:50,384
It's my life.

951
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,592
Sorry.

952
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:55,259
Don't worry.

953
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,967
I like it, actually.

954
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,509
- How did it go?
- Well.

955
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,009
They hired me.

956
01:19:12,884 --> 01:19:14,134
You're close.

957
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,675
- Hey, let me go.
- Ema.

958
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,360
Ema! God dammit. Ema!

959
01:21:05,384 --> 01:21:07,384
- Hey, let me go!
- Ema!

960
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,509
Ema, let me go.

961
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,217
You're breaking up with me?

962
01:23:31,217 --> 01:23:36,592
No, I'm not.
Because we don't have a relationship.

963
01:23:36,759 --> 01:23:39,467
We don't? Yes, we do.

964
01:23:41,175 --> 01:23:42,443
And you're going to miss me.

965
01:23:42,467 --> 01:23:44,217
- I don't want to.
- But, you will.

966
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:48,134
I don't want to because
I'm crazy jealous.

967
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:52,550
Well, if you want me to see you.

968
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:54,925
Call me and I can be here at any time.

969
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:56,675
- Really?
- Yeah.

970
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,675
And what would you do?

971
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:03,675
Well, I'd arrive and greet you.

972
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:07,384
I'd talk to you and feed you.
I'd do whatever you want.

973
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:09,925
- Really?
- Yeah.

974
01:24:12,509 --> 01:24:15,592
What if I just wanted a kiss?
Would you come?

975
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:16,967
Of course.

976
01:24:19,259 --> 01:24:21,175
And what would that kiss be like?

977
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,467
Like this.

978
01:24:27,634 --> 01:24:30,009
- Oh, Ema.
- What?

979
01:24:30,967 --> 01:24:34,134
- Marry me, Ema.
- In white.

980
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,675
In white.

981
01:24:35,842 --> 01:24:38,901
- But we'd have to be in love.
- It's true.

982
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:42,050
And that's a problem
because I'm not in love with you.

983
01:24:42,092 --> 01:24:43,717
I'm not in love with you either.

984
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:48,050
- Damn. You're not in love with me?
- Not yet.

985
01:24:49,175 --> 01:24:52,592
- Please. Don't do this to me.
- What?

986
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:58,050
- Tell me the truth.
- I don't know if I'm in love with you.

987
01:25:00,925 --> 01:25:03,550
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Well...

988
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,193
You can go back to your family
and I can disappear.

989
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:08,050
Is that what you want or not?

990
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:12,717
- I don't know. I can't do this.
- It's not so terrible.

991
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,425
We could be happy together.

992
01:27:53,092 --> 01:27:55,384
Come in. How are you?

993
01:27:55,592 --> 01:27:56,592
Hi.

994
01:27:57,009 --> 01:27:58,675
- Hi Ema, welcome.
- Thank you.

995
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,175
Good morning.

996
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:25,300
Good morning, kids.

997
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:29,425
Good morning, teacher.

998
01:28:29,592 --> 01:28:31,842
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

999
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,217
My name is Ema.

1000
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:38,384
I'm your new body expression teacher.

1001
01:29:04,675 --> 01:29:08,550
Let's form a circle in
the middle of the room

1002
01:29:19,925 --> 01:29:22,967
Polo, sweetie come.

1003
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:39,592
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

1004
01:32:52,092 --> 01:32:54,175
I hope you'll forgive me someday.

1005
01:32:54,717 --> 01:32:56,009
When you grow up.

1006
01:32:56,217 --> 01:32:57,467
I was a bad person.

1007
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,259
I'm sorry.
I did bad things, too.

1008
01:33:00,509 --> 01:33:02,092
No. You behaved well.

1009
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:05,009
Really, very good.

1010
01:33:06,592 --> 01:33:08,300
I wanted to be your mom.

1011
01:33:09,759 --> 01:33:12,384
Since they didn't let me,
I tried to be your teacher.

1012
01:33:20,009 --> 01:33:21,717
You're gonna have a baby brother.

1013
01:33:28,342 --> 01:33:29,550
Really?

1014
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:35,675
Yes.

1015
01:34:17,134 --> 01:34:20,217
I already told your mom that
we took you out of school.

1016
01:34:20,342 --> 01:34:21,675
That's good.

1017
01:34:26,425 --> 01:34:27,675
She's my mom.

1018
01:34:31,134 --> 01:34:32,467
- How are you?
- Fine.

1019
01:34:32,759 --> 01:34:33,759
Fine?

1020
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,675
- Do you like it?
- You look beautiful.

1021
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,759
Who cut it?

1022
01:34:43,259 --> 01:34:44,467
She did.

1023
01:34:44,884 --> 01:34:46,675
She's my mom and he's my dad.

1024
01:34:54,009 --> 01:34:55,009
Say hi.

1025
01:34:55,175 --> 01:34:56,425
- Sorry.
- Hi.

1026
01:34:56,967 --> 01:34:59,592
- Nice to meet you, Gastón.
- Anibal, it's a pleasure.

1027
01:35:00,175 --> 01:35:02,300
- Hello
- Nice to meet you.

1028
01:35:02,634 --> 01:35:03,634
Hey.

1029
01:35:08,134 --> 01:35:11,550
She's pregnant and the baby
will be my brother.

1030
01:35:11,967 --> 01:35:15,009
Oh, yeah? That's great.

1031
01:35:30,217 --> 01:35:31,842
How many months?

1032
01:35:32,842 --> 01:35:34,259
16 weeks.

1033
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:20,175
He's a child!

1034
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:48,384
Have it...

1035
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,134
Have your baby.

1036
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:57,092
Polo is fine now.
Leave us alone please.

1037
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,009
This child can be both of ours.

1038
01:37:18,134 --> 01:37:21,050
I'm sure it will be a girl,
just as pretty as you.

1039
01:37:23,967 --> 01:37:25,217
I can't.

1040
01:37:29,717 --> 01:37:32,217
And I'd like to see you.

1041
01:37:35,342 --> 01:37:36,634
To touch you.

1042
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:39,360
You're so perfect. I'd like to see...

1043
01:37:39,384 --> 01:37:42,467
How you get fat and get stretch marks.

1044
01:37:43,925 --> 01:37:45,967
How your breasts grow.

1045
01:37:47,342 --> 01:37:48,884
And feel...

1046
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,175
I've always had the fantasy...

1047
01:37:55,509 --> 01:37:57,759
Of asking a pregnant woman...

1048
01:37:59,509 --> 01:38:04,259
To get naked and lie on top of me
so I could feel the heartbeats.

1049
01:38:05,009 --> 01:38:07,634
Both heartbeats, as if they were mine.

1050
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:11,384
It could be like that with you.

1051
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:16,425
But with you it's something else
because there's something sexual as well.

1052
01:38:17,217 --> 01:38:18,675
Well.

1053
01:38:20,175 --> 01:38:21,634
That's not going to happen.

1054
01:39:05,592 --> 01:39:09,925
The only thing I wanted was to tell Polo
that all of this was a mistake.

1055
01:39:10,092 --> 01:39:12,842
A huge mistake.

1056
01:39:13,509 --> 01:39:16,259
That I didn't want to abandon him.

1057
01:39:16,509 --> 01:39:19,717
How could I tell him if I didn't
know where he lived, so...

1058
01:39:19,925 --> 01:39:23,175
I paid a psychologist
from Child Protective Services.

1059
01:39:23,467 --> 01:39:26,009
She told me
where Polo's new parents lived.

1060
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:28,592
I thought about how
to have him close again.

1061
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,967
So, I decided to have a baby with Anibal.

1062
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:35,759
The baby would always be part of
Polo's life and they'd grow up together.

1063
01:39:37,009 --> 01:39:39,800
So I could always be close to Polo.

1064
01:39:39,967 --> 01:39:41,967
Then, I met Raquel.

1065
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,175
And she was sad.

1066
01:39:44,342 --> 01:39:47,342
A kind of sadness that I knew very well.

1067
01:39:47,467 --> 01:39:50,425
Like when a child tells you
that you aren't their mother.

1068
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:53,384
And your marriage begins to fall apart.

1069
01:46:43,034 --> 01:46:46,826
I actually think that
it's very hard to describe Ema.

1070
01:46:47,038 --> 01:46:50,071
We are in front of a
character of characters,

1071
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:52,117
and as Pablo Larraín says

1072
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:56,418
she's such a complex woman,
very enigmatic,

1073
01:46:56,481 --> 01:46:58,568
hypnotic, sensual,

1074
01:46:58,631 --> 01:47:00,678
she knows what she wants and

1075
01:47:00,741 --> 01:47:02,323
will not stop until she gets it.

1076
01:47:02,386 --> 01:47:05,522
She fills the spaces like nobody else does.

1077
01:47:06,593 --> 01:47:08,646
Ema is liberation,

1078
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:10,286
Ema is danger,

1079
01:47:10,349 --> 01:47:12,546
Ema is like the Sun,

1080
01:47:12,609 --> 01:47:16,239
is like the fire
of her flame-thrower.

1081
01:47:16,635 --> 01:47:18,208
You really want to be close to her,

1082
01:47:18,322 --> 01:47:19,651
but you have to be careful

1083
01:47:19,714 --> 01:47:21,650
because you can get burnt!

1084
01:47:22,094 --> 01:47:24,454
And of course you may,

1085
01:47:24,517 --> 01:47:27,210
or may not agree with what she does,

1086
01:47:27,273 --> 01:47:29,621
you can understand it,
or no.

1087
01:47:30,011 --> 01:47:31,311
But somehow

1088
01:47:31,374 --> 01:47:33,777
or another,
she's going to get to you

1089
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,287
and she's going to conquer you.

1090
01:47:42,771 --> 01:47:47,361
When Pablo finally called me to
say he was going to make this film,

1091
01:47:47,424 --> 01:47:50,139
and that he wanted me
to be the lead actress,

1092
01:47:50,202 --> 01:47:53,172
we immediately started
with the dance training,

1093
01:47:53,235 --> 01:47:55,422
with Jose Luís Vidal's company

1094
01:47:55,485 --> 01:47:57,986
and with another choreographer,
Mona Valenzuela.

1095
01:47:58,236 --> 01:48:02,235
And personally I had some

1096
01:48:02,318 --> 01:48:05,753
ballet and pilates lessons,
to try and improve my posture

1097
01:48:05,816 --> 01:48:08,205
and to try and look like
a professional dancer.

1098
01:48:08,268 --> 01:48:11,657
We worked for two months,
a little bit more,

1099
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,641
and in parallel we had

1100
01:48:14,704 --> 01:48:16,960
look meetings, costume meetings,

1101
01:48:17,023 --> 01:48:20,304
some camera tests,
some lighting tests.

1102
01:48:20,576 --> 01:48:23,976
I actually never read a
script, we didn't make...

1103
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:26,024
We didn't do table work.

1104
01:48:26,087 --> 01:48:28,030
No rehearsals.

1105
01:48:28,093 --> 01:48:30,672
So it was a very

1106
01:48:31,453 --> 01:48:34,093
'here and now' job,

1107
01:48:34,456 --> 01:48:38,216
that requires a lot of concentration,
and very good communication

1108
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:41,220
with Pablo, with Gael,
with the rest of the team.

1109
01:48:41,821 --> 01:48:44,714
It was very challenging.

1110
01:48:45,628 --> 01:48:48,442
And yes, regarding to the,

1111
01:48:48,572 --> 01:48:51,192
to the dance part,
to the reggaeton part.

1112
01:48:51,268 --> 01:48:55,304
Every day we started or ended up
dancing, sometimes both.

1113
01:48:56,803 --> 01:49:01,983
I remember dancing on
the streets of Valparaíso

1114
01:49:02,046 --> 01:49:08,186
while the producer was holding a wireless
speaker, and another member of the team

1115
01:49:08,249 --> 01:49:10,489
asked the passengers

1116
01:49:10,552 --> 01:49:14,210
by not to look at the
camera, and...

1117
01:49:14,998 --> 01:49:21,521
Diego 'Dieguito' from the Steadicam
trying to not to trip, while...

1118
01:49:22,029 --> 01:49:25,223
While he was trying to
follow my dance steps!

1119
01:49:25,301 --> 01:49:27,321
It was a very challenging,

1120
01:49:27,384 --> 01:49:30,265
challenging work.
Very beautiful team work, and

1121
01:49:30,926 --> 01:49:35,093
we were all infected with
dance, with movement.

1122
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,516
With sensuality.

1123
01:49:44,849 --> 01:49:46,555
I think that this film

1124
01:49:46,618 --> 01:49:50,209
that Ema is a portrait
of a generation.

1125
01:49:50,557 --> 01:49:53,043
A generation that is different from Pablo's

1126
01:49:53,106 --> 01:49:55,656
from Gael's, from mine.

1127
01:49:55,719 --> 01:49:58,380
This "Ema generation".

1128
01:49:58,443 --> 01:50:01,751
Young people who
have lost their fear,

1129
01:50:01,814 --> 01:50:04,674
who are setting
new precedents...

1130
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:10,592
That know the power
of the collective,

1131
01:50:10,655 --> 01:50:14,850
of the tribe, of walking as one voice.

1132
01:50:15,187 --> 01:50:16,841
Friends who are lovers,

1133
01:50:16,904 --> 01:50:18,947
lovers who are friends.

1134
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,399
New ways of love,

1135
01:50:20,462 --> 01:50:24,865
they are building their families,
their diverse families.

1136
01:50:26,362 --> 01:50:28,184
They dance reggaeton
on the streets,

1137
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,136
they dance reggaeton at parties,

1138
01:50:30,199 --> 01:50:33,030
and they can go to a feminist
demonstration the next day

1139
01:50:33,093 --> 01:50:35,433
the next morning and
it's all ok with that.

1140
01:50:35,605 --> 01:50:37,432
Free young people,

1141
01:50:37,495 --> 01:50:41,375
brave young people,
agents of change

1142
01:50:41,438 --> 01:50:47,196
from whom, at least
I have a lot to learn.
