2
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,232
Through the snow and
sleet and hail...

3
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:33,514
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

4
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:36,634
through the wind and
through the rain...

5
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:39,515
over mountain, over plain...

6
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:42,793
through the blinding
lightning flash...

7
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:46,232
and the mighty thunder crash...

8
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:50,309
ever faithful, ever true...

9
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,625
nothing stops him.

10
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:54,706
He'll get through.

11
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:03,305
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
that persevering chap.</i>

12
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:06,784
<i>He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap.</i>

13
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:10,070
<i>You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which.</i>

14
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:13,543
<i>Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker.</i>

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,023
<i>So look out for Mr Stork and
let me tell you, friend.</i>

16
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:21,025
<i>Don't try to get away He'll
find you in the end.</i>

17
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:24,149
<i>He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork.</i>

18
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,462
<i>So you'd better look
out for Mr Stork.</i>

19
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:17,421
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list.</i>

20
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:21,020
<i>And when he comes around
it's useless to resist.</i>

21
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:24,541
<i>Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe.</i>

22
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,901
<i>Maybe he's got his eye on you.</i>

23
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,408

00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,349
But it's certainly no
excuse for what she did.

172
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,312
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

173
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:07,702
It's true, my dear, and she
has such a streak in...

174
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,704
A guy can't eat in peace.

175
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,670
Yes, but mother love does...

176
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,869
Gab, gab, gab. Always gossiping.

177
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:17,229
Girls, girls! Listen!

178
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:19,621
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

179
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:22,465
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

180
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:26,989
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

181
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:28,982
- No!
- You don't mean it!

182
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,460
Oh, how awful for her!

183
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:34,224
Well, I-I must say, I-I don't
blame her for anything.

184
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,939
You're absolutely right. It's
all the fault of that little...

185
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,942
F-R-E-A-K.

186
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,308
Yes, him with those ears that
only a mother could love.

187
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,420
What's the matter with his ears?

188
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,467
I don't see nothing wrong with
'em. I think they're cute.

189
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,978
Ladies, ladies! It's no
laughing matter at all.

190
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,218
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

191
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:02,665
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

192
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:05,022
His disgrace is our own shame.

193
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,984
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

194
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:11,582
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at
the same bale of hay with him.

195
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,940
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

196
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:15,620
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

197
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:18,015
Here he comes now.

198
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:21,654
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

199
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,179
Shh.

200
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:30,773
How do ya like that? Giving
him the cold shoulder.

201
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:34,982
Poor little guy.

202
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:39,216
There he goes, without
a friend in the world.

203
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,934
Nobody to turn to.

204
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,933
Oh, I'll do something
about this.

205
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:54,653
A mouse!

206
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,532
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

207
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,181
Well, why don't you pick on me?

208
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,650
A proud race.

209
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,889
Overstuffed hay bags!

210
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,047
Boo!

211
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,652
Still afraid of a mouse.

212
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:33,809
Ho-ho, boy. Wait'll I
tell the little guy.

213
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:36,536
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

214
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,177
You can come out now.

215
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:42,532
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

216
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,732
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

217
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:46,693
Come on out, won't ya?

218
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:51,612
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

219
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,450
Ya are? Must've
overdid it in there.

220
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:58,129
Don't know my own
strength sometimes.

221
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,968
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

222
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,811
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Ya gotta
come out first.

223
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,887
Too bad ya don't trust
me, 'cause I thought...

224
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:22,601
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

225
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,490
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

226
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,845
Well, that's more like it.

227
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,398
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

228
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,765
She's just broken-hearted.

229
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,525
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

230
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,760
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped
in it that time.

231
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:50,603
Aw, gee, Dumbo. I think
your ears are beautiful.

232
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:54,476
Sure. As a matter of fact, I
think they're very decorative.

233
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:58,322
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

234
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:01,525
Ho-ho, boy. All we gotta
do is build an act.

235
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,565
Make ya a star. A headliner!

236
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,797
Dumbo the Great!

237
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:12,405
Uh-oh. The great what?

238
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:18,159
Ya know, Dumbo, we
gotta get an idea.

239
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:21,999
Not just any idea. Something
colossal, like, uh...

240
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,680
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

241
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,915
Huh. He never had an
idea in his life.

242
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:32,122
Just visualize: One
elephant climbs up...

243
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,321
on top of another
elephant until finally...

244
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:37,553
all 17 elephants...

245
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,919
have constructed an
enormous pyramid...

246
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:42,994
of pachyderms.

247
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,472
I step out.

248
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,393
I blow the whistle.

249
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:49,837
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

250
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,674
- Yeah.
- And now...

251
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:53,992
comes the climax!

252
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,796
Yeah? What is the climax?

253
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:00,236
Hmm. I don't know.

254
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,551
I knew he never had nothing.

255
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,438
Well, maybe it comes to me...

256
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,035
in a vision while I dream.

257
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,429
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

258
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,350
Climax.

259
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:18,348
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

260
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,597
I'll be back in a minute. I'm
gonna take care of your future.

261
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:20,705
I am the voice of your
subconscious mind.

262
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:24,186
Your inspiration.

263
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,705
Now, concentrate.

264
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,269
Remember? Your pyramid
of elephants...

265
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:33,387
are standing in the ring
waiting for a climax.

266
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,179
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

267
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,147
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

268
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,302
Coming through okay? Good.

269
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,744
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

270
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,104
- Climax.
- Galloping across the arena.

271
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,498
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

272
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:50,988
to a platform.

273
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,185
At the very pinnacle of your
pyramid, he waves a flag...

274
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:55,906
for a glorious finish!

275
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:59,822
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

276
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:02,699
The little elephant
with the big ears!

277
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:07,985
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

278
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,898
What?

279
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:12,375
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

280
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,616
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

281
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:17,823
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

282
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:19,816
I got it! I got it!

283
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,983
Ladies and gentlemen...

284
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:27,341
we will now present for
your entertainment...

285
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:30,621
the most stupendous,
magnificent...

286
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,901
super-colossal spectacle.

287
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:36,214
On this tiny...

288
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:39,215
little, insignificant ball...

289
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,419
we will construct for you...

290
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:45,257
a pyramid, not of
wood, not of stone...

291
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:48,220
To hear him talk, you'd think
he was going to do it.

292
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,021
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

293
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,936
Pyramid of ponderous,
pulsating...

294
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:59,253
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

295
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,492
I give you the elephants.

296
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,729
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

297
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:39,610
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

298
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:42,927
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

299
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:45,928
Quiet up there. Tend
to your work, girls.

300
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:02,962
Take your foot out of
my eye, clumsy ox.

301
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:10,649
Steady, girls.

302
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:21,001
Boy, that was a close one.

303
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,448
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

304
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,329
Okay, okay. Don't wave
it no more. I saw ya.

305
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,971
Now, look. All ya gotta
do is run out, see?

306
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,962
Jump on the springboard.

307
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:35,726
All right, now show me just
how you're gonna do it.

308
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,768
That's it. Attaboy. That's
the stuff. Come on.

309
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,159
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

310
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,684
Oh, those ears. We gotta
do somethin', quick.

311
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,965
Ladies and gentlemen...

312
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,882
you have now seen
the impossible...

313
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,277
accomplished in front
of your faces.

314
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,882
Seven jungle giants...

315
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,799
each one weighing not...

316
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,401
That windbag!

317
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,240
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

318
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,477
And now, I present...

319
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,684
the world's smallest
little elephant...

320
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,554
who will spring from
this springboard...

321
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,637
in one spring...

322
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:18,560
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

323
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:21,796
for a grand climax!

324
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,240
Ladies and gentlemen...

325
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,476
I give you Dumbo!

326
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,078
Go on! Get goin'!

327
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:43,280
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

328
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,319
You're on, Dumbo.

329
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:45,956
Out of my way, assassin!

330
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,438
- Dear!
- Ohh.

331
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:53,567
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

332
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:58,084
Because of that Dumbo, I never
can show my face there again.

333
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,398
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

334
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:04,876
I'd just like to spank the
daylights out of him...

335
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:08,720
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

336
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:12,844
Oh, that won't be
necessary, dearie.

337
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:15,280
They fixed him good.

338
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,196
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

339
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:18,922
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

340
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:21,438
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

341
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:25,517
Oh. Well, they've

342
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,357
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

343
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:31,116
Made him a clown.

344
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:33,034
A clown?

345
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:35,842
- No!
- Yes.

346
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:39,437
Oh, the shame of it.

347
00:33:39,522 --> 00:33:41,911
Let us take the solemn vow.

348
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:47,517
From now on, he is no longer...

349
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,432
an elephant.

350
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,151
Please! Help me

351
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,835
Whoo! Save my child!

Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em. Ask

364
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,426
You said it. We rolled
'em in the aisles.

365
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:41,659
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.

366
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,306
Stupendous, I calls it.

367
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:45,185
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

368
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,259
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

369
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:49,816
This calls for a real
celebration. Come and get it.

370
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:52,945
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

371
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,858
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

372
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:58,144

00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,850
<i>Little one.</i>

00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:16,845
<i>When you play.</i>

<i>Never a tear.</i>

406
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,248
<i>Baby of mine.</i>

407
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:06,044
<i>From your head.</i>

00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:07,844
<i>To your toes.</i>

00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:37,591
<i>Baby mine.</i>

417
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,238
Here ya are. Pour it
in me slipper, Joey.

418
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,198
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

419
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,238
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

420
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,629
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

421
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,188
Yeah! If they laugh when
he jumps 20 feet...

422
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,998
they'll laugh twice as
hard if he jumps 40 feet.

423
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,957
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

424
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,475
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

425
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,435
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

426
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:18,157
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

427
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:20,115
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

428
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:22,951
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

429
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:25,710
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

430
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:27,150
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

431
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:28,989
Hey, hey! Let's hit
him for a raise.

432
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:31,227
Yeah, sure. This is
worth real dough.

433
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:34,786
<i>Oh, we're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise.</i>

434
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:38,312
<i>Yes, we're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise.</i>

435
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:42,104
<i>Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny.</i>

436
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:45,312
<i>We're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise</i>

437
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,109
I know how ya feel, Dumbo, but you
gotta pull yourself together.

438
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:58,028
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

439
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:00,752
Remember, you come
of a proud race.

440
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,388
Why you're a-a-a...
a pachyderm...

441
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,304
and pachyderms don't cry.

442
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:09,350
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

443
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,303
There. Ya see?

444
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:21,310
Well, ain't nothing a

00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,189
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have
ya fixed up in a jiffy.

446
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,061
Come on.

447
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,626
Here. Take a trunk full.

448
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,460
Listen, little fella.

449
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,188
We may have had a lot of
hard luck up till now...

450
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:43,386
but you and me is gonna
do big things together.

451
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:47,222
Hold your breath. Why, your
mother's gonna be so proud of ya.

452
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,821
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

453
00:41:48,908 --> 00:41:51,945
The whole circus is gonna be proud of
ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

454
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:53,938
Swallow it.

455
00:41:54,027 --> 00:41:56,416
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

456
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,897
Oh, I guess you had one
little one left over.

457
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:04,262
Dumbo, we'll bounce
back so ha...

458
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:07,144
Hey, what's the matter with you?

459
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,623
What kind of water
is this, anyhow?

460
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:09,377
Balloonies.

461
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,370
Hiya, George.

462
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,455
Whee!

All right. Let's see ya

465
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:58,725
Say, that's very, very clever.

00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:03,204
Now blow a great big one.

467
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,241
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

468
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,845
Dumbo.

469
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:35,318
You see what I see?

470
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:43,881
<i>Look out, look out Pink
elephants on parade.</i>

471
00:45:43,962 --> 00:45:46,271
<i>Here they come Hippity-hoppity.</i>

472
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:50,320
<i>They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere.</i>

473
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,517
<i>Look out, look out.</i>

474
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:55,354
<i>They're walking around
the bed on their head.</i>

475
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,238
<i>Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid.</i>

476
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,595
<i>Pink elephants on parade.</i>

477
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,591
<i>What'll I do - What'll I do.</i>

478
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,829
<i>What an unusual view.</i>

479
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:08,628
<i>I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs.</i>

480
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:13,031
<i>But Technicolour pachyderms
is really too much for me.</i>

481
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:14,949
<i>I am not the type to faint.</i>

482
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,949
<i>When things are odd
or things are quaint.</i>

483
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:19,029
<i>But seein'things you
know there ain't.</i>

484
00:46:19,118 --> 00:46:21,507
<i>Can certainly give
you an awful fright.</i>

485
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:24,475
<i>What a sight Chase 'em
away, chase 'em away.</i>

486
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:28,152
<i>I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade.</i>

487
00:46:28,237 --> 00:46:30,546
<i>Hey, hey, hey - Pink elephants.</i>

488
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:33,672
<i>Pink elephants.</i>

489
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:35,587
<i>Pink elephants.</i>

490
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,931
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

491
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,851
Why, this is most irregular.

492
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,408
Well, I just can't
believe my eyes.

493
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:08,174
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

494
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:10,489
Or do they?

495
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:13,929
Uh, wh-what's all the
ruckus? Come on.

496
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:17,977
Step aside, brother. Uh,
what's cooking 'round here?

497
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,049
What's the good news?
What's frying, boy?

498
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:23,891
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

499
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,287
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

500
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:35,412
Yeah. Find out what
they're doing up here.

501
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:37,532
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.

502
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:39,846
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

503
00:50:03,053 --> 00:50:06,966
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

504
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,805
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

505
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:17,207
What's so funny? What are you
boys doing down here, anyway?

506
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,327
What are we doing down here?

507
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:21,242
Well, hear him talk.

508
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:24,209
Go on. Fly up a tree
where you belong.

509
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,439
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

510
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,681
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

511
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,364
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

512
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:38,078
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

513
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,559
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no... Huh?

514
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:43,639
Tree?

515
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,159
Yo!

516
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:51,757
Dumbo.

517
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:54,315
Dumbo. Wake up.

518
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:57,160
Wake up, Dumbo!

519
00:50:57,247 --> 00:51:00,683
Don't look now, but I
think we're up in a tree.

520
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:31,283
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

521
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:34,355
Come on, Dumbo. Let's
get back to the circus.

522
00:51:34,443 --> 00:51:36,399
So long, boy!

523
00:51:43,922 --> 00:51:47,232
But I wonder how we ever got
up in that tree, anyway.

524
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:51,670
Now, let's see.

525
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:54,195
Elephants can't climb
trees, can they?

526
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,748
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

527
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,798
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

528
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,314
Hey there, son. Maybe
you all flew up.

529
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:07,148
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

530
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:10,197
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

531
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,747
Boy, am I stupid. Why didn't
I think of this before?

532
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,035
Your ears. Just look at 'em,
Dumbo. Why, they're perfect wings.

533
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:20,589
The very things that held ya down are
gonna carry ya up and up and up!

534
00:52:20,677 --> 00:52:22,827
I can see it all now.

535
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:25,385
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

536
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,593
The world's only
flying elephant!

537
00:52:30,556 --> 00:52:32,433
Did you ever see
an elephant fly?

538
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,952
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

539
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:38,106
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

540
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:41,791
See, I've seen all that too.

541
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:45,345
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

542
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:48,268
I seen a needle that
winked its eye.

543
00:52:48,354 --> 00:52:51,585
<i>But I be done seen
about ever'thing.</i>

544
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:53,790
<i>When I see a elephant fly.</i>

545
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:57,503
- What'd you say, boy?
- <i>I said when I see a elephant fly.</i>

546
00:52:57,593 --> 00:53:00,903
<i>I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring.</i>

547
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:03,666
<i>I seen a polka-dot
rail road tie.</i>

548
00:53:03,753 --> 00:53:07,302
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing.</i>

549
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,462
<i>When I see a elephant fly.</i>

550
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:12,350
<i>- Da da-da-da.
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow.</i>

551
00:53:12,432 --> 00:53:15,185
<i>Da da-da-da - Hey, wow.</i>

552
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:17,785
<i>I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck.</i>

553
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:21,022
<i>And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck.</i>

554
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,944
<i>I didn't see that I only heard.</i>

555
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,544
<i>Just to be sociable
I'll take your word.</i>

556
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:29,702
<i>- I heard a fireside chat.
- I saw a baseball bat.</i>

557
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,588
<i>And I just laughed till
I thought I'd die.</i>

558
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:36,184
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing.</i>

559
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:39,227
<i>When I see a elephant fly.</i>

560
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:42,585
<i>Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do.</i>

561
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:54,503
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing.</i>

562
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:58,739
<i>When I see a elephant fly.</i>

563
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:01,819
With the wind.

564
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:06,263
<i>When I see a elephant.</i>

565
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:08,780
<i>Fly.</i>

566
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:19,455
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

567
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:25,382
Quiet, gentlemen.

568
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:28,024
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

569
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:31,140
You ought a be ashamed
of yourselves.

570
00:54:31,223 --> 00:54:33,418
A bunch of big guys like you...

571
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,654
picking on a poor
little orphan like him.

572
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:40,815
Suppose you was torn away from your
mother when you was just a baby...

573
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,211
nobody to tuck you
in at nights...

574
00:54:43,302 --> 00:54:47,977
no warm, soft, caressing
trunk to snuzzle into.

575
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,291
How would you like to
be left out alone...

576
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:53,612
in a cold, cruel,
heartless world?

577
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,817
And why? I ask ya, why?

578
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,734
Just because he's got those big
ears, they call him a freak.

579
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,856
The laughing stock
of the circus.

580
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:05,407
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

581
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,774
they threw her into the clink.

582
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:11,488
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

583
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:14,376
Socially, he's washed up.

584
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:18,497
Ah, but what's the use of talking
to you cold-hearted birds?

585
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:20,648
Go ahead. Have your fun.

586
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:23,649
Laugh at him. Kick him,
now that he's down.

587
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,092
Go on!

588
00:55:26,177 --> 00:55:28,088
We don't care.

589
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,727
Come on, Dumbo.

590
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:44,165
Hey, brother, w-w-wait a minute.

591
00:55:44,255 --> 00:55:46,723
Uh, don't go away
feeling like that.

592
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:48,931
We done seen the light.

593
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:50,845
You boys is okay.

594
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,050
Please, you've done enough.

595
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:57,286
Well, but we's all fixing to help
you. Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

596
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:59,523
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

597
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:02,366
You wanna make the
elephant fly, don't ya?

598
00:56:02,453 --> 00:56:05,763
Well, you gotta use a lot
of'chology. You know, psychology.

599
00:56:05,852 --> 00:56:08,810
Now, here's what you
do. First, you, uh...

600
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:10,723
Uh, bu...

601
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:13,610
And then, right after
that, you, uh...

602
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:18,650
Use the magic feather. Catch on?

603
00:56:18,731 --> 00:56:21,199
The magic feather?

604
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,168
Yeah, I gotcha.

605
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,720
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

606
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:29,608
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

607
00:56:33,649 --> 00:56:37,039
Let's go. Let's go.

608
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:40,439
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

609
00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:43,646
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

610
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:45,559
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

611
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:47,764
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

612
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:50,043
Faster, faster. Get
up flying speed.

613
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:52,482
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

614
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,398
Take off.

615
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:03,277
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

616
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:05,721
I guess it's just another
one of their... Look!

617
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:08,400
Hot diggity! You're flying.

618
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:10,362
You're flying!

619
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:16,241
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

620
00:57:16,325 --> 00:57:18,555
That's better than a aeroplane.

621
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,999
Brother, now I've
seen everything.

622
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:26,275
<i>But I be done seen
about everything.</i>

623
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:30,595
<i>When I see a elephant fly.</i>

624
00:57:30,683 --> 00:57:32,639
With the wind.

625
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:36,557
<i>When I see a elephant.</i>

626
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:39,156
<i>Fly.</i>

627
00:57:39,242 --> 00:57:41,710
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

628
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:44,600
Wait'll we get to the big town.

629
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:48,037
Boy, them city folks is
sure in for a surprise.

630
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,833
Poor baby! Whoo!

631
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:06,353
- Come on! Jump! Come on!

632
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:08,270
- Hurry up!

633
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,112
- Come on! Jump!
- Come on!

634
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:14,868
Look at that house. Dumbo,

635
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,836
you're standing on the
threshold of success.

636
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:20,273
Don't look down. It'll
make you dizzy.

637
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:23,872
Boy, are they in for
a surprise. Ho-ho.

638
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:28,876
Got the magic feather? Good.

639
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:35,229
Okay. Contact!

640
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:37,147
Take off!

641
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:43,584
Uh-oh. The magic feather!

642
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:51,110
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

643
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:55,072
The magic feather was
just a gag. You can fly.

644
00:58:55,154 --> 00:58:58,032
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!

645
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,870
Please!

646
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:11,141
Whee! We did it! We did it!

647
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:13,951
Let's show 'em,
Dumbo. Power dive.

648
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,144
Now, loop the loop.

649
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:00,386
You're makin' history!

650
01:00:21,824 --> 01:00:24,213
<i>I've seen a peanut stand
heard a rubber band.</i>

651
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:26,534

652
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,217

655
01:00:35,582 --> 01:00:39,370
<i>Oh, my - When I see.</i>

<i>When I see.</i>

657
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:45,816
<i>When I see an elephant fly.</i>

658
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:50,576
- Mmm, look at him go!
- <i>When I see an elephant fly.</i>

659
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:52,538
- Happy landing, son.
- Yippee!

660
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:55,772
<i>When I see a elephant fly</i>

661
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,976
I wish I'd have got
his autograph.

662
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,732
Oh, man, I got his autograph.

663
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,095
Well, so long, glamour boy!
