1
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,998
Today,
a war is very different...

2
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,169
than the last European war was.

3
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:53,875
Now air power is the dominant
feature of military operations.

4
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,942
Air power can fly directly
into the vital centers...

5
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,614
of an opposing state
and neutralize them.

6
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:02,783
It can destroy the cities.
It can wreck the aqueducts.

7
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,293
It can knock out
the lines of communication.

8
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,295
It can destroy
the food supplies...

9
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,991
and make the people
helpless to resist.

10
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,256
For 3,500 years,
man has had the desire to fly.

11
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,622
And yet it was
only 40 years ago...

12
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,627
this ambition was realized-

13
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:41,129
an accomplishment that
was to change the destiny...

14
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,824
of the entire world.

15
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,865
Two brothers,
Orville and Wilbur Wright-

16
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:48,995
bicycle builders
from Dayton, Ohio-

17
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,097
on the morning
of December 17...

18
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,836
set up on the sands of
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina...

19
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,004
their first heavier-than-air
flying machine.

20
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,481
Powered by
a four-cylinder motor...

21
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:02,541
developing
almost twelve horsepower...

22
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:08,121
with two bicycle chain-driven
propellers...

23
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:11,354
turning at nearly
340 revolutions per minute.

24
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:13,623
The machine,
complete with pilot...

25
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:18,099
weighed almost 750 pounds.

26
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,101
In order
to launch the plane...

27
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,103
a monoraiI track was designed.

28
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:25,402
The biplane "A"runs on
the wooden raiI "B"...

29
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,966
and anchor wire "C"
holds the plane back...

30
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,240
to enable the motor
to develop sufficient power...

31
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,247
for the takeoff.

32
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:34,112
Everything is in readiness.

33
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,448
The small crowd of witnesses
looks on hopefully.

34
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:40,114
Orville Wright
is at the controls.

35
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:44,251
One, two, three...

36
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,487
Go!

37
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,454
The motor races.
It's a tense moment.

38
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,466
Wilbur steadies the wing.

39
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,639
The plane strains
at the anchor cable.

40
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:00,301
Orville's hand
grips the controI.

41
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,310
The wire is released!

42
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:10,182
For twelve seconds...

43
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,244
the Wright plane
plows through the air...

44
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:15,815
in unmistakable power-driven,
man-carrying flight.

45
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:20,852
Twelve seconds.
TotaI distance-120 feet.

46
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:24,332
Man has conquered the air.

47
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,732
The five witnesses
of this epoch-making flight...

48
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,704
were too startled,
too thrilled to cheer.

49
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,571
Success! Four flights
Thursday morning...

50
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:36,135
starting from leveI,
average speed 31 miles.

51
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:39,079
Inform press. Home Christmas.
Orville Wright.

52
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:40,877
Man's first flight.

53
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,645
Yet this epoch-making feat...

54
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:45,017
failed to impress
a disinterested public.

55
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,022
The only part
of this stirring message...

56
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:48,683
that seemed newsworthy was...

57
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:51,716
"The Wright Brothers
to be home for Christmas."

58
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:55,495
In spite of the public's
lack of enthusiasm...

59
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:56,896
the Wrights persisted.

60
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,259
Then one day, they made
a revolutionary flight.

61
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,999
For the first time,
they were able...

62
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,973
to turn the plane around
in midair...

63
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:08,101
and fly in
the opposite direction.

64
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:17,443
The daring Brazilian sportsman
Alberto Santos-Dumont...

65
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,147
made the first
officially recorded...

66
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:20,917
European airplane flight.

67
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,254
Soon, many other
intrepid airmen...

68
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,954
were flying
in triplanes, biplanes...

69
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,122
monoplanes and multiplanes.

70
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:31,621
Fantastic in appearance,
but they all flew.

71
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:37,897
Back in America...

72
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,809
Gee willikers!

73
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:48,112
It says here
the Army plans an Air Corps.

74
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,811
"The flying machine
must make...

75
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:52,616
"an endurance flight
of one hour...

76
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,953
"carry pilot
and one passenger...

77
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,925
"attain a speed
of 40 miles an hour...

78
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,452
'traveI ten miles
and land undamaged."

79
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,431
Well, doggone.

80
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:06,593
41 enthusiastic
airplane builders...

81
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,627
submitted bids
of somewhat varied amounts.

82
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,833
I'll build a plane
for a million dollars.

83
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,432
I'll build it
for a thousand.

84
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:15,670
Mine'll cost 10 million.
- $3,000.

85
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:18,805
- $1,230.
- $10,000.

86
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,112
My plane'll cost only $510.

87
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,675
And one shrewd bidder...

88
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:27,280
guaranteed to build a plane
for $45 a pound.

89
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,586
However, when
the government demanded...

90
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,684
a 10% forfeit be posted...

91
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,059
all but three of
these enthusiastic bidders...

92
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,563
hastily withdrew.

93
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,335
The contract was let
to the Wright Brothers...

94
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,496
for one military airplane.

95
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,308
Six months later,
at Fort Meyer...

96
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:50,334
delivery was made
to the United States Army.

97
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,680
This was the modest beginning
of our Air Force.

98
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,243
It was only 33 years ago...

99
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:01,415
that Louis Blériot took off
from the coast of France...

100
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:04,483
and, without instruments,
made the 21-mile flight...

101
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,357
across the English ChanneI.

102
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:11,163
Only a few realized
the significance...

103
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,827
of this great flight.

104
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,837
England was no longer isolated
from the rest of Europe...

105
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:18,362
by an impassable body
of water.

106
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:23,711
A ChanneI flight
that was to one day...

107
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,145
prove of even
greater significance...

108
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,842
was accomplished by
the Honorable C.S. Rolls.

109
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,316
In his own words...

110
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,784
Departing from England...

111
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,016
the flight across the ChanneI
was quite uneventfuI.

112
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:44,428
Reaching the other side
and being recognized.

113
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:54,401
Dropped greetings.
And without stopping...

114
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:57,640
returned home
safely without mishap.

115
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:01,014
In the meantime,
back in America...

116
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,916
aviation saw
another great advancement.

117
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,852
Eugene Ely
made the first takeoff...

118
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,220
from the deck
of the U.S.S. Birmingham.

119
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:14,763
Two months later,
Ely reversed this feat...

120
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:17,288
by landing on
the U.S.S. Pennsylvania.

121
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:20,768
This was the birth
of the aircraft carrier.

122
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:25,297
In 1911, the first experiments
with seaplanes began.

123
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,468
Canoe-like pontoons
were added to a land plane.

124
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:32,912
Straining for the takeoff,
the motor raced.

125
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:34,575
At 31 miles an hour...

126
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,846
the plane sped across
the surface of the lake...

127
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,814
and slid up on the bank.

128
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,318
It was not untiI Glenn Curtiss
added a more powerfuI motor...

129
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,353
that experiments with seaplanes
were a success.

130
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,423
That same year
also witnessed...

131
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,798
the first
transcontinentaI flight.

132
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,498
Racing against
a 30-day time limit...

133
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,506
for a $50,000 prize...

134
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,532
Calbraith P. Rodgers
took off from Long Island...

135
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:05,035
accompanied by a speciaI train
carrying spare parts.

136
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,984
The flight consisted
of 69 short hops...

137
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,618
and 15 crashes.

138
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:17,921
Over rivers and mountains...

139
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,288
against insurmountable odds...

140
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,265
bucking strong winds
and treacherous air currents...

141
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,295
losing precious moments...

142
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,931
with indomitable courage
and the will to win...

143
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,965
the daring flyer
crashed on and on.

144
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,974
Forty-nine days later
at Pasadena...

145
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,143
Rodgers arrived
with only one strut...

146
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:46,120
and part of the taiI intact
from the originaI plane.

147
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:51,954
Just barely missing
the prize by 19 days...

148
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:55,623
this modest hero confidently
predicted that someday...

149
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:59,498
somebody would fly
across the country in 30 days.

150
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,434
And so,
for the next few years...

151
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,870
the flying machine continued
to thrill the public...

152
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:07,740
but was regarded as a novelty
with no practicaI uses.

153
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,775
The airplane,
at the tender age of ten...

154
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,411
went off to war.

155
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,656
At first,
aircraft was considered...

156
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,625
to have very little
military value...

157
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,026
except for
observation purposes.

158
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:29,360
A spirit of
sportsmanship existed...

159
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,990
between the rivaI pilots.

160
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,728
As they would pass
each other...

161
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,861
on their daily flights
over the lines...

162
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,871
they would wave
a friendly greeting...

163
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,102
and sometimes take pictures
of one another...

164
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:43,043
which led to
an unusuaI development.

165
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,480
Sacré bleu!

166
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,313
This is outrage!

167
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:55,048
And so, the next day...

168
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,887
Oof!

169
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,899
The following day...

170
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,902
being a hothead
as well as a squarehead...

171
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,563
Fritz took a potshot at Pierre.

172
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,034
Oh!

173
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:20,042
Duels with pistols,
shotguns, and rifles...

174
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,607
led to the installation
of the machine gun...

175
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,415
successfuI
but for one small detaiI-

176
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:35,828
The propeller got in the way.

177
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,295
Then science developed
the synchronizing device...

178
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:43,270
to allow the bullets
to pass between...

179
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,671
the rapidly revolving blades
of the propeller.

180
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:50,600
The airplane became
a formidable weapon of war.

181
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,789
The merciless pressure
of warfare...

182
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,957
developed highly specialized
types of planes.

183
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,698
The dropping of grenades
and hand bombs...

184
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:21,402
led to a new and terrible
instrument of war-the bomber.

185
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:38,224
The terrific competition
of aeriaI combat...

186
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,286
compelled the rapid improvement
of aircraft.

187
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:38,178
More than 20,000 conflicts
were fought in the air.

188
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,245
The forced development
of aircraft...

189
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,347
in these four years of war...

190
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,882
would have taken 20 years
to accomplish in peacetime.

191
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:49,055
Yet the war ended before
the world fully realized...

192
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:52,123
the military potentiaI
of air power.

193
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,704
As a war-weary public
transferred its interest...

194
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,435
to peacetime activities...

195
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,377
the airplane again
had to struggle for existence.

196
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,312
The "Fly with Me"
gypsy flyer...

197
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,475
barnstormed
all over the country.

198
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,890
While people still regarded
the airplane...

199
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,623
as an exciting novelty...

200
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:24,097
farsighted airmen
were compelling the public...

201
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:27,124
to look upon aviation
with a new respect.

202
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,400
The U.S. Navy NC-4 flew
from Newfoundland to England...

203
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:31,928
via the Azores.

204
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,237
The first nonstop
transatlantic flight...

205
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:37,575
was made by Alcock and Brown
from Newfoundland to Ireland.

206
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,773
First solo flight
across the Atlantic-

207
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:42,612
Charles A. Lindbergh,
New York to Paris.

208
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,380
First round-the-world flight-

209
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:46,410
U.S. Army planes
circled the globe.

210
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,946
Flying time-15 days, 11 hours.

211
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:52,824
Post and Gatty-
4 days, 10 hours.

212
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:57,089
Howard Hughes-
2 days, 23 hours.

213
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,334
Altitude flights developed
superchargers and deicers.

214
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:06,738
Air races improved design
and advanced speed.

215
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:16,012
Power diving
at 620 miles per hour...

216
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:18,952
tested durability
and construction of planes.

217
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:26,092
The first air maiI service
in 1918...

218
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,857
grew in a short time
to major airlines...

219
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:31,661
with regularly scheduled
transcontinentaI...

220
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,329
and then transoceanic
passenger and freight service.

221
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,498
Aviation was progressing
at a tremendous pace.

222
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,572
Time was being compressed,
distance shrunk...

223
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:47,013
range lengthened,
and load capacity increased.

224
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:50,211
The airplane-
now flying all over the world-

225
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:52,277
was the only weapon of war...

226
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,118
to develop such great
usefulness in peacetime.

227
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:11,436
Jeepers!

228
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:15,239
President Roosevelt
wants 50,000 planes a year.

229
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:18,474
Backed by 25 years
of constant pioneering...

230
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,277
American aviation
met the challenge.

231
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:25,647
Remember,
the experiment of 1914...

232
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,552
had become
a devastating force.

233
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,116
From the mile-a-minute plane
of World War I...

234
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,922
we're starting today
with planes...

235
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,020
flying more than
six miles a minute.

236
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:38,298
During the last war...

237
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,393
firepower was increased
from one brick per minute...

238
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:43,495
to 2,400 bullets per minute.

239
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:50,140
Today we're starting
with 9,600 bullets per minute.

240
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,877
During World War I...

241
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:59,148
aeriaI grenades
and 25-pound hand bombs...

242
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:01,849
grew to two-ton bomb loads.

243
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,018
Today we're starting
with ten-ton bomb loads...

244
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,857
of the most
devastating explosives...

245
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:09,625
ever conceived by science.

246
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,599
Today the historic flight
of C.S. Rolls...

247
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,329
is repeated daily...

248
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,634
by Rolls-Royce-powered
pursuit and bomber planes.

249
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,139
Departing from England...

250
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:22,871
the flight across the ChanneI
was quite uneventfuI.

251
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,345
Reaching the other side
and being recognized.

252
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,211
Dropped greetings.

253
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,243
And without stopping...

254
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:37,122
returned home
safely without mishap.

255
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:38,785
In one single night...

256
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:40,988
the bomb load
dropped on Cologne...

257
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,328
was 20 times greater
than the totaI amount...

258
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:46,857
used in the last war
by the United States.

259
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,907
Today, only
a brief 40 years later...

260
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:59,311
The Wright Brothers'
first flight of 120 feet...

261
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:02,282
could be made
with 92 feet to spare...

262
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:05,252
on the wing of the B-19.

263
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,346
Yet this huge 82-ton
experimentaI bomber-

264
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,449
designed seven years ago-

265
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:13,655
is only a forerunner
of what can be done.

266
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,930
The amazing advancement
in military aviation...

267
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:20,332
is due to the vision
and persistence...

268
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:23,064
of pioneer airmen,
among whom...

269
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:27,234
Major Alexander P. de Seversky
is an outstanding figure.

270
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:30,176
He literally
grew up with aviation.

271
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,145
His father
was the first Russian...

272
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,876
to privately own and fly
an airplane.

273
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,352
At ten,
his military education began.

274
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:41,253
He graduated from the ImperiaI
Russian NavaI Academy...

275
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:46,625
as a lieutenant and saw
service with the fleet in 1914.

276
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,323
With a firm belief
in the future of aviation...

277
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:51,229
he became
a full-fledged pilot...

278
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,826
in both Army
and NavaI aviation...

279
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,304
and was assigned to flying duty
with the Baltic fleet.

280
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,829
While on
a night bombing mission...

281
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,865
he was shot down...

282
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:05,709
and suffered the loss of
his right leg-

283
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,840
an invalid at 22.

284
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:11,443
Ignoring his handicap and
determined to fight again...

285
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:14,182
he returned to the front as
Chief of Pursuit Aviation...

286
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:16,315
in the Baltic,
with the rank of commander.

287
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:19,656
He fought
57 aeriaI combats...

288
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:22,356
became the leading ace
of the navaI air forces...

289
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:24,024
and was awarded
the highest honors...

290
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:25,999
his country could bestow.

291
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:30,794
In 1918,
he came to America...

292
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,239
and later served
as aeronauticaI engineer...

293
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:36,334
and test pilot for
the United States government.

294
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:38,675
He became a friend,
advisor, and disciple...

295
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,704
of GeneraI Billy Mitchell.

296
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,613
Having become a citizen...

297
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,175
in 1928 he was
commissioned a major...

298
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,518
in the United States Air Corps.

299
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:50,217
He invented the first
fully automatic bombsight...

300
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,192
and many other instruments
and devices...

301
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:54,491
all contributing
to the greater efficiency...

302
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,360
of military aviation.

303
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,228
He designed, built, tested...

304
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,666
and himself
flew his new planes.

305
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:03,227
Among them,
an all-metaI amphibian plane-

306
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:06,536
in which he set a world speed
record that still stands-

307
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:09,873
the first low-wing all-metaI
basic training plane...

308
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:13,074
and the first all-metaI
single-seater fighter plane...

309
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,672
of cantilever construction...

310
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:16,877
adopted by
the United States Army.

311
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,510
In 1937...

312
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:21,716
to prove long range could be
built into pursuit planes...

313
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:25,715
he set a new nonstop record
from New York to Havana.

314
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,990
In an Army pursuit ship
of his own design...

315
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:31,055
he was the first officially to
cross the country east-west...

316
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,090
with a record
of 10 hours, 5 minutes.

317
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,602
His planes
won the Bendix race...

318
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:36,899
three successive years.

319
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:40,999
In 1940, he was presented
the Harmon Trophy...

320
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,373
by President Roosevelt...

321
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,208
for being the Outstanding
Airman of the Year.

322
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,714
With his background
as a combat pilot...

323
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,310
aeronauticaI designer,
engineer, manufacturer...

324
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,047
and military strategist...

325
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,022
Major Seversky's advanced
viewpoint and opinions...

326
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:59,083
are of vitaI importance
to every citizen.

327
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,154
Under the pressure of war...

328
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:06,724
the science of aviation
is making terrific strides.

329
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,168
As soon as the airplanes-
which are already...

330
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,603
on the drafting boards of
all the warring nations-

331
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:14,972
take to the air, there will
not be a single spot...

332
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,103
on the face of the earth
immune from overhead attack.

333
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,080
The enormous flying range...

334
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:23,641
and destructive power of
these planes will transform...

335
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:27,121
the entire surface of our planet
into a battlefield.

336
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:31,285
The distinction between soldiers
and civilians will be erased.

337
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:34,386
And I believe that
it is only a matter of time...

338
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,556
before we here in America...

339
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:39,795
will suffer our share
of civilian casualties.

340
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:43,099
And so warfare becomes
everybody's business.

341
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:46,038
All of us must understand
the strategy of war.

342
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:50,511
No longer should it be a mystery
open only to military minds.

343
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:54,311
The strategy of war is simply
a plan to defeat the enemy.

344
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,807
In wars of the past, there were
only two ways to do it.

345
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,945
One was to kill off his army...

346
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:02,889
in order to lay hands
on the source of his power.

347
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:05,392
The other
was to sink his navy...

348
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:09,328
and force a blockade
and starve him into submission.

349
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:13,027
Along comes the airplane,
and an entirely new method...

350
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,262
of defeating the enemy
becomes possible.

351
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,168
We can carry the war now...

352
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,196
over the heads
of his army and navy...

353
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,606
strike directly
at the source of his power-

354
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,076
his war industries-

355
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:25,477
and by destroying
these war industries...

356
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:29,882
automatically disarm and
paralyze his fighting forces.

357
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,385
This new kind of warfare-

358
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,547
a strategy
based on air power-

359
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,922
was clearly foreseen
more than 20 years ago...

360
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,951
by such great airmen
as General Douhet in Europe...

361
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,828
and our own General Mitchell
here in America.

362
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:48,131
Time and again they warned
that this new military force-

363
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,195
swifter and more deadly
than any in the past...

364
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:54,208
equally devastating
on land or at sea-

365
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:56,210
would revolutionize warfare...

366
00:27:56,244 --> 00:28:00,203
and make the old style
surface strategy impossible.

367
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:02,512
But their warnings
were dismissed...

368
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,518
as fantastic and visionary.

369
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,578
The military men of
the old school were unwilling...

370
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:11,058
to recognize this fundamental
change in war-making.

371
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:12,684
They stubbornly continued...

372
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:15,025
to pour the resources
of their nations...

373
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:18,260
into weapons that had already
outlived their usefulness.

374
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,857
As for the airplane...

375
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:23,200
they accepted it,
but just as another weapon.

376
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,467
Just another means
to bolster up...

377
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:28,100
their old methods
of surface warfare.

378
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,167
At the start of this war...

379
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:34,204
Europe was prepared to fight
along the same old lines.

380
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:44,055
England, with its undisputed
controI of the seas...

381
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:46,492
was supposed to take care
of sea warfare.

382
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,757
And France,
with its great army...

383
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,195
of land warfare.

384
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:55,463
France ended the last war
victoriously in the trenches...

385
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:56,868
so the naturaI tendency...

386
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,099
was to build bigger
and better trenches...

387
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,301
culminating in
that super-colossaI trench...

388
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:04,140
the trench deluxe,
the Maginot Line.

389
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,077
In these fantastic
underground fortresses...

390
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,579
were stored enough supplies
to withstand a siege of years.

391
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,091
The military leaders
assured the French people...

392
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,617
that this mighty wall
of steeI and concrete...

393
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:23,221
made France impregnable.

394
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:26,131
Those who dared criticize
this plan of defense...

395
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,193
were sharply reminded that
the French generaI's staff...

396
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:31,228
was the greatest on earth.

397
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:34,537
In the meantime, Hitler
was scheming a conquest...

398
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:37,442
based on lightning speed
and surprise.

399
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,850
His long-range artillery
took wings.

400
00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:00,365
Air power became
the spearhead of attack...

401
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,336
blasting clear a path
for his ground forces.

402
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,202
Under this shield
of air power...

403
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:12,769
the Nazi hordes
poured into France.

404
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:15,339
The mighty Maginot Line
proved no barrier...

405
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:18,216
against this new kind
of warfare.

406
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,921
Only when it was too late...

407
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,985
did the people of France
realize...

408
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,556
that their whole
plan of defense was futile.

409
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,999
These huge land fortresses-

410
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,970
representing
a great nationaI effort-

411
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:41,941
stand only as grim monuments
to outmoded military thinking.

412
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,211
And what about
the mighty floating fortresses

413
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:49,410
that Britain relied on
for controI of the seas?

414
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,686
When Hitler
hurled his blitzkrieg...

415
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,052
across the water gap
into Norway...

416
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:56,920
the British navy
was confident...

417
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,756
that he had
made a fataI mistake.

418
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:01,819
By cutting
Hitler's supply lines...

419
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,990
they expected
to trap his forces...

420
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,931
behind a navaI blockade.

421
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:11,030
But, like the French army...

422
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,302
the British navy
underestimated...

423
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:16,367
the tremendous
war potentiaI of air power.

424
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:31,718
Planes from
British aircraft carriers...

425
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,785
took to the air,
but they proved no match...

426
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,627
for the land-based aviation
of the Nazis.

427
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,392
Britain's
own land-based planes...

428
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,835
lacked the range
to come to the rescue.

429
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:47,534
So the world's mightiest navy,
utterly helpIess...

430
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,600
was forced to retire
to the protection...

431
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:51,669
of the RoyaI Air Force...

432
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:54,237
driven back
not by another navy...

433
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:58,241
but by this totally new
military force-air power.

434
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,656
Hitler planted
a string of air bases...

435
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,490
along the Norwegian coast...

436
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:08,927
and, with air power...

437
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,955
took over controI
of the seas in this area.

438
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,524
Ignoring
the floating fortresses-

439
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:17,503
as completely as he'd ignored
the land fortresses of France-

440
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:19,403
he was able
to move his supplies...

441
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,431
across this water gap
unmolested.

442
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:32,447
Over 300,000 British troops
cornered-

443
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,614
doomed men facing surrender
or annihilation...

444
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:39,558
under the merciless pounding
of Hitler's aeriaI spearhead.

445
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,330
But in contrast to Norway...

446
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,231
Dunkirk was
within easy reach...

447
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,498
of Britain's
land-based fighter planes.

448
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:50,936
For the first time...

449
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:55,033
Hitler's flying spearhead
met reaI air opposition.

450
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:59,211
The RoyaI Air Force...

451
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,407
gained mastery of the skies
in this area...

452
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:04,646
through a screen of wings
from shore to shore...

453
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:07,347
and under this shield
of superior air power...

454
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:11,722
300,000 men were
safely evacuated in four days.

455
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:19,258
The British braced themselves
for immediate invasion.

456
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,792
After Dunkirk, Hitler realized
he would have to strike...

457
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:26,273
with an air force many times
greater than the British.

458
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:29,708
So, for two months,
the invasion waited...

459
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:32,235
while he equipped
a chain of air bases...

460
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,213
to place
his short-range aviation...

461
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,546
within striking distance
of the target.

462
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:40,611
And then Hitler received
his first major setback.

463
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,849
He sent over
his aeriaI spearhead-

464
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,949
wave after wave of planes.

465
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:46,584
But the Luftwaffe...

466
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:50,063
built primarily to clear
a path for ground forces...

467
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,531
proved no match
for the RoyaI Air Force...

468
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:55,126
built for war in the air.

469
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,898
Outnumbered three to one...

470
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:59,201
the Spitfires rode the taiI
of the enemy...

471
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,038
firing eight guns
to the Germans' one.

472
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,938
The superior quality
of British men and machines...

473
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:41,004
overwhelmed German quantity-

474
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,814
blasted 2,400 planes
out of the sky...

475
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,556
and broke the spearhead
of the German offensive.

476
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:54,593
In winning
the Battle of Britain...

477
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,529
the gallant
RoyaI Air Force established...

478
00:34:57,565 --> 00:35:00,625
a new military truth
in the history of war-making-

479
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:04,263
that as long as a nation
controls its own skies...

480
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,330
it cannot be invaded.

481
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:11,776
Hitler's
invasion plan shattered...

482
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:14,144
he decided
to suffocate England...

483
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,173
by cutting
her lines of supply.

484
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:20,676
In the Mediterranean,
during the era of sea power...

485
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,088
controI had always centered
around the navaI strongholds...

486
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:28,528
of Gibraltar, Malta,
Alexandria, and Haifa.

487
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:30,928
In the new era of air power...

488
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,297
the island of Crete
was destined to become...

489
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,268
the commanding center
of the eastern half...

490
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,860
of the Mediterranean.

491
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,636
Recognizing
the importance of Crete...

492
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:46,976
Hitler-with his spearhead
of short-range aviation-

493
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,983
pushed step by step
through the Balkans...

494
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:53,885
and amassed his strength
for an aeriaI invasion.

495
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,855
The British had neglected
to provide Crete...

496
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,585
with an aeriaI defense...

497
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,492
and were confident they could
defend it with their navy.

498
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:03,554
The world witnessed
the first clear-cut dueI...

499
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:06,691
between sea power
and air power.

500
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:11,034
The Luftwaffe went to work,
sinking ships...

501
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:14,199
destroying
ground installations...

502
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:18,200
seizing airfields
with parachute troops...

503
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,338
and finally, landing
an army of occupation...

504
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,214
in gliders
and transport planes.

505
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,179
The first territory
to be conquered...

506
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:31,555
entirely through air power...

507
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,952
another upset in war-making.

508
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:38,923
For more than two years...

509
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,365
we had front-row seats...

510
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:42,665
to watch this revolution
in war-making...

511
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:46,104
yet we failed to understand
the lessons of air power.

512
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,075
In the Pacific,
we left the skies unprotected.

513
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,270
With our battle fleet
in PearI Harbor...

514
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:53,280
as our first line of defense...

515
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:56,283
we were prepared for
traditionaI navaI warfare...

516
00:36:56,317 --> 00:37:00,686
but again the first blow
came from the air.

517
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,339
In one hour
and twenty minutes...

518
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:24,844
a mighty battle fleet
was put out of action...

519
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:27,608
by a mere 150 planes.

520
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:32,811
True, PearI Harbor
was a sneak attack.

521
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,286
But three days later...

522
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,881
two of the mightiest warships
of the British navy-

523
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,858
"Prince of Wales"
and "Repulse"-

524
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:42,953
fully alert, dared to venture
within striking range...

525
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:45,989
of enemy land-based bomber
and torpedo planes.

526
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:18,829
The tragic sinking
of these two mighty warships...

527
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,494
was finaI proof that navies...

528
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:25,062
can no longer carry a war
to the enemy whose shores...

529
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:28,541
are adequately defended
by land-based aviation.

530
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:34,106
Our naval defense
of the Pacific crumpled...

531
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,207
under the blows of air power.

532
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,649
Japan's lightning drive...

533
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,585
was nothing
but a faithful imitation...

534
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,144
of the German blitzkrieg.

535
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,816
They employed
exactly the same tactics.

536
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:46,189
Having practically
no air opposition...

537
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,456
Japan's
spearhead of air power...

538
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,328
cleared the path
for its land and sea forces...

539
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:53,925
and drove us out
of one island after another...

540
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,731
until most of the Pacific
was lost.

541
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,204
Only then did
the earthbound mind grasp...

542
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,571
the main lesson of this war-

543
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:04,873
that no battle can be won
on the surface of the earth...

544
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:09,110
without first gaining complete
control of the sky above.

545
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:11,617
We were so impressed
with the use to which...

546
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,815
the enemy put the weapons
of land, sea, and air...

547
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,790
that we ourselves adopted
the very same tactics.

548
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:21,056
Aviation was recognized
as a full-fledged member...

549
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:22,995
of our fighting team.

550
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,625
It was to provide a roof
for our army and navy...

551
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,465
and act as a spearhead
of our offensive.

552
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,266
Now we were confident...

553
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,035
that we could beat the enemy
at his own game.

554
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:36,235
The reasoning
seemed logical enough-

555
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:39,370
if we have the same
kind of weapons as the enemy-

556
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:42,610
only more of them-
how can we lose?

557
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:46,312
With our abundant resources,
wealth of manpower...

558
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,651
and tremendous
industrial capacity...

559
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:51,249
why, we can
build the biggest army...

560
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,555
the biggest navy,
and the biggest air force.

561
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,926
And with
this super-colossal team...

562
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,090
we'll smother the enemy
with the sheer weight...

563
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:00,566
of our men and machines.

564
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:03,866
The success of this procedure
depends on two things-

565
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,362
first, we must produce
a vast amount of weapons...

566
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,342
of endless variety.

567
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:12,607
And second, we must deliver
this maze of equipment...

568
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:16,207
to battlefronts that are spread
all over the face of the earth.

569
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,710
Already nearly 100 million tons
of vital supplies...

570
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,713
are required every month,
month after month...

571
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:28,888
and if we step up the offensive,
this tonnage will grow.

572
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:32,592
Now, can we produce
and keep on producing...

573
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,931
and if we can,
can we deliver...

574
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:37,493
and keep on
delivering all this?

575
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:40,166
Regardless of the courage
and gallantry of our men...

576
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,175
on the battlefront...

577
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:45,576
regardless of the sacrifice
and effort on the home front...

578
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,137
as long as we follow
this course...

579
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,774
victory or defeat...

580
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:53,480
hangs on the fate
of our line of supply.

581
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,660
With this surface
struggle embracing the globe...

582
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,426
the problem of transportation
becomes the deciding issue.

583
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,335
To grasp
what we're up against...

584
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,701
let's spread this problem
before us.

585
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,207
In the west...

586
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:18,211
the battlefront stretched
over Europe and Africa.

587
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:21,271
The main theaters of war
are the Russian front...

588
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,875
extending from Murmansk
to the Black Sea...

589
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,977
the near-east,
and Mediterranean fronts.

590
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:31,652
In the east, from the Arctic
to the South Pacific.

591
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,962
Between these two theaters
of conflict...

592
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:41,127
thousands of miles away
lies the arsenaI of democracy.

593
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,230
This highly mechanized war...

594
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:50,539
has placed tremendous demands
on our production capacity...

595
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:52,943
which is rapidly
approaching its peak.

596
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,178
Ever mounting numbers
of tanks, guns, planes...

597
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:59,549
roll off production lines.

598
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,458
This vitaI equipment
for the distant fronts...

599
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,758
is rushed
across the continent...

600
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:13,061
but finally jams up
in the bottleneck of shipping.

601
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:24,502
This lifeblood of vitaI
war supplies must be pumped...

602
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,446
through the arteries
of our transport lines...

603
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:31,679
over distances that actually
girdle the globe.

604
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,743
To illustrate...

605
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:35,880
when a supply ship
from San Francisco...

606
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,687
moves over the trackless
miles of ocean...

607
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:41,023
and delivers
its cargo at Suez...

608
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,529
it can return
over the same route...

609
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:46,658
or traveI the rest of the way
around the world.

610
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,327
In either case...

611
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:50,996
as far as the distance
in wartime is concerned...

612
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:54,269
it's a tossup,
and the ship is lucky...

613
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:57,505
if it can deliver
more than two loads a year.

614
00:42:57,544 --> 00:43:00,342
Wartime distances
and peacetime distances...

615
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,439
are entirely different.

616
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:05,883
For example, from
San Francisco to Melbourne...

617
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:09,082
in peacetime is 6,700 miles.

618
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:12,114
But in wartime,
with enemy controI...

619
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,026
jutting out
its sphere of domination...

620
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,996
the distance
is almost doubled...

621
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,830
and the enemy has twice as long
to attack our shipping.

622
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:23,859
But his supply lines,
being interior lines...

623
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:26,202
have not
changed from peacetime.

624
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,310
To deliver supplies
to the Russian front...

625
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:38,148
our navies must convoy ships
over 4,000 perilous miles...

626
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,483
to Murmansk, and from there...

627
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,284
more than 1,000 miles
overland to the battlefront.

628
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:49,922
By contrast, the Nazis can rush
supplies to the same front...

629
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:53,160
in a few days
by direct overland transport.

630
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:58,327
Geographically,
the Axis has a great advantage.

631
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:01,830
They operate with short
interior lines of supply...

632
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:05,572
whereas we're compelled to use
long exterior lines...

633
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:08,012
a 50,000-mile battlefront...

634
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:11,347
every mile threatened by
the deadliest menace of all...

635
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,285
the submarine.

636
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:19,018
Against these wolf packs
lurking underwater...

637
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,084
and striking from ambush...

638
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:25,326
the ship glued to the surface
is a helpIess target.

639
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:27,890
In order to win
the battles at the front...

640
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:31,301
Hitler must cut
our lifeline of supply.

641
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:36,742
The U-boat-his major weapon-
is our greatest problem.

642
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:40,213
He is building improved U-boats
by the hundreds...

643
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:43,705
ever growing in size
and striking power...

644
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,913
immune to anything
short of a direct hit.

645
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:53,258
Every measure
we take to protect...

646
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:55,887
this slow-moving target
will be offset...

647
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,830
by new scientific devices
in the submarine.

648
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,667
Soon it will be able to lurk
safely below the surface...

649
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:13,202
and without ever
revealing its presence...

650
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:16,579
accurately locate
the approaching victim.

651
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:33,999
Our shipbuilding industry
tries desperately...

652
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:38,198
to meet the challenge,
but faces a tragic contest...

653
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:42,299
between
launchings and sinkings.

654
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:52,445
Every ship that goes down
is a triple casualty...

655
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:56,547
of wasted materiaI,
labor, and human life.

656
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:00,019
With millions of tons
of our production...

657
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,358
going to the bottom
instead of to battle...

658
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:06,764
a tremendous strain
is put on our industriaI heart.

659
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:14,266
As long as
we cling to a strategy...

660
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:16,571
based on surface warfare...

661
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,408
the advantage is
on the side of the enemy.

662
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:23,246
Hitler's strategic position
resembles a wheeI.

663
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:28,577
The hub-his powerfuI
industriaI center...

664
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:31,420
which grinds out
the implements of war.

665
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,520
The spokes-his supply lines...

666
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:38,463
that support
the fighting fronts...

667
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:40,728
the rim of the wheeI.

668
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,793
Our surface strategy seeks
to crush this structure...

669
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:47,295
by striking at
the rim from all sides...

670
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,638
millions of men and machines...

671
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:52,702
in a clash
of steeI against steeI.

672
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:54,873
Should we concentrate
enough force...

673
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,883
to attack at any one point...

674
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:59,249
Hitler can
quickly shift his power...

675
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,618
and reinforce
the threatened sector.

676
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,714
No matter where we strike...

677
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:05,691
Hitler can
strike back swiftly...

678
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:08,592
with the right force
at the right place.

679
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:15,099
Should we strike from all sides
with superior force...

680
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:17,569
Hitler will contract his wheeI.

681
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:21,631
The spokes become shorter,
the rim thicker...

682
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:25,042
the whole structure stronger
and more nearly impregnable.

683
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,572
To successfully attack,
we must use a superior force...

684
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:31,982
and attempt to knock out
Hitler's equipment...

685
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:34,248
faster than he can replace it.

686
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:35,948
Tanks destroy tanks...

687
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,583
and our supporting
short-range aviation...

688
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,183
plays an important part...

689
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:42,161
by destroying
more of Hitler's equipment.

690
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:47,891
But with his factories
unmolested...

691
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:49,697
he can quickly fill the gaps...

692
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:53,137
by moving his supplies
short distances over dry land.

693
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:03,038
By contrast, our replacements
must be carried in transports

694
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,575
over those thousands
of perilous floating miles...

695
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,145
constantly under attack
from the enemy.

696
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:21,067
As long as we fight
on the surface of the earth...

697
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,332
Hitler has all the advantage.

698
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,566
But with the strategy
of air power...

699
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,540
the advantage is ours.

700
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:31,408
Air power ignores
the battlefronts of the rim.

701
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,275
By direct
and independent action...

702
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,746
it strikes at the hub.

703
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:40,586
With this all-important source
of enemy power knocked out...

704
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,020
the whole structure
will collapse...

705
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:44,853
and our surface forces...

706
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,859
will move in
and clinch the victory...

707
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:49,293
with a tremendous saving
in human lives.

708
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,463
This is the real teamwork.

709
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,560
This is the true role
of air power.

710
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:59,037
The present air offensive
against Germany...

711
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:01,199
is the beginning
of such strategy.

712
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,039
Already more than
50 industrial targets...

713
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:06,568
have felt
the sting of bombardment.

714
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:08,945
The Royal Air Force
has blazed a trail.

715
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:11,212
They are giving the Nazis
a thorough lesson...

716
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:13,481
in the proper use of air power.

717
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,351
Now, this is no accident.

718
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:17,481
Back in 1918...

719
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,651
in the very midst
of the last war...

720
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:22,218
the British people
had the wisdom and courage...

721
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,355
to take a bold step.

722
00:49:24,397 --> 00:49:27,230
They divorced their Air Force
from their Army and Navy...

723
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:31,033
and set it up as a separate
and independent branch.

724
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:34,734
The entire air potential
of the country was unified.

725
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:37,834
As a result,
the Royal Air Force...

726
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:40,710
has been able to go ahead
and develop its strength...

727
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:43,238
free and unhampered.

728
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:47,185
American airmen have not
had the same opportunity.

729
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,451
They're still part and parcel
of our Army and Navy.

730
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,516
But recently,
under the pressure of events...

731
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,028
we have combined
our air strength...

732
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,654
with that of the British.

733
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,688
And now
some of our own airmen...

734
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,667
together with
the Royal Air Force...

735
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:05,694
are planning and carrying out
real air strategy.

736
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,367
As the United Nations
surround Nazi Europe...

737
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:11,707
with a ring of air bases,
the present-day bomber...

738
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:14,305
such as the British
Sterlings and Lancasters...

739
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:17,145
and our own Flying Fortresses
and Liberators...

740
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:20,209
with their striking radius
of 1,000 miles...

741
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:24,383
will be able to reach
every spot of the Axis anatomy.

742
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:27,393
Air power at last
will be in a position...

743
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,486
to score a major decision-

744
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,520
to bomb the enemy
into submission...

745
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:34,397
to knock
Germany out of the war.

746
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,334
But whether
this happens or not...

747
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,269
depends not on air power...

748
00:50:38,304 --> 00:50:42,638
but again on
those same lines of supply.

749
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,667
Air power planted
on these distant bases...

750
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,510
far away from
its main source of supply...

751
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:52,109
is only as good as the supply
lines by which it is fed.

752
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:55,519
If these lines...

753
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:58,353
can supply the needs
of this ring...

754
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:01,189
present-day bombers
with their striking radius...

755
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:04,219
of 1,000 miles
will be able to do the job.

756
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:07,700
But in the Pacific,
they haven't got a chance.

757
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,534
Let's take our ring
and move it over Japan.

758
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:15,473
If our bases were this close,
it would be a simple matter.

759
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:17,703
But Japan's
sphere of domination...

760
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,803
is three times that of Germany.

761
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:22,406
Japan is far beyond our reach.

762
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:26,385
All military men agree
that Japan cannot be defeated...

763
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:29,388
until the source
of its power is destroyed.

764
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:33,051
They all agree that Japan
itself is the target.

765
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:36,153
But they all disagree
on how to get at it.

766
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:38,822
Some pin their hopes
on Siberia...

767
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:41,163
others on direct assault
from the sea...

768
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,294
with aircraft carriers.

769
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:46,499
Some still cling to
the island-by-island approach.

770
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:49,201
Some say China.

771
00:51:58,351 --> 00:52:00,319
But they could not
strike on a big enough scale...

772
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:02,321
to knock Japan out.

773
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:06,621
China is isolated,
cut off from outside help...

774
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:10,356
on one side
by impassable mountains...

775
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:13,365
on the other three,
by the enemy.

776
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:16,459
The kind of air offensive
that could smash Japan...

777
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:19,370
would require millions
of tons of materiaI-

778
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:23,341
bombs, gasoline, oiI,
replacements.

779
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:27,210
All these vitaI supplies must
be brought in from the outside,

780
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,045
and with the only means
of delivery by air...

781
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,711
the task becomes impossible.

782
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:34,777
To reopen
surface supply lines...

783
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,187
we must drive the enemy
out of Burma...

784
00:52:37,223 --> 00:52:39,054
Thailand, and Indochina.

785
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:42,357
This means another major war-

786
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,659
2,000 miles
through steaming jungles...

787
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:47,666
hacking our way inch by inch...

788
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,500
struggling over
formidable mountain barriers...

789
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:54,029
crawling through
fever-ridden swamps...

790
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,371
years of exhaustive fighting.

791
00:52:56,409 --> 00:53:00,368
And even then, our bases
would still be dependent...

792
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:03,246
on the longest, most vulnerable
lines of supply...

793
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,342
on the face of the globe.

794
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:15,521
The Japanese are just as aware
of this as we are.

795
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:18,030
The instant
any attempt is made...

796
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,692
to use these air fields
for bombing raids...

797
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,362
against the Japanese homeland,
the jaws will close...

798
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:27,669
launching off another surface
struggle for air bases...

799
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:30,039
with the odds
all in favor of the Japs...

800
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:33,068
whose supply lines
are much shorter than ours.

801
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:53,491
Any such attempt will only
prove the superiority...

802
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:56,832
of land-based aviation
over carrier-based aviation.

803
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,895
The land-based plane
has the advantage of size...

804
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:04,467
range, and bomb load,
because it can take off...

805
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,241
from a runway
two or three miles long.

806
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:11,307
By contrast,
the carrier's runway...

807
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,411
is only
a fraction of this size.

808
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:18,447
Therefore, the plane itself
has to be much smaller...

809
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:23,289
which in turn reduces
the range and bomb load.

810
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:27,789
To destroy Japan with
these small doses of TNT...

811
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:32,032
would require not a hundred
but thousands of carriers.

812
00:54:32,071 --> 00:54:35,006
Long before our floating
airfields could bring...

813
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,771
their short-range aviation
within striking distance...

814
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,870
Japan's powerfuI
land-based planes...

815
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:43,108
would reach far out
into the Pacific...

816
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:46,880
and our carriers would be under
constant merciless attack...

817
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:50,013
not only from above,
but from the surface...

818
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:54,156
and from below.

819
00:54:54,193 --> 00:54:57,492
Aircraft brought on
these floating bases...

820
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,694
must share the same fate
as the fleet itself.

821
00:55:01,734 --> 00:55:05,636
"Land-sea-air team
to clear path to Tokyo.

822
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:09,802
"Island to island amphibious
drive to whip Japan."

823
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:12,936
Japan has already
fortified its new empire...

824
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,004
with a chain
of island strongholds...

825
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:16,743
converting every one of them...

826
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:20,082
into a powerfuI,
unsinkable air base.

827
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,679
Experience has proved
that to invade...

828
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:24,747
and reconquer
any of these islands...

829
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:28,591
is far too costly
in life, substance, and time...

830
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:32,564
for while we exhaust ourselves
attacking the outer fringe...

831
00:55:32,598 --> 00:55:36,466
the enemy feverishly rakes in
the loot of his stolen empire-

832
00:55:36,502 --> 00:55:41,462
oiI, copper, iron,
tungsten, tin, rubber.

833
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:43,873
Gorging on
this new lifeblood...

834
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,639
his war industries...

835
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:47,646
the heart and vitals
of the beast...

836
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:53,346
out of reach and unmolested,
swell in size and power...

837
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:57,516
forge more
bullets, guns, tanks...

838
00:55:57,557 --> 00:56:01,823
bombs, planes,
to strengthen his defenses...

839
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:04,227
more weapons of
death and destruction...

840
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:07,096
to expand
his sphere of domination.

841
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:12,228
Whether on the continent...

842
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:15,638
island by island,
or on the high seas...

843
00:56:15,675 --> 00:56:18,405
this long
and exhausting struggle...

844
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:20,912
is nothing but a fight
for air bases...

845
00:56:20,947 --> 00:56:23,745
so we can bring
our short-range aviation...

846
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:28,049
close enough
to strike at Japan.

847
00:56:28,087 --> 00:56:29,520
What is the solution?

848
00:56:29,555 --> 00:56:31,580
Long-range air power.

849
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:34,684
When we increase
the range of our bombers...

850
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:37,924
we automatically decrease
the surface struggle-

851
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:40,865
double the range,
half the struggle-

852
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,926
so the longer the range,
the shorter the war.

853
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,803
By increasing the striking
radius of our bombers...

854
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:49,774
to 3,000 miles,
we will be able...

855
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:53,006
to reach Japan from
the bases we have today.

856
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:54,307
But with this range...

857
00:56:54,347 --> 00:56:56,713
air power will no longer
have to depend...

858
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:58,808
on these distant bases.

859
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:00,910
It will be able
to strike directly...

860
00:57:00,953 --> 00:57:03,444
from continentaI America
and free itself...

861
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:07,289
of all dependency
on overseas supply lines.

862
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:11,391
From the great industriaI
heart of America...

863
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,922
our overland supply line...

864
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:18,232
the highway to victory,
runs to Alaska...

865
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:22,435
and Alaska points straight
at the heart of Japan.

866
00:57:28,214 --> 00:57:31,081
Bombers that can take off
from our own shores...

867
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:32,675
fly across the ocean...

868
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:35,516
strike at the enemy,
and return non-stop...

869
00:57:35,555 --> 00:57:38,285
are not only possible
but practicaI.

870
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:41,259
It is not longer a question
of whether it can be done...

871
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:43,455
but of making up our minds
to do it.

872
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:45,930
The science of aviation
is ready to give us...

873
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:48,559
powerfuI,
long-range combat planes...

874
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:51,900
far exceeding anything
in the air today.

875
00:57:51,938 --> 00:57:53,405
They'll be heavily armed...

876
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:56,966
and bristling
with large-caliber cannon.

877
00:57:57,009 --> 00:58:01,036
Their size and stability will
provide a steady platform...

878
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,947
for scientific
range-finding and gun-sights...

879
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:06,645
to assure accuracy of fire.

880
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:12,213
Small, single-seater fighters
will find themselves helpIess

881
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,624
for their guns
are not maneuverable.

882
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,094
They're fixed
and can only fire forward.

883
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:28,431
So while the small fighters...

884
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:30,135
are jockeying
to get into position...

885
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:32,940
they're under the constant
and deadly fire...

886
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:34,776
of the combat plane...

887
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,475
which is always
in firing position.

888
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,047
With scientific accuracy...

889
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:16,282
the big plane will blast
the enemy out of the air...

890
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:19,416
before he has a chance
to use his guns.

891
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:26,465
These powerfuI combat planes...

892
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:29,696
will destroy
enemy air power completely...

893
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:31,362
not only in the sky...

894
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:33,269
but on the ground
at its source.

895
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:43,577
Once complete mastery
of the air is achieved...

896
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:46,983
enemy war industries
will lie helpIessly exposed...

897
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,487
to systematic destruction.

898
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:55,254
The science of demolition
is keeping pace...

899
00:59:55,294 --> 00:59:56,921
with the development
of aviation...

900
00:59:56,963 --> 01:00:01,229
the bombs forever growing
in size and destructive power.

901
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:05,362
The industriaI districts
of all nations...

902
01:00:05,404 --> 01:00:08,703
depend on huge dams
for their main source of power.

903
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,471
Our Boulder Dam,
Japan's Nagayo...

904
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,478
and those in
the German Rhineland.

905
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:16,811
These solid structures suffer
relatively minor damage...

906
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:20,250
when hit by
one and two-ton bombs...

907
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:24,222
but when a ten-ton
delayed-action bomb is dropped,

908
01:00:24,256 --> 01:00:25,780
not on
the concrete structure...

909
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:29,090
but deep in the water
behind the dam...

910
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:34,366
its explosion will multiply
the pressure of the water...

911
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,960
far beyond the structuraI
strength of the dam...

912
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:39,369
and crush it like an eggshell.

913
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:49,714
With this important
source of power knocked out...

914
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:52,240
the war industries
of the entire region...

915
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:54,479
will come to a standstill.

916
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:03,454
Scientific bombing is destined
to conquer Hitler's submarines,

917
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:06,124
not by attacking them
one by one...

918
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:08,133
as they roam the Seven Seas...

919
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:10,692
but by striking
right at their source-

920
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:14,263
the breeding grounds
in Germany proper.

921
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:17,935
Today, the U-boats are
protected from ordinary bombing

922
01:01:17,977 --> 01:01:20,605
by thick roofs
of reinforced concrete.

923
01:01:20,646 --> 01:01:24,138
However, science is developing
an armor-piercing bomb...

924
01:01:24,183 --> 01:01:26,583
employing
the rocket principle.

925
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:30,749
As it nears its target,
a rocket in the taiI ignites...

926
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:35,224
driving it down
with such terrific speed...

927
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:37,821
it can knife its way
through steeI and concrete.

928
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,000
IndustriaI districts within
reach of this air power...

929
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:54,103
will be on the receiving end
of other gigantic bombs...

930
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:57,047
that contain an auxiliary
charge in their tails...

931
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,017
backed by a counterweight.

932
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:01,019
As the bomb
nears its target...

933
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:04,022
a secondary explosion
takes place...

934
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:07,924
driving it away
from the counterweight...

935
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,360
which explodes into
a shower of incendiaries.

936
01:02:10,396 --> 01:02:13,854
Driven down like a shot
from a cannon...

937
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:16,925
this bomb by its very size
and penetration...

938
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:21,303
will explode deep underground
and cause a locaI earthquake...

939
01:02:28,814 --> 01:02:33,012
completely demolishing
everything over a wide area.

940
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:38,052
This is the coming reality...

941
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,524
and we must face the fact...

942
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,891
that it is
a two-way proposition.

943
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:46,329
No nation has a monopoly
on this kind of air power...

944
01:02:46,365 --> 01:02:47,992
and when it comes...

945
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:51,434
there can be no real defense
against such an attack.

946
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,597
Bombers
will always go through...

947
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:57,336
and the only sure defense
will be a vigorous offense.

948
01:02:57,376 --> 01:03:00,504
It's a question
of who destroys who first.

949
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:03,447
Right now,
America holds the answer...

950
01:03:03,482 --> 01:03:06,144
not only because of
our superior science...

951
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:07,948
and industrial power...

952
01:03:07,987 --> 01:03:10,114
but because at
this stage of the war...

953
01:03:10,156 --> 01:03:12,681
our strategic position
is such...

954
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:14,693
that we can shift
our industrial effort...

955
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:16,592
into long-range air power...

956
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:21,464
But the enemy cannot,
and this is why.

957
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,128
He has overrun
vast territories...

958
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,867
and subjugated millions
of people against their will.

959
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:31,365
In order to suppress rebellion
and harness slave labor...

960
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,038
to develop his
newly-acquired resources...

961
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,573
he must maintain a huge army,
and a huge army requires...

962
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:41,313
a huge number
of supporting aircraft.

963
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:44,584
So his entire industry
must keep on grinding out...

964
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:46,420
this same kind of aviation.

965
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:49,086
He cannot afford
to disturb his production...

966
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:51,892
and start building
long-range air power...

967
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:56,891
until he has consolidated
his gains and digested his loot.

968
01:03:56,936 --> 01:04:00,702
That takes time,
and that time is ours.

969
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:04,175
Today, the enemy
is sprawled on the ground...

970
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,007
and while
his greedy tentacles...

971
01:04:06,045 --> 01:04:09,845
are clutching the loot,
his body lies unprotected.

972
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:13,443
Why spend our precious time
trying to loosen his grip?

973
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:15,350
In the struggle,
it can only lead...

974
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:19,016
to the complete devastation of
the lands we're trying to free.

975
01:04:19,058 --> 01:04:21,925
Why not use this time
to forge the dagger...

976
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,327
that can strike
at the heart of the beast?

977
01:04:24,363 --> 01:04:27,264
Once we give up the idea
of trying to regain...

978
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:29,426
the lost territory
inch by inch...

979
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:30,935
we can hold the enemy...

980
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,598
with surface forces
much smaller than his.

981
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:36,870
If we use our short-range
aviation to provide...

982
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:40,401
undisputed control of the skies
over our forces...

983
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:43,381
our present positions
cannot be invaded.

984
01:04:43,415 --> 01:04:46,350
Any further expansion
on the part of the enemy...

985
01:04:46,385 --> 01:04:49,684
will lead to
his exhaustion, not ours.

986
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:52,691
So by conserving our efforts
on land and on sea...

987
01:04:52,725 --> 01:04:55,455
we can throw the vast
resources of America...

988
01:04:55,494 --> 01:04:57,621
into long-range air power...

989
01:04:57,663 --> 01:05:00,826
and strike the decisive blow
through the air.

990
01:05:00,866 --> 01:05:02,390
This cannot be accomplished...

991
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:05,062
simply by building
a lot of huge airplanes.

992
01:05:05,104 --> 01:05:07,402
We could have
swarms and clouds of them...

993
01:05:07,439 --> 01:05:09,930
and still
not have real air power.

994
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:12,409
What we must do is unify...

995
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:14,912
the entire air strength
of our country...

996
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:19,407
into one formidable force
under a single air command.

997
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:23,080
This is a major undertaking,
but it is a move...

998
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:25,590
that is bound
to come sooner or later.

999
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:28,855
Because air power
is swiftly emerging...

1000
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:32,330
as the dominant force
in war or in peace...

1001
01:05:32,364 --> 01:05:35,333
this move will either
be forced upon us...

1002
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:36,994
by the march of events...

1003
01:05:37,036 --> 01:05:39,004
or it will come
through the foresight...

1004
01:05:39,038 --> 01:05:42,064
and native intelligence
of the American people.

1005
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:43,438
In the past...

1006
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:46,342
they have never failed
to act promptly and wisely...

1007
01:05:46,378 --> 01:05:49,074
once they understood
the problem they faced.

1008
01:05:49,114 --> 01:05:52,709
And so, in this crucial hour
in the destiny of our country...

1009
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:56,209
they will not hesitate
to break the chains of habit...

1010
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:59,088
and free themselves
from the earthbound past.

1011
01:05:59,124 --> 01:06:03,220
Only then will
our aviation leadership...

1012
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:06,561
be free to plan and carry out
reaI air strategy...

1013
01:06:06,598 --> 01:06:09,999
that will bring us victory in
the shortest possible time...

1014
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:13,436
with a minimum investment
in human lives.

1015
01:06:13,472 --> 01:06:15,440
Only then
will the creative brains...

1016
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:18,272
and productive talent
of our aviation industry...

1017
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,643
be free to forge the reaI
weapons of air power...

1018
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,446
that will carry
totaI destruction to the enemy.

1019
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:20,571
Our gallant airmen
have already demonstrated...

1020
01:07:20,606 --> 01:07:23,097
their skill,
their resourcefulness...

1021
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:24,632
and their courage.

1022
01:07:24,676 --> 01:07:29,477
Born to this aeriaI age,
they understand war in the sky.

1023
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:32,746
America should not hesitate
to place its destiny...

1024
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:34,650
in the hands of these men...

1025
01:07:34,686 --> 01:07:37,018
for with the strategy
of air power...

1026
01:07:37,056 --> 01:07:39,923
they will make the enemy
fight on our terms...

1027
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,926
against the weapons
of our choosing...

1028
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,691
at our time, but on his soiI.
