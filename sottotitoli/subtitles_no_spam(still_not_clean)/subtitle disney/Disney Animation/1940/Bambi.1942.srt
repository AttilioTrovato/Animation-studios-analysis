00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:18,117
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

2
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,789
<i>Life may be swift and fleeting</i>

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,295
<i>Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music</i>

4
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>Comes each day like the dawn</i>

5
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:40,906
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

6
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:46,512
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

7
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:52,284
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

8
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:59,703
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

9
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:12,438
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

10
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:19,521
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

11
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,136
Hoo!

12
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,473
Hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo.

13
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,147
Hoo-hoo!

14
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,950
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Oh, what now?

15
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:56,862
- Wake up, Friend Owl.
- Hey, what's going on around here?

16
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,531
- Wake up!
- It's happened. It's happened.

17
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,500
The new prince is born.

18
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,448
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.

19
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,730
Oh. Well, look.

20
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,626
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?

21
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,393
Oh...

22
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,967
Well... this is quite an occasion.

23
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,914
Yes, sir, it isn't every
day a prince is born.

24
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,140
You're to be congratulated.

25
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,210
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

26
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:47,213
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

27
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,056
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

28
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,091
Hello. Hello, there.

29
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,061
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

30
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,563
Hello, little prince.

31
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,066
Hoo-hoo!

32
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,401
Hoo-hoo!

33
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,064
Hoo-hoo!

34
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,228
Look! He's trying to get up.

35
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,909
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

36
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,412
Thumper!

37
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,548
Well, he is.

38
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,226
Aren't you?

39
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,937
Looks to me like he's
getting kind of sleepy.

40
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,134
I think it's time we all left.

41
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,338
Come on. Shoo-shoo! Psst!
Come on. Shoo-shoo!

42
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,441
Psst!

43
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,480
Psst!

44
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,562
Thumper. Come on.

45
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,665
Whatcha gonna call him?

46
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,133
Well... I think I'll
call him Bambi.

47
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,443
Bambi.

48
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,140
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

49
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,643
Bambi.

50
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,579
My little Bambi.

51
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,556
Walking already. Well,
what do you know.

52
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,531
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

53
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,536
And where's the young
prince this mo... Oh!

54
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,951
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

55
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,179
Goodbye.

56
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,251
Good morning, young prince.

57
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,826
Good morning, young prince.

58
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,242
Good morning. Hm.

59
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,412
Nice sunny day.

60
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,225
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

61
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,028
Did the young prince fall down?

62
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,942
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

63
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,970
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

64
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,473
Thumper.

65
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,476
Yes, Mama?

66
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,189
What did your father
tell you this morning?

67
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,422
If you can't say something nice...

68
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,660
don't say nothing at all.

69
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,596
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

70
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,633
Come on, get up. Get up, Bambi.

71
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,136
- Get up.
- Try again.

72
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,037
I'm thumping. That's why
they call me Thumper.

73
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,848
...call me Thumper.

74
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,442
- Thumper!
- Thumper!

75
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,199
Come on. You can do it.

76
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,136
Hop over it. Like this.

77
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,948
- Hop over it.
- Hop over it.

78
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,876
Like this.

79
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,834
You didn't hop far enough.

80
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,498
That's it. Now the other one.

81
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,743
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

82
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,330
Those are birds.

83
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,500
Bur.

84
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,034
Bur!

85
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,776
Look, he's trying to talk.

86
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,706
Bur!

87
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,209
He's trying to say "bird".

88
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,580
Say "bird".

89
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,549
Bur.

90
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,551
Bird.

91
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,827
Bur.

92
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,989
Uh-uh.

93
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,957
Bird.

94
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,460
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".

95
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,530
Say "bird". Say "bird".
Come on, say "bird".

96
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,033
Say "bird".

97
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,202
Bird!

98
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,407
He talked! He talked!
He talked, Mama.

99
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,910
The young prince said "bird".

100
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,324
Bird, bird, bird,
bird, bird, bird...

101
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,667
Bird!

102
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,936
No, that's not a bird.

103
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,271
That's a butterfly.

104
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,440
Butterfly?

105
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,318
Butter...

106
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,215
Butterfly.

107
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,817
No, that's a flower.

108
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:17,061
- Flower?
- Uh-huh, it's pretty.

109
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,962
Purty.

110
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,871
Flower!

111
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,439
Me?

112
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,652
No, no.

113
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,550
That's not a flower.

114
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,286
- He's a little...
- Oh, that's all right.

115
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:53,600
He can call me a
flower if he wants to.

116
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,673
I don't mind.

117
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,839
Purty! Purty flower!

118
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,645
Oh...

119
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
gosh.

120
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,761
I think I better go home now.

121
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,019
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

122
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,722

124
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,294

00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,963
<i>Beautiful sound
Beautiful sound</i>

<i>Drip, drip, drop

128
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,604
<i>Your pretty music
Can brighten the day</i>

129
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,240
<i>Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy</i>

130
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,710
<i>You come along
with a song right away</i>

131
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,712
<i>Come with your beautiful music</i>

132
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,581

00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,117

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,381

<i>Beautiful sound
Beautiful</i>

153
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,961
Mother, what we going to do today?

154
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,068
I'm going to take
you to the meadow.

155
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,367
Meadow? What's the meadow?

156
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,337
It's a very wonderful place.

157
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,273
Then why haven't we
been there before?

158
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,976
You weren't big enough.

159
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,745
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

160
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,648
We're not the only
deer in the forest.

161
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,052
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

162
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,421
Well, he's right.

163
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,157
There are many deer in
the forest besides us.

164
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,626
Then why don't I ever see them?

165
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,862
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

166
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,698
Perhaps.

167
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,201
Hush now.

168
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,437
We're almost there.

169
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,982
- The meadow!
- Wait!

170
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,656
Bambi, wait!

171
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,722
You must never rush
out on the meadow.

172
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,225
There might be danger.

173
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,994
Out there, we're unprotected.

174
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,596
The meadow is wide and open,

175
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,466
and there are no trees
or bushes to hide us.

176
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,311
So we have to be very careful.

177
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,310
Wait here.

178
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:20,552
I'll go out first. And if the
meadow is safe, I'll call you.

179
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,900
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

180
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,339
Come on.

181
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,758
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

182
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,293
Good morning, young prince.

183
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,096
Hello. What ya eatin'?

184
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,433
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.

185
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,502
It's delicious.

186
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,506
Why don't you try some?

187
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,421
No, no, not that green stuff.

188
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,946
Just eat the blossoms.

189
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,449
That's the good stuff.

190
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,886
Thumper.

191
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,624
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

192
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,225
About what?

193
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:52,363
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

194
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,866
Oh, that one.

195
00:23:56,567 --> 00:24:00,304
Eating greens is a special treat.

196
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:04,947
It makes long ears
and great big feet.

197
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,215
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

198
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,429
I made that last part up myself.

199
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,957
Watch out.

200
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,404
Watch out.

201
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,900
That's little Faline.

202
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,493
He's kind of bashful,
isn't he, Mama?

203
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:33,771
Well, maybe he wouldn't
be if you'd say hello.

204
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,981
Hello, Bambi.

205
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,309
I said hello.

206
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,154
Well, aren't you
going to answer her?

207
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,455
You're not afraid, are you?

208
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,926
Well, then, go ahead.

209
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,298
Go on, say hello.

210
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,172
Hello.

211
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,643
You!

212
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,634
He stopped and looked at me.

213
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,445
Yes, I know.

214
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,508
Why was everyone still when
he came on the meadow?

215
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,777
Everyone respects him.

216
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:46,160
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

217
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,963
He's very brave and very wise.

218
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:57,402
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.

219
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,031
Faline!

220
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,702
Bambi!

221
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,148
Mother!

222
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,482
Bambi!

223
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,715
Bambi!

224
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,059
Mother!

225
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,189
Mother!

226
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,662
Mother!

227
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,327
Come on out, Bambi.

228
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,401
Come on.

229
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,600
It's safe now.

230
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,980
We don't have to hide any longer.

231
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,081
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

232
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,258
Man... was in the forest.

233
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,897
Mother, look! What's
all that white stuff?

234
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,591
Why, it's snow.

235
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,294
- Snow?
- Yes.

236
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,797
Winter has come.

237
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,802
Hiya, Bambi.

238
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,674
Watch what I can do.

239
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,678
Whoo!

240
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,650
Come on! It's all right!

241
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,562
Look!

242
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,389
The water's stiff.

243
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,261
Yippee!

244
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,578
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

245
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,852
Come on, get up. Like this.

246
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,007
No, no.

247
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,296
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

248
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:31,084
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

249
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,960
Guess you better unwind it.

250
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,216
Arghh!

251
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,653
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!

252
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,229
Is it spring yet?

253
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,461
No. Winter's just started.

254
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,459
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?

255
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,809
Uh-huh.

256
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,567
What do you want to do that for?

257
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:03,909
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

258
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:11,284
Well... good night.

259
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,386
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

260
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,889
It seems long.

261
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,228
But it won't last forever.

262
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,398
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

263
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,209
Yes, I know.

264
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,177
Bambi.

265
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,680
Bambi, come here.

266
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,549
Look.

267
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,587
New spring grass.

268
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,410
Bambi. Quick!

269
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,221
The thicket!

270
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,853
Faster! Faster, Bambi!

271
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,456
Don't look back! Keep running!

272
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,062
Keep running!

273
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,739
We made it!

274
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,808
We made it, Mother!

275
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,011
We...

276
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,247
Mother!

277
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,593
Mother!

278
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,567
Mother, where are you?!

279
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,402
Mother!

280
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,941
Mother!

281
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,678
Mother!

282
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,319
Mother!

283
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,233
Mother!

284
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,949
Your mother can't be
with you anymore.

285
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,392
Come.

286
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,193
My son.

287
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,986
<i>Let's sing a gay
little spring song</i>

288
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,153
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

289
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,957
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

290
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,127
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

291
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,429
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

292
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,536
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

293
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,712
<i>Let's sing a gay
little spring song</i>

294
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,010
<i>Just like the bird on the wing</i>

295
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,713
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

296
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,583
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

297
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,252
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

298
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,322
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

299
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,026
<i>Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May</i>

300
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,529
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

301
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,033
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

302
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,101
Wait!

303
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,604
Oh, what now?

304
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,147
Hey! Hey!

305
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,244
Stop that racket!

306
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,347
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!

307
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,754
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

308
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,554
I'll fix 'em.

309
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:02,201
There. I guess...
that'll teach 'em.

310
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,409
Oh, what's the use?

311
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:15,116
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

312
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,627
Same thing every spring.

313
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,221
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

314
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,963
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

315
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,994
Love's sweet song.

316
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:35,372
Hm! Pain in the pin
feathers, I call it.

317
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,154
Stop it!

318
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,204
Get out of here. All of you.

319
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,097
And you, too!

320
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:12,401
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

321
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,737
Why, it... it's the young prince.

322
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,649
Bambi!

323
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:20,576
My, my, how you've changed.

324
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,746
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

325
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,784
I see you've traded in your
spots for a pair of antlers.

326
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:36,058
You know, just the other day I
was talking to myself about you.

327
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,028
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

328
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,531
Hello, Bambi!

329
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,870
Remember me?

330
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,303
Thumper!

331
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,410
Right-o!

332
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,444
Hi, fellas.

333
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,549
Flower.

334
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,016
Yeah.

335
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,162
Well, what's the matter with them?

336
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,531
Why are they acting that way?

337
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:18,576
Why, don't you know?

338
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,009
They're twitterpated.

339
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,841
- Twitterpated?
- Yes.

340
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:29,149
Nearly everybody gets
twitterpated in the spring time.

341
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,984
For example...

342
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,322
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

343
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:43,459
you're looking neither to
the left nor to the right,

344
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,561
when all of a sudden...

345
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:49,532
you run smack into a pretty face.

346
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:58,341
You begin to get weak in the knees.

347
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,981
Your head's in a whirl.

348
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,914
And then you feel
light as a feather.

349
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,150
And before you know it,

350
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:10,693
you're walking on air.

351
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,828
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.

352
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,242
And you completely lose your head.

353
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,035
Gosh, that's awful.

354
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,304
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

355
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,306
And that ain't all.

356
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,720
It can happen to anybody.

357
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,180
So you'd better be careful.

358
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:41,490
It could happen to
you, and you, and...

359
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,500
Yes, it could even happen to you.

360
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,060
Well, it's not going
to happen to me.

361
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,971
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

362
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,785
Ha! Twitterpated!

363
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,882
Oh...

364
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:59,130
Ahem.

365
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,481
Oh.

366
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,719
Hello, Bambi.

367
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,590
Don't you remember me?

368
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,430
I'm Faline.

369
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,865
Bambi.

370
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,682
Bambi.

371
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,023
Bambi!

372
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,620
<i>I bring you a song</i>

373
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:54,083
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

374
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,319
<i>For I want you to know</i>

375
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,360
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

376
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,695
<i>I bring you a song</i>

377
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,299
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

378
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,435
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

379
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:17,281
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

380
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,877
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

381
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,913
<i>Only found when you're
young and it's May</i>

382
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,983
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

383
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,588
<i>When all longing is through</i>

384
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,524
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

385
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,761
<i>Only found when
a thrill is complete</i>

386
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:42,097
<i>Only found when two
hearts gently beat</i>

387
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:48,937
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

388
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,441
<i>I bring you a song</i>

389
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,412
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

390
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,281
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

391
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,351
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

392
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:08,632
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

393
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:22,237
<i>I bring you a song</i>

394
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:26,174
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

395
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,520
<i>And you</i>

396
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,388
It is Man.

397
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,457
He is here again.

398
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,466
There are many this time.

399
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,866
We must go deep into the forest.

400
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,369
Hurry! Follow me!

401
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,807
Faline!

402
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,833
Bambi.

403
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,727
Bambi, where are you?

404
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,496
Bambi!

405
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,170
Bambi!

406
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,975
Faline!

407
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,312
Faline!

408
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,247
Faline!

409
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,850
Listen.

410
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,919
- He's coming!
- Hush!

411
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,331
Be quiet.

412
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:31,465
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

413
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:35,163
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

414
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,366
Whatever you do, don't fly.

415
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:41,405
He's almost here! I can't
stand it any longer!

416
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:59,563
Bambi! Bambi!

417
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,271
Faline!

418
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,085
Bambi!

419
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,463
Bambi!

420
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,156
Quick, Faline! Jump!

421
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,578
Get up, Bambi.

422
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,751
Get up!

423
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,057
You must get up.

424
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,496
Get up!

425
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,299
Get up!

426
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,082
Now... come with me.

427
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,236
Bambi.

428
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,007
Hoo!

429
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,911
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.

430
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,247
Wake up, Friend Owl.

431
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:35,922
Oh, what now?

432
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,721
Hey, what's going on around here?

433
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,456
- It's happened.
- Happened?

434
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,525
Yes. In the thicket.

435
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,560
Hurry up, Bambi.

436
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,440
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

437
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,864
Oh. Well.

438
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,449
Look.

439
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,273
- Two of them.
- Oh!

440
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:44,986
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

441
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:48,593
Prince Bambi ought
to be mighty proud.

442
01:08:52,028 --> 01:09:00,510
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

443
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:08,782
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

444
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:13,081
<i>Like the voice</i>

445
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:19,287
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

446
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:23,291
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

447
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:27,963
<i>Flows on</i>
