1
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>Ichabod and Mr Toad</i>

2
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,103
<i>Ichabod</i>

3
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:25,072
<i>Ichabod and Mr Toad</i>

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,915
<i>Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...</i>

5
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:45,631
<i>If you chose the most fabulous
character in English literature,</i>

6
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:48,108
<i>who would it be?</i>

7
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:55,413
<i>Robin Hood? King Arthur?</i>

8
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,518
<i>Becky Sharp?</i>

9
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,729
<i>Sherlock Holmes?</i>
<i>Oliver Twist, perhaps?</i>

10
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,982
<i>Any one of them would
be an excellent choice.</i>

11
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:08,112
<i>But as the most fabulous
character of all, I nominate</i>

12
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,030
<i>a toad.</i>

13
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:15,035
<i>J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.
Have you never met him?</i>

14
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:19,123
<i>You'll find his story in
"The Wind in the Willows".</i>

15
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:21,792
<i>Toad was the one
disturbing element.</i>

16
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:25,796
<i>Incurable adventurer, mad,
reckless, tried everything.</i>

17
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:30,592
<i>A positive mania for fads, and
he never counted the cost.</i>

18
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:33,429
<i>He had a host of
fair-weather friends.</i>

19
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,559
<i>But there were only three who had
his best interests at heart.</i>

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,293
<i>One was a badger. MacBadger.</i>

21
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,983
<i>And then there was a water rat.</i>

22
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:50,696
<i>A bit stuffy, perhaps, but really
a fine fellow. And a mole.</i>

23
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:54,217
<i>A gentle creature,
kind and sympathetic.</i>

24
00:02:55,493 --> 00:03:00,414
<i>They all made their homes in a
quaint community along a riverbank.</i>

25
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:05,228
<i>On that particular day, Mole
was in a hurry because...</i>

26
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,714
<i> because he was late for tea.</i>

27
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:12,885
<i>A regrettable habit, but Rat
had learned to put up with it.</i>

28
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:16,889
<i>Sorry, says Mole. Quite
alright, says Rat. Two lumps?</i>

29
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,038
<i>Then, just as they were
getting settled...</i>

30
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:29,276
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.

31
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:32,168
How's everything on the river, sir?

32
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:35,717
Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you.

33
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,952
Mole, listen.

34
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:45,334
"Dear Rat: You and Mole must
come to Toad Hall at once."

35
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:48,045
"Urgent!! A MacBadger."

36
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:51,298
<i>Rat was certain Toad was
making trouble again.</i>

37
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,803
<i>The answer to that lay just
around the bend at Toad Hall,</i>

38
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:59,473
<i>the ancestral home of
J Thaddeus himself.</i>

39
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:04,061
<i>This impressive structure was
the finest home on the river.</i>

40
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,272
<i>The animals were
tremendously proud of it.</i>

41
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>They felt it gave the whole
community an air of respectability.</i>

42
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:16,490
<i>To lose Toad Hall was,
of course, unthinkable,</i>

43
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:19,785
<i>and yet it was no secret
that Toad's follies</i>

44
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,955
<i>had brought him to the
brink of bankruptcy.</i>

45
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:28,433
<i>So, MacBadger had volunteered
to put Toad's house in order.</i>

46
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:34,192
Smashed fence. Two guineas.

47
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:42,621
Damage, lamp post. Four pound six.

48
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:53,047
Destruction of hen house...

49
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,464
How can a man figure
with all this hubbub?

50
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:05,015
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!

51
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,875
- I want my money!
- Silence!

52
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,586
You'll get your money
in due course.

53
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:15,234
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.

54
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:24,037
Why did I assume the
responsibility of looking after...

55
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,704
Didn't I tell you...?

56
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:36,028
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.

57
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,505
You've come at last.

58
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,202
<i>Poor MacBadger. He'd reached
the end of his rope.</i>

59
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,079
<i>As he said himself...</i>

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,873
I'm practically a nervous wreck.

61
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:51,001
I say! What seems
to be the trouble?

62
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:56,673
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!

63
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:58,383
But he promised us...

64
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:03,078
Promises? What good are promises
when wild manias take him?

65
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:07,810
Now, look, you're his closest
friends, are you not?

66
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:10,145
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.

67
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:13,607
Then you must find
Toad and stop him!

68
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:17,319
- What's he doing?
- He's got a new mania.

69
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,534
He's rampaging about the county
in a canary-yellow gypsy cart.

70
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:27,268
With a horse named Cyril.

71
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,624
Tally-ho!

72
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:35,337
<i>Are we on our way to Nottingham,
to Brittingham, to Buckingham</i>

73
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:38,715
<i>Or any hammy hamlet by the sea? No!</i>

74
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:42,719
<i>Are we on our way to Devonshire,
to Lancashire or Worcestershire?</i>

75
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,722
<i>I'm not so sure
We'll have to wait and see</i>

76
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:49,768
<i>Are we on our way to Dover?
Or going merrily over</i>

77
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,604
<i>The jolly old road that
goes to Plymouth Ho?</i>

78
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:56,233
<i>No! We're merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily, merrily</i>

79
00:06:56,234 --> 00:07:00,654
<i>On our way to nowhere in particular</i>

80
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:04,575
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily on our way</i>

81
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:08,179
<i>Though the roads are perpendicular</i>

82
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:11,915
<i>- We're always in a hurry
- We have no time to stall</i>

83
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,001
<i>We've gotta be there
We've gotta be there</i>

84
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,920
<i>But where, we can't recall</i>

85
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:21,049
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily on our way</i>

86
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,928
<i>And we may be going to Devonshire,
to Lancashire, to Worcestershire</i>

87
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,764
<i>We're not so sure,
but what do we care?</i>

88
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:30,559
<i>We're only sure we've
got to be there</i>

89
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,754
<i>We're merrily on our
way to nowhere at all</i>

90
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:42,488
Hello, you fellows!

91
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,657
You're the very animals
I was coming to see!

92
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:49,745
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!

93
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:53,499
The open road, the dusty
highway. Come!

94
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,667
I'll show you the world.

95
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:59,402
Travel, change, excitement...

96
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:11,642
How stupid of me! I want you fellows
to meet my noble steed Cyril.

97
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:14,331
Aye, that's me.

98
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:18,398
A bit of a trotter,
a bit of a rotter.

99
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,958
How do you do, how do
you do, how do you do?

100
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,008
How do you do?

101
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:32,136
Say, guv'nor, your friends
seem a bit on the stuffy side.

102
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:36,606
Toad, we want to have
a talk with you.

103
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:40,254
A visit! Splendid!

104
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:44,967
This is serious. You must
give up that horse and cart.

105
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:51,323
Give up my... But my dear
Ratty, this is my career!

106
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,101
- You can't mean...
- I do!

107
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:57,271
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.

108
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,398
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.

109
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,985
Your reckless behaviour is
giving animals a bad name!

110
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:05,946
You're becoming a
menace to society.

111
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,699
At least think of poor MacBadger!

112
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,953
And as for that horse, no good
will come of gadding about

113
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:16,355
with such a fast and
irresponsible beast!

114
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,837
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.

115
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:27,825
Stop it! Let me go!
Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!

116
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,071
It's no use. You'll never
get me to give this up!

117
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:35,911
Tally-ho! Yikes!

118
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,293
Look!

119
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:48,489
Gad! What is it?

120
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,726
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?

121
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:13,161
A motorcar... Gad! What
have I been missing?

122
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:29,279
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.

123
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,783
A new mania. Motor mania.

124
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,618
<i>Mania.</i>

125
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:38,205
<i>That's it. That's what it was.
A positive mania.</i>

126
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:41,917
<i>No telling where it would end.
Might linger for months.</i>

127
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:47,548
<i>And with Toad Hall at stake,
Rat and Mole had no choice.</i>

128
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,299
<i>Only one thing to do.</i>

129
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,612
<i>Lock the poor chap up until the
poison worked out of his system.</i>

130
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,329
Hold him, Moley!

131
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,988
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.

132
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:13,428
Simply no use trying.

133
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:23,896
Let me out! Open up, I say! Please!

134
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,462
Open the door!

135
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:30,716
<i>Playing jailer to one's dearest
friend wasn't pleasant.</i>

136
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:36,388
<i>In fact, Moley immediately wanted to
call it quits, but Ratty said no.</i>

137
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:38,996
<i>This time they must be firm.</i>

138
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:46,356
<i>It wasn't just a matter of
saving Toad from himself.</i>

139
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:51,301
<i>There was MacBadger to consider, and
Toad Hall and all it stood for.</i>

140
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:57,201
<i>There was only one thing wrong
with Ratty's cure for motor mania.</i>

141
00:11:57,202 --> 00:12:01,580
<i>It didn't work. You see,
Toad was far too clever.</i>

142
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:06,627
<i>And, at the moment, completely mad.
He was determined to get a motorcar,</i>

143
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,566
<i>even if he had to beg, borrow or...</i>

144
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:14,573
Toad arrested! Extra!

145
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,973
His Majesty versus J
Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall,

146
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,517
Riverbank, Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey.

147
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,598
24th day of August, set forth
in the following brief.

148
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,273
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad,
of stealing a motorcar,

149
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:32,778
and with it, endangering sundry
subjects of His Majesty,

150
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,532
- their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown,

151
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,659
proceed with the case.

152
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,163
My lord, I call, as
first Crown witnesses,

153
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:46,565
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!

154
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:05,602
Is it true that you had the
accused locked in his own house

155
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:08,838
because he had threatened
to get a motorcar?

156
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:12,317
Did you, or did you not,
have him locked up?

157
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:15,470
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!

158
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:20,719
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!

159
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,579
As trustee of the Toad estate,

160
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,313
you knew of the prisoner's
mania for motorcars?

161
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,984
And due to his extravagance,
you cut off his allowance?

162
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:37,801
Then he was, to the best of
your knowledge, without funds?

163
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:39,511
That is all! Thank you!

164
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:43,974
Gentlemen of the jury,
the Crown rests.

165
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:48,124
Counsel for the defence
will present his case.

166
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:53,464
My lord, with the
court's indulgence,

167
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:58,597
I rise prepared to
plead my own defence.

168
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:03,410
Stop it.

169
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:05,887
Gentlemen of the jury...

170
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:11,772
I call, as my first
witness, Cyril Proudbottom.

171
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:20,344
Are you acquainted with the
defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?

172
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:25,474
Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of
the jolliest chaps I've run across.

173
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:27,559
And simply tons of money.

174
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,479
Good fellow? Throws it away.

175
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
But he wasn't throwing
it away that day!

176
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:37,903
You heard Mr MacBadger testify
that his allowance was cut off.

177
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:40,656
Then how did he get a motorcar?

178
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:43,367
The only way a gentleman
gets anything.

179
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:47,682
- The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?

180
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,646
I thought you wouldn't know!

181
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,585
Your Lordship, I...

182
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:56,922
The witness may testify
in his own words.

183
00:14:56,923 --> 00:15:01,218
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts.

184
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:06,495
When Toady escaped from his boudoir
he headed straight for my place.

185
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,560
<i>Soon we was off down the highway,</i>

186
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:15,335
<i>but we hadn't gone far, I confess,
when, with a rush and a roar...</i>

187
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:20,719
<i> something passed
like the London Express.</i>

188
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:26,201
<i>It was big, it was
red, it was beautiful.</i>

189
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:30,766
<i>A motorcar, a bit of alright.</i>

190
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:35,419
<i>Toady was transfixed
with... rapture.</i>

191
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,485
<i>You could tell it was
love at first sight.</i>

192
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:44,595
<i>The motor pulled up to a tavern,
wherein was located a bar.</i>

193
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:48,515
<i>And we watched while some
tough-looking weasels</i>

194
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:51,490
<i>got out of that lovely red car.</i>

195
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,232
<i>Now, weasels, I know,
are deceitful.</i>

196
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:00,319
<i>And not to be trusted, at all.</i>

197
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,363
<i>But how could I know
they'd stolen that car?</i>

198
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:06,516
<i>I didn't have no crystal ball.</i>

199
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,329
<i>The guv'nor is not one to dally.</i>

200
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,166
<i>He made up his mind
like a flash. He says...</i>

201
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,668
<i>Try it for size, my good Cyril,</i>

202
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,106
<i>while I see what they'll
take for it, cash.</i>

203
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:26,386
<i>Into the tavern he saunters, where
the barman was back of the bar.</i>

204
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:27,429
<i>And he said,</i>

205
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,370
Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the
owner of that... hot-looking car?

206
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:42,986
<i>The barman, a codger named Winky,
leaned over the bar and said,</i>

207
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:46,031
- Why?
<i>- The guv'nor answered,</i>

208
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,825
That car must be mine!

209
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:51,096
Whatever the price is, I'll buy.

210
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,669
<i>But Toad found he hadn't no money.
So, he promptly offered a trade.</i>

211
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,230
<i>The weasels appeared to be willing.
In a moment, the bargain was made.</i>

212
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:09,096
<i>Toady drawed up a paper, with
almost incredible speed.</i>

213
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:11,890
<i>He called on old Winky the barman</i>

214
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:15,292
<i>to... pop over and
witness the deed.</i>

215
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:24,385
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.

216
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:28,465
The weasels gave him
the red motorcar,

217
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,635
and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.

218
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:45,485
Traded Toad Hall? An estate
worth £100,000 for a motorcar?

219
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,932
You expect me to believe that?

220
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:57,436
I don't expect you
to believe anything.

221
00:17:57,437 --> 00:18:03,673
Fortunately, I can produce
a witness. Call Mr Winky!

222
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,830
My lord, gentlemen,

223
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:23,879
facing you in the witness box is a
citizen of substance and standing.

224
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,649
A man of unimpeachable honesty.

225
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:33,889
Now, Mr Winky, do you recall
an incident that took place

226
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,851
in your... establishment
last August 12th,

227
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,395
that I was a party to?

228
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:44,047
Yes, sir, that I do.

229
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:50,969
Well, then... just tell the
court what actually happened.

230
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:53,325
Well, guv'nor,

231
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:57,771
you tried to sell me
a stolen motorcar.

232
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:02,181
That's a deliberate lie,
you monkey-faced rum pot!

233
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:08,526
I've been framed! Let me go! Help!

234
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,284
Toad guilty!

235
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,140
<i>Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.</i>

236
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,852
<i>The court was determined
to make an example of him.</i>

237
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:23,897
<i>Toad's friends tried to help
him, but were always blocked.</i>

238
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,359
<i>They must've reopened
the case a dozen times.</i>

239
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,322
<i>Appeals to this court, that court
any court. But the decision stood.</i>

240
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:37,053
<i>The case of J Thaddeus
Toad was closed.</i>

241
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>Merry, merry Christmas time</i>

242
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:49,506
<i>Bind every heart with happiness
Let everyone...</i>

243
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:53,719
<i>Yes, once again, it was
a white Christmas.</i>

244
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,474
<i>Melodies of Yuletide hung
sweet upon the winter's air.</i>

245
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:01,351
<i>Hearts were gay and spirits high.</i>

246
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:03,187
<i>Indeed, in all the city,</i>

247
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:07,691
<i>only one spot was untouched by
the warmth of Christmas cheer.</i>

248
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:14,239
<i>The Tower, grim monument to</i>
<i>despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,</i>

249
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,468
<i>and the abode of Toad for a
good many Christmases to come.</i>

250
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:25,584
<i>Poor Toad. Alone with
memories of his wasted life.</i>

251
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:28,545
<i>What a fool he'd been!</i>

252
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:32,633
<i>With many a pang he recalled the
kindly face of Angus MacBadger,</i>

253
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:35,655
<i>and his sage advice,
so often scorned.</i>

254
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:41,782
<i>A tear for Moley, too, for his
loyalty, sympathy, understanding.</i>

255
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:47,704
<i>Toad wept for Rat, and all those
little lectures so often laughed at.</i>

256
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:57,825
<i>Yes, within the dark confines
of his miserable cell,</i>

257
00:20:57,826 --> 00:21:04,062
<i>a new Toad was born. A reformed
Toad, a repentant Toad.</i>

258
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,086
<i>In a flood of remorse, he
vowed to forsake the follies</i>

259
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,963
<i>of the Primrose path.</i>

260
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:15,676
<i>Never again would he give way
to those mad, foolish manias</i>

261
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:19,991
<i>that had brought him
to this sorry end.</i>

262
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:28,605
As it's Christmas, you're
allowed a visitor.

263
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,650
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?

264
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,528
Merry Christmas, sonny!

265
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:38,761
Granny wouldn't forget
her little Toady boy!

266
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,811
Look, Christmas gift.

267
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:57,926
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?

268
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:00,012
A disguise.

269
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:05,350
All you've got to do is put on
this natty little costume and...

270
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:10,397
<i>Alas for good intentions.
Toad was incurable.</i>

271
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:14,151
<i>One whispered word and
all his high resolve</i>

272
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:17,529
<i>vanished in the mad whirl
of this new adventure.</i>

273
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,219
<i>This new mania! Escape!</i>

274
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:24,302
Toad's escaped!

275
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,266
Halt!

276
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:09,206
Good evening, ma'am.

277
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,647
Good evening to you, Officer.

278
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:15,690
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily...</i>

279
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:19,283
Begging your pardon, but you...

280
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,244
You fellows, do you see him?

281
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,281
<i>Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!</i>

282
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:44,639
<i>Trap Toad, would they?</i>

283
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>Never!</i>

284
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:50,289
- There he goes!
- Where?

285
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,852
Over there!

286
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,931
<i>Blockheads! Let them
scour the countryside.</i>

287
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:53,828
<i>Once more, J Thaddeus
Toad had the last laugh.</i>

288
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,885
<i>That Christmas Eve,
along the riverbank,</i>

289
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:30,264
<i>the name of Toad was
banned from conversation,</i>

290
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:35,144
<i>lest the memory of his disgrace
becloud the merriment of the season.</i>

291
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:39,440
<i>Yet there was one home, at
least, in which two loyal hearts</i>

292
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:43,589
<i>still held the warmth
of Christian charity.</i>

293
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:47,865
Bless this good food
we are about to enjoy.

294
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:51,765
Bless us, every one.

295
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:56,039
And... bless poor Toad.

296
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,683
And may he get time off
for good behaviour.

297
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:11,450
Why, it's a poor old lady.

298
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:14,791
Let's take her over by the fire.

299
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,732
What are you doing here?

300
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:24,443
I was just sort of...

301
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:27,446
Well, this is a merry Christmas!

302
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:31,283
But... aren't you
afraid of the police?

303
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:33,677
Afraid of the police?

304
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,940
I, Toad, afraid of the police?

305
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:42,436
- Open up, I say!
- The police!

306
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:46,340
Hide me, Ratty!

307
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:50,552
Sorry, but you owe
a debt to society.

308
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:53,222
And you've got to pay.

309
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:56,161
Mole, let them in.

310
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,439
But, Ratty, don't
you think, maybe...

311
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,216
Open the door!

312
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:11,865
Hi, lads!

313
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:17,094
I've just made a very
important discovery.

314
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:21,021
<i>Toad Hall is ablaze with lights</i>

315
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:25,768
<i>and in possession of
a pack of weasels.</i>

316
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:31,109
<i>And the leader of the gang
is none other than Mr...</i>

317
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:33,702
Winky!

318
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,664
Hip, hip...

319
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,435
Hooray!

320
00:27:39,436 --> 00:27:44,231
And so, you see,
he did trade Toad Hall

321
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:46,316
for the motorcar!

322
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:52,222
- Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.

323
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:56,425
And if he were only
here right now...

324
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:00,519
- Toad!
- Angus!

325
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,669
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.

326
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,946
I hope, someday, you'll
find it in your heart...

327
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,843
Not another word.

328
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:17,076
To err is human, to forgive...

329
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,017
Not so fast!

330
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:23,687
You're still guilty in
the eyes of the law.

331
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:29,248
To prove your innocence, we've got
to get that paper away from Winky!

332
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:32,362
Now, I have a plan.

333
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:35,449
We'll sneak in through
the secret tunnel.

334
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,080
<i>It was an expert plan, cunningly
contrived but extremely dangerous.</i>

335
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:46,085
<i>It would work only if each did his
part. There was no margin for error.</i>

336
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:51,231
<i>The odds against them were tremendous,
but the stakes were high.</i>

337
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:59,737
<i>But now, steady's the word...</i>

338
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:06,296
<i>One false move and four
lives hang in the balance.</i>

339
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,715
Careful, lads. There is a guard.

340
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,597
- I'll pop him off!
- Don't shoot!

341
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:22,059
Who goes there?

342
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,000
<i>That was a close one.</i>

343
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:31,380
<i>Trust Toad to start things
off on the wrong foot.</i>

344
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:35,342
<i>No turning back now. Nothing
for it but to push on.</i>

345
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:39,263
<i>What new and greater perils
lay ahead, no one could say.</i>

346
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:44,207
<i>Toad had already got out of
hand, so anything could happen.</i>

347
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:02,093
Look. They're all asleep.

348
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:06,707
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.

349
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,584
But where is Winky?

350
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:10,377
There he is!

351
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:13,088
He's got the paper on him!

352
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:16,823
We'll have to climb
up on the balcony.

353
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,803
The paper! It's gone!

354
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:07,806
Get him, you blokes!

355
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:24,110
I beg your pardon!

356
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:54,230
Over here!

357
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:03,904
After it!

358
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:28,798
- Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!

359
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,370
Where's Moley?

360
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:30,945
Well, laddies, we saved our skins,
but we didn't get the deed.

361
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,309
Well done!

362
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,545
Hip, hip, hooray!

363
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:43,442
<i>So, it was a happy
ending, after all.</i>

364
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:47,696
<i>Toad's friends were dreadfully
proud of him. And why not?</i>

365
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:50,532
<i>He was a new Toad,
completely reformed,</i>

366
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:54,036
<i>through with gypsy carts
and motorcars for ever.</i>

367
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:58,332
<i>And so, on this happiest of New
Years, a toast was in order.</i>

368
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:03,359
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!

369
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:09,524
Hello, you fellows!

370
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:14,098
Come! I'll show you the world.

371
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,950
Travel, change, excitement...

372
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,773
<i>That was the fabulous
Thaddeus Toad.</i>

373
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:25,901
<i>But let's weigh our
judgement carefully,</i>

374
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:30,489
<i>we Moles and Rats and Badgers.
Don't we envy him a bit?</i>

375
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,366
<i>I know I do.</i>

376
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:35,160
<i>When we speak of
fabulous characters,</i>

377
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:38,664
<i>the most fabulous will
always be, to me,</i>

378
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:41,852
<i>the master of Toad Hall.</i>

379
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,757
<i>Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!</i>

380
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:51,218
<i>Speaking of fabulous characters,</i>

381
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,804
<i>England has produced a bumper crop.</i>

382
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:57,953
<i>But here in the colonies,
we have a few of our own.</i>

383
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:01,979
<i>Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,</i>

384
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,022
<i>Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.</i>

385
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:07,443
<i>And, of course, the one
and only Ichabod Crane.</i>

386
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:12,636
<i>Ichy was the country schoolmaster
dreamed up by Washington Irving.</i>

387
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,642
<i>He had a way with a
yarn did Mr Irving.</i>

388
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:26,086
<i>If we could journey back
to that period in history</i>

389
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,756
<i>when Manhattan was
but a market town,</i>

390
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:31,633
<i>we would discover,
in one of the coves</i>

391
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:34,636
<i>which indent the
shores of the Hudson,</i>

392
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:37,347
<i>the little village of Tarry Town.</i>

393
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:41,977
<i>And just beyond, nestled deep
in the low rolling hills,</i>

394
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:44,454
<i>a sequestered glen.</i>

395
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,444
<i>It's a quiet, peaceful place,</i>
<i>and yet, somehow... foreboding.</i>

396
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:52,613
<i>It abounds in haunted spots,</i>

397
00:36:52,614 --> 00:36:56,180
<i>twilight tales and
local superstitions.</i>

398
00:36:56,493 --> 00:37:00,746
<i>The best-known story concerns
an itinerant schoolmaster</i>

399
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:03,499
<i>who once frequented these parts.</i>

400
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:08,396
<i>Some say his melancholy spirit
still haunts the vicinity.</i>

401
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:13,425
<i>The pedagogue was described
as a most unusual man.</i>

402
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:15,469
<i>To see him striding along,</i>

403
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,283
<i>one might mistake him for a
scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.</i>

404
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:24,209
<i>He was tall, but exceedingly lank.</i>

405
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:30,359
<i>His head was small and flat on
top, with a long, snipe nose.</i>

406
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,905
<i>It looked like a weathercock
perched upon his spindle neck.</i>

407
00:37:34,906 --> 00:37:40,549
<i>Altogether, he was an apparition
seldom to be seen in broad daylight.</i>

408
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:49,169
<i>Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,</i>

409
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,731
<i>this strange figure first
approached Sleepy Hollow.</i>

410
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:58,220
<i>As usual, there had gathered</i>

411
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:01,098
<i>at Ye Olde Schnooker
and Schnapps Shoppe</i>

412
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,749
<i>a group of rustic lads,
the Sleepy Hollow boys.</i>

413
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:13,026
<i>Their self-appointed
leader, Brom Bones,</i>

414
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:18,469
<i>was a burly, roistering blade, always
ready for a fight or a frolic.</i>

415
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,667
<i>Though Brom was given to madcap
pranks and practical jokes,</i>

416
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:31,503
<i>there was no malice
in his mischief.</i>

417
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:35,132
<i>With his waggish humour
and prodigious strength,</i>

418
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:39,281
<i>Brom Bones was quite the
hero, all the country round.</i>

419
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:02,015
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!

420
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:05,563
Look at that old spook of spooks.

421
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:15,047
<i>Who's that coming down the street?</i>

422
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,235
<i>Are they shovels or are they feet?</i>

423
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,260
<i>Lean and lanky</i>

424
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:21,929
<i>Skin and bone</i>

425
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,224
<i>With clothes a scarecrow
would hate to own</i>

426
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:28,268
<i>Yet, he has a certain air</i>

427
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:31,271
<i>Debonair and devil-may-care</i>

428
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:33,107
<i>It's the new schoolmaster</i>

429
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:34,566
<i>What's his name?</i>

430
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,235
<i>Ichabod</i>

431
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:38,213
<i>Ichabod Crane</i>

432
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:40,906
<i>What a name!</i>

433
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:42,533
<i>Kind of odd</i>

434
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,868
<i>But nice just the same</i>

435
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:47,891
<i>Funny pan, funny frame</i>

436
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:54,128
<i>Ichabod may be quaint</i>

437
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:57,589
<i>May be odd, and maybe he ain't</i>

438
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,551
<i>Anyway, there's no complaint</i>

439
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:03,443
<i>From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...</i>

440
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:09,601
<i>Though the arrival of the pedagogue
gave rise to mixed emotions,</i>

441
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:13,689
<i>the townspeople all agreed
they'd never seen anyone...</i>

442
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,545
<i>Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane</i>

443
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:24,658
<i>The schoolroom became
Ichabod's empire,</i>

444
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:29,436
<i>over which, with lordly
dignity, he held absolute sway.</i>

445
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:36,670
<i>Truth to say, Ichabod was
a conscientious man,</i>

446
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:41,925
<i>and ever bore in mind the maxim
spare the rod and spoil the child.</i>

447
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:46,013
<i>Still, he was careful
to administer justice</i>

448
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:48,098
<i>with discrimination.</i>

449
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,977
<i>For it behoved him to keep on
good terms with his pupils.</i>

450
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:56,506
<i>Especially if their mothers
happened to be good cooks.</i>

451
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:07,993
<i>Who's the town's ladies' man?</i>

452
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:11,038
<i>Gets around like nobody can</i>

453
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,309
<i>Has to be none other than...</i>

454
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:24,927
<i>As time went by, it may be
seen that the pedagogue</i>

455
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:27,471
<i>got on tolerably enough.</i>

456
00:41:27,472 --> 00:41:32,726
<i>Moreover, Ichabod found ways
to increase his slender income</i>

457
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,728
<i>and, at the same time,</i>

458
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:39,791
<i>awaken the cultural interests
of the sleepy little village.</i>

459
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:38,917
<i>It was inevitable that
a man like Ichabod</i>

460
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:43,172
<i>would become an object of ridicule
to Brom Bones and his gang.</i>

461
00:42:43,173 --> 00:42:46,925
<i>Yet, to Ichabod, these
were small matters.</i>

462
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:50,012
<i>He possessed a
remarkable equanimity</i>

463
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:53,348
<i>which remained quite
undisturbed until</i>

464
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,794
<i>that fateful day, when his
path was crossed by a woman.</i>

465
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:01,336
<i>A certain woman.</i>

466
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:05,444
<i>Katrina Van Tassel, only
child of Baltus Van Tassel,</i>

467
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:08,072
<i>the richest farmer in the county.</i>

468
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:12,076
<i>She was a blooming lass,
plump as a partridge.</i>

469
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:16,521
<i>Ripe, melting and rosy-cheeked.</i>

470
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,618
<i>Once you have met that
little coquette Katrina</i>

471
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:39,077
<i>You won't forget Katrina</i>

472
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:45,208
<i>But nobody yet has
ever upset Katrina</i>

473
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:51,136
<i>That cute coquette Katrina</i>

474
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:56,936
<i>You can do more with
Margaret or Helena</i>

475
00:43:57,956 --> 00:44:02,934
<i>Or Anne or Angelina</i>

476
00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:06,821
<i>But Katrina will kiss and run</i>

477
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,647
<i>To her, a romance is fun</i>

478
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:14,946
<i>With always another one to start</i>

479
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:21,753
<i>And yet when you've met that
little coquette Katrina</i>

480
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:27,333
<i>You've lost your heart</i>

481
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:48,630
<i>There was no doubt the fair Katrina</i>

482
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:52,009
<i>was the richest prize
in the countryside.</i>

483
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,095
<i>The schoolmaster, being
an ambitious man,</i>

484
00:44:55,096 --> 00:44:58,640
<i>began to fill his mind
with many sugared thoughts</i>

485
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,497
<i>and hopeful suppositions.</i>

486
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:06,315
<i>Katrina, my love.</i>

487
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:10,464
<i>Who can resist your grace?
Your charm?</i>

488
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:14,712
<i>And who can resist
your father's farm?</i>

489
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,659
<i>Boy, what a set-up!</i>

490
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,726
<i>There's gold in them
acres, and that ain't hay.</i>

491
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:29,107
<i>Not to mention that
lovely green stuff.</i>

492
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:37,703
<i>Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.</i>

493
00:45:38,515 --> 00:45:40,575
<i>Treasure...</i>

494
00:45:40,683 --> 00:45:42,976
<i>That barn's a gold mine.</i>

495
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:46,462
<i>How I'd love to hit the jackpot.</i>

496
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:52,125
<i>Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.</i>

497
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,363
<i>Papa!</i>

498
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:56,907
<i>The old goat can't
take it with him.</i>

499
00:45:56,908 --> 00:46:00,759
<i>When he cuts out,
that's where I cut in.</i>

500
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:05,807
<i>Sweet Katrina, poor
little rich girl.</i>

501
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:10,523
<i>But don't worry, Katie,
Ichabod will protect you.</i>

502
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:13,606
<i>Yes, Katrina, you've won me.</i>

503
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,324
<i>I surrender.</i>

504
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:26,792
<i>And yet when you've met that
little coquette Katrina</i>

505
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:34,126
<i>You've lost your heart</i>

506
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,742
<i>Every portal to Katrina's
heart was jealously guarded</i>

507
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,494
<i>by a host of rustic admirers.</i>

508
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:46,081
<i>But Ichabod was confident
he'd soon ride roughshod</i>

509
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:49,104
<i>over these simple country bumpkins.</i>

510
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:55,716
<i>But the most formidable obstacle
he had failed to reckon with.</i>

511
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:59,486
<i>That was the redoubtable
Brom Bones.</i>

512
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,394
<i>The ease with which Brom
cleared the field of rivals</i>

513
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:11,129
<i>both piqued and provoked
the fair Katrina.</i>

514
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:16,779
<i>She often wished that some
champion would appear</i>

515
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,094
<i>and take the field openly
against the boisterous Brom.</i>

516
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:07,913
<i>A wiser man would have
shrunk from the competition,</i>

517
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:09,123
<i>but love is blind.</i>

518
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:12,000
<i>Ichabod was aware only
that Dame Fortune</i>

519
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:15,023
<i>was at last thundering at his door.</i>

520
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:55,169
<i>It's true that Brom liked a
joke as well as the next,</i>

521
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,693
<i>but enough was too much.</i>

522
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,790
<i>It was time for open warfare.</i>

523
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,292
<i>He'd double that schoolmaster up</i>

524
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:20,694
<i>and lay him on a shelf
in his schoolhouse!</i>

525
00:50:31,307 --> 00:50:34,874
<i>But this was easier said than done.</i>

526
00:51:08,136 --> 00:51:11,620
<i>No doubt of it, this was
Ichabod's lucky day.</i>

527
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:22,316
<i>The schoolmaster was a
man of hidden talents,</i>

528
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:24,875
<i>a rival to be reckoned with.</i>

529
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:29,656
<i>Still, wars are neither won nor
lost at the first encounter.</i>

530
00:51:29,657 --> 00:51:32,993
<i>The high-flyer might yet
be brought to earth.</i>

531
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:36,845
<i>For Brom Bones was never
a man to cry quits.</i>

532
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:47,007
<i>On the occasion of her father's
annual Halloween frolic,</i>

533
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:51,345
<i>Katrina chose to stir the embers
of the smouldering rivalry.</i>

534
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:56,704
<i>One invitation in particular
carried a most personal summons.</i>

535
00:52:08,113 --> 00:52:12,282
<i>The worthy schoolmaster
was in a transport of joy.</i>

536
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:15,471
<i>To him, this could
mean but one thing.</i>

537
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,956
<i>Ichy, you sly old dog, you!</i>

538
00:52:18,957 --> 00:52:22,642
<i>What is this strange power
you have over women?</i>

539
00:52:22,752 --> 00:52:25,822
<i>Well, tonight's the night, boy!</i>

540
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:29,466
<i>Just turn on the old charm.</i>

541
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:33,236
<i>The fair Katrina is
yours for the asking.</i>

542
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:43,814
<i>Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted
on a horse he had borrowed,</i>

543
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:47,276
<i>Ichabod issued forth like
a knight errant of old</i>

544
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:50,084
<i>to keep a tryst with his lady fair.</i>

545
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:00,164
<i>There was nothing to
equal the merrymaking</i>

546
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:02,833
<i>at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.</i>

547
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:07,296
<i>To Ichabod, here was a perfect
field for his endeavours.</i>

548
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:10,632
<i>How would he put his
best foot forward!</i>

549
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:15,991
<i>Beyond all his other talents, he
prided himself upon his dancing.</i>

550
00:53:17,974 --> 00:53:20,768
<i>Unhappy Brom, already
bested at every turn,</i>

551
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:24,039
<i>saw himself once more outmatched.</i>

552
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:27,274
<i>For as he watched the
posturing pedagogue,</i>

553
00:53:27,275 --> 00:53:30,986
<i>he had to admit that here
was a flawless picture</i>

554
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:33,759
<i>of ease and grace.</i>

555
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:13,315
<i>There was no doubt that Ichabod
was the man of the hour.</i>

556
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:16,985
<i>Brom had to concede his
rival another victory.</i>

557
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:20,823
<i>Yet, there was still a
chance his time would come.</i>

558
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:25,452
<i>For when the hour grew late, Van
Tassel would call on his guests</i>

559
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:28,580
<i>to tell him ghostly
tales of Halloween.</i>

560
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:31,917
<i>Brom knew there was no
more potent believer</i>

561
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:36,779
<i>in spooks and goblins
than Ichabod Crane.</i>

562
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:46,098
Just gather round
and I'll elucidate

563
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:49,101
what goes on outside,
when it gets late.

564
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:52,729
Around about midnight,
the ghosts and banshees

565
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,441
get together for nightly jamborees.

566
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:58,110
Things with horns and saucer eyes,

567
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,447
and some with fangs
about this size!

568
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:04,116
- Some are fat.
- And some are thin!

569
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:07,119
And some don't even
wear their skin!

570
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,706
I'm telling you, brother,
it's a frightful sight

571
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:13,146
what goes on, Halloween night.

572
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:21,216
<i>When spooks have a
midnight jamboree</i>

573
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:24,136
<i>They break it up with fiendish glee</i>

574
00:57:24,137 --> 00:57:27,181
<i>Ghosts are bad, but
the one that's cursed</i>

575
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:30,434
<i>Is the Headless Horseman,
he's the worst</i>

576
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:33,604
<i>That's right, he's a
fright on Halloween night</i>

577
00:57:33,605 --> 00:57:37,149
<i>When he goes a-joggin'
across the land</i>

578
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,069
<i>Holdin' his noggin in his hand</i>

579
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,072
<i>Demons take one look and groan</i>

580
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:46,075
<i>And hit the road for parts unknown</i>

581
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:49,119
<i>Beware, take care, he rides alone</i>

582
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,372
<i>And there's no spook like
a spook who's spurned</i>

583
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:55,334
<i>They don't like him and
he's really burned</i>

584
00:57:55,335 --> 00:57:58,629
<i>He swears to the
longest day he's dead</i>

585
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,363
<i>He'll show them that
he can get ahead</i>

586
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:06,929
<i>They say he's tired
of his flamin' top</i>

587
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,572
<i>He's got a yen to make a swap</i>

588
00:58:09,682 --> 00:58:12,643
<i>So he rides one night each year</i>

589
00:58:12,644 --> 00:58:15,687
<i>To find a head in the hollow here</i>

590
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:19,208
<i>Now, he likes them little,
he likes them big</i>

591
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:22,194
<i>Part in the middle, or a wig</i>

592
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:25,072
<i>Black or white, or even red</i>

593
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:28,117
<i>The Headless Horseman needs a head</i>

594
00:58:28,118 --> 00:58:31,286
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

595
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:34,331
<i>He's out lookin' for a top to chop</i>

596
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:37,584
<i>So don't stop to figure out a plan</i>

597
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:42,564
<i>You can't reason
with a headless man</i>

598
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:46,910
Now, if you doubt this tale is so,

599
00:58:47,011 --> 00:58:49,972
I met that spook just a year ago.

600
00:58:49,973 --> 00:58:52,683
Now, I didn't stop
for a second look,

601
00:58:52,684 --> 00:58:56,019
but made for the bridge
that spans the brook.

602
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,939
For once you cross that
bridge, my friends

603
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,734
<i>The ghost is through,
his power ends</i>

604
00:59:01,735 --> 00:59:04,820
<i>So, when you're riding home tonight</i>

605
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:07,823
<i>Make for the bridge
with all your might</i>

606
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:10,701
<i>He'll be down in the hollow there</i>

607
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:12,161
<i>He needs your head</i>

608
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:13,829
<i>Look out! Beware!</i>

609
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,665
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

610
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,835
<i>He's out lookin' for a head to swap</i>

611
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:22,838
<i>So don't try to figure out a plan</i>

612
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:28,743
<i>You can't reason
with a headless man</i>

613
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:40,960
<i>It was the witching hour of night
as Ichabod pursued his travel home.</i>

614
00:59:41,149 --> 00:59:42,733
<i>The sky grew darker.</i>

615
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:46,236
<i>One by one, the stars
winked out their lights.</i>

616
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:50,074
<i>Driving clouds obscured
the moon from sight.</i>

617
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:54,203
<i>Never had the schoolmaster
felt so melancholy,</i>

618
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:56,789
<i>so utterly alone.</i>

619
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:59,792
<i>The nearer he
approached the hollow,</i>

620
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:02,481
<i>the more dismal he became.</i>

621
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:49,174
<i>Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's
anxiety increased one-hundredfold.</i>

622
01:00:49,175 --> 01:00:52,886
<i>The forest seemed to
close in behind him.</i>

623
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:56,598
<i>Every small detail of
Brom's awful story</i>

624
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,084
<i>returned to haunt his recollection.</i>

625
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,025
Headless Horseman.

626
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,771
Beware!

627
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,506
<i>Once you cross that
bridge, my friends,</i>

628
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:43,525
<i>the ghost is through,
his power ends.</i>

629
01:06:48,827 --> 01:06:52,761
<i>Next morning, Ichabod's
hat was found.</i>

630
01:06:52,914 --> 01:06:56,897
<i>And close beside it,
a shattered pumpkin.</i>

631
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:01,109
<i>But there was no trace
of the schoolmaster.</i>

632
01:07:04,968 --> 01:07:10,279
<i>Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones led
the fair Katrina to the altar.</i>

633
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:14,726
<i>Rumours persisted that
Ichabod was still alive,</i>

634
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:18,294
<i>married to a wealthy widow
in a distant county.</i>

635
01:07:18,398 --> 01:07:22,943
<i>But the good Dutch settlers
refused to believe such nonsense.</i>

636
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:26,613
<i>They knew the schoolmaster
had been spirited away</i>

637
01:07:26,614 --> 01:07:29,007
<i>by the Headless Horseman.</i>

638
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,164
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

639
01:07:35,165 --> 01:07:38,041
<i>He's out looking for a head to swap</i>

640
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:41,211
<i>But don't try to figure out a plan</i>

641
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:48,908
<i>You can't reason
with a headless man</i>

642
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:53,156
<i>Man, I'm getting out of here!</i>
