Why, you're just a

You can call me Jiminy.

00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,916
Sorry!

87
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,319
Howdy, chum.

88
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,553
Why so glum?

89
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,943
Say, what's the matter?

90
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,594
You worried about somethin' too?

91
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,599
Never saw such a dismal pair.

92
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,883
A deadpan doll...

93
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,704
and a droopy bear.

94
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:21,332
You ought to try my recipe.

95
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,072
Be full of fun and fancy-free.

96
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:28,982
Life is a song... happy, gay.

97
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:33,242
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?

98
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:40,063
"Bongo"? Now, what in
the world is Bongo?

99
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:43,667
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."

100
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,333
Well, what are we waitin' for?

101
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,890
A ringer!

102
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,527
It's a gift.

103
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:11,432
Take it away, Dinah!

104
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,574
This is the story...

105
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:20,677
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.

106
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:24,248
The mama bear, the papa bear,
and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.

107
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,584
But it's not the story you expect.

108
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:29,254
This is a love story.

109
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,958
It's about a little girl bear...

110
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,528
and a big, burly,
brawny brown bear...

111
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,799
who wanted very much
to be her boyfriend.

112
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,505
But mostly, this is
a story about Bongo.

113
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,740
He was a circus bear.

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,778
He was born in the circus,
grew up in the circus.

115
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:54,174
In fact, Bongo was
the star of the circus.

116
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,955
Why, he could juggle and dance
while on a trapeze,

117
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,691
walk a tightrope with
the greatest of ease.

118
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,328
In jujitsu,
he was beyond compare.

119
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,564
Once threw a bull
at the county fair.

120
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:09,000
Super at wrestling
and lifting weights.

121
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,032
Outboxed the champs
of 17 states.

122
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:19,513
They all packed in
from near and far...

123
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,816
to see this death-defying star.

124
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,220
With mouths wide open,
they watched his ascent...

125
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,148
as he daringly climbed
to the top of the tent!

126
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,435
Then, for a grand climax,

127
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:42,807
he would gracefully
plunge 300 feet...

128
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:46,168
into a wet sponge!

129
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:04,197
Poor Bongo.

130
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,977
Naturally, you'd think
he'd be handled with kid gloves,

131
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,648
treated like a king...

132
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,882
and pampered like a baby.

133
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:25,552
But, no! He was tossed
around like an old shoe.

134
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:31,222
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.

135
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,407
His thoughts would wander
to an imaginary life...

136
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,843

"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,

203
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,641
"this is the stuff."

204
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,287

a canopy of stars...

"studding the velvet
softness of the night.

To sleep in the peace and
quiet of the woods."

207
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:48,648
The stillness of the night
descends like a sheltering veil.

208
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:52,750
Hush. All nature sleeps.

209
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,681
Then came the dawn.

210
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:50,999
Ohh. Bongo felt as
stiff as a board...

211
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,631
and as cranky as an old bear.

212
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,787
Bongo was discouraged.

213
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,892
A fine kind of bear
he'd turned out to be!

214
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,821
He didn't even know
how to act like a bear.

215
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:27,776
This rough, rugged
stuff wasn't for him.

216
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,568
Especially on an empty stomach.

217

No talk, no laughs, no chatter.

00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:34,932
With the trees shaking, the ground
quaking, the crowd began to scatter.

261
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:39,863
Out of his lair came the third
bear, with murder in his eye.

262
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,711
He took in the scene of love
serene with jealousy and surprise.

263
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,848
He was the roughest,
toughest, meanest bear.

264
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:52,141
Lump jaw by name,
a villain for fair.

265
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:07,336
Well... what's this?

266
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:13,978

Gosh, Bongo was surprised.

274
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:14,973
Why should Lulubelle
turn against him?

275
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,110
That was no way
for a lady to act.

276
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,071
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.

278
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:38,602

Now who says dreams
don't come true? Well!

353
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:36,840
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.

Oh, dear. Nanny goats

371
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,270
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.

372
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,341
Tell me, what is the secret
of your lovely complexion?

373
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:48,679
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.

374
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:51,249
Yes. If I'm not being too
personal, Ophelia...

375
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,518
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?

376
00:38:53,618 --> 00:38:56,387
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?

377
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,391
- Yes.
- And how old is that?

378
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,494
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.

379
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,629
I thought you were a little
bit older than that.

380
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:05,566
Well, I knocked off a few years
for good behavior.

381
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,902
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff.

382
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:10,290
Well, we're awfully glad
you came to our party.

383
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,610
- Well.
- Did you have fun?

384
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,169
Oh, yes, indeedy.

385
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,745
I thought Charlie made a pig of himself
with that chocolate cake.

386
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:19,282
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.

387
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:20,783
Yes, I agree with you.

388
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:24,155
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.

389
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:27,592
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?

390
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:31,464
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...

391
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,366
Uh, bunny, bunny wee,
bunny wee. Bun...

392
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:36,656
I don't know no bunny wee.

393
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:38,906
I don't know no bunny wee.

394
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,441
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.

395
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,712
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?

396
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:46,948
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?

397
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:50,287
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!

398
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,255
Help, he...

399
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:55,125
Isn't that a wonderful trick?

400
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,839
Yes, it is. Yes.

401
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,029
I wish I could enjoy
my first childhood...

402
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,332
as much as he does
his second.

403
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,495
Now, Luana, how would you like
another piece of cake

404
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:05,737
or some ice cream?

405
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,840
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?

406
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,580
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?

407
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
How about you, Mortimer?

408
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:17,103
Mortimer?

409
00:40:17,404 --> 00:40:18,920
I don't smoke.

410
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,448
I don't mean that.

411
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:22,775
Well, what shall we do now?
Any suggestions?

412
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,919
How would you like
to go down to the city dump

413
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,091
and watch me slug rats?

414
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,655
- Certainly not.
- No?

415
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,632
How would you like to
hear me tell a story?

416
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:32,269
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?

417
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:36,473
Well, I, uh...
Y-y-yeah... no.

418
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:38,577
This is a story that
everyone should know.

419
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:40,728
Yes, but not everyone
should tell it.

420
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:41,847
And you know who.

421
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,490
Well, I'm going to
tell it anyway.

422
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,051
Now, many, many years ago...

423
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,953
I think I'll run out
and wind a sundial.

424
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,989
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,993
Once upon a time, long, long ago...

426
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:54,862
Funny, nothing ever
happens nowadays.

427
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:57,165
There was a place
called Happy Valley.

428
00:40:57,265 --> 00:40:59,167
Now, it was called Happy Valley...

429
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:01,496
because everyone
who lived there...

430
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:03,006
was happy.

431
00:41:03,205 --> 00:41:06,011
No! Well, there's
a hunk of logic for you.

432
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:07,811
Are you listening, Mortimer?

433
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:12,050
- Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.

434
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,850
Now just try and imagine it.

435
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,187
Can't you just close your eyes
and see it?

436
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:20,092
Well, I can't see very good
with my eyes closed.

437
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,694
My eyelids get in the way.

438
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:24,398
You create a picture
in your mind's eye.

439
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:29,070
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.

440
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,207
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.

441
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:35,144
I... I painted a barn once, I did.

442
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,247
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.

443
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:39,820
It was... It was a red barn.
It was. Yeah.

444
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,983
Well, forget the barn.

445
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,153
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.

446
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,856
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.

447
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:48,125
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll work on it.

448
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:50,762
Let's see...
Let's see, now.

449
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:54,367
It's... Oh, let's say
it's about...

450
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,469
Uh, what was the question?

451
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,206
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

452
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:02,109
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!

453
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:04,946
Yeah.

454
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:08,044
Let's see, uh...

455
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,624
Oh, I'm tired.
All that work for nothin'.

456
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:18,588
- Can I try?
- Certainly.

457
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:23,501
Yes. I think
I can see it, Mr. Bergen.

458
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,838
It's beautiful.

459
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:28,874
Yes, it was one of
nature's garden spots,

460
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:32,078
nestled among
the green, rolling hills.

461
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:34,981
Can't you see the lovely brook
as it flows through the valley?

462
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:37,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:41,088
The winding roads,
lined with stately trees.

464
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:43,091
Trees. Yeah.

465
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:46,529
Lush fields and prosperous
farms dot the landscape.

466
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,531
L-Landscape. Yeah.

467
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,934
And high on a hilltop
overlooking the valley,

468
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:54,238
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.

469
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,774
No, no. It was
something much nicer.

470
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,442
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.

471
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,616

kept within these castle walls.

Yes, the voice of
this golden harp...

500
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:27,349
cast a magic spell of joy and
prosperity over the valley.

501
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:30,953
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.

502
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:33,222
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.

503
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:34,322
No, no.

504
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:37,637
One day a mysterious shadow
crept over the valley.

505
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,810
And then something
dreadful happened!

506
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,425
What happened?

507
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:54,362
When the shadow lifted,
the golden harp was gone.

508
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:58,234
No longer was the valley happy,
for without the magic of the harp,

509
00:44:58,334 --> 00:45:02,572
all was misery, misery, misery.

510
00:45:02,672 --> 00:45:04,808
Just like the eighth grade.

511
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:06,843
Desolation spread over the land.

512
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,112
Everything was drying up.

513
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:11,516
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?

514
00:45:11,616 --> 00:45:13,519
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,090
The fields of golden
corn turned to dust.

516
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,092
Kerplop.

517
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:22,384
The laughing brook flowed no more.

518
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:29,470
To think that this was
once Happy Valley!

519
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,473
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.

520
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:34,509
Days pass, weeks pass.

521
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,281
I pass. New deal.

522
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:40,084
What happened to all the people?

523
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,553
Well, suppose we look in
on these humble peasants.

524
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:45,890
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.

525
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,093
Well, at least they had milk.

526
00:45:48,193 --> 00:45:50,696
Well, she used to be a
good milker. But now...

527
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,599
She's an udder failure.

528
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:57,237
She was the bosom friend
of a once-proud family.

529
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,028
Well, they're certainly out
of the high rent district.

530
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,746
And there they are,

531
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:08,917
three poor farmers, gripped
by the pangs of starvation.

532
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,588
Still alive, still breathing,

533
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:14,257
sharing a pitiful
crust between them.

534
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:17,595
Share and share alike.

535
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:21,932
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.

536
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:24,269
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.

537
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:26,638
But are their spirits broken?

538
00:46:26,738 --> 00:46:28,708
Have they lost hope?

539
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:33,614
Yes. Men facing famine,
naught left but beans.

540
00:46:33,714 --> 00:46:36,884
Ahem. Bean, you mean.

541
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:39,654
If it were one man
and three beans...

542
00:46:39,754 --> 00:46:43,926
But, no. One bean and three men.

543
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:46,962
Well, at least there
are no bones in it.

544
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:49,398
Just look at that
miserable creature,

545
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:52,169
doggedly struggling
to maintain life,

546
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:55,873
a gaunt, lean bag of
bones and feathers.

547
00:46:55,973 --> 00:46:59,211
Truly a picture of despair.

548
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:02,481
But Donald doesn't whimper.

549
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,552
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!

550
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:08,320
I can't stand it!

551
00:47:12,693 --> 00:47:15,953
Easy, Donald. Easy!

552
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:22,071
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.

553
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,508
I... I'll be all right.

554
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,377
Yeah. I'll be all right.

555
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,736
I'll be all right.

556
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,891
He says he's all
right, but I wonder.

557
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,360
He's suffered too much.

558
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,732
What diabolical thought is being
hatched in the fevered brain...

559
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:47,592
of this poor, demented duck?

560
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:52,599
Donald! No! No!

561
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:57,144
Nice bossy, bossy.

562
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:03,077
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!

563
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:09,227
Donald! No, Donald!

564
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:14,397
Give it here! Let me...

565
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:20,741
I just gotta eat.

566
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:22,743
I'm so... hungry.

567
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:24,846
The little fellow was
completely out of his head.

568
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:27,348
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.

569
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:32,255
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!

570
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:36,053
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...

571
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:37,428
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.

572
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:40,331
Oh, it was a sorry
predicament indeed.

573
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,900
What to do? What to do?

574
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,378
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's
got the right idea. Kill the cow.

575
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:50,810
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow
was their best friend.

576
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,380
Well, a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

577
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,984
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.

578
00:48:57,084 --> 00:49:00,021
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,

579
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:03,358
I don't wanna hear
the rest of the story.

580
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,528
Well, she wouldn't have to know.

581
00:49:05,628 --> 00:49:07,432
They could sneak up on her
and surprise her.

582
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:08,554
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

583
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,301
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.

584
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:13,670
We'll get a stranglehold
on her while she's asleep.

585
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,309
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!

586
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:20,778
I ain't a-gonna listen
to the story.

587
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,984
Well, it'll be your fault
if they starve to death.

588
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:27,153
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.

589
00:49:27,253 --> 00:49:29,339
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place,

590
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,658
and save a lot of time?

591
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:34,095
I could save a lot of time
by not telling the story at all!

592
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:37,331
Your idea is not without merit.

593
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,302
Well, back to the
scene of desolation.

594
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:42,571
Things are beginning to
look much brighter now,

595
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,410
because as Mickey goes
to the village to sell the cow,

596
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:46,976
the thought of prosperity...

597
00:49:47,076 --> 00:49:49,647
brings new hope
to the famished farmers.

598
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:53,218
Even Donald has fully recovered,
for soon their long-empty plates...

599
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:55,220
will overflow with food.

600
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,825
Hey, look! ♪ Turkey,
lobster sweet potato pie ♪

601
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:03,162
♪ Pancakes piled up
'til they reach the sky ♪

602
00:50:09,336 --> 00:50:11,172
♪ I wanna eat and eat
and eat and eat ♪

603
00:50:11,272 --> 00:50:13,208
♪ And eat until I die ♪

604
00:50:13,308 --> 00:50:16,011
♪ Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie ♪

605
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:19,449
♪ Pancakes piled up
'til they reach the sky ♪

606
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,451
♪ Lots of starches
Lots of greens ♪

607
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,388
♪ Fancy chocolate-covered... ♪

608
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,639
Beans!

609
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,156
- What d'you mean, beans?
- Yeah, fellows.

610
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:31,329
I sold the cow for
some magic beans!

611
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,833
Beans!

612
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,438
But Donald!

613
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:41,108
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!

614
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:45,113
If you plant these beans in the light of
a full moon, do you know what'll happen?

615
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:48,350
Yes! We get more beans!

616
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,712
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!

617
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,691
Poor Mickey,

618
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:58,795
cheated into trading his cow
for a handful of beans.

619
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,598
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!

620
00:51:01,698 --> 00:51:05,004
Swindling an innocent farmer
out of all he owned...

621
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:09,070
and lying to him, telling him
that the beans were magic.

622
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:12,846
Planted in the light
of a full moon!

623
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:16,449
What a shame to deceive a
simple little peasant.

624
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:18,953
Magic beans, indeed!

625
00:51:19,053 --> 00:51:21,589
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!

626
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:24,159
- What?
- There's something moving.

627
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:28,364
Why, yes. Well, maybe there
is some magic in them!

628
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:31,725
All right, now let's all keep
quiet and see what happens.

629
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:12,022
Mmm.

630
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:48,405
And all through the night, it grew,

631
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,575
onward and upward.

632
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:53,673
That thing is a menace to aviation.

633
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,684
And so, with the coming of dawn,

634
00:53:57,784 --> 00:54:01,121
we find the bewildered farmers
staring at a mammoth castle,

635
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,123
miles above the earth.

636
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:06,827
Their curiosity was aroused,
nothing could hold them back.

637
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:09,964
Who lives there? Man or monster?

638
00:54:10,064 --> 00:54:12,968
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?

639
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,970
Well, search me.

640
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,107
What drew them toward
this place of mystery?

641
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:20,310
Hunger? Desperation?

642
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,846
Or perhaps it was
love of adventure.

643
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:26,217
What a fantastic experience,
perhaps mortal man...

644
00:54:26,317 --> 00:54:29,521
has never before set foot
on this strange land.

645
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:33,793
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?

646
00:54:33,893 --> 00:54:36,096
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.

647
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:40,534
Soon they reached the moat
surrounding the castle.

648
00:54:40,734 --> 00:54:42,241
But this didn't stop them.

649
00:54:42,442 --> 00:54:45,740
On they went, as if drawn
by some irresistible force.

650
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,345
And then, suddenly, without
warning, out of the sky above...

651
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:51,481
Ooh, dragonflies!

652
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:55,752
Yeah. A-flyin' front
and draggin' behind.

653
00:54:55,852 --> 00:55:00,422
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!

654
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:19,276
Come back and fight!

655
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:52,952
Finally, they reached the castle.

656
00:55:54,154 --> 00:55:56,288
The hard way.

657
00:55:59,828 --> 00:56:02,230
This was the biggest
adventure of their lives.

658
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:06,103
Forgotten was their hunger,
forgotten was their fear.

659
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:09,206
It took courage to scale
these massive steps,

660
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:12,110
to make this journey
into the unknown.

661
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:15,280
But these stouthearted
lads never faltered.

662
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,750
Three minds with but
a single thought.:

663
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:21,487
What mystery lurked within
those cold, forbidding walls?

664
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:25,224
What strange spell hovered
over this gloomy place?

665
00:56:27,995 --> 00:56:29,897
Will no one answer?

666
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:33,101
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?

667
00:56:33,201 --> 00:56:36,405
You know, you could stand
some rehearsal on this story.

668
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:40,109
Inside, the tremendous hall
was as silent as a tomb.

669
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:42,979
Not a sign of life anywhere.

670
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:44,982
Caught with his pants...

671
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:46,984
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...

672
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,787
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.

673
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:51,790
They gazed in speechless wonder,

674
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,793
almost afraid to breathe.

675
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:56,329
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?

676
00:56:56,429 --> 00:56:59,531
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!

677
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:20,429
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?

678
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:23,095
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!

679
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,303
How'd you get here?

680
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,973
I was kidnapped by
that wicked giant!

681
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,811
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!

682
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:35,013
- A giant?
- A giant!

683
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:38,017
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!

684
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:42,288
An ogre who had the power to turn
himself into anything, man or beast.

685
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,523
That calls for a drink.

686
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:51,533
It was this heartless monster that
swooped down under cover of darkness,

687
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:53,590
carried off the golden harp and...

688
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,904
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!

689
00:59:02,045 --> 00:59:05,516
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.

690
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:08,820
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.

691
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,324
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.

692
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,494
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.

693
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:18,464
- No.
- No? Ten men?

694
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:21,501
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?

695
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,240
I don't know. I guess it's just
a stage I'm goin' through.

696
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,242
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!

697
00:59:27,342 --> 00:59:29,444
Now go over there and
behave yourself.

698
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:31,447
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.

699
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:34,417
But why did the giant
want to steal the harp?

700
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:38,055
Because he was cruel and selfish. He
didn't care what happened to the valley.

701
00:59:38,155 --> 00:59:40,057
He just wanted someone
to sing him to sleep.

702
00:59:40,157 --> 00:59:42,526
Well, why didn't he
turn on the radio?

703
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,562
Well, they didn't have
radios in those days.

704
00:59:44,662 --> 00:59:48,067
Yeah. That's why they
called it Happy Valley.

705
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,204
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...

706
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:53,529
Oh... I'll try and show you.

707
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:08,580
He looked something like this.

708
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:14,398
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.

709
01:00:14,498 --> 01:00:18,003
Never mind the
self-portraits. Ha-ha.

710
01:00:18,103 --> 01:00:20,405
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like...

711
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,407
more like this.

712
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:26,437
There he is now. And the giant
came home for dinner, roaring...

713
01:00:26,537 --> 01:00:29,316
- Drunk.
- I was not!

714
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,131
- I mean, he was not.
- No.

715
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:34,460
Down the castle hall
he came, roaring...

716
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,193
Fe, fi, fo, fum!

717
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:40,696

Wait. He may be smarter
than he looks.

734
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,886
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.

735
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,557
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.

736
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:33,559
Well, don't tell him!

737
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:36,657
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!

738
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:41,668

Oh, no, you don't!

747
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,450
You can't get away
from Willie.

748
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,885
I gotcha!

749
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:28,255
I think I gotcha.

750
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,995
Yeah, I gotcha.

751
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:33,997
Willie.

752
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:36,066
What?

753
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,002
He'll have to talk fast
to get out of this one.

754
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:40,337
Well, you leave it
to Mickey. Just watch.

755
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:44,234
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!

756
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:48,347
But what's this here?

757
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:50,316
What is it? What is it!

758
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:53,353
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!

759
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:56,690
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here...

760
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,627
that you can change
yourself into anything!

761
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:01,729
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?

762
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:06,035
I can change myself
into the darndest things!

763
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:09,573
Go on, gimme somethin'.

764
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:12,410
- Anything!
- Anything?

765
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,346
Anything.

766
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:18,383
See? Mickey never misses a trick.

767
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:20,619
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...

768
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:22,721
Can you change into a fly?

769
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:27,393
A cute, teeny-weeny,
itsy-bitsy housefly?

770
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:30,063
That's it. A housefly.

771
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:33,001
Aw, you don't want a fly.

772
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:37,473
How about a bunny
with long, pink ears?

773
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:40,443
Ha. Well, of course,
if you can't do a fly, why, uh...

774
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,513
All right. A fly.

775
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:47,217
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...

776
01:03:47,317 --> 01:03:49,920
- Because.
- Okay.

777
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,926
A teeny-weeny fly.

778
01:03:55,026 --> 01:03:57,251
With pink wings.

779
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:00,200
Now for the magic wordies.

780
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,503

782
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:12,447

want a pink bunny?

783
01:04:12,547 --> 01:04:15,083
Hey, what is this?

784
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:17,682
You think you fool Willie.

785
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:24,930
Yeah, a couple more good ideas
like that and they're finished.

786
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,599
Well, I'll admit the little
fellows are in a bad fix.

787
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:29,935
But Mickey isn't one to
give up without a struggle.

788
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:32,939
And with a little luck,
they may still pull through.

789
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,107
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.

790
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:38,812
Anybody wanna buy
a tall, thin mouse?

791
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:41,376
No, thank you.
Uh, I mean no.

792
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:45,320
Yes, things look pretty
dark for the prisoners.

793
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,690
Looks like their goose is cooked.

794
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,225
Oh, Fate may yet deal
them a winning hand.

795
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:52,988
Don't forget,
there's still the magic harp.

796
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,098
She knows the giant's weakness.

797
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:57,769
She could be my weakness.

798
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,671
There might still be
a chance of escape...

799
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,921
if she could only use
her magic voice

800
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:04,509
to put the giant to sleep.

801
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,078
If she can't,
I know who can.

802
01:05:07,878 --> 01:05:10,078

Where is he?

824
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:30,110
Hello?

825
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,117
Nightmare.

826
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:53,539
Oh, boy.

827
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:02,283
- He made it!
- He did?

828
01:08:02,383 --> 01:08:06,987
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!

829
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:12,496
Well, it looks like
success at last.

830
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,099
Free from the clutches
of that terrible monster.

831
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,037
And now to find
the beanstalk,

832
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:19,538
climb down and
return home in triumph,

833
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:22,107
with a big surprise
for Happy Valley.

834
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:25,211
But wait... Mickey's going
to make doubly sure.

835
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:27,780
He's taking no chances.

836
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,517
Just in case the giant
might wake up.

837
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:37,223
Should have left
well enough alone.

838
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,599
Come back here!
Come back here!

839
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,344
And there goes the giant!

840
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:58,589
He's helpless now, tumbling
over and over and over,

841
01:09:58,789 --> 01:10:02,848
down, down, down, down.

842
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:08,467
And so with the passing
of the wicked giant,

843
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:12,706
Happy Valley echoed once again
with song and laughter.

844
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,908
For with the return
of the magic harp,

845
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:17,712
peace and prosperity reigned
throughout the land.

846
01:10:17,812 --> 01:10:20,248
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.

847
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:22,717
Lived happily ever after.

848
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:26,789
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?

849
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,024
Simply thrilling.

850
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:33,663
You're even better than the
old-fashioned sleeping pill.

851
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:36,566
What's the matter, Mortimer?

852
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:41,540
Oh, the poor giant got
killed, that he did.

853
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,411
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.

854
01:10:45,511 --> 01:10:48,248
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.

855
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:52,153
He just got too big
for his britches.

856
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:56,457
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.

857
01:10:56,657 --> 01:10:58,461
I'll be all right.

858
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:01,663
Oh, excuse me.

859
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,514
What I'm trying
to explain, Mortimer,

860
01:11:03,615 --> 01:11:06,142
is that Willie the Giant
didn't actually exist.

861
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:07,351
- No?
- No.

862
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:10,960
He's a metaphysical phenomenon
of your subconscious mind,

863
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:13,912
a phantasmagoria of
your mental faculties.

864
01:11:14,012 --> 01:11:15,859
- Yeah?
- In other words,

865
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,050
just a figment of
your imagination.

866
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,452
- No!
- Yes.

867
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:23,090
So there's nothing
to be upset about.

868
01:11:27,395 --> 01:11:30,198
Hey! Has anybody seen anything...

869
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:33,302
of a teensy-weensy little mouse?

870
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:36,505
No. I-I-I, uh...

871
01:11:36,605 --> 01:11:39,008
Oh, Mr. Bergen!

872
01:11:39,108 --> 01:11:42,712
Bergen, speak to me.
Speak to me.

873
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:46,250
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?

874
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:49,987
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig...

875
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:52,725
fig-a-mentation of his imagination.

876
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:55,394
- No!
- Yeah.

877
01:11:55,494 --> 01:11:58,732
Well, uh, good night, Willie.

878
01:11:58,832 --> 01:12:01,735
Uh, don't slam the roof.

879
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:03,263
