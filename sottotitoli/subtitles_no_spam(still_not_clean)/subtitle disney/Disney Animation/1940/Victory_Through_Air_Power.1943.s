00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000

1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,815
Here is the most unusual feature film
Walt Disney ever made.

2
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:09,048
A film intended not so much to entertain,

3
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:11,022
but to send a message.

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,685
Walt, like many people,
was impressed by the text

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,921
of a book called
Victory Through Air Power,

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:18,692
written by Major Alexander P. De Seversky.

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,700
In it, this Russian born
naturalized American citizen,

8
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:26,000
who became a key figure in
the advancement of U.S. military aviation,

9
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:28,871
called for an overhaul of our priorities.

10
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,672
He was convinced that
the only way to win the war

11
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:33,610
was to focus our energies

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,376
on creating long-range bomber planes.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,613
Remember that when this film
was released in 1943,

14
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:42,951
victory in Europe and the Pacific
was far from certain.

15
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:45,048
...spearhead of short-range aviation,

16
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,720
pushed step by step through the Balkans.

17
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,253
There was no end in sight
and our losses were tremendous.

18
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,028
Walt believed in the principles
of Seversky's book.

19
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:58,868
And felt it was his patriotic duty
to spread the word.

20
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,601
By making a Technicolor feature film
about the subject,

21
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,609
with limited commercial potential,

22
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,645
in the midst of many other wartime duties,

23
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:09,341
Walt quite simply put his money
where his mouth was.

24
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,852
The message Seversky delivers,
quite convincingly in this film,

25
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,581
isn't about aggression or warmongering.

26
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,646
It's about winning a war against enemies

27
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,658
who were bent on world domination.

28
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,660
A war America stayed out of,

29
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:25,323
until we were attacked
without provocation at Pearl Harbor.

30
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,367
That's the historical context

31
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,459
that gives meaning to this film today.

32
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,663
For animation buffs,
it's yet another example

33
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:33,672
of how skillfully the Disney artists

34
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,208
adapted their visual
storytelling techniques

35
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,176
to a deadly serious purpose.

36
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,509
And how successful they were.

37
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:44,146
In the introductory history of aviation,

38
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,650
there's room for humor.

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,653
Even in the later sections of the film,

40
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,450
there's tremendous creativity.

41
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:53,755
From the staging of battle scenes and
explosions to the use of visual metaphors.

42
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,261
To make sure Major Seversky
made his presentation

43
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,263
as persuasively as possible,

44
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,731
Walt hired a professional director,

45
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,668
a man of long experience
on stage and in Hollywood,

46
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,968
H.C. Potter,
to film these lecture segments.

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,974
Potter's many movie credits include

48
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,033
Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,

49
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,375
The Farmer's Daughter, Hell's A'Poppin',

50
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,415
and the story of Vernon and Irene Castle.

51
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,781
But more importantly,
he was a flier himself,

52
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,446
and already acquainted with its star.

53
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,648
He certainly did his job well in this movie,

54
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,850
because Seversky comes off quite well,

55
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,588
and doesn't seem stiff or severe.

56
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:32,792
When I interviewed Mr. Potter years ago,
he had fond memories of Seversky,

57
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:35,164
whom he knew as Sasha.
But he also remembered

58
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,362
he had to shoot
those sequences at night

59
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:39,962
because Walt didn't have
sufficient soundproofing

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,067
to drown out the noise
from Lockheed Aircraft nearby.

61
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:47,307
Potter's approach was to make
Seversky's speeches seem as far

62
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,813
from a lecture as possible.

63
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,510
So he gave him lots of movement
and other suggestions

64
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,383
to make the speeches seem
as casual as possible.

65
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:58,015
He especially remembered one night,
when Sasha couldn't hit his marks,

66
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,855
the places where the camera and
lighting were set up for him.

67
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,521
He said, "Hank,
how can I remember the words,

68
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:07,363
"the expression, the meaning,
the walking without limping,"

69
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,834
because he had one wooden leg,
"and hit these marks,

70
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,269
"and think of what I'm saying
at the same time?"

71
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,899
Potter replied,
"When you're flying airplanes,

72
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,307
"you're flying a plane, you're navigating,

73
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,311
"you're looking at the ground
to see if you're going

74
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,142
"where you're supposed to be going.

75
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,478
"You're listening to the radio,
watching for other planes,

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,178
"and checking your instruments,
all at the same time. "

77
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,778
He concluded in a mock Russian accent,

78
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:32,052
"Your model should be,
'Dewide the attention'."

79
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,286
Seversky loved that, and from that time on

80
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,295
before every shot,
the crew would chant,

81
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:38,058
"Dewide the attention. "

82
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,565
Movie critics weren't crazy about the film.

83
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:44,365
Walt Disney's own distributor, RKO,
didn't want to release it.

84
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,429
So Walt put the film in theaters
through United Artists.

85
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:51,637
But the most important response
to the movie came from Winston Churchill.

86
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,906
When he flew to Quebec
for an Allied conference,

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,914
and learned that President Roosevelt

88
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,678
hadn't seen the movie,
he and Air Marshal Tedder

89
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:02,085
prodded him until he ordered
that a print be sent to him.

90
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:05,716
H.C. Potter was told by Walt
that it was only after

91
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,851
Roosevelt saw Victory Through Air Power,

92
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,988
that our country made the commitment
to long-range bombing.

93
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,929
And that, after all, was the reason

94
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,763
Walt committed to making
this movie in the first place.

95
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,632
Because of its topicality,

96
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,638
the Disney Studio decided to keep this film

97
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,970
in the vaults at the close of World War ll.

98
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,306
Only the history of aviation sequence

99
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,345
was seen in the years since then.

100
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,506
It's with great pleasure that we present

101
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,812
Victory Through Air Power, in its entirety.

102
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:41,812
