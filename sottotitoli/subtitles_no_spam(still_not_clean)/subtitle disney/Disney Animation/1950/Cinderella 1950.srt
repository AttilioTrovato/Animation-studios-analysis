1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,086
<i>Ahh, ooh</i>

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,299
<i>Cinderella</i>

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,819
<i>You're as lovely as your name</i>

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,019
<i>Cinderella</i>

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,619
<i>You're a sunset in a frame</i>

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,499
<i>Though you're dressed in rags</i>

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,579
<i>You wear an air of queenly grace</i>

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,979
<i>Anyone can see</i>

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,923
<i>A throne would be your proper place</i>

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,019
<i>Cinderella</i>

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,539
<i>If you give your heart a chance</i>

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,659
<i>It will lead you</i>

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,329
<i>To the kingdom of romance</i>

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,604
<i>There you'll see your dreams unfold</i>

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,019
<i>Cinderella</i>

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,859
<i>In the sweetest story</i>

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,449
<i>Ever told</i>

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,139
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>in a faraway land,</i>

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,408
<i>there was a tiny kingdom,</i>

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,365
<i>peaceful, prosperous, and rich</i>
<i>in romance and tradition.</i>

21
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,459
<i>Here, in a stately chateau,</i>

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,419
<i>there lived a widowed gentleman</i>

23
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,007
<i>and his little</i>
<i>daughter, Cinderella.</i>

24
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,539
<i>Although he was a kind</i>
<i>and devoted father,</i>

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,779
<i>and gave his beloved child</i>
<i>every luxury and comfort,</i>

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,059
<i>still, he felt she</i>
<i>needed a mother's care.</i>

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,899
<i>And so, he married again,</i>

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,579
<i>choosing for his second wife</i>
<i>a woman of good family,</i>

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,419
<i>with two daughters</i>
<i>just Cinderella's age,</i>

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,406
<i>by name, Anastasia and Drizella.</i>

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,059
<i>It was upon the untimely death</i>
<i>of this good man, however,</i>

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,979
<i>that the stepmother's</i>
<i>true nature was revealed.</i>

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,619
<i>Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous</i>

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,739
<i>of Cinderella's charm and beauty,</i>

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,379
<i>she was grimly determined</i>
<i>to forward the interests</i>

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,682
<i>of her own two awkward daughters.</i>

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,939
<i>Thus, as time went by,</i>

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,179
<i>the chateau fell into disrepair.</i>

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,259
<i>For the family fortunes</i>
<i>were squandered</i>

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,739
<i>upon the vain and</i>
<i>selfish stepsisters,</i>

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,059
<i>while Cinderella was</i>
<i>abused, humiliated,</i>

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,842
<i>and finally forced to become</i>
<i>a servant in her own house.</i>

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,539
<i>And yet, through it all,</i>

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,259
<i>Cinderella remained<i>
<i>ever gentle and kind.</i>

45
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,899
<i>For with each dawn, she</i>
<i>found new hope that someday</i>

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,646
<i>her dreams of happiness</i>
<i>would come true.</i>

47
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,929
Well, it serves you right,
spoiling people's best dreams.

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,459
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning,

49
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,411
but it was a lovely dream, too.

50
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,899
What kind of a dream?

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,139
Mmm-mmm. Can't tell.

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,139
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,646
And, after all...

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,419
<i>A dream is a wish</i>

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,699
<i>Your heart makes</i>

56
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,499
<i>When you're fast asleep</i>

57
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,699
<i>In dreams you will lose</i>

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,059
<i>Your heartaches</i>

59
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,539
Shh.

60
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,699
<i>Whatever you wish for</i>

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,979
<i>You keep</i>

62
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,579
<i>Have faith</i>

63
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,728
<i>In your dreams and someday</i>

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,050
<i>Your rainbow will</i>
<i>come smiling through</i>

65
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,570
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,964
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

67
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,939
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

68
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,379
<i>Will come true</i>

69
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,968
Oh, that clock.

70
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,800
Old killjoy.

71
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,446
I hear you. "Come on,
get up," you say.

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,659
Time to start another day.

73
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,167
Even he orders me around.

74
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,339
Well, there's one thing.

75
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,779
They can't order me
to stop dreaming.

76
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,699
And perhaps someday...

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,619
<i>The dreams that I wish</i>

78
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,979
<i>Will come true</i>

79
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,819
<i>Da dum da da dum</i>
<i>Bum bum bum</i>

80
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,124
<i>La da da da bum dum</i>
<i>Ba dee</i>

81
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,139
<i>Ba dum dum ba dum dum</i>
<i>Ba dee</i>

82
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,779
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>La la</i>

83
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,339
<i>Ahhh</i>

84
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,283
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

85
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,842
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

86
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,139
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

87
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,339
<i>Will come true</i>

88
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,259
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.

89
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,379
Wait a minute.

90
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,409
One at a time, please.

91
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,939
Now, Jaq, what's all
the fuss about?

92
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,379
New mouse in the house.

93
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,339
Brand-new. Never saw it before.

94
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,211
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

95
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,724
Well, she'll need a dress...

96
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,139
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.

97
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,125
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.

98
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,939
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!

99
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,059
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?

100
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,886
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?

101
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,807
Now, now, calm down, everybody.

102
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,419
Oh, the poor little
thing's scared to death.

103
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,379
Jaq, maybe you better
explain things to him.

104
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,779
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.

105
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,539
Now, now. Look, little guy.

106
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,379
Take it easy. Nothin'
to worry about.

107
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,139
We like you. Cinderelly
likes you, too.

108
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,859
She's nice, very nice.

109
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,339
That's better. Come
on, now. Zuk, zuk.

110
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,379
Uh, uh, zuk, zuk.

111
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,124
Well, that's better.

112
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,086
Hmm.

113
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,331
Well, let's just
slip it on for size.

114
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,139
Uh-huh. It is a little snug.

115
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,249
But it'll have to do.

116
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,284
Now, for a name.

117
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,123
I've got one. Octavius.

118
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,649
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

119
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,979
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,099
Gus-Gus.

121
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,059
I've got to hurry. See he
keeps out of trouble, Jaq.

122
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,819
And don't forget to
warn him about the cat.

123
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,779
Zuk, zuk. Look, did
you ever see a cat?

124
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,419
Cat, cat?

125
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,819
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.

126
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,499
Meany, sneaky.

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,579
Jump at you. Bite at you.

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,339
Big, big. Big as a house.

129
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,085
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?

130
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,449
Duh, Lucify, zuk, zuk.

131
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,120
Here, kitty, kitty.

132
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,562
Come, kitty. Come on.

133
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,890
Lucifer! Come here!

134
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,299
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

135
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,968
It's certainly not my
idea to feed you first.

136
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,361
It's orders. Come on.

137
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,899
Uh, Lucify. Is that Lucify?

138
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,739
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.

139
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,259
Gus-Gus take the
Lucify and look at!

140
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,659
No, Gus-Gus, no.

141
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,939
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.

142
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,969
Lucify mean.

143
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,179
Bruno.

144
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,806
Bruno!

145
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,339
Dreaming again.

146
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,899
Chasing Lucifer?

147
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,090
Catch him this time? That's bad.

148
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,139
Suppose they heard you upstairs.

149
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,044
You know the orders.

150
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,539
So if you don't want to
lose that nice, warm bed,

151
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,366
you'd better get rid
of those dreams.

152
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,200
Know how?

153
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,339
Just learn to like cats.

154
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,819
No, I mean it. Lucifer has
his good points, too.

155
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,088
For one thing, he...

156
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,859
Well, sometimes he...

157
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,179
Hmm.

158
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,721
There must be something
good about him.

159
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,859
Bruno!

160
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,019
Oh, Bruno.

161
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,290
Come on, now. Outside.

162
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,299
I know it isn't easy,

163
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,763
but at least we should try
to get along together.

164
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,729
And that includes
you, Your Majesty.

165
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,219
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.

166
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,419
Come on, everybody,
breakfast, breakfast.

167
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,739
Come on, let's eat breakfast.

168
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,203
Breakfast? Ooh, breakfast!

169
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,406
Uh-oh, Lucify. How're
we gonna get out?

170
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,324
Let's see.

171
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,859
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.

172
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,099
Now, somebody's got to sneak out,

173
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,739
get Lucify to chase him,

174
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,979
run over to the corner
and keep Lucify there.

175
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,819
Then we all run out. Zuk.

176
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,499
Yuk, yuk. Out.

177
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,139
Now we choose the one
to do it. Ibby-dibby hop.

178
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,899
- Hop.
- Uh, hop.

179
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,619
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.

180
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,081
Hop.

181
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,259
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.

182
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,244
Uh, hop.

183
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,447
Shh!

184
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,859
Oh, there you are.

185
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,739
I was wondering.

186
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,611
All right. Breakfast is served.

187
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,367
Uh, uh... Take it
easy, cluck-cluck.

188
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,241
Duh... Let go! Let go, now.

189
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,699
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.

190
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,082
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

191
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,410
Poor little Gus.

192
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,019
Here.

193
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,810
Help yourself.

194
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,419
Hmm. Where's Gus-Gus?

195
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,688
Well, guess he got away.

196
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,170
Cinderella!

197
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,219
All right, all right. I'm coming.

198
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,139
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.

199
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,499
Cinderella!

200
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,325
Coming, coming.

201
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,406
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.

202
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,779
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

203
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,409
Cinderella!

204
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,081
Cinderella!

205
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,139
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

206
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,059
Huh. As if you care.

207
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,499
Take that ironing and
have it back in an hour.

208
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,459
One hour, you hear?

209
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,250
Yes, Drizella.

210
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,539
Good morning, Anastasia.

211
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,619
Well, it's about time.

212
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,899
Don't forget the mending.

213
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,339
Don't be all day getting
it done, either.

214
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,961
Yes, Anastasia.

215
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,779
Well, come in, child, come in.

216
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,179
Good morning, Stepmother.

217
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,019
Pick up the laundry and
get on with your duties.

218
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,924
Yes, Stepmother.

219
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,859
Oh! Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!

220
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,059
Mother! Mother!

221
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,099
You did it. You did it on purpose.

222
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,539
Mother! Mother! Mother!

223
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,059
- Now what did you do?
- Oh!

224
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,539
She put it there.

225
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,128
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.

226
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,447
All right, Lucifer. What
did you do with him?

227
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,459
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

228
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,539
We'll just see about this.

229
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,059
Come on. Let him go.

230
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,059
Now the other one.

231
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,646
Come on!

232
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,566
Oh, poor little Gus.

233
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,179
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?

234
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,939
Cinderella!

235
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,844
Yes, Stepmother.

236
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,259
- Humph!
- Are you gonna get it.

237
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,166
Close the door, Cinderella.

238
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,211
Come here.

239
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,404
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.

240
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,921
Now,

241
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,379
it seems we have time on our hands.

242
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,842
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!

243
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,401
Time for vicious practical jokes.

244
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,299
Perhaps we can put
it to better use.

245
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,284
Now, let me see...

246
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,339
There's the large carpet
in the main hall.

247
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,339
Clean it!

248
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,499
And the windows, upstairs and down.

249
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,211
Wash them!

250
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,979
Oh, yes. And the tapestries
and the draperies.

251
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,806
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!

252
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,419
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.

253
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,339
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.

254
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,690
And, of course, there's the mending
and the sewing and the laundry.

255
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,965
Oh, yes. And one more thing.

256
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,687
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

257
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,459
My son has been avoiding his
responsibilities long enough.

258
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,048
It's high time he married
and settled down.

259
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,648
Of course, Your Majesty.

260
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,219
But we must be patient.

261
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,727
I am patient!

262
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,259
But I'm not getting any
younger, you know.

263
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,539
I want to see my
grandchildren before I go.

264
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,379
- I understand, Sire.
- No.

265
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,819
No, you don't know what it
means to see your only child

266
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,001
grow farther, farther, and
farther away from you.

267
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,299
I'm...

268
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,499
I'm lonely in this
desolate old palace.

269
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,739
I... I want to hear

270
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,339
the pitter-patter of
little feet again.

271
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,723
Now, now, Your Majesty.

272
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,568
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?

273
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,299
With his silly romantic ideas?

274
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,259
But, Sire, in matters of love...

275
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,979
Love. Bah!

276
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,619
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

277
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,499
So, we're arranging the conditions.

278
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,339
But, Your Majesty, if the
Prince should suspect.

279
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,219
Suspect!

280
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,059
Look, the boy's coming
home today, isn't he?

281
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,099
Yes, Sire.

282
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,339
Well, what could be more natural
than a ball to celebrate his return?

283
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,299
Nothing, Sire.

284
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,299
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just

285
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,699
happened to be there,

286
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,059
why, he's bound to show interest
in one of them, isn't he?

287
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,819
Isn't he?

288
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,459
Yes, Sire.

289
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,285
The moment he does...

290
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,379
Soft lights.

291
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,059
Romantic music.

292
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,761
All the trimmings!

293
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,603
It can't possibly fail.

294
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,250
Can it?

295
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,619
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!

296
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,979
Very well, Sire.

297
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,739
I shall arrange the ball for...

298
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,379
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!

299
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,059
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!

300
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,619
And see that every
eligible maid is there.

301
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,400
Understand?

302
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,322
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,059
<i>The pear-shaped toad</i>

304
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,619
<i>Ooh</i>

305
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:18,819
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

306
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,939
<i>High</i>

307
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,859
<i>Above me</i>

308
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,019
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

309
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,299
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

310
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,299
<i>High</i>

311
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,379
<i>Above</i>

312
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,859
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

313
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,739
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

314
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,365
<i>High</i>

315
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,219
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

316
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,779
<i>Sing, sweet</i>

317
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,579
<i>Nightingale</i>

318
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,619
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

319
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,979
<i>Sing, sweet</i>

320
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,299
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

321
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,251
<i>Sing</i>

322
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,099
<i>Oh, sing, sweet nightingale</i>

323
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,406
<i>Oh, sing, sweet</i>

324
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,681
<i>Oh</i>

325
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,259
<i>Sing</i>

326
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,882
Oh! Oh, Lucifer!

327
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,444
You mean old thing.

328
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,339
I'm just going to have
to teach you a lesson.

329
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,602
Open in the name of the King.

330
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,579
An urgent message from
His Imperial Majesty.

331
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,339
- Thank you.
- From the King!

332
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,539
What's it say, Cinderelly?

333
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,939
What's it say, huh?

334
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,459
I don't know.

335
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,539
He said it's urgent.

336
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,699
<i>Ohhh</i>

337
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,419
Maybe I should interrupt
the, uh, music lesson.

338
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,619
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

339
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,290
<i>High</i>

340
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,121
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

341
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,739
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember,

342
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,059
above all, self-control.

343
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,560
Yes!

344
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,499
Cinderella! I've warned
you never to interrupt...

345
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,459
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!

346
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,019
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.

347
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,687
I'll read it.

348
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,699
Well, there's to be a ball.

349
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,459
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.

350
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,979
Oh, the Prince!

351
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,259
And, by royal command,

352
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,339
every eligible maiden is to attend.

353
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,086
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.

354
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,699
- That means I can go, too.
- Ha!

355
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,819
Her, dancing with the Prince.

356
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,059
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

357
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,819
Would you mind holding my broom?

358
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,522
Well, why not?

359
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,419
After all, I'm still a
member of the family.

360
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,379
And it says, "By royal command,

361
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,179
"every eligible
maiden is to attend."

362
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,245
Yes, so it does.

363
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,899
Well, I see no reason
why you can't go.

364
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,299
If you get all your work done.

365
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,179
Oh, I will. I promise.

366
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,859
And if you can find
something suitable to wear.

367
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,259
I'm sure I can. Oh,
thank you, Stepmother.

368
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,899
Mother, do you realise
what you just said?

369
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,884
Of course.

370
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,499
I said "If."

371
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,419
Oh. "If."

372
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,939
Isn't it lovely?

373
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,659
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.

374
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,339
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned,
but I'll fix that.

375
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,530
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.

376
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,845
There ought to be some
good ideas in here.

377
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,299
Uh-huh. This one.

378
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,739
Oh, very nice. Nice.

379
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,579
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.

380
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,619
I'll have to shorten the
sleeves, I'll need a sash,

381
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,810
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!

382
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,979
Oh, now what do they want?

383
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,645
Cinderella!

384
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,939
Oh, Well.

385
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,979
I guess my dress will
just have to wait.

386
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,699
Cinderella!

387
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,379
Cinderella!

388
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,126
All right, all right. I'm coming.

389
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,299
Poor Cinderelly.

390
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,059
Every time she finds a minute,
that's the time when they begin it.

391
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,059
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.

392
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,169
Cinderella!

393
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,979
<i>Cinderelly, Cinderelly</i>
<i>Night and day it's Cinderelly</i>

394
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,019
<i>Make the fire</i>
<i>Fix the breakfast</i>

395
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,899
<i>Wash the dishes</i>
<i>Do the moppin'</i>

396
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,939
<i>And the sweepin' and the dustin'</i>

397
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,739
<i>They always keep her hoppin'</i>

398
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,299
<i>She'd go around in circles</i>

399
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,219
<i>Till she's very, very dizzy</i>

400
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,739
<i>- Still they holler</i>
<i>- Keep her busy, Cinderelly</i>

401
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,122
Yeah. Keep her busy.

402
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,419
You know what?

403
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,579
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?

404
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,644
- Not go?
- What did you say?

405
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,807
You'll see. They'll fix her.

406
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,323
Work, work, work. She'll
never get her dress done.

407
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,048
Poor Cinderelly.

408
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,619
Hey! We can do it!

409
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,779
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

410
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,379
<i>We can help our Cinderelly</i>
<i>We can make the dress so pretty</i>

411
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,219
<i>There's nothing to it, really</i>

412
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,019
<i>We'll tie a sash around it</i>
<i>Put a ribbon through it</i>

413
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,539
<i>When dancing at the ball she'll</i>
<i>be more beautiful than all</i>

414
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,299
<i>In the lovely dress we</i>
<i>make for Cinderelly</i>

415
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,979
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry?</i>

416
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,779
<i>Gonna help our Cinderelly</i>

417
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,619
<i>Got no time to dilly-daily</i>

418
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,539
<i>We got to get it goin'</i>

419
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,499
I'll cut it with the scissors.

420
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,179
And I can do the sewing.

421
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,299
Leave the sewing to the women.

422
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,899
You go get some trimmin'.

423
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,899
<i>And we'll make a lovely</i>
<i>dress for Cinderelly, whoo</i>

424
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,739
<i>We'll make a lovely</i>
<i>dress for Cinderelly</i>

425
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,099
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.

426
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,846
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.

427
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,579
Cinderelly will be surprised.

428
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,121
Surprised, surprised.
Very surprised.

429
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,979
And this, too, my
slippers. Don't forget...

430
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,419
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

431
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,859
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?

432
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,699
- Yes?
- When you're through,

433
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,579
and before you begin
your regular chores,

434
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,419
I have a few little things.

435
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,779
Very well.

436
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,259
I don't see why everyone else
has nice things to wear,

437
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,419
and I always end up
in these old rags.

438
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,459
This sash! I wouldn't
be seen dead in it.

439
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,779
You should talk. These beads!

440
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,411
I am sick of looking at them.

441
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,899
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.

442
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,619
Come on and be careful.

443
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,242
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.

444
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,248
We can use that, Gus-Gus.

445
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,139
- Pretty, pretty.
- Shh.

446
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,647
Look out. Lucify!

447
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,859
Oh! Beads!

448
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,606
- Very pretty beads!
- Shh!

449
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,139
<i>A dream is a wish your heart makes</i>

450
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,139
<i>When you're fast asleep</i>

451
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,859
<i>In dreams you will</i>
<i>lose your heartaches</i>

452
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,482
<i>Whatever you wish for</i>
<i>You keep</i>

453
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,059
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

454
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,859
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

455
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,130
<i>The dream that you</i>
<i>wish will come true</i>

456
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,419
Okay. One, two, three, four,

457
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,643
five, six, seven, eight.

458
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,539
<i>Whatever you wish for you keep</i>

459
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,045
All right.

460
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,219
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.

461
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,171
Heave, ho.

462
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,099
<i>The dream that you</i>
<i>wish will come true</i>

463
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,687
<i>Will come true</i>

464
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,099
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.

465
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,819
Oh.

466
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,539
Why, Cinderella,

467
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,379
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.

468
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,162
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

469
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,379
But, of course, there
will be other times.

470
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,330
Yes. Good night.

471
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,979
Oh, well.

472
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,123
What's a royal ball?

473
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,899
After all, I suppose it
would be frightfully dull,

474
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,727
and boring, and completely...

475
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,408
Completely wonderful.

476
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,379
- It's my...
- Surprise!

477
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,523
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

478
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,859
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!

479
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,339
Well, I never dreamed it.

480
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,179
It's such a surprise.

481
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,802
Oh, how can I ever...

482
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,966
Oh, thank you so much.

483
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,379
Remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

484
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,330
- be sure...
- Wait!

485
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,129
Please, wait for me.

486
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,019
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?

487
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,209
Do you think it will do?

488
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,739
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.

489
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,019
- Oh, no.
- You can't!

490
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,731
Girls, please.

491
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,499
After all, we did make a bargain.

492
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,689
Didn't we, Cinderella?

493
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,047
And I never go back on my word.

494
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,579
How very clever.

495
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,379
These beads,

496
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,459
they give it just the right touch.

497
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,059
Don't you think so, Drizella?

498
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,499
No, I don't. I think she's...

499
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,371
Oh! Why, you little thief!

500
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,259
They're my beads. Give them here.

501
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,739
Oh, no.

502
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,939
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.

503
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,819
- Mine!
- Oh, please.

504
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,099
Please, no.

505
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,659
Thief!

506
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,088
Girls, girls.

507
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,844
That's quite enough. Hurry
along now, both of you.

508
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,051
I won't have you
upsetting yourselves.

509
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,131
Good night.

510
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,779
<i>You will lose your heartache</i>

511
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,859
<i>Whatever you wish for</i>
<i>You'll keep</i>

512
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,659
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

513
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,059
<i>Have faith in your</i>
<i>dreams and someday</i>

514
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,379
It's just no use.

515
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,939
<i>Your rainbow will</i>
<i>come smiling through</i>

516
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,004
No use at all.

517
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,259
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

518
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,939
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

519
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,019
I can't believe. Not any more.

520
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,139
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

521
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,339
<i>Will come true</i>

522
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,859
There's nothing left to believe in.

523
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,400
Nothing.

524
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,424
Nothing, my dear? Oh, now
you don't really mean that.

525
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:10,179
- Oh, but I do.
- Nonsense, child!

526
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,619
If you'd lost all your
faith, I couldn't be here.

527
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,539
And here I am.

528
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,099
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

529
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,299
You can't go to the
ball looking like that.

530
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,419
The ball?

531
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,899
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.

532
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,379
But we have to hurry,

533
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,699
because even miracles
take a little time.

534
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,299
- Miracles?
- Mmm-hmm. Watch.

535
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,339
What in the world did I do with
that magic wand? I was sure...

536
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,579
Magic wand?

537
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,259
That's strange.

538
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,059
- I always...
- Then you must be...

539
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,259
Your fairy godmother? Of course.

540
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,961
Where is that wand? I...

541
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,419
Oh! I forgot.

542
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,210
I put it away.

543
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,219
Look at what she did.

544
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,739
How'd she do it?

545
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,859
Now, let's see. Hmm.

546
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,139
I'd say the first thing
you need is, um,

547
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,539
- a Pumpkin.
- A Pumpkin?

548
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,139
Mmm-hmm. Now, uh, the magic words.

549
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,886
Uh... Oh!

550
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,099
<i>Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la</i>
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

551
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,259
<i>Put 'em together and</i>
<i>what have you got?</i>

552
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,379
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

553
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,939
<i>Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la</i>
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

554
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,259
<i>It'll do magic
Believe it or not</i>

555
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,459
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

556
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,939
<i>Now sala-gadoola means</i>
<i>Menchika-boolaroo</i>

557
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,459
<i>But the thing-a-ma-bob</i>
<i>that does the job</i>

558
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,179
<i>Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

559
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,779
<i>Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la</i>
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

560
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,979
<i>Put 'em together and</i>
<i>what have you got?</i>

561
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,171
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi</i>
</i>Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

562
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,659
Oh, looky.

563
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,769
Isn't it wonderful?

564
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,699
Oh, it's beautiful.

565
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,179
Yes, isn't it?

566
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,699
With an elegant coach
like that, of course,

567
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,819
we'll simply have to have

568
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,459
- mice!
- Mice?

569
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,979
Oh, this really is nice.

570
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,139
Why, we'll have a coach and
four when we're through.

571
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,699
Just a wave of my stick
and to finish the trick,

572
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,699
bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

573
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,819
Gracious, what did I do?

574
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,699
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.

575
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,002
There you are.

576
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,528
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

577
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,819
Oh, poor Lucifer.

578
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,179
Serves him right,
I'd say. Now, um...

579
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,179
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.

580
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,819
You can't go to the
ball without, um...

581
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,379
a horse.

582
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,170
Another one?

583
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,539
But tonight, for a change,

584
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,099
you will handle the reins,

585
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,846
and sit in the driver's seat, too.

586
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,659
For instead of a horse, you're
the coachman, of course.

587
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,883
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

588
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,219
That does it, I guess,
except for... Oh, yes!

589
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,419
The finishing touch.
And, that's you.

590
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,520
Yes, Bruno, that's right,
you'll be footman tonight.

591
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,207
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

592
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,979
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

593
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,779
- But, uh...
- No, don't try to thank me.

594
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,539
Oh, I wasn't...
I mean, I do, but...

595
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,219
- But, don't you think my dress...
- Yes, it's lovely, dear, Love...

596
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,445
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!

597
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,099
Now, let's see, dear.

598
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,419
Your size and the shade
of your eyes. Mmm-hmm.

599
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,619
Something simple, but daring, too.

600
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,686
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.

601
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,179
Bibbidi-bobbidi. Bibbidi-bobbidi.

602
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,801
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

603
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,059
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.

604
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,379
Did you ever see such
a beautiful dress?

605
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,411
And, look, glass slippers.

606
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,099
Why, it's like a dream.

607
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,139
A wonderful dream come true.

608
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,539
Yes, my child. But,
like all dreams,

609
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,419
well, I'm afraid this
can't last forever.

610
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,539
You'll have only till
midnight, and then...

611
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,219
Midnight? Thank you.

612
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,659
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear,

613
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,979
on the stroke of 12:00
the spell will be broken,

614
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,619
and everything will
be as it was before.

615
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,979
Oh, I understand, but

616
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,739
it's more than I ever hoped for.

617
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,539
Bless you, my child.

618
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,099
I... Goodness me!

619
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,499
It's getting late. Hurry up,
dear. The ball can't wait.

620
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,859
Have a good time. Dance, be gay.

621
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,099
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.

622
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,499
<i>With a bibbidi-bobbidi</i>
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi</i>

623
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,484
<i>Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo</i>

624
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,126
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.

625
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,059
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Augustina DuBois.

626
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,807
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.

627
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,204
The boy isn't cooperating.

628
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,939
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.

629
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,643
Daughter of Colonel and
Madame de la Tour.

630
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,499
I can't understand it.

631
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,619
There must be at least one
who'd make a suitable mother.

632
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,579
Shh. Sire.

633
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,326
A suitable wife.

634
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,779
<i>Mademoiselles</i> Drizella
and Anastasia Tremaine.

635
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,731
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.

636
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,339
I give up. Even I couldn't
expect the boy to...

637
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,939
Well, if I may say so, Your
Majesty, I did try to warn you,

638
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,086
but you, Sire, are
incurably romantic.

639
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:20,122
No doubt you saw the whole
pretty picture in detail.

640
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,560
The young Prince bowing
to the assembly.

641
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,219
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.

642
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,081
For, lo, there she stands.

643
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,449
The girl of his dreams.

644
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,123
Who she is or whence she came,

645
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,819
he knows not, nor does he care,

646
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,699
for his heart tells him that here,

647
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:49,040
here is the maid predestined
to be his bride.

648
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,339
A pretty plot for
fairy tales, Sire.

649
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,539
But in real life, oh, no.

650
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,128
No! It was foredoomed to failure.

651
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,779
Failure, eh?

652
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,019
Take a look at that,
you pompous windbag.

653
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,659
Who is she?

654
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,859
- You know her?
- No, Sire.

655
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,019
I've never seen her before.

656
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,379
That's one thing in her favour.

657
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,648
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

658
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,523
Lights. The lights.

659
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,699
Failure, eh?

660
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,059
Well... Now for a
good night's sleep.

661
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,859
Oh, quite so, Sire.
I believe I, too...

662
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,699
You will stay right here.

663
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,379
See they're not disturbed,
and when the boy proposes,

664
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,579
notify me immediately.

665
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,099
Notify me immediately.

666
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,899
And remember,

667
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,726
if anything goes wrong...

668
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,419
<i>La di da di la di da di</i>
<i>La di da di</i>

669
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,979
<i>La di um um um</i>
<i>Ba dum ba do</i>

670
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,604
<i>Ya dum ba dum dum dum dum</i>

671
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,379
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

672
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,939
Well, the Prince
certainly seems to.

673
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,099
I know I've never seen her.

674
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,499
Nor I.

675
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,804
But she certainly is... Wait.

676
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,166
There is something
familiar about her.

677
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,761
Oh.

678
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,686
Ahem.

679
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,579
<i>So this is love</i>

680
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,979
<i>So this is love</i>

681
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,979
<i>So this is what makes life</i>

682
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,179
<i>Divine</i>

683
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,699
<i>I'm all aglow</i>

684
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,179
<i>- And now I know</i>
<i>- And now I know</i>

685
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,779
<i>The key to all Heaven</i>

686
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,339
<i>Is mine</i>

687
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,659
<i>My heart has wings</i>

688
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,499
<i>And I can fly</i>

689
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,419
<i>I'll touch every star</i>

690
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,963
<i>In the sky</i>

691
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:56,899
<i>So this is the miracle</i>

692
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:03,003
<i>That I've been dreaming of</i>

693
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,219
<i>So this</i>

694
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,939
<i>Is</i>

695
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,687
<i>Love</i>

696
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,459
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

697
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,299
What's the matter?

698
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,619
It's midnight.

699
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,699
Yes, so it is. But why...

700
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,099
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.

701
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,899
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.

702
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,579
- Please, I must.
- But why?

703
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,939
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,

704
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,459
I haven't met the Prince.

705
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,899
The Prince?

706
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,299
But didn't you know...

707
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,579
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.

708
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,167
Come back. Please come back.

709
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,859
I don't even know your
name. How will I find you?

710
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,730
Wait! Please wait.

711
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,171
Good bye.

712
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,779
Oh, I say. Young lady.

713
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,289
- Wait!
- The Prince!

714
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,041
Just a moment.

715
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,811
Guard! Guard!

716
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,407
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

717
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,099
Follow that coach!

718
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,767
Open those gates!

719
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,970
I'm sorry.

720
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,968
I guess I forgot about everything.

721
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,684
Even the time, but...

722
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,925
But it was so wonderful.

723
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:24,139
And he was so handsome,
and when we danced...

724
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,366
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself
couldn't have been more... More...

725
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,979
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.

726
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,299
- Look, look! The slippers!
- Yeah, your slipper.

727
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,579
Your slipper, Cinderelly.

728
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,927
Oh.

729
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,285
Thank you.

730
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,884
Thank you so much, for everything.

731
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,899
Your Majesty, I see no point
in beating about the bush.

732
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,939
I regret to inform you, Sire,

733
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,179
that the young lady
has disappeared,

734
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,059
leaving behind only
this glass slipper.

735
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,169
Yes. I'll do it.

736
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,529
No. I just can't.

737
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,844
Well, come in.

738
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,739
Come in!

739
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,019
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?

740
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,579
- Tell me about it.
- Well...

741
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,099
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...

742
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,779
No matter. We've more
important things to discuss.

743
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,539
Arrangements for the wedding,

744
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,491
invitations, a national holiday.

745
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,219
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...

746
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,939
Here. Have a cigar.
Take a few more.

747
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,539
But...

748
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,419
Better practise passing
these out, eh?

749
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,779
But, if you'd only listen.

750
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,619
And for you, my friend.

751
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,459
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.

752
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,219
I hereby dub you Sir... Um, uh...

753
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,126
By the way, what title
would you like?

754
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,459
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?

755
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,922
A peculiar title, but
if that's what you...

756
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,419
She what? Why, you...

757
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,619
You... You traitor!

758
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,619
Now, Sire. Remember,
your blood pressure.

759
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,809
Treason!

760
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,979
No, Sire. No!

761
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,647
Sabotage!

762
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,299
You were in league with the Prince.

763
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,419
I tried to stop her,

764
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,379
but she vanished into thin air.

765
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,219
A likely story.

766
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,659
But it's true, Sire. All we could
find was this glass slipper.

767
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,440
The whole thing was a plot!

768
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,819
But, Sire, he loves her.

769
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,819
He won't rest till he finds her.

770
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,043
He's determined to marry her.

771
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,410
What? What did you say?

772
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,139
The Prince, Sire,
swears he'll marry none

773
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,339
but the girl who fits this slipper.

774
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,449
He said that, did he?

775
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,859
We've got him!

776
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,339
But, Sire, this slipper may fit
one of any number of girls.

777
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,299
That's his problem.
He's given his word.

778
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,539
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.

779
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,619
I'll have nothing to do with it.

780
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,419
You'll try this on every
maid in my kingdom.

781
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,219
And if the shoe fits,

782
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,179
bring her in.

783
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

784
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,407
Cinderella? Cinderella?

785
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,339
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?

786
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,005
Here I am.

787
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,739
My daughters, where are they?

788
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,059
I think they're still in bed.

789
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,819
Don't just stand there! Bring
up the breakfast trays at once.

790
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,326
And hurry!

791
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,339
Wow. I wonder what's the matter.

792
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,099
What's the matter with her?

793
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,641
I don't know. Let's
find out. Come on.

794
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,419
Drizella. Drizella!

795
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,619
What?

796
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,659
Get up. Quick. This instant.

797
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,849
We haven't a moment to lose.

798
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:56,203
Anastasia.

799
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,019
Get up, Anastasia.

800
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,299
What for? Why?

801
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,419
Everyone's talking about
it, the whole kingdom.

802
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,819
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

803
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,939
The Grand Duke. He's
been hunting all night.

804
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,099
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

805
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,739
The one who lost her slipper
at the ball last night.

806
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,779
They say he's madly
in love with her.

807
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,499
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!

808
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,379
The Prince!

809
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,739
You clumsy little fool.

810
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,139
Clean that up, then help
my daughters dress.

811
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,459
What for?

812
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,459
If he's in love with that girl,
why should we even bother?

813
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,339
Now, you two, listen to me. There is still
a chance that one of you can get it.

814
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,571
Huh? One of us?

815
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:48,659
- Why, Mother, what do you mean?
- Just this:

816
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,299
No one, not even the Prince,
knows who that girl is.

817
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,139
We know! We know!
Cinderelly! Cindere...

818
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,779
The glass slipper
is their only clue.

819
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,819
The Duke has been ordered to try
it on every girl in the kingdom.

820
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,019
And if one can be found
whom the slipper fits,

821
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,499
then, by the King's command,

822
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,099
that girl shall be
the Prince's bride.

823
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,019
- His bride.
- His bride!

824
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,419
Cinderella, get my things together.

825
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,259
Never mind her. Get
mine right away.

826
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,339
What's the matter with her?

827
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,899
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.

828
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,339
Dressed. Oh, yes.

829
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,099
Oh, we must get dressed.

830
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,499
It wouldn't do for the
Duke to see me...

831
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,259
Mother, did you see what she did?

832
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,739
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!

833
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,539
<i>So this is love</i>

834
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,419
What's she gonna do?

835
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:05,680
Shh. I don't know.
Gotta watch. Come on.

836
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,019
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

837
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,179
<i>So this is the miracle</i>

838
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,939
<i>That I've been dreaming of</i>

839
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:44,419
What?

840
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,643
Oh! Oh, no!

841
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,499
No, please!

842
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,139
Oh, you can't, you just can't.

843
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,099
Let me out! You must let me out!

844
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,179
You can't keep me in here!

845
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,099
Oh, please.

846
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,339
No, no. She can't do it. She
can't lock up Cinderelly.

847
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,819
- I'm gonna...
- Shh.

848
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,099
Please. Please.

849
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:11,041
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

850
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,650
Whoa.

851
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,979
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.

852
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,099
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.

853
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,339
We gotta get that key quick.

854
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,563
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.

855
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,579
Oh, Mother, Mother,
he's here, he's here.

856
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,380
The Grand Duke.

857
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:39,452
Do I look all right?
I'm so excited,

858
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:41,899
- I just don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.

859
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,647
Now, remember, this is your
last chance. Don't fail me.

860
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:53,979
Announcing His Imperial
Grace, the Grand Duke.

861
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:56,859
You honour our humble home.

862
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,207
Quite so.

863
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,819
May I present my daughters,

864
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,699
Drizella, Anastasia.

865
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,411
Your Grace.

866
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,209
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.

867
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,651
His Grace will read the
royal proclamation.

868
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,979
"All loyal subjects of
His Imperial Majesty

869
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,339
"are hereby notified by royal
proclamation in regard to a certain

870
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,122
"glass slipper.

871
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,059
"It is decreed..."

872
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,059
Why, that's my slipper!

873
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,339
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!

874
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,699
No, no, no! It's
Cinderelly's slipper!

875
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,699
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.

876
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,525
Your manners.

877
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,899
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

878
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,499
Please continue.

879
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,939
Yes, quite so.

880
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,699
Eh, um... Oh, yes. "It
is upon this day decreed

881
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,979
"that a quest be
instituted throughout...

882
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,046
"The sole and express purpose
of such quest to be as follows:

883
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:03,579
"That every maid throughout the
kingdom without exception,

884
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,579
"shall try on her foot
this slipper of glass,

885
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,379
"and should one be found upon whose
foot this slipper shall properly fit,

886
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,099
"such maiden shall be acclaimed
the object of this search

887
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,419
"and shall be looked upon as the
true love of His Royal Highness,

888
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,179
"our beloved son and
heir, the noble Prince.

889
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,619
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee

01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,099
"beg, request, or
if need be, implore

01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,619
"said maiden that he be
granted her hand in marriage.

892
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,139
"Whereupon, should the

01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:38,819
"look with favour, shall the

896
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,419
"as King and Queen of our kingdom.

897
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,246
"So be it."

898
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,139
You must be quite
fatigued, Your Grace.

899
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,619
May we offer you some tea?

900
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,299
What? Tea?

901
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,659
Thank you, madam, no.

902
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,339
We must proceed with the fitting.

903
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,007
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

904
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,090
There. I knew it was my slipper.

905
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,979
Exactly my size.

906
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,979
I always wear the same size.

907
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,859
As soon as I saw it, I said...

908
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,819
Oh, well...

909
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,659
It may be a trifle snug today.

910
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,339
You know how it is,
dancing all night.

911
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,299
I can't understand why.

912
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,648
It's always fit perfectly before.

913
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,929
I don't think you're half trying.

914
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,819
- Mother, can you...
- Shh.

915
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:43,219
Quiet, my dear. We mustn't
disturb His Grace.

916
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,819
Young man, are you sure you're
trying it on the right foot?

917
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,339
Oh, it's the right foot, but...

918
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,179
These glass shoes
aren't always reliable.

919
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,179
Come on, hurry.

920
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,369
Up the stairs, up the stairs!

921
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,899
Lucify, Lucify.

922
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:08,006
Up, up, up with it.

923
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,299
Oh!

924
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,161
Here.

925
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,851
Shh.

926
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,899
Why can't you hold still a minute?

927
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,249
Oh! My word. Enough of this!

928
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,739
The next young lady, please.

929
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,419
Did you hear that, Gus?

930
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,802
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.

931
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,568
Shh. Come on, come on, hurry.

932
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:06,819
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.

933
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,964
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.

934
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,819
Us is coming, Cinderelly.
Us is coming.

935
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,459
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!

936
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,459
How did you ever manage to...

937
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,139
Lucifer!

938
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,761
Let him go, Lucifer.

939
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,369
Please, let him go.

940
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,739
- Let him go.
- Let him go!

941
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:38,299
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?

942
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,099
Lucify, you...

943
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,808
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!

944
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,010
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!

945
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,489
Oh! Of all the stupid
little idiots.

946
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,939
I'll do it myself.

947
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,739
Get away from me.

948
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,089
I'll make it fit.

949
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,259
- There.
- It fits.

950
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,846
It fits?

951
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,048
No!

952
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,802
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

953
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,499
It shan't happen again.

954
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,290
Precisely, madam.

955
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,564
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.

956
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,048
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

957
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,688
Let go, let go.

958
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,179
You are the only ladies in the
household I hope... I presume.

959
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,979
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.

960
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,851
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?

961
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,779
Your Grace, please, wait.

962
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,979
May I try it on?

963
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,899
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.

964
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,859
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.

965
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,979
She's out of her mind.

966
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,979
Just an imaginative child.

967
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,284
Madam, my orders
were "every maiden."

968
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,365
Come, my child.

969
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,099
Oh, no.

970
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,619
No, no, no. Oh, no!

971
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,779
Oh, this is terrible.

972
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,287
The King, what will he say?

973
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,299
What will he do?

974
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,939
Perhaps, if it would help...

975
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,499
No, no. Nothing can
help now. Nothing.

976
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,768
But, you see, I have
the other slipper.

977
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,619
<i>Have faith in dreams</i>

978
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,419
<i>And someday</i>

979
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,019
<i>Your rainbow will</i>
<i>come smiling through</i>

980
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:51,899
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

981
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,179
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

982
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,499
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

983
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,805
<i>Will come true</i>
