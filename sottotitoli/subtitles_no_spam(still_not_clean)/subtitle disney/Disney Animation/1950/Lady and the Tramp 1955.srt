00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,200
# This is the night

2
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,700
# It's a beautiful night

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,700
# And they call it bella notte

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
# Look at the skies

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,000
# They have stars in their eyes

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,900
# On this lovely bella notte

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,100
# So take the love

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,600
# Of your loved one

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,000
# You'll need it about this time

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,900
# To keep from falling like a star

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,300
# When you make that dizzy climb

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
# For this is the night

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,200
# And the heavens are right

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
# On this lovely

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,400
# Bella notte

16

# Bella notte #

18
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,600
# Silent as a snowflake in the night

19
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,600
# Holy is the spirit of this night

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,700
# All the world is calm and peaceful

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,500
# All the world is bright and joyful

# Spirit of love

23
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,600
# And child of peace

# Love unending

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,800
# That shall not cease

26
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,100
# Peace, my children

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,100
# Of good will

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
# Peace, my children

29
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,300
# Peace be still #

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,000
[man] It's for you, darling.

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,500
Merry Christmas.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh, Jim, dear.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,700
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,900
- Trimmed with ribbons?
- [Whimpering]

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
[Jim] Well, it has a ribbon.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
[Gasping]

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, how sweet.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,500
- [Jim] You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

39
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

40
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,500
Come on, Lady. Over here.

41
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,000
That's a girl.

42
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,400
There, now. A nice little bed for you.

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,900
[Darling] But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

44
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,100
[Jim] Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Uh-oh!

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Almost forgot something.

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,900
There.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
[Jim] Good night, Lady.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,500
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
She'll go right to sleep.

51
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,000
No, no, Lady.

52
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,500
This is where you belong, right here.

53
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
- [Whimpering]
- [Darling] Oh, look.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,900
She's lonesome.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't you think maybe?
Just for tonight?

56
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,000
[Jim] Darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,

57
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,200
we must be firm from the very beginning.

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
[Whimpering]

59
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,500
[Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady!

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,800
Stop that now!

61
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,500
Stop it!

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,100
[Whimpering]

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
[footsteps]

64
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,000
[whimpering]

65
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,200
[Jim pounding on door] Lady!

66
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,200
[Jim] Quiet, now. You hear me?

67
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,400
Back to bed!

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Quick, now.

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,800
Not one more sound.

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,500
[Chiming]

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,300
[scraping]

[snoring]

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Jim, dear.

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,700
[Groaning]

75
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,000
[whimpering]

76
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,300
Aw, Jim.

77
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
[Jim] Hmm? What?

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
[Whimpering, howling]

79
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,900
[Jim yawning]

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
[Jim] Oh, all right.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,600
But remember, just for tonight.

82
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,600
[Rooster crowing]

83
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
[chiming]

84
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
[Darling groaning]

85
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,900
[yawns] All right, Lady. All right.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.

87
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,600
Oh, no!

88
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,800
[Darling] What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

89
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,200
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

90
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,000
[Barking]

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,900
[growling, barking]

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
[bicycle bell rings]

93
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
[Jim] Have you noticed,
darling, since we've had Lady

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,300
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

95
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,200
[Darling] Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

96
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,000
[Jim] Say, she must be
about six months old.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
We'd better be getting her a license.

98
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
Hope it fits.

99
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,600
My, but it does look nice.

100
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,100
So grown up.

101
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,900
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

102
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
[Humming]

103
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,200
# Four steps straight
and then to the left

104
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,800
# And right to the place
where I marked it

105
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,100
# With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own

106
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,800
# In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard #

107
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
A-ha, that's a grand sight.

108
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,300
[Lady] Jock!

109
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, Jock!

110
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
Hello, Jock.

111
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [Chuckles]

112
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Notice anything different?

113
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,300
Eh, uh... You've had a bath?

114
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
No, not that.

115
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,800
You've had your nails clipped?

116
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
[Lady] Mm-mmm. Guess again.

117
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,800
Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'.

118
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Why-o, lassie.

119
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,700
A bonnie new collar.

120
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
- Do you like it?
- Aye. [Sniffs]

121
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,900
Mmm. It must be very expensive.

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,600
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

123
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
Ah, we'd best go at once.

124
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,600
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.

125
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,000
[Snoring]

126
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,300
[whimpering]

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
[snorting, howling]

128
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
He's dreaming.

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,900
[Jock] Aye.

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,100
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

131
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,400
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
through the swamps.

133
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,500
- [Lady] They were?
- That was before...

134
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Before what?

135
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,400
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

136
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,700
[Jock] It shouldn't
have happened to a dog.

137
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,700
But, well...

138
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,000
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,800
- [Lady gasps] No!
- [Jock] Aye.

140
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,100
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

141
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
It would break his poor heart.

142
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Uh... Which way did he go?

143
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
Which way did he go?

144
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,100
- Go?
- [Trusty] Yeah, big fella.

145
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
About, uh, six-foot-two.

146
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
[Sniffs] No, uh, three.

147
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

148
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,500
Why, Miss Lady.

149
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
You have a collar.

150
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Mm-hmm. And a license.

151
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,600
My, my.

152
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
- How time does fly.
- Aye.

153
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
It seems only yesterday she was

154
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,300
cuttin' her teeth
on Jim Dear's slippers,

155
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,600
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

156
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,200
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.

157
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,800
The badge of faith and respectability.

158
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,800
That's right, Miss Lady.

159
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,900
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,600
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

161
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,000
Aye, you have, laddie.

162
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, yeah.

163
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,600
- [Whistling]
- Ooh, it's Jim Dear.

164
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
Please excuse me.

165
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,500
Hello, there, Lady.

166
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Come on, beat you home.

167
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
Oh, you win again.

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Steady, now.

169
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,000
Steady.

170
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, what have we here?

171
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,200
Oh, big girl now, huh?

172
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,500
All right.

173
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Oh, ladies first.

174
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,100
You know, darling, with Lady here

175
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
I'd say life is quite complete.

176
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,200
[Darling] Yes, dear.

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,600
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.

178
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,300
[Steam hissing]

179
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,500
[train whistle blows]

180
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
[train chugging]

181
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,600
[stretching]

182
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,900
[shuddering]

183
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Ah! What a day!

184
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

185
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Hmm? [Chuckles]

186
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Aw, cute little rascals.

187
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,400
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

188
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

189
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,200
Bernie's?

190
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,700
Mmm... no.

191
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Francois...

192
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
No, no.

193
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,500
Nope. Too much starch. Ah!

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,900
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

195
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
I haven't been there in a week.

196
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
[Tony] # A beautiful day
to make pizza

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,100
# Hey, still we call it bella notte #

198
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,800
[scratching]

199
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, buon giorno, Butch.

200
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,600
You want-a your breakfast, eh?

201
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.

202
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,400
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

203
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
[Chuckles] Good catch!

204
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
[Man whistling]

205
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,500
[man] Whoa, boy, whoa.

206
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
[Whistling continues]

207
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
[man humming]

208
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,900
Hey. Psst. Psst.

209
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,100
Blimey.

210
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,000
- Look, Peg, it's the Tramp.
- [Tramp] Shh.

211
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,300
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

212
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,500
All right. No time for wisecracks.

213
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,100
I've got to get you out.

214
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm telling you, the pressure's on.

215
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Signs all over town.

216
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,400
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

217
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,400
- OK, OK, get going.
- [Man] Hey! What's going on there?

218
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,900
Scram. And be careful.

219
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
- [Snarling]
- Why, you mangy mutt.

220
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,400
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

221
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,900
Well. Snob hill. Ha!

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,200
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Pretty slim, eh?

224
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,600
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.

225
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,500
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.

226
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,800
[Chuckles] I wonder what
the leash and collar set

227
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
does for excitement.

228
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,900
Lassie. Lassie!

229
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,300
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.

230
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Miss Lady!

231
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,100
[Jock] Ah! Good morning, lassie.

232
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh...

233
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,900
...day.

234
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,300
Why, Miss Lady.

235
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Is something wrong?

236
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,000
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

237
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,000
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- Oh, no, Jock.

238
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,400
It's something I've done, I guess.

239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
You?

240
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,900
It must be.

241
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,400
- Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...
- [Darling humming]

242
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
[humming continues]

243
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,000
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.

244
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Now, lassie,

245
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,100
get on with the details.

246
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,700
Well, I first noticed it

247
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,200
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

248
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,500
[Clock chiming]

249
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,300
[barking]

250
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
Down, Lady, down!

251
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,900
Darling, darling!

252
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Are you all right?

253
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,100
[Darling] Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

254
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,500
[Jim] I just can't help worrying.

255
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,700
After all, in your condition,

256
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,200
alone here all day,

257
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,100
and walking that dog...

258
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
- That dog!
- That dog?

259
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,900
He's never called me that before.

260
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Well, now, lassie,

261
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,600
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.

262
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,500
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.

263
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right, Miss Lady.

264
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,200
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

265
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

266
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,600
Aye, you have, laddie.

267
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,700
- Frequently.
- Oh, yeah.

268
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,600
But now Darling is... Well...

269
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,500
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

270
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
But yesterday...

271
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
[chiming]

272
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,500
[barking]

273
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
[humming]

274
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
[whining]

275
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,300
No, Lady. No walk today.

276
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,700
[Humming continues]

277
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,500
[barking]

278
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,000
No, Lady.

279
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
Not now.

280
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Lady!

281
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Drop that, Lady.

282
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,600
Drop it, I say.

283
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,600
It didn't hurt, really.

284
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,400
But Darling has
never struck me... before.

285
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,300
[Chuckling] Now, lassie.

286
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,500
Do not take it too seriously.

287
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
After all, at a time like this...

288
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,900
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

289
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
there comes a time

290
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,800
in the life of all humans when, uh...

291
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,500
Well, as they put it, uh...

292
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,200
Birds and the bees?

293
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,200
Or... Well, uh...

294
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,000
The stork. You know. Uh, no?

295
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,100
- Well, uh...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,

296
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,800
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

297
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,100
Bairn?

298
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

299
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh.

300
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,400
What's a baby?

301
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,200
[Jock] Well, they resemble humans.

302
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,900
[Trusty] But I'd say a mite smaller.

303
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,200
[Jock] Aye. And they walk on all fours.

304
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,400
[Trusty] And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.

305
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Aye. And they're very expensive.

306
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
You will not be permitted
to play with it.

307
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,300
But they're mighty sweet.

308
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,200
And very, very soft.

309
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Just a cute little bundle. [Chuckles]

310
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
[Tramp] Of trouble.

311
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

312
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,800
Aw, but shucks.
Any dog can take that.

313
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,700
It's what they do to your happy home.

314
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Move it over, will you, friend?

315
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

316
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

317
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
Look here, laddie.
Who are you to barge in?

318
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,400
The voice of experience, buster.

319
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,800
[Chuckles] Just wait
till junior gets here.

320
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,500
You get the urge for
a nice comfortable scratch,

321
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,900
and, "Put that dog out!

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,900
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

323
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,800
You start barking
at some strange mutt.

324
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,500
[Barks]

325
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,300
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."

326
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
And then!

327
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,600
Then they hit you in the
room and board department.

328
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,800
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?

329
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,500
[Tramp] Forget them.

330
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,900
Leftover baby food.

331
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,500
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?

332
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,900
[Chuckles]

333
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,200
[thunderclap]

334
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,900
A leaky doghouse.

335
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,200
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.

336
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,900
No human is that cruel.

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,500
Of course not, Miss Lady.

338
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
Why, everybody knows

339
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,500
a dog's best friend is his human.

340
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
[Tramp laughing]

341
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Oh, come on now, fellas.

342
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,100
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?

343
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

344
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,500
and their radical ideas.

345
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,200
Off with you, now. Off with you!

346
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.

347
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,300
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

348
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,800
OK, OK, OK.

349
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,300
But remember this, Pigeon.

350
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,300
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.

351
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
When a baby moves in,

352
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,700
the dog moves out.

353
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,700
[Jim] Uh-huh.

354
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,100
Oh, let's see. That'll be about...

355
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,000
Oh, well.

356
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,400
[Pounding]

357
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,900
[Jim] Darling?

358
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There isn't any way we can tell for sure

359
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,000
what it's going to be, is there?

360
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
[Darling] I'm afraid not.

361
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,000
Nobody ever knows for certain.

362
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,700
All we can do is hope.

363
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,100

- We can't go in.
- Why not?

543
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,300
- [Lady] The sign says...
- [Tramp] Yeah, well, that's...

544
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,500
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

545
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Look. We'll just wait for the right...

546
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,900
Uh-oh. Here we are now.

547
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,600
Just lay low.

548
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,600
[Whistling]

549
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
[barking]

550
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,300
- [guard] Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.

551
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,700
- Were you addressing?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

552
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,900
Why, yes, in several languages.

553
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

554
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,400
All right, now,
what's this creature doing here?

555
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,200
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?

556
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,500
Go away. Get down.

557
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,500
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

558
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,500
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

559
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
it was the dog that was whistling, eh?

560
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,300
- [Man] I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

561
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,100
Well, you listen to me.

562
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,500
A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.

563
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,900
You're gonna pay.

564
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Ow!

565
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,600
Pull a knife on me, will you?

566
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,500
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

567
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,500
Carrying concealed weapons.

568
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,000
[Arguing continues]

569
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,900
Come on, Pige.

570
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
The place is ours.

571
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
[Arguing continues]

572
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,200
We better go through
this place from A to Z.

573
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,900
Apes.

574
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,100
No, no. No use even asking them.

575
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,100
They wouldn't understand.

576
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,500
They wouldn't?

577
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,300
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.

578
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
Uh-oh.

579
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
[Tramp] Alligators.
Now there's an idea.

580
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,400
Say, Al, do you suppose you
could nip this contraption off for us?

581
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,100
[Echoing] Glad to oblige.

582
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Whoa. Whoa!

583
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
[Hysterical laughter]

584
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,100
Ha! If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

585
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
- [Animal] Timber!
- Pigeon, look out!

586
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Now what harebrained idiot would...

587
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,400
Hey, look. A beaver.

588
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,700
There's the answer to our problem.

589
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,300
Let me see here.

590
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,200
Six-foot-six
and seven-sixteenth inches.

591
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,400
Pardon me, friend.

592
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,800
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.

593
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Can't stop to gossip now.

594
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,900
Got to slide this sycamore
to the... [straining]

595
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,100
...swamp.

596
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Well, this will only take a second.

597
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

598
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,500
Do you realize every second,
70 centimeters of water

599
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
is wasted over that spillway?

600
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,900
- [Tramp] Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

601
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,500
Gotta get it moving.

602
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,100
Think the cuttin' takes the time?

603
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,200
It's the doggone haulin'.

604
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,700
[Straining]

605
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,000
[Tramp] The haulin'. Exactly.

606
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,500
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.

607
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,500
What you need is a log puller.

608
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,500
[Shouting] I said a log puller!

609
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,000
I ain't deaf, sonny.

610
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,700
There's no need to...

611
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,200
Did you say log puller?

612
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,400
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,

613
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,400
modeled by the lovely little lady,

614
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,100
the new, improved,

615
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,000
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.

616
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,100
The busy beaver's friend.

617
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
You don't say?

618
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,900
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.

619
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,700
Turn around and show
the customer the merchandise.

620
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
And it cuts
log-hauling time 66 per cent.

621
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,100
Sixty-six per cent, eh?

622
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,100
[Giggles] Think of that.

623
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,300
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.

624
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,000
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this,

625
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,400
and haul it off.

626
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,900
Uh, say...

627
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
You mind if I slip it on for size?

628
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Help yourself, friend.

629
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,800
OK. Don't mind if I do.

630
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,300
How do you get the
consarned thing off, sonny?

631
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,300
Glad you brought that up, friend.

632
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,500
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...

633
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,300
Like this?

634
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,700
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.

635
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,500
You see?

636
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,700
It's off.

637
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,300
Say, that is simple.

638
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,800
Well, friend,
we'll be on our way now, so...

639
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny...

640
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,500
I'll have to make certain
it's satisfactory

641
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,000
before we settle on a price.

642
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,900
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

643
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,100
You can keep it.

644
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
I can, eh?

645
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,400
I can?

646
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,100
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.

647
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,700
Well, thanks a lot.

648
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,900
[Chuckles] Thanks ever so...

649
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,800
Say!

650
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,800
It works swell.

651
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,900
[Lady] But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

652
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,600
Say no more. I get the whole picture.

653
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,400
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

654
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,300
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.

655
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,900
Haven't you a family?

656
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,500
One for every day of the week.

657
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,500
The point is, none of them have me.

658
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm afraid I don't understand.

659
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,300
It's simple.

660
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,900
You see... [sniffing]

661
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,400
Hey. [Sniffing]

662
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,800
Something tells me it's suppertime.

663
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.

664
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Now take the Schultzes here.

665
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Little Fritzie,

666
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,800
that's me, Pige,

667
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,600
makes this his Monday home.

668
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,800
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.

669
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,200
[With German accent]
Monday is Mama Schultz

670
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,000
cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.

671
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,500
Mmm.

672
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,300
Delicious.

673
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,100
[Irish accent] O'Brien's
is where little Mike,

674
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
that's me again, Pige,

675
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,300
- comes every Tuesday.
- Every Tuesday?

676
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,700
Begorra. And that's when they're havin'

677
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,300
their darlin' corned beef.

678
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,000
You see, Pige,

679
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,400
when you're footloose and collar-free,

680
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,800
well, you take nothing but the best.

681
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,100
- [Singing in Italian]
- Hey!

682
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,300
Tony's!

683
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,900
Of course.

684
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,800
The very place
for a very special occasion.

685
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,000
This way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

686
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,500
Wait here.

687
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,700
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

688
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,000
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool with...

689
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,600
[barking]

690
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,900
Oh, hello, Butch.

691
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,700
Where you been so long?

692
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,900
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

693
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,100
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

694
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Hey, hey, hey!

695
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,800
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.

696
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
- [Chuckling]
- OK, Tony. OK.

697
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,500
Bones a-coming up.

698
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,900
[Barking]

699
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,200
Huh?

700
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,900
Ahh!

701
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,200
What's this?

702
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,000
Hey, Joe, look.

703
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

704
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, a son of a gun!

705
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,200
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

706
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,000
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

707
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,700
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?

708
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,700
"This a-one"?

709
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,400
This one. This... Oh!

710
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,300
Tony, you know.

711
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,800
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.

712
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,400
[Chuckles, clears throat]

713
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,800
Now, first we fix-a the table.

714
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,900
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?

715
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,300
[Tony] What's the matter with you,
Joe? I break-a your face.

716
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,600
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.

717
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,400
[Joe] OK, Tony, you're the boss.

718
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,300
Now, tell me, what's your pleasure?

719
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,800

721
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,300

Hey, Joe.

724
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,000
he wants-a two spaghetti special.

725
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

726
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
Tony, dogs don't talk.

727
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,600
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.

728
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,900
You the boss.

- It's morning.
- Yeah. [Stretches]

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,800
So it is.

771
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,900
I should have been home hours ago.

772
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,200

"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

for such a knick-knack.

- Now there's a bloke

what never gets caught.

00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,300
He's given the slip
to every dogcatcher in this burg.

that Tramp always
finds some way out.

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,600
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

898
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,900
I think.

899
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,600
What a dog.

900
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,300
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

901
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,900
What a dog!

902
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Peg used to be in
the Dog and Pony Follies.

903
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,500
# He's a tramp

904
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,800
# But they love him

905
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,200
# Breaks a new heart every day

906
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,500
# He's a tramp

907
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,600
# They adore him

908
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,900
# And I only hope he'll stay that way

909
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,500
- # He's a tramp
- [howling]

910
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,700
# He's a scoundrel

911
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,900
- # He's a rounder
- [whimpering]

912
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,500
# He's a cad

913
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,700
# He's a tramp

914
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,800
# But I love him

915
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,600
# Yes, even I have got it pretty bad

916
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,000
- [howling]
- # You can never tell

917
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,300
# When he'll show up

918
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,000
# He gives you plenty of trouble

919
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,600
# I guess he's just a no-count pup

920
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,300
# But I wish that he were double

921
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
- # He's a tramp
- # Bum-bum-bum-ruff

922
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,100
- # He's a rover
- # Bum-bum-bum-ruff

923
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,000
# And there's nothin' more to say

924
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,200
# Bum-bum-bum-ruff

925
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,300
# [Peg] If he's a tramp

926
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,200
# He's a good one

927
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,300
# And I wish that
I could travel his way

928
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,200
# Wish that I could travel his way

929
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,900
# Wish that I could travel his way #

930
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Yeah.

931
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,300
But he never takes them serious.

932
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,800
Ah, but someday

933
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,900
he is meeting someone different.

934
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,700
[Boris] Some delicate, fragile creature

935
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,300
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

936
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,900
Like Miss Park Avenue
here, eh, matey?

937
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,000
Mm-hmm. Could be.

938
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,400
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

939
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,100
Under the spell of true love...

940
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,700
The poor chump grows careless...

941
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
The Cossacks are picking him up...

942
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,400
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

943
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,000
[Door opens]

944
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
[man] It's the little cocker, Bill.

945
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,600
- In number four.
- [Bill] OK.

946
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,600
All right, baby.

947
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,300
They've come to take you home.

948
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,800
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

949
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,300
Courage, man.

950
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,700
Courage!

951
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,900
But, uh...

952
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,100
I've never even considered matrimony.

953
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,600
Nor I.

954
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,300
But no matter which of us she accepts,

955
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,600
we'll always be the best of friends.

956
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,200
Now remember,

957
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,300
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.

958
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,000
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

959
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,300
Lassie.

960
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,900
Miss Lady, ma'am.

961
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,100
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

962
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,100
Now, now, lassie.

963
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,400
Don't feel that way about it.

964
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,900
Of course not, Miss Lady.

965
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,600
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down

966
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,500
- were jailbirds.
- [Jock] Quiet!

967
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,300
You great loony!

968
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,800
Uh, please, lassie.

969
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,800
We've come with a proposition.

970
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,200
[Jock] For helpin' ya.

971
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,600
Help me? What do you mean?

972
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,200
Well, now...

973
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,200
You see, lassie...

974
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,300
Neither of us
is as young as we used to be.

975
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,300
But we're still in the prime of life.

976
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
Aye.

977
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,200
And we've both got
very comfortable homes.

978
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,000
[Trusty] That's right. Where we know

979
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,300
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

980
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,900
So... So, to come
directly to the point...

981
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,100
[clears throat]

982
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,100
If you could, uh,

983
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,300
find it possible to, uh...

984
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,200
To, uh...

985
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,600
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.

986
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,900
- But...
- [Tramp] Oh, Pigeon.

987
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh, Pi...

988
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,900
[Tramp] Oh! Oh, hi, boys.

989
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,700
Anything new in the kennel club set?

990
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,300
[Chuckling]

991
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,700
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.

992
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,000
Hmpf.

993
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,400
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

994
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,000
If this person
is annoying you, Miss Lady...

995
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,000
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

996
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,700
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

997
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,000
Very well, ma'am.

998
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,000
You... You...

999
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,500
...mongrel!

1000
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,600
Aw, come on, Pige.

1001
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,000
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hmpf.

1002
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,600
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.

1003
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,300
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...

1004
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,800
Don't even mention that horrible place.

1005
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,900
[Sobbing] I was so embarrassed and...

1006
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
- And frightened.
- Oh, now, now.

1007
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,100
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

1008
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,100
[Lady] Trick? Trick!

1009
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,200
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

1010
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,100
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...

1011
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,100
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...

1012
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,300
Oh! Yes! Well, I-I...

1013
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,800
As far as I'm concerned,

1014
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,900
you needn't worry about your old heel.

1015
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,200
[Stammering] My heel?

1016
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,500
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.

1017
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,100
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.

1018
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,500
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.

1019
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,300
- And take this with you.
- [Thunderclap]

1020
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,900
[Lady sobbing]

1021
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,200

[barking]

1026
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,400
Stop that.

1027
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,400
Hush, now, hush.

1028
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,000
[Barking continues]

1029
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,400
[Sarah] Stop that racket!

1030
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,200
[Tramp] What's wrong?

1031
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,100
- A rat!
- Where?

1032
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,400
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

1033
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,200
- How do I get in?
- The little door.

1034
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,600
On the porch.

1035
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,200
[Thunderclap]

1036
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,600

[gasping] Merciful heavens!

1046
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,700
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.

1047
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,300
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

1048
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,300
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

1049
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,000
Get back!

1050
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,400
Go on! Get back!

1051
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,500
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.

1052
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,600
[Barking]

1053
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,000
Come here, you. Come here!

1054
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,800
Come on, come on.

1055
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,000
Come along.
I'll call them this minute.

1056
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,100
[Whimpering]

1057
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,400
I won't sleep
with that brute in the house.

1058
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,900
[Barking]

1059
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,500
[telephone ringing]

1060
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,000
[Sarah] Hello? Hello!

1061
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,800
[Whimpering]

1062
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,000
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.

1063
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,000
I insist you pick him up immediately.

1064
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,700
[Bell rings]

1065
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,500
[Jim] Darling, look.

1066
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,400
[Sarah] If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.

1067
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,300
[Man] Don't worry, ma'am.

1068
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,800
We've been after this one for months.

1069
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,800
We'll take care of him.

1070
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,000
- [Darling] What do you suppose?
- [Jim] What's going on here?

1071
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,100
[Man] Just picking up a stray, mister.

1072
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,200
Come on, giddup. [Whip cracks]

1073
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,800
Caught him attacking a baby.

1074
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,200
- [Jim] Heavens.
- My baby.

1075
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,600
[Both] Aunt Sarah!

1076
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,000
[Darling] Aunt Sarah!

1077
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,600
[Both] Aunt Sarah!

1078
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,700
I was certain he was no good

1079
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,100
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

1080
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,600
Yeah, but, uh...

1081
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,900
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

1082
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,600
[Sarah] I got there in time.
There they were...

1083
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,000
[Jim] I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...

1084
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,200
[barking]

1085
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,100
[Sarah] Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.

1086
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,600
[Jim] Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.

1087
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,200
- [Barking continues]
- What is it, old girl?

1088
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,000
What are you try...

1089
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,800
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

1090
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,900
- [Darling] What is it?
- [Sarah gasps]

1091
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,300
[Sarah] Aaah! A rat!

1092
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,200
A rat?

1093
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,100
We should've known.

1094
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,300
I misjudged him.

1095
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,500
Badly.

1096
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,900
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

1097
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,800
But man, we don't know
which way they've gone.

1098
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,900
We'll track 'em down.

1099
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,300
And then?

1100
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,800
We'll hold 'em.

1101
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,000
Hold 'em at bay.

1102
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
Now what?

1103
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,200
The scent. Follow the scent.

1104
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,100
Ach. Let's face it, man.

1105
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,700
We both know you've
lost your sense of smell.

1106
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,500
[Howling]

1107
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,000
[howling continues]

1108
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,500
[howling]

1109
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,400
[howling]

1110
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,600
- [man] Get out of here.
- [Barking]

1111
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,600
Go on, get away.

1112
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,200
[Barking]

1113
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,800
Easy. Go on, get away.

1114
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,700
Watch it now. Watch it!

1115
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,900
[Horn honking]

1116
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,600
[crowd murmuring]

1117
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,800
Hi, Pige.

1118
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,200
[Whimpering]

1119
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,700
[howling]

1120
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,200
[Jim] All right,
everybody, watch the birdy.

1121
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,000
[Growling]

1122
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,000
- [squeaking]
- Steady, now.

1123
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,100
[Jim] Hold it.

1124
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,200
[Coughing]

1125
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,600
I guess I used a little too much.

1126
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,400
Uh-oh.

1127
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,800
Darling, visitors.

1128
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,400
Visitors?

1129
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,600
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.

1130
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,100
[Jim] And good old Trusty.

1131
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,100
Careful now, man.

1132
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,900
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

1133
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,000
[Trusty] Yes, it is.

1134
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,700
[Jim] All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.

1135
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,600
No, no, not you, young man.

1136
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,200
You're going to take a nap.

1137
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,500
Well, Merry Christmas.

1138
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,300
Come in, come in.
If you'll just step into the parlor

1139
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,300
[Jim] I'll see about refreshments.

1140
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,900
Oh, darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?

1141
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,100
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

1142
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,100
[Darling] In the kitchen, Jim dear.

1143
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,800
Oh, no doubt about it.

1144
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,300
They've got their mother's eyes.

1145
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,500
Aye. [Chuckles]

1146
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,900
But there's a bit
of their father in them too.

1147
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,900
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.

1148
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,500
Oh. Yes.

1149
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
Complete with license.

1150
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,400
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

1151
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,800
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

1152
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,100
[Trusty] Trusty, I says,

1153
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,200
Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar.

1154
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,700
'Course, my sense of smell

1155
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,100
is very highly developed.

1156
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Runs in the family, you know.

1157
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,600
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

1158
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:48,400
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

1159
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,000
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

1160
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,800
[All] No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

1161
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,200
Huh?

1162
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,400
I haven't?

1163
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,500
Well, um...

1164
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,000
As Old Reliable used to say...

1165
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,900
He'd say, uh...

1166
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,300
He'd say... uh...

1167
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,000
Uh...

1168
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,500
Hmm.

1169
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,700
Doggone.

1170
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,100
You know,

1171
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,500
I clean forgot what
it was he used to say.

1172
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,600

1173
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,700
