1
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,842
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

2
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,446
I'm lost!

3
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,905
Where's the line?

4
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,181
It just went away.

5
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,465
What do I do?

6
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,444
Help! We'll be stuck here forever!

7
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:20,012
Do not panic.
Do not panic!

8
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,280
We are trained professionals.

9
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:23,583
Now, stay calm.

10
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,821
We are going around the leaf.

11
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,860
Around the leaf?

12
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,753
I don't think we can do that.

13
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:29,766
Oh, nonsense.

14
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,691
This is nothing compared
to the twig of '93.

15
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,112
That's it. That's it.

16
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,036
Good!

17
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,660
You're doing great!

18
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,127
There you go.
There you go!

19
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,572
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

20
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,391
And here's the line again.

21
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,731
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Soil.

22
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,176
Good job, everybody!

23
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,188
Oh my. There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.

24
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:53,620
Shouldn't we tell the queen?

25
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,623
I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.

26
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,519
She's got enough on her plate already,

27
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,314
training her daughter.

28
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:00,439
Oh, yes.

29
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,989
Princess Atta, the poor dear.

30
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,097
Wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

31
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,756
Just be confident, dear.

32
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:09,902
You'll be fine.

33
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,614
There's a gap, there's a gap in the line.

34
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:13,738
What are we gonna do?

35
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,812
It's ok, Your Highness.
Gaps happen.

36
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,996
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

37
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,248
Right.

38
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,748
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

39
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,822
Of course. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

40
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,017
Guys, go shade someone else for a while.

41
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,672
Ok, Atta.
Now what do we do?

42
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:32,728
Oh, don't tell me.

43
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,994
I know it. I know it.
What is it?

44
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,355
We relax.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,680
Right.

46
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,877
It'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

47
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,852
They come, they eat, they leave.

48
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,293
That's our lot in life.

49
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:46,376
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

50
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,557
Isn't that right, Aphie?

51
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,998
You're such a cute little aphid.

52
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,018
Ditch Dot!
Yeah, yeah!

53
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,036
Hey, come back here!

54
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:00,308
Dot!

55
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,683
Yes, Mother.

56
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,352
What did I tell you about trying to fly?

57
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,127
Not until my wings grow in.

58
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:08,799
Right.
But Mom...

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,899
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little...

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,172
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

61
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,675
Now, Dot, be nice to your sister.

62
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,906
It's not my fault she's so stressed out.

63
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,705
I know, I know.

64
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,501
I'm always acting like the sky is falling.

65
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,538
Look out!

66
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,546
Atta!
Princess Atta!

67
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,570
Princess Atta.
Princess Atta!

68
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,071
Oh!
Hey!

69
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:50,399
Stop that!
What do you think you're doing?

70
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,366
You could have killed somebody over here.

71
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:53,665
I'm sorry!

72
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:56,013
I'm sorry!
Oh, it's Flik.

73
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,409
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

74
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,914
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry!

75
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,188
Princess Atta!

76
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,945
Flik, what are you doing?

77
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,071
Oh, this!

78
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,217
This is my new idea for harvesting grain.

79
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,523
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut just down the entire stalk!

80
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:12,381
Flick, we don't have time for this.

81
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:15,215
Exactly, we never have time
to collect food for ourselves.

82
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,560
Because we spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

83
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,683
But my invention will speed up production.

84
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:21,531
Another invention?

85
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,908
Yeah. I got something for you too.

86
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,300
Flick!
Since you're gonna be queen soon,

87
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,993
you could use this to oversee production.

88
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:27,601
Dr. Flora, if I may.

89
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:29,427
Very nice.
What?

90
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:32,157
Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right?

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,423
Flik, please.
Wrong! It is, in fact...

92
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,088
a telescope.

93
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:39,162
It's very clever, Flik, but...
Hello, Princess!

94
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:41,443
Aren't you looking lovely this morning!

95
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,092
Not of course that you would need
a telescope to see that.

96
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:45,081
All right, listen!

97
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,131
The princess doesn't have time for this!

98
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:48,781
You wanna help fill this thing?

99
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,184
Get rid of that machine,

100
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:53,426
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else!

101
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,945
Like everybody else!

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,791
Please, Flik. Just go.

103
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,704
I'm sorry, I was really just trying...

104
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,213
trying to help.

105
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,366
Harvester.

106
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,337
Why, we harvested the same
way ever since I was a pupa.

107
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,558
Where were we?

108
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,182
The food pile, Your Highness.

109
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:15,477
Yes, yes.

110
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,794
Hey, Flik!

111
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,248
Wait Wait up!

112
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:19,831
Hello, Princess.

113
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,121
You can call me Dot.

114
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,883
Here, you forgot this.

115
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:25,665
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

116
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:27,518
I like your inventions.

117
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,496
Really?
Well, you're the first.

118
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,143
I'm beginning to think nothing I do works.

119
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,399
This works?

120
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:35,074
Great. One success.

121
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,916
I'm never gonna make a difference.

122
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,007
Me, neither.

123
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,455
I'm a royal ant and I can't even fly yet.

124
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,808
I'm too little.

125
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,957
Being little's not such a bad thing.

126
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:46,091
Yes, it is.

127
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,383
No, it's not.
Is too!

128
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:50,128
Is not!
Is too!

129
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:53,424
A seed. I need a seed...

130
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,107
Here, here.

131
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,935
Pretend. Pretend that that's a seed.

132
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:06,726
It's a rock.

133
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,951
Oh I know it's a rock, I know.

134
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:10,259
But let's just pretend for
a minute it's a seed, all right.

135
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,772
We'll just use our imaginations.

136
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,753
Now, do you see our tree?

137
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:16,884
Everything that made that giant tree,

138
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:20,090
is already contained inside this tiny little seed.

139
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:21,614
All it needs is some time,

140
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,545
a little bit of sunshine and rain and...

141
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,088
Voila!

142
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,097
This rock will be a tree?

143
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,460
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right, ok?

144
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,699
You might not feel like
you can do much now,

145
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,268
but that's just because,
well you're not a tree yet.

146
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,360
You just have to give yourself some time.

147
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:39,643
You're still a seed.

148
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,844
But it's a rock.

149
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:43,850
I know it's a rock!

150
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:47,854
Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a rock?
I've spent a lot of time around rocks!

151
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,687
You're weird, but I like you.

152
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:54,293
They're here.

153
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:10,837
They're coming!
Run!

154
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,574
Dot! Dot!

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,205
Mom!

156
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,291
Mom!

157
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:18,336
Thank heavens!

158
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,002
Food to the offering stone.

159
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,641
Ok everyone, single file.

160
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,036
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill.

161
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,092
Now let's go!

162
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,294
Go, go, go!

163
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,291
Come on, keep moving, keep moving!
Good.

164
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,228
Ok. That's everyone.

165
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:04,197
Hey!

166
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,762
Hey, wait for me!

167
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,064
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

168
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,941
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!

169
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,243
Princess Atta!

170
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,222
They come, they eat, they leave.

171
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,038
They come, they eat, they leave.

172
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,191
Excuse me, pardon me.

173
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:04,315
Pardon me, excuse me.
Coming through.

174
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:05,621
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.
Coming through.

175
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,312
Princess, there's something
I need to tell you.

176
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:08,263
Not now, Flik.

177
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,514
But Your Highness, it's about the offering!

178
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,404
Hey, what's going on?

179
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,195
Yeah, where's the food?

180
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,024
What did you do?

181
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,532
It was an accident?

182
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,926
Where's the food?

183
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,176
Hopper.

184
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,837
So, where is it?

185
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,610
Where's my food?

186
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,483
Isn't it up there?

187
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:35,272
What?

188
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:37,189
The food was in a leaf sitting on top...

189
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,170
Excuse me.

190
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,649
Are you sure it's not up there?

191
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,919
Are you saying I'm stupid?

192
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:42,575
No.

193
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,418
Do I look stupid, to you?

194
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,446
Let's just think about the logic, shall we?

195
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,171
Let's just think about it for a second.

196
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,355
If it was up there,

197
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,394
would I be coming down here,

198
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,656
to your level,

199
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:54,963
looking for it?

200
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,640
I...
Why am I even talking to you?

201
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:58,956
You're not the queen.

202
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:00,828
You don't smell like the queen.

203
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:03,313
She's learning to take over for me, Hopper.

204
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,350
Oh, I see.

205
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,099
Under new management.

206
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,771
So it's your fault?

207
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,145
No, it wasn't me, it was...

208
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,264
First rule of leadership.

209
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:16,710
Everything is your fault.

210
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:17,494
But I...

211
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,016
It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess,

212
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,863
one of those circle-of-life kind of things.

213
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:27,301
Now, let me tell you how things
are supposed to work.

214
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,358
The sun grows the food,

215
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,456
the ants pick the food,

216
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,500
the grasshoppers eat the food...

217
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,370
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

218
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,892
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you remember? you remem...

219
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,969
Oh, you shoulda seen it.
Molt!

220
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:41,016
This blue jay, he has him
halfway down his throat, ok,

221
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,741
and Hopper, Hopper's kicking
and screaming, ok.

222
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:44,720
And I'm scared. Ok.
I'm not going anywhere near, ok?

223
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:47,155
Come on, it's a great story.

224
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,295
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed,

225
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,993
that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.

226
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,267
And believe me, no one appreciates
that more than I do.

227
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:58,769
Shut up!

228
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:01,425
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

229
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,198
Do you understand me?

230
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,387
I said, do you understand me?

231
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,636
How can I answer, you said
I couldn't say another word.

232
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,879
Remember Ma!

233
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:18,650
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

234
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,586
There's still a few months till the rains come,

235
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,027
so you can all just try again.

236
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,826
But Hopper, since it's almost
the rainy season,

237
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,163
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

238
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,703
Listen, if you don't keep
your end of the bargain,

239
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,001
then I can't guarantee your safety.

240
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:38,607
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

241
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:41,608
Someone could get hurt.

242
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,450
What's the matter?

243
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,975
You scared of grasshoppers?

244
00:13:58,964 --> 00:13:59,863
Dot!

245
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,587
You don't like Thumper?

246
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,728
Leave her alone!

247
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:15,914
You want her?

248
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:17,336
Go ahead...

249
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,830
take her.

250
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:22,403
No?

251
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,472
Then get back in line.

252
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:34,465
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

253
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,164
So let's double the order of food.

254
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,672
No! But, but...

255
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,341
We'll be back at the end of the season,

256
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,927
when the last,

257
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,795
leaf falls.

258
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,604
You ants have a nice summer.

259
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,135
Let's ride!

260
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,748
Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?

261
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:23,795
Sorry. I...

262
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,916
I'm sorry for the way I am.

263
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,281
I didn't mean for things to go so wrong.

264
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:31,146
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

265
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,684
Well Flik, you did.

266
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,213
I was just trying to help.

267
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:36,802
Then help us, don't help us.

268
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,551
Help, help. Help?

269
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,094
Flik, you are sentenced to one month
digging in the tunnels.

270
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:42,268
Excuse me Your Highness,

271
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,168
need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel within a tunnel project?

272
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,329
Helpers to help us.
It's ok.

273
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:47,506
That's it! That's. We could...
It took,

274
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,065
the whole engineering department,
two days to dig him out.

275
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,909
Send him to Health and Ant Services.

276
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,911
Heavens, no!

277
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:53,091
We could leave the island,

278
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,268
the river bed's dry right now. We'd
just walk right across the river bed.

279
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,801
We could go get helpers.
We could!

280
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,938
We could leave. Sure.
We could go find helpers to help us.

281
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,276
It's perfect!

282
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,047
Perfect?
What's so perfect?

283
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,507
Your Highness, don't you see?

284
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,615
We could send someone to get help!

285
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,451
Leave the island?

286
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,260
No, why didn't I think of that?

287
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,223
Because it's suicide!

288
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:12,993
She's right!

289
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:14,957
We never leave the island.
Never leave!

290
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:17,368
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!

291
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,667
Exactly!
Bigger bugs!

292
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,265
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight.

293
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,936
And forever rid us of Hopper
and his gang!

294
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:25,786
Ludicrous!

295
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:28,030
Who would do a crazy
thing like that?

296
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:30,145
I'll volunteer.
I'd be very happy to volunteer.

297
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:32,483
You got a lot of spunk, kid,

298
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,405
but no one's gonna help
a bunch of ants.

299
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,051
At least we could try.

300
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,043
I. I. I could. I could travel to the city!
I could search there!

301
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,560
If you went, you'd be on that silly
search for weeks.

302
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:43,626
Royal huddle.

303
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,626
Great idea, Princess. It's perfect!
Exactly.

304
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,789
Wait a minute, what did
we just decide here?

305
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:49,694
To let Flik leave.

306
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:52,570
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

307
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,943
You see, with Flik gone, he can't...
He can't mess anything up!

308
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,246
Flik, after much deliberation,

309
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,383
we have decided,
to grant you your request.

310
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:04,268
Really?

311
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:05,369
Really?
Really.

312
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,021
Thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

313
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,570
I. I. I won't let you down,

314
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,140
I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise.
Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. No, forget it

315
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,526
Oh, but I should probably help repair
the damage before I go, don't you think?

316
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,613
No! No, no! No! No, no! No! No, no!

317
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:17,190
Just go.
Just leave!

318
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,228
Hey.

319
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,534
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!

320
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:04,775
Bye, now.

321
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,882
All right.

322
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,223
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful morning?

323
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:27,367
My dad says he gives you one hour
before you come back to the island crying.

324
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,002
Does he, now?

325
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,038
My dad doesn't think that.
He doesn't?

326
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,965
No, he's betting you're gonna die.

327
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,972
Yeah, he says if the heat doesn't get you,
the birds will.

328
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:37,978
Well, I think he's gonna make it.

329
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:41,675
Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

330
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,980
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up all right. Come on.

331
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,818
She's entitled to her opinion too.

332
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,095
So go, already.

333
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,667
Hey!
The city's that way.

334
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:04,444
I know.

335
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,991
You're supposed to look for bugs,
not dandelions.

336
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,811
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

337
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:11,938
That's right.

338
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:14,680
Here I go, for the colony!

339
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:17,504
And for oppressed ants everywhere!

340
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,584
Hey!

341
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:27,141
Hey-hey-hey!

342
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,666
Bye, Flik!

343
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,306
Good luck, Flik!

344
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,210
Bye!

345
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:51,948
Flik!

346
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,919
I'm... ok!

347
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:57,961
Your dad's right.

348
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
He's gonna die.

349
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,384
You just watch.

350
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:04,198
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!

351
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,277
Get back! Get back!

352
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:11,225
Get back, you horrible beast!

353
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:12,765
I have no fear!

354
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:15,537
Oh, my goodness.

355
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:19,512
Oh, no!

356
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,145
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
Owie! Owie, owie.

357
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,814
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's ok.

358
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:33,426
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

359
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:35,993
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!

360
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,085
Oh, no!
You! Come here!

361
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,627
I want my money back!

362
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,803
No refunds after the first two minutes.

363
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,368
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

364
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:47,433
We're losing the audience!
You clowns get out there now!

365
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,830
I hate performing
on an empty stomach!

366
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:51,162
Do your act, Heimlich.

367
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,129
Then you can eat.
P.T what's the point?

368
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,372
Not now, Slim.

369
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:57,683
What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.

370
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,603
That's because you're a clown!

371
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,975
No, it's because I'm a prop!

372
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,904
You always cast me as the broom,

373
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,849
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

374
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:09,195
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny!

375
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,097
Now go!

376
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:11,688
You parasite.

377
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,406
Spring's in the air.

378
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:27,642
And I'm a flower
with nothing interesting to say.

379
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,018
A bee!

380
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,363
I am a cute little bumblebee!

381
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,445
Here I come!

382
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,222
Slow down, you flowers!

383
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,677
Candy corn!

384
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,026
Here, Here. let me help you to finish it.

385
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:43,939
Hey, cutie!

386
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,887
Wanna pollinate with a real bug?

387
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:52,576
Come to papa! yeah!

388
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,380
So, being a ladybug
automatically makes me a girl,

389
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,700
is that it, fly boy?

390
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,596
You lie she's a guy!

391
00:21:58,597 --> 00:21:59,984
Francis, leave them alone.

392
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,486
They are poo-poo heads!

393
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,806
Not again.

394
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,758
Judging by your breath,

395
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,942
you must have been buzzing
around a dung heap all day.

396
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:08,158
Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

397
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,417
All right, we're dying out there.

398
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,801
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny...

399
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,097
He's in a trance.

400
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,111
Well, get him out of it!

401
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,107
You and your husband are up now.

402
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,342
Manny, we're on.

403
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,213
Yet again, it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

404
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,816
Gypsy, come.

405
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,967
The stage is the other way, dear.
Yes, of course.

406
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,356
Anytime, pal!

407
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm gonna pick the hairs out
of your head one by one!

408
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:42,341
Take your best shot!
You name the place!

409
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:43,127
Oh, yeah?

410
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,958
Yeah, because when you get there,
you are dead!

411
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,830
Francis, let me handle this.

412
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,031
That's no way to speak to a lady.

413
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:49,480
I heard that, you twig.

414
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:53,231
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent,

415
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,996
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

416
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,477
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

417
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,542
I give you the Chinese Cabinet,

418
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,450
of Metamorphosis!

419
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,123
Rosie, whole troupe on stage!
Finale now!

420
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,855
Ok, I just need time to...
Now!

421
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,928
Coming, coming.

422
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,359
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.

423
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,799
Don't you understand?
We are up!

424
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,833
Hey!
Hey! They don't understand me.

425
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,103
I summon the voice of Confucius...

426
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,737
Get off the stage, you old hack!

427
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,341
I demand to know who said that!

428
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,283
How dare you!

429
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,055
Ingrates!

430
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,632
Manny?

431
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,181
Manny!

432
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,891
I only got 24 hours to live
and I aint gonna waste it here.

433
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,199
Come on.

434
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,369
I've just about had it with these losers!

435
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,665
Flaming death!

436
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,867
I hold in my hand the match...

437
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,379
the match that decides whether
two bugs live or die this very evening.

438
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,916
In a moment,

439
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:14,217
I will light this trail of matches...

440
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,404
leading to a sheet of flypaper,

441
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,940
dowsed in lighter fluid!

442
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,285
Aimed directly at the flypaper,

443
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,612
are Tuck and Roll,

444
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,831
the pill bug cannonballs!

445
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,158
The cannon will be triggered by Dim,

446
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,548
trained to jump at the sound of this bell,

447
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:33,891
set to go off in 15 seconds.

448
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,352
Our pill bugs' only hope of survival,

449
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,503
is our mistress of the high wire, Rosie!

450
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,338
Secured to a web line of exact length,

451
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,410
Rosie will plummet down to these two posts,

452
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,013
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds!

453
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:55,957
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...

454
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,563
blind folded!

455
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,270
Ladies and gentlemen, may I suggest
that those of you with weak constitutions,

456
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:08,685
leave the arena,

457
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,364
for this act is so dangerous.

458
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,211
That if the slightest thing should go wrong...

459
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:14,989
No!

460
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:15,619
Go?

461
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,060
Ok, through the tunnel...
Ok, that's done!

462
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:27,093
P.T!
Oh, no!

463
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:30,008
Rosie!

464
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,298
Water! We need some water!

465
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,657
Water, water, water, water, water!

466
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,575
Get me outta here!

467
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,828
It's the web. I'm sorry.

468
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,446
You're all fired.

469
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,101
We got the water!

470
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,149
Here we come, P.T!
We'll save you.

471
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:06,996
Burn him again!

472
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,003
No, Harry, no!

473
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:28,543
Don't look at the light!

474
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,157
I can't help it!

475
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:31,811
It's so beautiful!

476
00:26:37,265 --> 00:26:39,063
Try not to look like a country bug.

477
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,298
Blend. Blend in.

478
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,005
Hey, Buggy!

479
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,305
What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.

480
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,616
The city!

481
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:18,096
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water,

482
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:21,536
empty bean can and dead rat.

483
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,442
Watch your stingers. All aboard!
Hey, watch it.

484
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,504
Hey! Get out of the way!
Oh, sorry.

485
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,796
Watch where you're going!
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:28,821
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't...

487
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:29,550
I mean...

488
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,045
Sorry!

489
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,188
Are you? I'm-I'm-I'm
I'm really, really sorry.

490
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:36,614
That was an-an ac-accid-an accident.

491
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:40,238
Hey, don't come back!

492
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,958
I'll show you who's tough!

493
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,196
And stay out!

494
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,786
Tough bugs!

495
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:51,472
I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly...

496
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,974
Move it!

497
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:55,442
Hey, waiter!

498
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:56,827
I'm in my soup!

499
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,114
I've been working out.
Feel my wing.

500
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:02,907
Yo! Two Black Flags over here!

501
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,211
Hair of the dog you bit.

502
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:10,116
Hey, who ordered the poo-poo platter?

503
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:13,923
Here you go, slick. Enjoy.

504
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,358
Hey, I said no salt!

505
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,537
Pardon me, sir. I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment.

506
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:23,305
I represent a colony of ants,

507
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,919
and, and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know mean bugs, the sort of bugs...

508
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:27,693
Fired by a flea,

509
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:29,358
how humiliating!

510
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:31,046
Let's face it. We stink.

511
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,348
You fired. You fired!
You fired!

512
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,325
Will you shut up?

513
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,570
Hey!
You fired!

514
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,845
Someday I will be a beautiful butterfly,

515
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,155
and then everything will be better.

516
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,840
I can't believe the
troupe is breaking up.

517
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,620
We've always been together.

518
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:48,245
Farewell, my friends.

519
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,450
To the audience we'll never have.

520
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:55,736
Hey Francis!

521
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,558
Your boyfriends from the circus are here!

522
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,334
There she is.

523
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,596
Hello there, girlie bug.

524
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:09,976
Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

525
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,413
Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud,

526
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,287
what you said to us at the circus.
Yeah.

527
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,353
Something about buzzing around a dung heap?

528
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:20,507
Excuse me.

529
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,164
Hi. I represent an ant colony and we're...

530
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,927
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

531
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:30,673
Sir?

532
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,202
<i>♪ Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home ♪</i>

533
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,411
Not so tough now, are you?

534
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,908
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

535
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,844
Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.

536
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,549
I want to be LittleJohn!

537
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,679
What part can I play?

538
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,176
You see, I'm looking
for tough, warrior bugs.

539
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:48,703
Stand back, you flies!

540
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:51,682
We are the greatest
warriors in all bugdom!

541
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:53,081
Warrior bugs!

542
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,313
My sword!

543
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,299
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

544
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:57,367
LittleJohn?

545
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:58,501
What ho, Robin?

546
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:01,229
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!

547
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:03,702
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!

548
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,794
Jawohl!
Thrust. Parry.

549
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:07,874
Lunge!

550
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,443
Me thinketh it's not working!

551
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:12,814
Back to Sherwood Forest!

552
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:14,275
Schnell! Schnell!
What's going on in there?

553
00:30:28,898 --> 00:30:30,726
Help! Help!
Get me out!

554
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:45,449
You're perfect!

555
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:47,630
Oh, great ones!

556
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:51,009
I have been scouting for bugs
with your exact talents!

557
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:52,455
A talent scout.

558
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,980
My colony's in trouble.

559
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,927
Grasshoppers are coming!
We've been forced to prepare all this food.

560
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:00,149
Dinner theater!
Food?

561
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:03,258
Please!
Will you help us?

562
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:06,735
Where are they?

563
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:07,914
We'll take the job!

564
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,688
Really?
Yes, yes, yes!

565
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:12,976
You can explain the details on the way.

566
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:17,515
Ok, come on, everyone.
Break a leg!

567
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:19,354
You're vicious!

568
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,218
Hold on, Mr. Ant.

569
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:23,519
Amazing!

570
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:26,040
This is too good to be true!

571
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:51,839
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

572
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,650
But then, Princess Atta.

573
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,071
Boy, is she one in a million,

574
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,220
she let me go out and find you.

575
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,223
And after seeing you fight off those flies.

576
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:02,586
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in perfect for a surprise!

577
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:27,633
Dr. Flora!

578
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,546
Oh, my dear.
Not another one.

579
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,556
This is insane.
Insane.

580
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:34,024
There's just not enough
food left on the island!

581
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,687
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

582
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,502
Well, we have to try, Thorny.

583
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:40,513
We don't have any choice.

584
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,391
Yeah, I know.

585
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:46,983
Hey, look who's playing lookout again.

586
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:48,229
Little Speck!

587
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:50,542
The name is Dot.

588
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:52,867
Well Spot, still looking for Flik?

589
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,432
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

590
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,675
Flik!
He did it! He did it!

591
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,085
What?
Quit shoving!

592
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,163
This is it!

593
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,513
This is Ant Island!

594
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,698
Flik! Over here!

595
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,556
Flik! Flik!

596
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,434
Hey!

597
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,858
He did it! He did it!
He did it! Yeah!

598
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,162
He did it!
Cool!

599
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,077
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

600
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:26,873
That's right!
We need a miracle!

601
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,249
Run for your lives!

602
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:44,226
Ta-da!

603
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,236
Once again, our reputation precedes us.

604
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,612
Hey, everybody!

605
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,022
Hey! I'm back!

606
00:33:57,776 --> 00:33:58,895
Hey, guys!

607
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:00,316
Hey-hey!

608
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:02,223
Look, look, look who's here with me!

609
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:03,014
Flik!

610
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,133
Flik! Flik!
You're back!

611
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,659
I knew you could do it!

612
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:08,495
Flik?

613
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,441
It's Flik!
What?

614
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,465
Yeah.
No, it's not Flik.

615
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,723
Flik has returned!
He's back?

616
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:22,094
And he's accompanied by savage insects!

617
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,268
What?

618
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,574
How? He...

619
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:27,593
He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!

620
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:29,776
Oh, look at this, look at this.
This is great. Look.

621
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:31,427
Oh, my ticker!

622
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,946
So, what are you supposed to be?

623
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,272
He's a stick, stupid.
He hit bugs with him.

624
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:36,989
No that's an oversimplification.

625
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:38,399
That's right, kids. Like this!
Ah no.

626
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Put me down!

627
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:44,453
Hey! My, you just pop
right open there, dont you?

628
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:48,158
Oh, oh. Kids, he's kinda ticklish.

629
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:50,247
Let's come on out.
Be careful.

630
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:56,795
Well my boy, you came through.

631
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,497
Aphie and I are very impressed.

632
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:01,207
Princess Atta!

633
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,875
Hey! Hey guys, this is Princess Atta!

634
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,265
She's the one that sent me to find you!

635
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,329
Atta! Atta! Did you see
that really big bug over there?

636
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,349
He looks absolutely ferocious!

637
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,167
They're our ticket out of this mess!

638
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:13,186
They came just in time!
That's right!

639
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:15,318
So, Princess Atta, what do you think?

640
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,442
No, no, no, no, wait!

641
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,383
This was not supposed to happen.

642
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,786
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losing the job.

643
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,964
We don't fight grasshoppers.

644
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:27,632
We don't, but they will.
Bingo!

645
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:29,830
We gotta sweeten the deal.

646
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,917
Your Majesty,

647
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,922
ladies and gentlemen,

648
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:37,371
boys and girls of all ages,

649
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:41,376
our troupe here guarantees
a performance, like no other!

650
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:43,638
Why, when your grasshopper
friends get here,

651
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:47,319
we are gonna knock them dead!

652
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,889
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

653
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,274
Come on. Hurry!

654
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,860
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

655
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:29,896
Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

656
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,287
And to make our official
welcome complete.

657
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,227
Mr. Soil?

658
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:43,461
Yes, Your Highness?

659
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:45,293
He's our resident thespian.

660
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:48,113
Last year he played the lead in Picnic.

661
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:51,311
The children, and myself,

662
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:54,964
have quickly put together
a little presentation,

663
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,964
in honor of our guests.

664
00:36:57,392 --> 00:37:00,225
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?

665
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:02,760
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Oh, they're cute!

666
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:09,461
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class,

667
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:12,093
would like to present you with this,

668
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:13,892
a mural we have drawn,

669
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:18,145
of you bugs, helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.

670
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:22,583
Look at the beautiful colors of the blood.

671
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:26,179
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

672
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:34,822
♪ <i>I tell you a tale, of heroes so bold,</i> ♪

673
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:39,057
♪ <i>Who vanquished our grasshopper
enemies of old.</i> ♪

674
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:43,728
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

675
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:47,037
We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?

676
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,237
Who will come to save us poor ants?

677
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:53,407
We are the warriors, here to defend you!

678
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:58,711
I die! Die! Die!

679
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,672
Hail, the bugs!

680
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:06,226
Thank you, thank you!

681
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,548
Thank you!

682
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:08,878
Hey, hey, hey!

683
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:10,184
I say we go.

684
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,031
Ok, honey. You're up.

685
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:17,264
We're all very very grateful to have...
Here, here.

686
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:18,375
<i>The warriors...</i>

687
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:21,878
<i>Thanks.</i>

688
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:23,846
<i>First of all,</i>

689
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,403
<i>I'd like to thank the warriors</i>

690
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:28,510
<i>for helping us in our fight,
against the grasshoppers.</i>

691
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,361
<i>Secondly,</i>

692
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:31,886
<i>I would like to thank,</i>

693
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:33,029
<i>Flik,</i>

694
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:36,085
<i>for his forthright thinking...
Thank you, Your Highness.</i>

695
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,459
<i>Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.</i>

696
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:42,264
<i>Because it was you, Princess Atta.</i>

697
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:45,033
<i>You believed in me and
you sent me on my Quest,</i>

698
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,894
You tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.

699
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,337
<i>Now, I know I've made mistakes,</i>
Go!

700
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,265
<i>In the past, and I hope that
this will make up...</i>

701
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,442
Flik!
Not right now Rosie.

702
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:52,704
I'm making a speech.

703
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:57,079
<i>Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our...</i>

704
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,782
No, there's no circus around here.

705
00:38:58,907 --> 00:38:59,873
<i>So, I...</i>

706
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:10,586
Your Highness, the warriors have called
for a secret meeting to plan for a circus,

707
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,106
circumventing the oncoming
hordes so they can trapeze...

708
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,131
trap them with ease!

709
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:15,631
Shouldn't I come too?
No!

710
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,617
Sorry no is classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P.

711
00:39:19,643 --> 00:39:21,454
You know, strictly B.Y.O.B.
Bye!

712
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:25,333
Sorry. Sorry I have to take the warriors
away so early but you know...

713
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,541
they have a...
they have a lot to get done,

714
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,240
with the battle looming and all.

715
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:31,612
So... please, everyone enjoy the party.

716
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:33,978
B.Y.O.B?

717
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,620
Thanks again. Bye.
Bye-bye.

718
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:37,632
Ok, just...

719
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,471
Just, just get in there. Go!

720
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:40,757
Go! Go, go, go!

721
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:43,826
Circus bugs?

722
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:46,362
How can you be circus bugs?

723
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,664
What?
Hey, hey, hey.

724
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,989
You said nothing about
killing grasshoppers pal.

725
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,013
You lied to us!
Ja!

726
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,229
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?

727
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:55,738
This my friends, is false advertising.

728
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,198
How dare you!

729
00:39:57,623 --> 00:40:00,872
You sir, are the charlatan in this scenario,

730
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,309
touting your wares as a talent scout,

731
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:06,145
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

732
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:08,051
Good day to you, sir.

733
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:14,750
Wait! No, no!

734
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:17,127
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
You can't go.

735
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:18,293
You have got to help me.

736
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:20,549
Give me some time,
I'll come up with a plan.

737
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:22,285
Just go tell them the truth!

738
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,960
They can't, they can't know the truth.
The truth you see is bad.

739
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:26,978
I will be branded with this
mistake for the rest of my life.

740
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:29,121
My children's children
will walk down the street,

741
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:30,325
and people will point and say,

742
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:33,225
Look! There goes the
spawn of Flik, the loser!

743
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:38,178
You know, all right, fine.
Yeah, ok. Just go.

744
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,643
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

745
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,779
If you could squish me,

746
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:44,542
that would be great, because...

747
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,623
when they find out, I'm as good as dead.

748
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:47,727
Flik!

749
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:51,636
I really do think I should be part
of this meeting.

750
00:40:52,262 --> 00:40:53,121
Flik!

751
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,066
Princess Atta!
What a nice surprise.

752
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,969
Just what exactly is going on?

753
00:40:58,137 --> 00:41:00,036
I would like to speak with the so-called,

754
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:01,061
warriors.
You can't,

755
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,089
I mean, they are in the middle of
a top secret meeting right now,

756
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,110
and they really should not be disturbed now.

757
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,277
Right, guys?

758
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:09,597
Could you excu... pl... Could you.

759
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:11,006
Could you excuse me, please?

760
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,759
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please don't go!

761
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,142
I'm not going anywhere.

762
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,568
What is going on?

763
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:18,272
Flik?

764
00:41:18,323 --> 00:41:19,218
Flik!

765
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:21,944
I knew it!

766
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:26,491
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Please don't go!

767
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,425
No!
Quick, he's losing it!

768
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,344
No, no, no, no, no!
You can't go!

769
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:32,827
I'm desperate!

770
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:34,686
Really? I couldn't tell.

771
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,505
Come on, wings.

772
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,410
Help!

773
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,576
Mother, Flik is up to something.

774
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,436
No! No!
Ok Flik, time to put you down.

775
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,919
Get him off me! He's cutting off
the circulation to my foot.

776
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,484
Let go!
No, no, no, no!

777
00:41:50,756 --> 00:41:52,309
Please, please, don't go!

778
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:54,743
Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it now.

779
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:55,767
Drop the stick.

780
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:56,871
Drop it.

781
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:57,979
Run!

782
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:01,968
Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.

783
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,031
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

784
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:15,011
This way.

785
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:17,280
There they are.

786
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:20,119
A bird!

787
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:22,210
Flik!

788
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:23,580
Look!
Dot!

789
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:26,992
Flik!

790
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:32,459
Dot!
My baby!

791
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,928
I gotcha! I gotcha!

792
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:38,529
I gotcha, I gotcha!

793
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:46,741
I can't see!
Somebody do something!

794
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:47,749
Are they all right?

795
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,310
Did anyone see are they all right?

796
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:50,995
I can't see!
What is happening?

797
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:54,560
Dot?

798
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:56,135
Good heavens, they're in trouble!

799
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:58,034
Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis...

800
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,245
You guys, I've got an idea!

801
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,157
Here! I've got it!

802
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:05,957
Please, ma'am, wake up!
Wake up!

803
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,138
Help! Help!

804
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,394
Mr. Early Bird!

805
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:20,299
How about a nice, tasty
worm on a stick?

806
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:21,843
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

807
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:24,775
Nice and juicy,

808
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,338
succulent.

809
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:28,517
Let's go!

810
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,387
There they are!
Flik! Help!

811
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:36,064
Ok.

812
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,379
Flik!

813
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:40,647
It's going to be ok, Dot.

814
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:44,304
Bye-bye, birdie!

815
00:43:46,273 --> 00:43:47,698
Help!
I'm stuck!

816
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:48,973
Pull me down!

817
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:50,708
Schnell, schnell, schnell!

818
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:53,782
The caterpillar's using himself as live bait!

819
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:54,833
How brave!

820
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,316
Suck it in, man!

821
00:44:09,662 --> 00:44:10,727
My leg!

822
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:26,780
The bird! The bird!
Look out for the bird!

823
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,942
Flik!

824
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,850
Up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a!

825
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,033
What is that?

826
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:59,076
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!

827
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,726
Applause. I'm in heaven!

828
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:23,804
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs for
rescuing our smallest member, Princess Dot.

829
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,567
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas!

830
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:30,869
We voted you our honorary den mother!

831
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:33,747
What?

832
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:35,473
Great.

833
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,774
Den mother.

834
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,636
All right girls, let's move
your keisters outta here now.

835
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:41,322
The patient needs her rest, you know.

836
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:42,307
Come on.

837
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,426
Excuse me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second?

838
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:46,624
Sure.

839
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:48,310
Again...

840
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:51,080
Thank you all, very, very much.

841
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,324
Oh, stop it.
You're too kind. Thank you.

842
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:56,570
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?

843
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:58,072
You? No.

844
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:00,237
Good. Because you see...

845
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,576
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

846
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:04,971
You did?

847
00:46:06,548 --> 00:46:07,882
Don't tell them I said that.

848
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,183
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.

849
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,120
Princess, you're doing a great job.

850
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:14,669
Thanks, you're sweet.

851
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:16,518
You're wrong, but sweet.

852
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,282
I know what everyone really thinks.

853
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:20,245
I don't follow you.

854
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:21,370
Everyone.

855
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:22,562
The whole colony.

856
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:25,439
Nobody really believes I can do this job.

857
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,530
It's like, they're all watching me.

858
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:30,294
Just, just...

859
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,494
Waiting for you to screw up.

860
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:38,310
Flik, I owe you an apology.

861
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:39,430
For what?

862
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:42,151
Well, I haven't been that nice to you and...

863
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,465
I'm sorry.

864
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,453
If there's any way I can make it up to you...

865
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:47,155
Hey! I know!

866
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:50,551
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?

867
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:52,094
Me?
Oh, sure.

868
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:55,797
You've got a great rapport with them,
especially after that rescue.

869
00:46:55,923 --> 00:46:57,656
It was very brave.

870
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,127
Really? Naw, naw...
Well,

871
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,091
not every bug would face a bird.

872
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:02,853
I mean, even Hopper's afraid of them.

873
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,413
Yeah, I guess, you know maybe I...

874
00:47:04,874 --> 00:47:05,892
Say that again?

875
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:08,629
I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

876
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:12,982
Thank you.

877
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,008
Hopper's afraid of birds!

878
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,269
And I don't blame him!

879
00:47:19,722 --> 00:47:20,956
Oh, this is perfect.

880
00:47:21,024 --> 00:47:22,081
We can get rid of Hopper,

881
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,081
and no one has to know that I messed up.

882
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:25,920
You just keep pretending you're warriors.

883
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:27,494
Flik, honey.

884
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,813
We are not about
to fight grasshoppers, ok?

885
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,050
You'll be gone before
the grasshoppers ever arrive.

886
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:33,517
It will be easy, here's what we do.

887
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,204
Not another word.

888
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:39,269
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,

889
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,176
but we'll have no part of it.

890
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,101
Excuse me?

891
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,394
Could we get the warriors' autographs?

892
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:46,381
Autographs? Ja!

893
00:47:47,649 --> 00:47:50,085
So, you fellas catch the action today?

894
00:47:50,253 --> 00:47:52,012
The bird went...
and it just missed you!

895
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:53,009
Aren't you sweet?

896
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:56,115
And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack!

897
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,926
That's just all part of the plan.
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:47:59,095 --> 00:48:01,122
And then you dive-bombed into the bush!

899
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:03,098
There you go, my boy.

900
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:04,522
Thanks!

901
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:06,452
Ma... Major.

902
00:48:06,453 --> 00:48:08,654
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

903
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:11,651
I outrank everyone here.
Remember that.

904
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:12,790
Yes, sir!

905
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:13,843
Dismissed!

906
00:48:14,545 --> 00:48:16,295
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be a praying mantis!

907
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,633
I'm gonna be a stick bug!

908
00:48:18,181 --> 00:48:20,411
They're all so cool, I can't pick!

909
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,180
Delightful for lads.

910
00:48:24,106 --> 00:48:25,541
You were saying, Flik?

911
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:28,717
All right, we are going to build a bird.

912
00:48:28,793 --> 00:48:31,176
A bird that we can
operate from the inside,

913
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,422
which would then be hoisted...

914
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:36,790
hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

915
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:39,937
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

916
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:44,298
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

917
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:47,143
Now it's going
to take everyone's involvement,

918
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:49,076
to make this plan a reality.

919
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:52,441
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,

920
00:48:52,616 --> 00:48:56,008
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,

921
00:48:56,087 --> 00:49:00,347
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!

922
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:26,143
<i>Perfect!
Ok, hit your marks!</i>

923
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:44,893
Hi, Flik.

924
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:55,172
I love what you did with your antenna.
Oh, thank you.

925
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:57,816
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

926
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,174
All right, that's it!

927
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:01,772
Out! Out! Everybody out!

928
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:04,748
Ok, now you're gonna cry, right?
Now you're gonna cry.

929
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:06,339
See if I care. Go ahead and cry.
Go ahead!

930
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:08,791
Please, don't cry. Please.

931
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:21,739
Ok lowe.

932
00:50:22,363 --> 00:50:23,363
Lower.

933
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:25,811
You got it. And that's it!

934

Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

935
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:34,084
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

936
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:35,719
Done!
Ruben Kincaid!

937
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:37,553
Hey!

938
00:50:37,878 --> 00:50:39,871
Good job, guys! Nice work!

939
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:44,161
Up, down.

940
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:46,285
Up, down.

941
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,509
Up, down.

942
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:56,169
Read them and weep.

943
00:51:13,092 --> 00:51:14,251
Flik, watch out!

944
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:16,993
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

945
00:51:24,003 --> 00:51:25,027
There you go.

946
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:26,725
Good job, fellas.

947
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,147
Keep up the good work.

948
00:51:49,795 --> 00:51:50,825
Ok!

949
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,003
You're fired!

950
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,584
Yes!

951
00:52:55,394 --> 00:52:57,224
Look at me!
I'm barefooting!

952
00:52:58,699 --> 00:52:59,566
Yo, bugito,

953
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,624

954
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:03,498

00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:29,793
We go all the way back there
and it starts to rain,

957
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:32,116
we might as well be sucking bug spray.

958
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:33,781
Don't even say that!

959
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:34,735
You know something?

960
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:37,127
You're making a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?

961
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:38,571
You should tell Hopper.

962
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:40,021
Good idea.

963
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:43,137
But, you know, it's really not our place.

964
00:53:43,311 --> 00:53:46,042
I mean you're his brother.
That makes you, like...

965
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:48,575
the vice president of the gang.

966
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,184
It kinda does, doesn't it?

967
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,916
Ok, I'll tell him.

968
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,755
Boy I should talk to you guys more often.

969
00:53:54,756 --> 00:53:56,134
What if Hopper doesn't like it?

970
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,648
Then at least the genius
will get smacked and not us.

971
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,291
Vice President Molt.

972
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:04,590
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

973
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:07,006

974
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:08,831
Hey ya, Hop.

975
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:09,536
Go away.

976
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:11,659
That's fine, then I won't tell you my idea.

977
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,304
Good!
Ok, ok.

978
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:14,207
I'll tell you anyway.

979
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,108
You see, I've been thinking,

980
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,373
Ok, which is something I do,
being vice president and all.

981
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,003
And this is a thought and it was mine.

982
00:54:19,027 --> 00:54:21,614
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

983
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:23,616
I mean you don't even like grain.
What?

984
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:25,785
You're right, I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

985
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:28,281
Actually it wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!

986
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:30,984
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!

Yeah!

990
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:54,915
What was I thinking,
going back to Ant Island.

991
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:56,518
I mean, we just got here,

992
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:59,587
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

993
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,522
Right?
Why go back?

994
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,863
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.

995
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:10,990
Yeah, but we can forget about him!

996
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,654
Yeah, it was just one ant.

997
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:15,133
One ant!

998
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:19,607
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!

999
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:20,681
Yeah, boss.

1000
00:55:20,706 --> 00:55:21,912
They're puny!

1001
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:23,623
Puny.

1002
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:28,579
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

1003
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:30,716
Did that hurt?

1004
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:31,849
Nope.

1005
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,318
Well, how about this one?

1006
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:35,080
Are you kidding?

1007
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:38,189
Well, how about this?

1008
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:53,502
You let one ant stand up to us,

1009
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:56,567
then they all might stand up.

1010
00:55:57,045 --> 00:56:01,673
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.

1011
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,354
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!

1012
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:08,566
It's not about food.

1013
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,776
It's about keeping those ants in line.

1014
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,163
That's why we're going back!

1015
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,526
Does anybody else wanna stay?

00:58:57,895 --> 00:58:59,655
Jiminy H. Cricket!

1064
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:04,501
They're back!

1065
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:06,337
Get ready, everybody!

1066
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:07,338
Get to your posts!

1067
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:11,774
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.

1068
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:13,991
Come on, everyone.
You know your jobs!

1069
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:15,834
Let's go, go, go, go!

1070
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:19,241
Look out!

1071
00:59:21,953 --> 00:59:23,820
Oh there. Steady, girls. That's it.

1072
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:25,613
It's P.T.
P.T?

1073
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,668
Greetings and salutations!

1074
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:30,993
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

1075
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:34,198
I am the great P.T, Flea!

1076
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:38,664
I'm in need of your assis...
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

1077
00:59:38,937 --> 00:59:41,804
Look, I've been going
from anthill to anthill.

1078
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:44,172
I'm looking for a bunch
of circus performers.

1079
00:59:44,297 --> 00:59:45,896
Have you seen them?

1080
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:51,312
Wait a second.
Aint that Staff Sergeant Slim?

1081
00:59:51,384 --> 00:59:53,311
Nope! No, no, no.
I'm sorry, no, but...

1082
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:55,520
No one has seen anyone like that around here.
Be quiet!

1083
00:59:55,544 --> 00:59:56,881
No one has ever seen anyone Hey!

1084
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:58,452
Like that around here.
So, you'll probably...

1085
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:01,077
You'll probably want to get going, I guess
you got a lot of other anthills to check into so,

1086
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:01,948
bye!

1087
01:00:04,295 --> 01:00:06,460
Guys, I've been looking all over for you!

1088
01:00:06,632 --> 01:00:09,359
Flaming Death is a huge hit!
P.T!

1089
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:11,400
I'm serious, word of mouth got around.
P. T! No!

1090
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:14,286
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!

1091
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:16,475
It must have been a foot long!
P. T, no!

1092
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,066
So I figured it out, you guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

1093
01:00:20,067 --> 01:00:22,414
and then we do it all over again!

1094
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:24,946
We'll be the top circus act in the business!

1095
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:27,652
You mean, you're not warriors?

1096
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,027
Are you kidding?

1097
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:32,072
These guys are the lousiest
circus bugs you've ever seen.

1098
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:34,759
And they're gonna make me rich!

1099
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:38,617
You mean to tell me that our
entire defensive strategy,

1100
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,888
was concocted by clowns?

1101
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:43,094
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We really thought Flik's idea was gonna work.

1102
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:49,902
Tell me this isn't true.

1103
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:50,965
No, you don't... You don't...

1104
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:52,969
This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time!

1105
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:54,946
The last leaf is about to fall!

1106
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:57,312
We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!

1107
01:00:57,383 --> 01:00:59,613
If Hopper finds out what we almost did...

1108
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,113
Hopper is not going to find out.

1109
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:06,346
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

1110
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:08,556
You bugs were never here.

1111
01:01:08,757 --> 01:01:10,428
So I suggest you all leave.

1112
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:11,192
But the bird!

1113
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:12,981
The. The. The bird will work.

1114
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:17,265
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself,

1115
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:19,332
before the rest of his colony.

1116
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:20,221
What?

1117
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,418
The point is Flik, you lied to us.

1118
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:24,059
No, no, no! I. I... just...

1119
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:25,267
You lied, Flik.

1120
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:26,899
You lied to her.

1121
01:01:27,047 --> 01:01:29,942
You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!

1122
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:32,812
And like an idiot, I believed you.

1123
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:33,802
But I...

1124
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:35,573
I was just afraid, that...

1125
01:01:36,223 --> 01:01:38,221
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

1126
01:01:40,894 --> 01:01:43,462
I just wanted to make, a difference.

1127
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,412
I want you to leave, Flik.

1128
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:49,001
And this time, don't come back.

1129
01:01:59,546 --> 01:02:01,174
Tough crowd.

1130
01:02:04,249 --> 01:02:05,249
Flik!

1131
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:01,006
That's it? But there's got
to be more food on the island!

1132
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:03,009
If we give up any more we'll starve.

1133
01:03:03,077 --> 01:03:04,637
Hopper won't accept this!

1134
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:13,987
Mother, it's not enough.

1135
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:15,055
What do we do?

1136
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:16,247
I, I don't know.

1137
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,381
You little termites!

1138
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:53,592
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?

1139
01:03:55,662 --> 01:03:57,860
But Hopper, we ran out of time!

1140
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:00,067
Have you been playing all summer?

1141
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:01,723
You think this is a game?

1142
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,086
No, no, please!

1143
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:04,930
Well, guess what?

1144
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,242
You just lost.

1145
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:11,004
Not one ant sleeps,

1146
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,446
until we get every scrap of food,

1147
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,682
on this island!

1148
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:17,697
Just do what he says.

1149
01:04:17,722 --> 01:04:19,846
You don't want to make him mad.
Believe me!

1150
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,398
No, no, no.

1151
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,745
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

1152
01:04:25,593 --> 01:04:27,084
What do you think you're doing?

1153
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,369
Get over there.

1154
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:30,416
Quick! To the clubhouse.

1155
01:04:38,238 --> 01:04:39,238
Hurry!

1156
01:04:48,682 --> 01:04:49,882
Shut up a minute, will you?

1157
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,321
I think I heard something over here.

1158
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:53,185
Have you checked over there?

1159
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:54,081
No, not yet.

1160
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:56,282
Well then get over there
and check it out!

1161
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,420
Wait a minute.

1162
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,760
Hey, I think I found something.

1163
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,369
Cool.
Hey, how do I look?

1164
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,004
Like an idiot.

1165
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,306
I don't know, maybe it'll
keep me dry in the rain.

1166
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,143
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

1167
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,345
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food,

1168
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,711
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind them who's boss.

1169
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:23,850
Then she's dead. They cry... boo-hoo...
we go home. End of story.

1170
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,620
Cool.

1171
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:27,076
I love our job.

1172
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,649
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

1173
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,634
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

1174
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:37,149
Yeah.

1175
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,208
<i>♪ I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich. ♪</i>

1176
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:56,372
<i>♪ I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich. ♪

1177

1178
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,717
<i>♪ I'm rich, rich, rich, ♪
♪ That's who I am. ♪</i>

1179
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:09,266
Poor fellow.

1180
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,413
Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

1181
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:14,793
Don't worry, Flik.

1182
01:07:14,817 --> 01:07:16,827
The circus life isn't so bad.

1183
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,460
Yes, you can be part of our act.

1184
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:19,694
Here! Like this.

1185
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,866
Slapstick! Get it?

1186
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,259
I'm a walkingstick.

1187
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:28,570
Never mind.

1188
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,547
Flik!
Dot?

1189
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,550
Flik, wait!
Wait!

1190
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:35,363
Dot, you're flying!

1191
01:07:35,364 --> 01:07:36,870
Here. What are you doing here?

1192
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:39,151
You, have to go back.

1193
01:07:39,324 --> 01:07:41,258
Hopper moved into the anthill,

1194
01:07:41,526 --> 01:07:43,551
and his gang's eating everything!

1195
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:45,062
Oh, no!
Good heavens!

1196
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,316
And I heard a grasshopper say,

1197
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,686
that when they're finished,

1198
01:07:47,732 --> 01:07:49,825
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

1199
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,731
Oh, not the queen!

1200
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:52,753
We have to do something!

1201
01:07:52,854 --> 01:07:54,520
How?
Come on, you guys, think!

1202
01:07:54,646 --> 01:07:55,951
I know, the bird.

1203
01:07:56,174 --> 01:07:57,933
Yes, of course!
The bird, that's brilliant.

1204
01:07:58,009 --> 01:08:00,201
Ja!
The bird won't work.

1205
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:02,576
What are you talking about?
It was your idea.

1206
01:08:02,802 --> 01:08:04,047
But you said that everything...

1207
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:06,376
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?

1208
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,383
Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.

1209
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:13,452
And that bird is a guaranteed failure.

1210
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:15,886
Just like me.

1211
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:17,973
You listen to me, my boy.

1212
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:20,587
I've made a living out of being a failure.

1213
01:08:20,648 --> 01:08:23,126
And you sir, are not a failure!

1214
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:25,299
Oh but Flik, you've done
so many good things.

1215
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:26,324
Oh, yeah?

1216
01:08:26,348 --> 01:08:28,472
Ok, show me one thing I've done right.

1217
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,068
Us.

1218
01:08:32,477 --> 01:08:34,968
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Dim is right, my boy.

1219
01:08:35,146 --> 01:08:39,783
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.

1220
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:41,127
And if it wasn't for you,

1221
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:44,035
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.

1222
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:45,248
Oh yeah? Well...

1223
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,259
You know what?
He's right.

1224
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:50,821
Lieutenant Gypsy reporting for duty.

1225
01:08:50,896 --> 01:08:53,254
Kid, say the word and we'll
follow you into battle.

1226
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:54,857
We believe in you, my boy.

1227
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,991
Flik, please?

1228
01:09:22,461 --> 01:09:24,525
Pretend it's a seed, ok?

1229
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:32,795
Thanks, Dot.

1230
01:09:37,543 --> 01:09:40,012
Hey, what's with the rock?
Must be an ant thing.

1231
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:43,275
All right, let's do it.

1232
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:45,283
That's the Flik we know and love.

1233
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,342
We're on!
So, what do we do first?

1234
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:51,923
♪ Bugs will pay big bucks to see ♪

1235
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:54,926
♪ A bonfire that is starring me ♪

1236
01:09:55,394 --> 01:09:57,021
P.T, look. Money!

1237
01:09:57,096 --> 01:09:58,127
Where? Where?

1238
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:03,219
All right. Get moving!

1239
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:06,826
Get going.
Move your abdomens, now!

1240
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:08,307
They're rounding everyone up.

1241
01:10:10,776 --> 01:10:12,110
Hey! Turn your butt off.

1242
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:15,747
Hey, guys!
Get me out of this thing, will you?

1243
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:17,750
I promise to start thinking about paying you.

1244
01:10:18,018 --> 01:10:20,414
Hey! Wait, wait!
Ok, I'll pay you! I'll pay you!

1245
01:10:21,387 --> 01:10:23,652
Oh, no!
They've finished collecting the food.

1246
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:26,319
We've got to get the queen now.

1247
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:28,821
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

1248
01:10:35,367 --> 01:10:36,567
Someone's coming!

1249
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:39,721
Hello, kids!

1250
01:10:39,747 --> 01:10:42,131
Ready to make some grasshoppers cry?

1251
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,944
It's payback time, Blueberry-style.

1252
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:47,045
Blueberries rock!

1253
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:48,976
Yeah!
All right!

1254
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,024
<i>Ladies and Gentlebugs!</i>

1255
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,838
<i>Larvae of all stages!</i>

1256
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:59,457
<i>Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus!</i>

1257
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,371
Wait a minute.

1258
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,206
I think I'm going to wet myself.
Steady...

1259
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:18,777
What's going on here?

1260
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:19,736
Well...

1261
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,080
Yes.

1262
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:26,952
We were invited by Princess Atta,
as a surprise for your arrival.

1263
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,147
Squish them.

1264
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:35,631
Hey!

1265
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:49,776
Now that's funny.

1266
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:56,110
I guess we could use a little entertainment.

1267
01:11:56,384 --> 01:11:59,144
Looks like you did something right
for once, Princess.

1268
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,179
On with the show!

1269
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,281
The circus, the circus.

1270
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,844
I love the circus.

1271
01:12:22,442 --> 01:12:23,972
Ba-ba all gone!

1272
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:25,943
Baby wants pie!

1273
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:28,142
Pie? He asked for it.

1274
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:30,306
Should I give it to him?

1275
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:33,212
Yeah! Give him pie!
Give him pie!

1276
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,984
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

1277
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,688
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

1278
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:43,096
Can't tell. As soon as the light goes on,
they scatter!

1279
01:12:58,612 --> 01:12:59,642
Almost there.

1280
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:03,644
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

1281
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:06,480
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.

1282
01:13:06,855 --> 01:13:09,483
Of Metamorphosis!

1283
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:12,218
Utilizing psychic vibrations,

1284
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:15,423
I shall select the perfect volunteer.

1285
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:16,680
Pick me!
Oh, no!

1286
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:18,751
Come on, I'm asking you with my brain.

1287
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,636
Why, Your Majesty!
Me?

1288
01:13:23,104 --> 01:13:25,300
No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

1289
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:27,008
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

1290
01:13:27,976 --> 01:13:31,173
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,

1291
01:13:31,346 --> 01:13:36,449
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

1292
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,414
This is gonna be good!

1293
01:13:40,122 --> 01:13:42,090
Blueberries ready?
Ready.

1294
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:43,517
Ready!

1295
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:47,853
I call upon the ancient Szechwan spirits...

1296
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:51,490
to inhabit the body of our volunteer!

1297
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:53,435
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

1298
01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:55,833
Transformation.

1299
01:13:56,105 --> 01:13:58,096
Transformation!

1300
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,567
Transformation!

1301
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:02,938
Manny's getting good.

1302
01:14:03,412 --> 01:14:05,173
Not now.
If it rains,

1303
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,094
that bird'll get ripped to shreds!

1304
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:14,719
And now, insectus...

1305
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,823
transformitus!

1306
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:26,533
Pretty!

1307
01:14:28,102 --> 01:14:30,372
Thank you, thank you.

1308
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:33,074
That's the signal. That's the signal!

1309
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,977
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.

1310
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:42,726
It's stuck!

1311
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:44,777
That was amazing!
I have no...

1312
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:48,170
How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.

1313
01:14:48,224 --> 01:14:50,715
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
More, more, more!

1314
01:14:50,893 --> 01:14:52,526
More! More! More!
Wait!

1315
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:54,703
Where is she?

1316
01:14:55,028 --> 01:14:56,587
Well, now, actually...

1317
01:14:56,632 --> 01:15:00,300
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.

1318
01:15:00,324 --> 01:15:01,465
That's very true, Hoppy.

1319
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:03,530
I mean, where would the mystery be
if we all knew how it was...

1320
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:04,442
Shutting up.

1321
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:06,271
You can do it!

1322
01:15:06,396 --> 01:15:07,872
You've got to make it work!

1323
01:15:08,874 --> 01:15:09,633
Hey!

1324
01:15:11,547 --> 01:15:13,140
I said, where is she?

1325
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:23,884
Hold on!

1326
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:35,136
Bird! It's a bird!

1327
01:15:55,857 --> 01:15:57,723
Let's get out of here! Go!

1328
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:04,159
Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!

1329
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:07,270
Help me!

1330
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,174
Up, down, up, down.

1331
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:14,243
And turn!

1332
01:16:25,823 --> 01:16:27,783
Oh, my eye! Help me!

1333
01:16:33,765 --> 01:16:35,926
Boysenberry.

1334
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,627
No, no, no, no, no!

1335
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,742
The pain!

1336
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,447
There goes my magic act!

1337
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:54,210
Flaming gas!

1338
01:16:54,211 --> 01:16:55,267
No! P.T!

1339
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:01,923
A direct hit!

1340
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:05,195
Run!

1341
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:07,690
Flik! Help us!

1342
01:17:28,419 --> 01:17:29,419
Dot!

1343
01:17:31,556 --> 01:17:33,108
Ok! Everyone out!

1344
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,112
Hurry!

1345
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:38,496
Where's Dot?
Anyone seen Dot?

1346
01:17:41,732 --> 01:17:44,066
Whose idea was this?

1347
01:17:48,006 --> 01:17:50,270
Was it yours, Princess?

1348
01:17:50,642 --> 01:17:52,804
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be ok.

1349
01:17:53,078 --> 01:17:55,012
Leave her alone, Hopper.

1350
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,602
The bird was my idea.

1351
01:17:57,927 --> 01:17:59,331
I'm the one you want.

1352
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,670
Where do you get
the gall to do this to me?

1353
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:24,439
You were...
You were gonna squish the queen.

1354
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,310
It's true.

1355
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:30,109
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

1356
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:33,585
You piece of dirt!

1357
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,509
No, I'm wrong.

1358
01:18:35,554 --> 01:18:37,219
You're lower than dirt.

1359
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:38,470
You're an ant!

1360
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:43,218
Let this be a lesson to all you ants.

1361
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:46,458
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1362
01:18:46,832 --> 01:18:48,079
You are mindless,

1363
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,090
soil-shoving losers,

1364
01:18:50,468 --> 01:18:53,062
put on this earth to serve us!

1365
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,907
You're wrong, Hopper.

1366
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:08,278
Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers!

1367
01:19:12,056 --> 01:19:14,321
I've seen these ants do great things.

1368
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:16,751
And year after year,

1369
01:19:16,776 --> 01:19:20,714
they somehow manage to pick
food for themselves and you.

1370
01:19:24,235 --> 01:19:26,669
So, so who is the weaker species?

1371
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,232
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1372
01:19:30,908 --> 01:19:32,806
It's you who need us.

1373
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:40,346
We're a lot stronger 
than you say we are.

1374
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,750
And you know it, don't you?

1375
01:19:55,232 --> 01:19:57,067
Well, Princess!

1376
01:19:57,235 --> 01:19:58,026
Hopper?

1377
01:19:58,351 --> 01:19:59,923
I hate to interrupt, but...

1378
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,777
You ants stay back!

1379
01:20:14,553 --> 01:20:16,547
Oh, this was such a bad idea!

1380
01:20:16,773 --> 01:20:17,948
You see Hopper,

1381
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:20,344
nature has a certain order.

1382
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:22,438
The ants pick the food,

1383
01:20:22,563 --> 01:20:24,477
the ants keep the food,

1384
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,060
and the grasshoppers, leave!

1385
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:33,794
I'm so proud of you, Flik!

1386
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:35,129
Charge-a!

1387
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:37,735
Where are you going?
They're just ants!

1388
01:20:43,482 --> 01:20:44,888
No! Bad grasshopper!

1389
01:20:44,913 --> 01:20:46,539
Bad grasshopper! Go home!

1390
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:56,322
Come back here, you cowards!

1391
01:20:56,347 --> 01:20:57,344
Don't leave!

1392
01:20:57,396 --> 01:20:59,523
To the cannon!
To the cannon!

1393
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:00,926
No!

1394
01:21:11,143 --> 01:21:12,838
Happy landings, Hopper!

1395
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:25,282
Rain!

1396
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,002
Flik!

1397
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:56,075
Quick! After them!

1398
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,400
Slim!

1399
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:10,168
Francis!

1400
01:22:10,369 --> 01:22:11,776
Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!

1401
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:12,804
Where are you?

1402
01:22:12,805 --> 01:22:14,139
I'm over here!
Where?

1403
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,871
Here.
I'm the only stick with eyeballs!

1404
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:21,776
Help! Help! Help!

1405
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:22,800
Get him!

1406
01:22:35,828 --> 01:22:36,855
No!

1407
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:52,889
Go that way!
But the anthill's over...

1408
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,138
I've got an idea!

1409
01:22:59,953 --> 01:23:01,587
Flik!
Come on!

1410
01:23:08,094 --> 01:23:09,094
There!

1411
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:14,467
Come on!
We've gotta hide!

1412
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:16,515
No matter what happens,

1413
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,594
stay down!

1414
01:23:17,738 --> 01:23:19,672
Flik, no!
What are you doing?

1415
01:23:22,209 --> 01:23:22,832
Hopper!

1416
01:23:22,857 --> 01:23:24,200
You think it's over?

1417
01:23:24,278 --> 01:23:26,112
No, no, no.
No, I, I can explain.

1418
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,281
All your little stunt did was buy them time!

1419
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:30,816
No, please!
Please, Hopper!

1420
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,311
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,

1421
01:23:34,488 --> 01:23:36,418
but you won't!

1422
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,388
Well, what's this?

1423
01:23:42,829 --> 01:23:44,929
Another one of your little bird tricks?

1424
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:45,685
Yup.

1425
01:23:46,011 --> 01:23:48,359
Are there a bunch of little girls
in this one too?

1426
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:50,070
Hello, girls!

1427
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,009
No! No!
No, no, no, no!

1428
01:24:02,383 --> 01:24:03,783
No!
No!

1429
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:08,689
Oh, no!

1430
01:24:09,457 --> 01:24:11,326
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

1431
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:24,568
Come on, boys!

1432
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,474
Hey, Princess Dot!
Wait up!

1433
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:35,015
I finally get a second to relax,
and I gotta get out of my chair.

1434
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:37,990
Come on, you can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.

1435
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:39,472
Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1436
01:24:43,956 --> 01:24:45,549
Oh, thank you!

1437
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,891
Oh, you're too kind!
It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work. Any time.

1438
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:49,896
Dim!

1439
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:53,117
I'm so sorry, kids.

1440
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:54,657
I wish you could come along too.

1441
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:57,071
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna cry.

1442
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:07,076
Hey, let's go.
We got a schedule to keep.

1443
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:07,937
Come on, let's go.

1444
01:25:08,282 --> 01:25:10,817
Hey, Tiny!
Let's get this show packed up!

1445
01:25:10,818 --> 01:25:12,252
We got paying customers hatching!

1446
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,485
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1447
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,591
And... I just wanted to thank you
for giving me a chance,

1448
01:25:16,759 --> 01:25:19,250
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

1449
01:25:19,728 --> 01:25:20,498
Shutting up.

1450
01:25:20,624 --> 01:25:23,080
You sure you can't come on tour with us?

1451
01:25:23,132 --> 01:25:25,513
Sorry, my place is here.

1452
01:25:25,939 --> 01:25:27,119
Good answer.

1453
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,167
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!

1454
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,875
I wanna thank all of you,

1455
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:36,177
for giving us back our hope,

1456
01:25:36,302 --> 01:25:37,396
our dignity,

1457
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:38,887
and our lives.

1458
01:25:39,248 --> 01:25:41,253
And to you, Princess Atta.

1459
01:25:41,278 --> 01:25:43,212
You have given us so much.

1460
01:25:43,252 --> 01:25:45,197
Please accept this gift,

1461
01:25:45,222 --> 01:25:47,509
from us bugs to you ants.

1462
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:50,805
For you!

1463
01:25:53,131 --> 01:25:54,131
It's a rock.

1464
01:25:55,563 --> 01:25:56,831
What's with the rock?

1465
01:25:56,899 --> 01:25:58,533
Must be a circus thing.

1466
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:02,803
Well Flik, you really goofed up.

1467
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:04,572
Thanks.

1468
01:26:04,834 --> 01:26:06,632
Yeah, you too.

1469
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:48,875
All right. Now it's getting mushy.

1470
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,007
We're outta here!

1471
01:26:59,627 --> 01:27:01,054
See you next season!

1472
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:02,317
See you, Flik!
Bye!

1473
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:03,615
We miss you already!

1474
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,434
You fired!
You fired!

1475
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,125
We forgot Heimlich!

1476
01:27:10,574 --> 01:27:11,881
I'm finished!

1477
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:15,627
Finally, I'm a beautiful butterfly!

1478
01:27:22,252 --> 01:27:23,292
Mein wings!

1479
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:25,369
Oh, they're beautiful!

1480
01:27:25,422 --> 01:27:26,075
Heimlich!

1481
01:27:26,101 --> 01:27:28,612
The wagon's taking off!
You better start flying!

1482
01:27:28,758 --> 01:27:30,347
But I am flying!

1483
01:27:30,348 --> 01:27:33,612
And from way up here,
you all look like little ants!

1484
01:27:34,364 --> 01:27:36,258
Auf Wiedersehen!

1485
01:27:37,033 --> 01:27:38,330
Bye!

1486
01:27:46,175 --> 01:27:47,570
Present stalks!

1487
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,206
Harvester, salute!

1488
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,083
By <font color="#ff80ff">L</font><font color="#ff6aff">E</font><font color="#ff5bff">S</font><font color="#ff3cff">A</font><font color="#ff15ff">I</font><font color="#f200f2">G</font><font color="#e100e1">N</font><font color="#cc00cc">E</font><font color="#bb00bb">U</font><font color="#ae00ae">R</font>

1489
01:29:56,508 --> 01:29:57,573
Speed!
Marker.

1490
01:29:57,943 --> 01:30:00,942
And... action!
Are you saying I'm stupid?

1491
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,478
No!
Do I look stupid to you?

1492
01:30:06,918 --> 01:30:08,652
I'm sorry!

1493
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,947
Are you saying I'm stupid?

1494
01:30:15,894 --> 01:30:19,162
I'm sorry! I got it.
No, no. Just do it again. I'm fine.

1495
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:20,927
Are you saying I'm stupid?

1496
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:22,251
Yes!

1497
01:30:23,403 --> 01:30:25,145
This is the 15th take.

1498
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,227
I cannot work like this.

1499
01:30:27,373 --> 01:30:28,744
I will be in my trailer.

1500
01:30:29,368 --> 01:30:30,540
I need a break.

1501
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,010
Marker.

1502
01:30:32,712 --> 01:30:33,757
Flik honey,

1503
01:30:33,882 --> 01:30:34,967
we are not about...

1504
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,449
Is someone hammering?

1505
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,951
Could we hold the work, please?
People?

1506
01:30:40,053 --> 01:30:41,844
Am I in this shot?
You can see me, right?

1507
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:43,713
And... action!

1508
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:47,225
To infinity, and beyond!

1509
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:51,959
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1510
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,665
Really, can you,
can you blame me?

1511
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:56,177
Ok, ok let's go for real now.

1512
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,258
Ok. Sorry.
Cut!

1513
01:30:57,503 --> 01:31:00,131
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

1514
01:31:00,406 --> 01:31:02,040
I mean, you don't even like grain.
What?

1515
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:04,142
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1516
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:06,269
Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was...
Watch it!

1517
01:31:06,345 --> 01:31:08,745
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Is the camera broke?

1518
01:31:08,915 --> 01:31:11,445
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Did I ruin the take?

1519
01:31:12,117 --> 01:31:14,684
And thank you for finding them, Flik.

1520
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:16,147
Me? Oh, no.

1521
01:31:19,058 --> 01:31:21,069
This really hurts, guys.
I'm sorry, I'm s...

1522
01:31:23,296 --> 01:31:26,763
So, is there a Mrs. Ant
you have to tunnel home to?

1523
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:30,569
I'm sorry!
I thought he was real.

1524
01:31:32,536 --> 01:31:34,200
Dear. Put that thing in my car.

1525
01:31:34,475 --> 01:31:35,475
Marker.

1526
01:31:36,577 --> 01:31:38,677
Flik, after much deliberation...

1527
01:31:45,283 --> 01:31:45,783
My eye!

1528
01:31:45,952 --> 01:31:48,414
No, no. Seriously,
I've got berry juice in my eye!

1529
01:31:48,789 --> 01:31:51,187
It stings! Stop acting.
I'm serious.

1530
01:31:51,358 --> 01:31:52,692
Oh, stop the camera!

1531
01:31:56,462 --> 01:31:58,528
Towel!
I need a towel over here!

1532
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,200
Cut!

1533
01:32:04,402 --> 01:32:05,701
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1534
01:32:05,872 --> 01:32:07,064
Can we... Can we cut?

1535
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,508
It's just I don't think
I'm comin across.

1536
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:12,875
I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1537
01:32:13,646 --> 01:32:15,947
That's good. I got it, J.L.
All right, one more for me.

1538
01:32:16,116 --> 01:32:17,016
Speed!
Marker!

1539
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:18,751
Action!

1540
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:21,817
Spinning a web of safety in less than 50...
