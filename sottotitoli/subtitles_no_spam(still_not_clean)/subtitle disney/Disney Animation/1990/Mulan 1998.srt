{18022}{18156}{Y:bi}Who is that girl I see
{18157}{18215}{Y:bi}Staring straight
{18216}{18269}{Y:bi}Back at me

{20111}{20171}But I'll bet that|when it blooms,
{20197}{20302}it will be|the most beautiful of all.
{20434}{20489}What is it?
{20759}{20805}Mulan.
{20807}{20859}Stay inside.
{20980}{21047}Citizens, I bring|a proclamation...
{21048}{21099}from the Imperial City.
{21101}{21178}The Huns have invaded China.
{21180}{21232}By order of the Emperor,
{21234}{21343}one man from every family|must serve in the Imperial Army.
{21345}{21412}The Hsiao family.

{22143}{22223}Please, sir, my father has already|fought bravely... - Silence!
{22225}{22365}You would do well to teach your daughter|to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
{22367}{22437}Mulan, you dishonor me.
{22512}{22572}Report tomorrow|to the Wu Zhong camp.
{22573}{22625}Yes, sir.
{22655}{22714}The Chu family!
{22743}{22802}The Wen family!
{22846}{22902}The Chang family!
{24441}{24493}You shouldn't have to go!|- Mulan-
{24495}{24548}There are plenty of young men|to fight for China.
{24550}{24648}It is an honor to protect|my country and my family.
{24650}{24697}So, you'll die for honor.
{24698}{24756}I will die|doing what's right.
{24758}{24863}But if you... - I know my place!|It is time you learned yours.
{28210}{28286}Mulan is gone!
{28288}{28371}What?
{28397}{28444}It can't be.
{28619}{28672}Mulan!
{28748}{28817}No.
{28819}{28921}You must go after her.|She could be killed.
{28923}{28990}If I reveal her,
{28991}{29046}she will be.
{29264}{29351}Ancestors, hear our prayer.
{29352}{29386}Watch over Mulan.
{29894}{29958}Mushu, awaken.
{30102}{30190}I live!
{30192}{30268}So tell me what mortal needs|my protection, Great Ancestor.
{30269}{30328}You just say the word and I'm there.|- Mushu-
{30330}{30420}And let me say somethin'. Anybody's who's|foolish enough to threaten our family,
{30422}{30491}vengeance will be mine!
{30493}{30558}Mushu!
{30559}{30625}These are|the family guardians.
{30626}{30711}They-|- Protect the family.
{30713}{30800}And you, O Demoted One?
{30802}{30870}I... ring the gong.
{30872}{30977}That's right.|Now, wake up the ancestors.
{30978}{31069}One family reunion comin' right up.
{31070}{31141}Okay, people, people, look alive.|Let's go. Come on. Get up.
{31142}{31237}Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way|past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.
{31339}{31455}I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan|was a troublemaker from the start!
{31457}{31519}Don't look at me. She gets it|from your side of the family.
{31520}{31580}She's just trying|to help her father.
{31581}{31646}But if she's discovered,|Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.
{31648}{31725}Dishonor will come to the family.|Traditional values will disintegrate.
{31726}{31769}Not to mention,|they'll lose the farm.
{31770}{31863}My children never caused such trouble.|They all became acupuncturists.
{31865}{31936}Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.|- No!
{31938}{32014}Your great-granddaughter|had to be a cross-dresser!
{32077}{32172}Let a guardian bring her back.|- Yes, awaken the most cunning.
{32174}{32220}No. The swiftest.
{32222}{32285}No. Send the wisest.|- Silence!
{32287}{32358}We must send|the most powerful of all.
{32360}{32487}Okay, okay,|I get the drift. I'll go.
{32548}{32641}Oh, y'all don't think I can do it.|Watch this here.
{32643}{32694}Aha! Jump back.|I'm pretty hot, huh?
{32696}{32750}Don't make me have to singe|nobody to prove no point.
{32752}{32816}You had your chance|to protect the Fa family.
{32818}{32882}Your misguidance led|Fa Deng to disaster.
{32884}{32962}Yeah, thanks a lot.|- And your point is?
{32964}{33091}The point is we will be sending|a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
{33093}{33148}What- What-|I'm a real dragon!
{33149}{33286}You are not worthy of this spot.|Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.
{33319}{33393}So you'll get back to me|on the job thing?
{33446}{33513}Just one chance,|is that too much to ask?
{33515}{33591}I mean, it's not like|it'd kill ya.
{33593}{33674}Yo, Rocky, wake up!|Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!
{33765}{33825}Come on, boy!|Go get her! Go on!
{33827}{33880}Come on.
{34073}{34119}Hello?
{34121}{34174}Hel-lo!
{34176}{34227}Hello!
{34229}{34277}Uh-oh.
{34448}{34498}Uh, Stony?
{34500}{34576}Stony? Oh, man,|they're gonna kill me.
{34578}{34636}Great Stone Dragon,
{34637}{34704}have you awakened?
{34705}{34790}Uh, uh, uh, uh-|Yes, I just woke up.
{34792}{34882}I'm- I'm the Great|Stone Dragon. Good morning.
{34884}{34945}I will go forth|and fetch Mulan.
{34946}{35026}Did- Did I mention that|I was the Great Stone Dragon?
{35028}{35100}Go! The fate|of the Fa family...
{35102}{35163}rests in your claws.
{35165}{35249}Don't even worry about it.|I will not lose face.
{35300}{35373}My elbow!
{35375}{35442}I know I twisted somethin'.
{35492}{35546}That's just great.|Now what?
{35547}{35665}I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man decides|to take her little drag show on the road.
{35758}{35849}Go get her? What's the matter|with you? After this Great Stone,
{35851}{35944}Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her|home with a medal to get back in the temple.
{35945}{35999}Wait a minute. That's it!
{36001}{36078}I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be|begging me to come back to work.
{36080}{36148}That's the master plan.|Ah, you done it now, man.
{36201}{36277}Hey, what makes you|think you're comin'?
{36278}{36344}You're lucky?
{36345}{36429}Do I look like a sucker to you?
{36431}{36531}What you mean, a loser? How|'bout I pop one of your antennas|off, throw it across the yard?
{36532}{36605}Then who's the loser, me or you?
{37369}{37435}Imperial scouts.
{37674}{37736}Shan-Yu.
{37823}{37919}Nice work, gentlemen.|You found the Hun Army.
{37980}{38028}The Emperor|will stop you.
{38029}{38114}Stop me?|He invited me.
{38157}{38246}By building his wall,|he challenged my strength.
{38248}{38303}Well, I'm here|to play his game.
{38351}{38471}Go! Tell your Emperor|to send his strongest armies.
{38473}{38527}I'm ready.
{38596}{38660}How many men does it take|to deliver a message?
{38661}{38724}One.
{38817}{38872}Okay, okay,|how about this?
{38874}{38933}Excuse me.

{38986}{39085}Ha, I see you have a sword.|I have one too.
{39087}{39146}They're very manly|and... tough.
{39232}{39286}I'm working on it!
{39288}{39361}Oh, who am I fooling?
{39363}{39437}It's going to take a miracle|to get me into the army.
{39439}{39510}Did I hear someone ask|for a miracle?
{39511}{39572}Let me hear you say "aaah"!
{39573}{39624}That's close enough.|- A ghost.
{39626}{39710}Get ready, Mulan.|Your serpentine salvation is at hand!
{39712}{39784}For I have been sent|by your ancestors...
{39785}{39850}to guide you through|your masquerade.
{39852}{39902}Come on. If you're gonna stay,|you're gonna work.
{39903}{40010}So heed my word! 'Cause if|the army finds out you're a girl,
{40012}{40089}the penalty is death!
{40091}{40189}Who are you?|- Who am I? Who am I?
{40190}{40273}I am the guardian|of lost souls.
{40275}{40338}I am the powerful,|the pleasurable,
{40340}{40398}the indestructible Mushu.
{40433}{40481}Pretty hot, huh?
{40615}{40725}Uh, my ancestors sent|a little lizard to help me?
{40727}{40793}Hey, dragon, dragon,|not lizard.
{40795}{40859}I don't do that tongue thing.
{40861}{40907}You're, um-
{40909}{40962}Intimidating?|Awe inspiring?
{40964}{41044}Tiny. - Of course. I'm travel|size for your convenience.
{41045}{41137}If I was my real size,|your cow here would die of fright.
{41139}{41243}Down, Bessie. My powers are|beyond your mortal imagination.
{41245}{41349}For instance, my eyes can see|straight through your armor.
{41387}{41472}All right, that's it! Dishonor!|Dishonor on your whole family.
{41473}{41565}Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,|dishonor on your cow, dis-

{41641}{41701}I'm just nervous.|I've never done this before.
{41702}{41791}Then you're gonna have to trust me.|And don't you slap me no more.

{42721}{42821}I hope you can|get your money back.
{42823}{42872}I don't think|I can do this.
{42874}{42939}It's all attitude.|Be tough, like this guy here.
{42941}{43016}What are you lookin' at?
{43018}{43081}Punch him.|It's how men say hello.
{43121}{43180}Oh, Yao,|you've made a friend.
{43181}{43240}Good. Now slap him on the behind.|They like that.
{43296}{43388}I'm gonna hit you so hard,|it'll make your ancestors dizzy.
{43390}{43503}Yao, relax and chant with me.
{43681}{43738}Feel better?
{43740}{43830}Yeah. Ahh, you ain't|worth my time.
{43832}{43882}Chicken boy.|- Chicken boy?
{43883}{43939}Say that to my face,|ya limp noodle!
{44025}{44095}Oh. Sorry, Ling.
{44158}{44215}Whoa! You're dead!
{44296}{44348}Oh, there he goes!
{44789}{44846}Hey, guys.
{44847}{44926}The Huns have struck here,|here and here.
{44928}{44998}I will take the main troops|up to the Tung Shao Pass...
{45000}{45088}and stop Shan-Yu|before he destroys this village.
{45090}{45147}Excellent strategy, sir.
{45147}{45247}I do love surprises.
{45249}{45304}You will stay and train|the new recruits.
{45306}{45372}When Chi Fu believes|you're ready,
{45373}{45421}you will join us, Captain.
{45423}{45470}Captain?
{45471}{45569}This is an enormous|responsibility, General.
{45571}{45617}Perhaps a soldier|with more experience.
{45619}{45725}Number one in his class, extensive|knowledge of training techniques,
{45726}{45787}and impressive|military lineage.
{45789}{45855}I believe Li Shang will do|an excellent job.
{45857}{45962}Oh, I will. I won't let you down.|This is- I mean-
{45964}{46035}Yes, sir.|- Very good then.
{46037}{46120}We'll toast China's victory|at the Imperial City.
{46122}{46200}I'll expect a full report|in three weeks.
{46201}{46282}And I won't leave|anything out.
{46339}{46394}Captain Li Shang.
{46444}{46513}Leader of China's|finest troops.
{46515}{46596}No. The greatest troops of all time.
{46812}{46868}Most impressive.
{46941}{47032}Good luck, Captain. Hyah!
{47178}{47255}Good luck, Father.
{47431}{47494}Day one.
{47530}{47580}Soldiers!
{47604}{47651}He started it!
{47815}{47879}I don't need anyone|causing trouble in my camp.
{47881}{47927}Sorry. Uh-
{47929}{48021}I mean, uh, sorry you had to see that.
{48022}{48143}But you know how it is when you get those|manly urges and you just gotta kill somethin',
{48144}{48230}fix things, cook outdoors-
{48232}{48320}What's your name?
{48322}{48411}Your commanding officer|just asked you a question.
{48412}{48516}Uh, I've got a name.|Ha! And it's a boy's name too.
{48518}{48585}Ling. How 'bout Ling?|- His name is Ling.
{48587}{48658}I didn't ask for his name.|I asked for yours!
{48659}{48726}Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.|- Ah Chu.
{48728}{48812}Ah Chu?|- Gesundheit. Ha, ha. I kill myself.
{48814}{48850}Mushu.|- Mushu?
{48852}{48891}No.|- Then what is it?
{48893}{48962}Ping was my best friend growin' up.|- It's Ping.
{48963}{49044}Ping?|- Of course, Ping did steal my-
{49045}{49101}Yes, my name is Ping.
{49103}{49165}Let me see your|conscription notice.
{49167}{49294}Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?|- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
{49295}{49370}Um, he doesn't talk about me much.
{49490}{49596}I can see why.|That boy's an absolute lunatic.
{49656}{49732}Okay, gentlemen,|thanks to your new friend, Ping,
{49734}{49825}you'll spend tonight picking up|every single grain of rice.
{49826}{49918}And tomorrow, the real work begins.
{49988}{50070}You know, we have to work|on your people skills.
{50542}{50628}All right! Rise and shine,|Sleeping Beauty.
{50630}{50684}Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
{50734}{50829}Get your clothes on. Get ready.|Got breakfast for ya.
{50830}{50944}Look, you get porridge,|and it's happy to see you.
{50945}{51008}Hey, get outta there!|You gonna make people sick.
{51010}{51091}Am I late? - No time to talk. Now remember,|it's your first day of training,
{51093}{51163}so listen to your teacher and no|fightin', play nice with the other kids,
{51164}{51235}unless one of the other kids wanna fight,|then you have to kick the other kid's butt.
{51237}{51314}But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.|- Don't talk with your mouth full.
{51316}{51382}Now let's see your war face.
{51384}{51477}Oh, I think my bunny slippers just ran|for cover. Come on! Scare me, girl.
{51479}{51554}Yeah, that's my tough lookin' warrior.
{51556}{51624}That's what I'm talkin' about.|Now, get out there and make me proud.
{51688}{51743}What do you mean, the troops just left?|- They what?
{51832}{51888}Wait!|You forgot your sword.
{51935}{52005}My little baby,|off to destroy people.
{52126}{52175}Order. People, order.
{52177}{52247}I'd like a pan-fried noodle.|- Oh, oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.
{52249}{52312}Moo goo gai pan.|- That's not funny.
{52368}{52445}Looks like our new friend|slept in this morning.
{52448}{52530}Hello, Ping.|Are ya hungry?
{52532}{52618}Yeah, 'cause I owe you|a knuckle sandwich.
{52620}{52674}Soldiers!
{52775}{52859}You will assemble swiftly|and silently every morning.
{52891}{52951}Anyone who acts otherwise...
{52953}{53005}will answer to me.
{53006}{53073}Eeew. Tough guy.
{53075}{53126}Yao.
{53237}{53322}Thank you for volunteering.|Retrieve the arrow.
{53351}{53423}I'll get that arrow,|pretty boy,
{53425}{53505}and I'll do it|with my shirt on.
{53540}{53618}One moment. You seem|to be missing something.
{53704}{53762}This represents discipline,
{53802}{53880}and this|represents strength.
{53918}{53990}You need both|to reach the arrow.
{54524}{54585}We've got a long way to go.
{54784}{54877}{Y:bi}Let's get down to business
{54879}{54967}{Y:bi}To defeat the Huns
{54969}{55079}{Y:bi}Hoo-ah!|- Did they send me daughters
{55081}{55182}{Y:bi}When I asked for sons
{55184}{55270}{Y:bi}You're the saddest bunch|I ever met
{55272}{55379}{Y:bi}But you can bet|before we're through
{55380}{55475}{Y:bi}Mister, I'll make a man
{55477}{55543}{Y:bi}Out of you
{55618}{55682}{Y:bi}Tranquil as a forest
{55683}{55793}{Y:bi}But on fire within
{55795}{55901}{Y:bi}Once you find your center
{55903}{55996}{Y:bi}You are sure to win
{55997}{56092}{Y:bi}You're a spineless, pale|pathetic lot
{56094}{56182}{Y:bi}And you haven't got a clue
{56184}{56304}{Y:bi}Somehow I'll|make a man
{56306}{56365}{Y:bi}Out of you
{56395}{56464}{Y:bi}I'm never gonna|catch my breath
{56465}{56512}{Y:bi}Say good-bye|to those who knew me
{56513}{56613}{Y:bi}Boy, was I a fool|in school for cutting gym
{56614}{56667}{Y:bi}This guy's got 'em scared to death
{56667}{56714}{Y:bi}Hope he doesn't see right through me
{56715}{56790}{Y:bi}Now I really wish|that I knew how to swim
{56792}{56918}{Y:bi}Be a man|- We must be swift as a coursing river
{56919}{57003}{Y:bi}Be a man|- With all the force of a great typhoon
{57005}{57124}{Y:bi}Be a man|- With all the strength of a raging fire
{57126}{57299}{Y:bi}Mysterious as the dark side|of the moon
{57337}{57405}{Y:bi}Time is racing toward us
{57407}{57521}{Y:bi}Till the Huns arrive
{57523}{57620}{Y:bi}Heed my every order
{57622}{57714}{Y:bi}And you might survive
{57716}{57819}{Y:bi}You're unsuited for|the rage of war
{57821}{57915}{Y:bi}So pack up, go home|You're through
{57917}{58008}{Y:bi}How could I|make a man
{58009}{58118}{Y:bi}Out of you
{58120}{58211}{Y:bi}Be a man|- We must be swift as a coursing river
{58212}{58320}{Y:bi}Be a man|- With all the force of a great typhoon
{58322}{58428}{Y:bi}Be a man|- With all the strength of a raging fire

{58939}{59013}{Y:bi}Mysterious as the dark side
{59015}{59085}{Y:bi}Of the moon
{59717}{59779}What do you see?
{59781}{59868}Black pine,|from the high mountains.
{59898}{59963}White horse hair.|Imperial stallions.
{59964}{60039}Sulphur, from cannons.
{60040}{60132}This doll came from a village|in the Tung Shao Pass...
{60134}{60190}where the Imperial Army|is waiting for us.
{60191}{60246}We can avoid them easily.
{60248}{60305}No.
{60306}{60409}The quickest way to the Emperor|is through that pass.
{60411}{60528}And besides, the little girl|will be missing her doll.
{60530}{60582}We should return it to her.
{60736}{60831}No, this is not a good|idea. What if somebody sees you?
{60833}{60906}Just because I look like a man|doesn't mean I have to smell like one.
{60908}{61013}So a couple of guys don't rinse|out their socks. Picky, picky, picky.
{61015}{61081}Well, myself, I kind of|like that corn chip smell.
{61155}{61237}Okay, all right. That's enough. Get|out before you get all pruny and stuff.
{61238}{61317}Mushu, if you're so worried,|go stand watch.
{61319}{61379}Yeah, yeah.|"Stand watch, Mushu,
{61381}{61449}while I blow our secret|with my stupid girlie habits."
{61451}{61514}Pfft! Hygiene!
{61516}{61592}Me first! Me first!
{61594}{61681}We're doomed! There are a couple of|things I know they're bound to notice!
{62078}{62146}Hey, Ping!
{62176}{62247}Oh, hi, guys.|I didn't know you were here.
{62249}{62333}I was just washing. So now I'm clean,|and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.
{62334}{62432}Come back here.|I know we were jerks to you before,
{62433}{62492}so let's start over.
{62494}{62568}Hi. I'm Ling.
{62570}{62654}And I'm Chien-Po.|- Hello, Chien-Po.
{62656}{62725}And I am Yao!
{62727}{62781}King of the rock!
{62783}{62865}And there's nothin'|you girls can do about it.
{62867}{62953}Oh, yeah?|Well, I think Ping and I can take you.
{62955}{63036}I really don't wanna take him anywhere.|- Ping, we have to fight!
{63037}{63169}No, we don't. Uh, we, uh, could just|close our eyes and swim around.
{63171}{63217}Come on. Don't be|such a gir-
{63219}{63265}Ouch! Something bit me!
{63267}{63329}What a nasty flavor.
{63331}{63408}Snake!
{63468}{63516}Oooh, snake! Snake!
{63518}{63621}Snake! Snake!
{63622}{63705}Some king of the rock.
{63707}{63757}Boy, that was close.
{63759}{63820}No. That was vile.
{63822}{63880}You owe me big.
{63882}{63979}I never want to see|a naked man again.
{64088}{64165}Hey, don't look at me.|I ain't bitin' no more butts.
{64204}{64267}You think your troops|are ready to fight?
{64269}{64350}Ha! They would not last a minute|against the Huns!
{64352}{64429}They completed their training.|- Those boys...
{64431}{64522}are no more fit to be soldiers|than you are to be captain.
{64524}{64587}Once the General|reads my report,
{64589}{64653}your troops|will never see battle.
{64655}{64741}Oh, no, you don't! I've worked|too hard to get Mulan into this war.
{64743}{64788}This guy's messin'|with my plan.
{64789}{64839}We're not finished!
{64841}{64911}Be careful, Captain.|The General may be your father,
{64913}{64990}but I am|the Emperor's counsel.
{64992}{65110}And, oh, by the way,|I got that job on my own.
{65111}{65176}You're dismissed.
{65208}{65288}Hey. I'll hold him|and you punch.
{65289}{65378}Or not.
{65380}{65487}For what it's worth,|I think you're a great captain.
{65613}{65669}I saw that.|- What?
{65671}{65728}You like him, don't you?
{65729}{65833}No!|- Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.|Go to your tent!
{65949}{66048}I think it's time we took|this war into our own hands.
{66505}{66618}Let me see what you got. "From General Li.|Dear Son, we're waiting for Huns at the Pass.
{66620}{66675}It would mean a lot|if you'd come and back us up."
{66677}{66740}That's great, except you forgot,|"And since we're out of potpourri,
{66741}{66796}perhaps you wouldn't mind|bringing up some. "
{66798}{66893}Hello! This is the army! Make it sound|more urgent! Know what I'm talkin' about?
{67026}{67082}That's better.|Much better. Let's go.
{67084}{67178}Khanny, baby.|Hey, we need a ride.
{67335}{67396}Insubordinate ruffians!
{67398}{67489}You men owe me a new pair of slippers!
{67491}{67583}And I do not squeal like a girl.
{67585}{67655}Urgent news|from the General.
{67698}{67770}What's the matter? You've never seen|a black and white before?
{67831}{67880}Who are you?
{67882}{67973}Excuse me? I think|the question is, who are you?
{67975}{68046}We're in a war, man!|There's no time for stupid questions!
{68048}{68132}I should have your hat for that.|Snatch it right off your head.
{68134}{68227}But I'm feeling gracious today,|so carry on before I report you.
{68332}{68434}Captain, urgent news from the General!|We're needed at the front.
{68438}{68522}Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.|We're movin' out.
{68524}{68618}{Y:bi}For a long time we've been marching|off to battle
{68662}{68792}{Y:bi}In our thundering herd|we feel a lot like cattle
{68794}{68860}{Y:bi}Like a pounding beat|our aching feet
{68862}{68923}{Y:bi}Aren't easy to ignore
{68924}{68973}{Y:bi}Hey!|Think of instead
{68975}{69065}{Y:bi}A girl|worth fighting for
{69067}{69126}Huh?|- That's what I said.
{69127}{69200}{Y:bi}A girl|worth fighting for
{69202}{69281}{Y:bi}I want her paler|than the moon
{69282}{69334}{Y:bi}With eyes that shine|like stars
{69335}{69409}{Y:bi}My girl will marvel at my strength
{69411}{69474}{Y:bi}Adore my battle scars
{69476}{69596}{Y:bi}I couldn't care less what she'll wear|or what she looks like
{69598}{69677}{Y:bi}It all depends on|what she cooks like
{69679}{69753}{Y:bi}Beef, pork, chicken|Mmm
{69857}{69954}{Y:bi}Bet the local girls thought you|were quite the charmer
{69987}{70092}{Y:bi}And I'll bet the ladies|love a man in armor
{70094}{70180}{Y:bi}You can guess what|we have missed the most
{70182}{70241}{Y:bi}Since we went off to war
{70243}{70350}{Y:bi}What do we want|- A girl worth fighting for
{70352}{70430}{Y:bi}My girl will think|I have no faults
{70432}{70492}{Y:bi}That I'm a major find
{70494}{70594}{Y:bi}Uh, how 'bout a girl|who's got a brain
{70596}{70688}{Y:bi}Who always speaks her mind|- Nah!
{70690}{70755}{Y:bi}My manly ways|and turn of phrase
{70757}{70815}{Y:bi}Are sure to thrill her
{70817}{70940}{Y:bi}He thinks he's|such a lady killer
{70942}{71068}{Y:bi}I've a girl back home|who's unlike any other
{71070}{71156}{Y:bi}Yeah, the only girl|who'd love him is his mother
{71188}{71261}{Y:bi}But when we come home in victory
{71263}{71333}{Y:bi}They'll line up|at the door
{71335}{71458}{Y:bi}What do we want|- A girl worth fighting for
{71460}{71559}{Y:bi}Wish that I had|- A girl worth fighting for
{71598}{71670}{Y:bi}A girl worth fighting-
{72357}{72403}Search for survivors.
{73109}{73225}I don't understand.|My father should've been here.
{73227}{73273}Captain!
{73553}{73599}The General.
{74563}{74609}I'm sorry.
{75054}{75127}The Huns are moving quickly.
{75128}{75217}We'll make better time to the Imperial|City through the Tung Shao Pass.
{75219}{75287}We're the only hope|for the Emperor now.
{75289}{75337}Move out!
{76522}{76592}What happened?
{76592}{76621}Um... - You just gave away|our position! Now we're-
{76621}{76672}Um... - You just gave away|our position! Now we're-
{76786}{76874}Get out of range!
{77150}{77215}Save the cannons!
{77217}{77343}Come on! Empty it! Empty it!
{77706}{77777}Oh, sure.|Save the horse.
{77908}{77958}Fire!
{78193}{78238}Fire!
{78390}{78452}Hold the last cannon.
{79053}{79146}Prepare to fight.|If we die, we die with honor.
{79558}{79619}Yao, aim the cannon|at Shan-Yu.
{79895}{79972}Hey!|- Ping! Come back!
{79973}{80038}Ping!
{80365}{80411}Stop!
{80558}{80618}All right. You might want to|light that right about now.
{80619}{80679}Quickly. Quickly!
{80711}{80790}Come on!|We gotta help!
{80992}{81067}You missed!|How could you miss?
{81069}{81140}It was three feet|in front of you!
{82635}{82690}Mulan!
{82756}{82804}Mulan!
{82806}{82848}Mulan?
{82850}{82896}No.
{82898}{82958}Mulan!
{82960}{83035}Man, you are|one lucky bug.
{83249}{83321}Shang!
{83446}{83532}Do you see them?|- Yes.
{83609}{83708}Perfect.|Now we'll pull them to safe-ty.
{83769}{83837}Hey, Mulan!|I found the lucky cricket!
{83839}{83889}We need help.
{83916}{84024}Ooh, nice. Very nice.|You can sit by me.
{84026}{84091}We're gonna die!
{84093}{84139}We're gonna die!|We are definitely gonna die.
{84141}{84214}No way we survive this.|Death is coming!
{84257}{84368}I let them slip through my fingers.
{84437}{84480}Pull!
{84752}{84823}I knew we could do it.|You the man!
{84825}{84878}Well, sort of.
{84968}{85028}Step back, guys.|Give him some air.
{85030}{85100}Ping?
{85101}{85198}You are the craziest man I've ever met.
{85231}{85291}And for that,|I owe you my life.
{85293}{85375}From now on,|you have my trust.
{85377}{85467}Let's hear it for Ping!|The bravest of us all!
{85469}{85556}You're king of the mountain!|- Yes, yes, yes!
{85617}{85669}Ping! What's wrong?
{85758}{85824}He's wounded!|Get help!
{85872}{85946}Ping, hold on.
{85948}{85994}Hold on.
{86683}{86730}I can explain.
{86755}{86819}So it's true!
{86821}{86874}Shang!
{86875}{86946}I knew there was|something wrong with you.
{86948}{87006}A woman!
{87008}{87080}Treacherous snake!
{87082}{87142}My name is Mulan.
{87144}{87203}I did it|to save my father.
{87205}{87275}High treason!|- I didn't mean for it to go this far.
{87276}{87332}Ultimate dishonor!
{87334}{87422}It was the only way.|Please believe me.
{87424}{87502}Captain?
{87664}{87722}Restrain him!
{87780}{87849}No!|- You know the law.
{88143}{88202}A life for a life.
{88203}{88257}My debt is repaid.
{88303}{88387}Move out!|- But you can't just-
{88389}{88459}I said, "Move out."
{89306}{89364}I was this close.
{89366}{89441}This close|to impressin' the ancestors,
{89443}{89510}gettin' the top shelf,|an entourage.
{89512}{89600}Man. All my fine work.|Pfft.
{89692}{89738}Hi.
{89740}{89812}I should never have left home.
{89814}{89892}Hey, come on.|You went to save your father's life.
{89894}{89955}Who knew you'd end up shamin' him|and disgracing your ancestors...
{89957}{90023}and losin' all your friends?
{90025}{90102}You know, you just gotta-|You gotta learn to let these things go.
{90156}{90229}Maybe I didn't go|for my father.
{90231}{90343}Maybe what I really wanted was to prove|I could do things right...
{90345}{90426}so when I looked in the mirror,
{90428}{90490}I'd see someone worthwhile.
{90540}{90591}But I was wrong.
{90624}{90678}I see nothing.
{90889}{90968}Now, that's just 'cause|this needs a little spit, that's all.
{90969}{91053}Let me shine this up for ya.
{91055}{91130}I can see you. Look at you.|You look so pretty.
{91241}{91310}The truth is,|we're both frauds.
{91312}{91387}Your ancestors never sent me.|They don't even like me.
{91389}{91445}I mean, you risked your life|to help people you love.
{91447}{91503}I risked your life|to help myself.
{91505}{91574}At least|you had good intentions.
{91651}{91704}What? What do you mean,|"You're not lucky"?
{91706}{91784}You lied to me?
{91786}{91887}And what are you, a sheep?
{91889}{91988}I'll have to face my father|sooner or later.
{91989}{92047}Let's go home.
{92049}{92126}Yeah. This ain't|gonna be pretty.
{92128}{92221}But don't you worry, okay?|Things will work out.
{92223}{92320}We started this thing together,|and that's how we'll finish it.
{92361}{92408}I promise.
{94378}{94441}Uh, home is that way.
{94443}{94521}I have to do something.|- Did you see those Huns?
{94523}{94595}They popped out of the snow...|Iike daisies!
{94596}{94670}Are we in this together|or not?
{94754}{94839}Well, let's go kick|some Hunny buns!
{95350}{95440}Make way for the heroes|of China.
{95784}{95840}Shang!|- Mulan?
{95842}{95900}The Huns are alive!|They're in the city!
{95902}{95966}You don't belong here,|Mulan. Go home.
{96031}{96128}Shang, I saw them in the mountains.|You have to believe me.
{96130}{96190}Why should I?
{96247}{96316}Why else would I come back?
{96318}{96432}You said you'd trust Ping.|Why is Mulan any different?
{96611}{96720}Keep your eyes open.|I know they're here. Yah!
{96898}{96968}Now, where are you going?
{96970}{97032}To find someone|who will believe me.
{97774}{97868}My children,|heaven smiles down...
{97870}{97922}upon the Middle Kingdom.
{97923}{98011}China will sleep|safely tonight...
{98013}{98080}thanks to|our brave warriors.
{98130}{98211}Sir, the Emperor's in danger.
{98213}{98265}But the Huns are here.
{98267}{98336}Please, you have to help.
{98380}{98463}No one will listen. - Huh? Oh,|I'm sorry. Did you say something?
{98465}{98560}Mushu.|- Hey, you're a girl again, remember?
{98562}{98694}Your Majesty, I present to you|the sword of Shan-Yu.
{98695}{98778}I know what this means|to you, Captain Li.
{98780}{98866}Your father would have been|very proud.
{99514}{99586}No!|- Come on!
{99999}{100061}They'll never reach|the Emperor in time.
{100151}{100211}Hey, guys!

{101598}{101717}Your walls and armies have fallen,|and now it's your turn.
{101719}{101766}Bow to me.
{101874}{101920}Okay. Any questions?
{101922}{101971}Does this dress|make me look fat?
{102019}{102073}Who's there?
{102138}{102221}Concubines.|- Ugly concubines.
{102223}{102282}Oh, he's so cute!
{102529}{102609}Now, that's what I call|Mongolian barbecue.
{103020}{103082}Shang, go!
{103147}{103258}I tire of your arrogance,|old man. Bow to me!
{103260}{103398}No matter how the wind howls,|the mountain cannot bow to it.
{103400}{103487}Then you will kneel|in pieces!
{103787}{103842}Chien-Po, get the Emperor!
{103844}{103907}Sorry, Your Majesty.
