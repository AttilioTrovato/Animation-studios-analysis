1
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>Once upon a time,
in a faraway land,</i>

2
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,626
<i>a young prince lived
in a shining castle.</i>

3
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,964
<i>Although he had everything
his heart desired,</i>

4
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.</i>

5
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,930
<i>But then, one winter's night,</i>

6
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,683
<i>an old beggar woman came
to the castle</i>

7
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,644
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

8
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,106
<i>in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.</i>

9
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,775
<i>Repulsed by her haggard appearance,</i>

10
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,572
<i>the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.</i>

11
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,</i>

12
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:01,370
<i>for beauty is found within.</i>

13
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:06,208
<i>And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away</i>

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,212
<i>to reveal a beautiful enchantress.</i>

15
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,466
<i>The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,</i>

16
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:17,178
<i>for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.</i>

17
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>And as punishment,</i>

18
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,973
<i>she transformed him
into a hideous beast</i>

19
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,770
<i>and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.</i>

20
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:29,315
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form,</i>

21
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:32,234
<i>the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle</i>

22
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.</i>

23
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,409
<i>The rose she had offered</i>

24
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,912
<i>was truly an enchanted rose,</i>

25
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,582
<i>which would bloom until his 21st year.</i>

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,335
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>

27
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:54,090
<i>and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell,</i>

28
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,093
<i>then the spell would be broken.</i>

29
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,638
<i>If not, he would be doomed</i>

30
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:03,599
<i>to remain a beast for all time.</i>

31
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,395
<i>As the years passed,</i>

32
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:11,816
<i>he fell into despair and lost all hope,</i>

33
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,113

to love a beast?</i>

- <i>Bonjour,</i> Gaston.

136
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,801
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

137
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,429
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

138
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,806
Well, some people
use their imagination.

139
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,767
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

140
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,395
and paid attention
to more important things.

141
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,688
Like me.

142
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,775
The whole town's talking about it.

143
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,736
It's not right for a woman to read.

144
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,405
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.

145
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,782
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

146
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,784
Why, thank you, Belle.

147
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,120
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

148
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,415
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.

149
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,208
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crazy.

150
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,710
He's gorgeous.

151
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:08,464
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

152
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,132
Goodbye.

153
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,676
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

154
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,804
Don't talk about my father that way.

155
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,390
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

156
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,101
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

157
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,701
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?

158
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,997
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?

159
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,542
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

160
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,546
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!

161
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,508
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

162
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,385
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

163
00:09:56,595 --> 00:10:00,015
And become a world-famous inventor.

164
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,142
You really believe that?

165
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,019
I always have.

166
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,315
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

167
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,568
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,530
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

169
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,865
I got a new book.

170
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,827
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

171
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,287
My daughter? Odd?

172
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,289
Where would you get an idea like that?

173
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,585
Oh, I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

174
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,546
There's no one I can really talk to.

175
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,091
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

176
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:37,970
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

177
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,013
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

178
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,141
Well, don't you worry.

179
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,894
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

180
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,148
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

181
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,622
- It works!
- It does?

182
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,833
It does!

183
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,042
You did it.

184
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,086
You really did it!

185
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,131
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!

186
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,427
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

187
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,430
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

188
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,825
We should be there by now.

189
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe we missed a turn.

190
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,331
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

191
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,754
No. Let's go this way.

192
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,560
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

193
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,708
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

194
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,961
We better turn around.

195
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,839
Whoa. Whoa, boy.

196
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,675
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

197
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,719
Oh!

198
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,846
Look out! No!

199
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,059
Whoa!

200
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,103
Whoa, boy!

201
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,856
Back up, back up, back up!

202
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,944
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

203
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,697
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

204
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,700
Steady. No, Philippe!

205
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,500
Philippe?

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,879
Oh.

207
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,154
Help! Is... Is someone there?

208
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,281
Help!

209
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:49,745
Oh!

210
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:12,934
Wha...

211
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,394
Ooh!

212
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,526
Hello?

213
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,989
Hello!

214
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,367
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.

215
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,870
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.

216
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,914
Is someone there?

217
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:37,459
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

218
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,713
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

219
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,591
and I need a place to stay for the night.

220
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,802
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

221
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,969
Shh!

222
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,555
Ow!

223
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,974
Of course, <i>monsieur,</i>
you are welcome here.

224
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,018
Who said that?

225
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,645
Over here.

226
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,814
- Where?
- Hello.

227
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,944
Incredible!

228
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,904
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

229
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:08,990
Splendid. Just peachy. Ah!

230
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,369
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once.

231
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,579
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

232
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,084
Ow! Ah! Ah!

233
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,713
Sir, close that at once!

234
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,299
- Do you mind?
- I beg your pardon.

235
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:29,803
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...

236
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,522
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, <i>monsieur.</i>

237
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,566
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

238
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,861
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!

239
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:48,029
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

240
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:50,574
I demand that you stop right there.

241
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:55,162
Oh, no, no. Not the master's chair.

242
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,752
Well, hello there, boy.

244
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,302
- What service.
- All right.

245
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,430
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

246
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,809
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

247
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,146
No. No tea. No tea!

248
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,984
His mustache tickles, Mama.

249
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,819
Oh!

250
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,070
Hello.

251
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,910
Uh-oh!

252
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,171
There's a stranger here.

253
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:49,466
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

254
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,259
He was cold and wet, so...

255
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:57,390
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

256
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,601
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

257
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,853
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

258
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,278
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

259
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,572
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...

260
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,449
You are not welcome here!

261
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,201
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

262
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:19,204
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

263
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,666
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

264
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:26,336
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.

265
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,091
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!

266
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna
get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

267
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,894
Yep, this is her lucky day.

268
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,734
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

269
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,487
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

270
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,326
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

271
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,996
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

272
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,668
- Not yet.
- Sorry.

273
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,933
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

274
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,312
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

275
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,188
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

276
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,858
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

277
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,610
This is the day...

278
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,073
This is the day your dreams come true.

279
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,909
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

280
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,746
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

281
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:48,627
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

282
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,130
and my little wife massaging my feet

283
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,549
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

284
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,010
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?

285
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,637
No, Belle.

286
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,473
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.

287
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:02,891
Do you know who that little wife will be?

288
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,893
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.

289
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,813
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

290
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,316
I really don't know what to say.

291
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:14,736
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

292
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,573
But I just don't deserve you!

293
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,699
Whoa!

294
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,173
So, how'd it go?

295
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,260
I'll have Belle for my wife.

296
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,138
Make no mistake about that.

297
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,141
Touchy.

298
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,733
Is he gone?

299
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,822
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

300
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:02,742

313
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,968
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

314
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,138
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

315
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,528
What is this place?

316
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:24,032
Philippe, please, steady.

317
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,285
Steady.

318
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,165
Papa!

319
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,543
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

320
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,046
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

321
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:42,550
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

322
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,260
I was trying to be hospitable.

323
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,888
Hello?

324
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,098
Is anyone here?

325
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,184
Hello?

326
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,438
Papa? Papa?

327
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,857
Are you here?

328
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,194
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

329
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,239
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

330
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,491
Really, Mama. I saw her.

331
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:08,827
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What?

332
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,955
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

333
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,207
See, I told you.

334
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:18,753
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

335
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,921
Papa?

336
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,216
Did you see that?

337
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,263
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.

338
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,558
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

339
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,352
- She has come to break the spell.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

340
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,357
Papa?

341
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,110
Papa?

342
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,698
Hello? Is someone here?

343
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,118
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...

344
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,374
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

345
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,003
Is anyone here?

346
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,463
- Belle?
- Papa!

347
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,551
How did you find me?

348
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,261
Your hands are like ice.

349
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,470
We have to get you out of there.

350
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,514
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

351
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,724
Who's done this to you?

352
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,310
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

353
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,645
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?

354
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,980
Run, Belle!

355
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,483
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.

356
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,194
I've come for my father.

357
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,530
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

358
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,824
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

359
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,577
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

360
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,456
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

361
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,833
There must be some way I can...

362
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,835
Wait!

363
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,760
- Take me instead.
- You?

364
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,640
You would take his place?

365
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:55,934
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

366
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,020
If I did, would you let him go?

367
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,608
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

368
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,862
Come into the light.

369
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,418
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

370
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,507
- You have my word.
- Done.

371
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:35,056
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

372
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,140
Wait.

373
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,225
- Belle!
- Wait.

374
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,562
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

375
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,941
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

376
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,819
Let me out. Please let me out!

377
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:52,031
Let me out! Please! Please!

378
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,372
- Master?
- What?

379
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,251
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

380
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:07,755
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

381
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,259
Then again, maybe not.

382
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,305
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

383
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,391
I'll never see him again.

384
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,102
I didn't get to say goodbye.

385
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,272
I'll show you to your room.

386
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,941
My room? But I thought...

387
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,318
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

388
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,778
- No.
- Then follow me.

389
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,093
Say something to her.

390
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,595
Huh? Oh.

391
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:59,015
I hope you like it here.

392
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:02,769
The castle is your home now,

393
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,813
So you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

394
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,483
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!

395
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,993
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

396
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,245
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

397
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:25,500
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

398
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,978
Who does she think she is?

399
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,189
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

400
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:51,359
- No one says no to Gaston.
- Darn right.

401
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,696
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

402
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,740
Why, it's more than I can bear.

403
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,244
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.

404
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:04,372
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never.

405
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:08,584

He's got her locked in the dungeon.

- Belle. We must go.

- A beast!

459

- Huge.

00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,052
Bye.

510
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,763
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

511
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,391
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.

512
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,603
Oh, how embarrassing!

513
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:05,983
Ah, here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

514
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:09,445
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

515
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,572
But you must.

516
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,782
Ahem, ahem, ahem.

517
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,244
Dinner is served.

518
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,415
What's taking so long?

519
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,250
I told her to come down.

520
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,795
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Try to be patient, sir.

521
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,216
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

522
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,759
Master, have you thought

523
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,678
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

524
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,556
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

525
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,392
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

526
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:44,104
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

527
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:46,398
We'll be human again by midnight.

528
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,943
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

529
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,445
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

530
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,614
Oh, it's no use.

531
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:56,116
She's so beautiful and I'm...

532
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,826
Well, look at me!

533
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,957
You must help her to see past all that.

534
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,792
I don't know how.

535
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,419
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

536
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,838
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

537
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,842
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

538
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,262
Come, come, show me the smile.

539
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:20,307
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.

540
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,517
But be gentle.

541
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,894
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.

542
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,437
And above all,

543
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:28,482
- you must control your temper!
- You must control your temper!

544
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,984
Here she is!

545
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,487
Good evening.

546
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:37,283
- Well, where is she?
- Who?

547
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,659
Oh!

548
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,078
The girl, yes. The girl.

549
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,040
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

550
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:49,545
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

551
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,755
What?

552
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,925
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

553
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,177
Let's not be hasty!

554
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,141
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

555
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:03,726
I'm not hungry.

556
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,563
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

557
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,523
Master, I could be wrong,

558
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:14,111
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

559
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:17,573
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

560
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:20,367
But she is being so difficult.

561
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,828
Gently, gently.

562
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,207
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!

563
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,500
- Hmm?
- Eh-eh.

564
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,878
Suave, genteel.

565
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:33,922
It would give me great pleasure

566
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,842
if you would join me for dinner.

567
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,594
And we say "please."

568
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,471
- Please.
- No, thank you.

569
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,765
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.

570
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:47,394
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

571
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:52,066
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

572
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:58,572
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

573
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,492
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

574
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,870
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

575
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,414
You can count on me, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

576
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,710
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

577
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:15,381
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

578
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,467
What does she want me to do, beg?

579
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:21,345
Show me the girl.

580
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,142
<i>But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him.</i>

581
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,269
<i>Why don't you give him a chance?</i>

582
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,105
<i>I don't want to get to know him.</i>

583
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,108
<i>I don't want to have anything
to do with him.</i>

584
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,861
I'm just fooling myself.

585
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,823
She'll never see me as anything

586
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,408
but a monster.

587
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,164
It's hopeless.

588
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,892
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

589
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,477
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

590
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,814
I've been burned by you before.

591
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,445
<i>Zut alors!</i> She has emerged!

592
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,494
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

593
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,789
But I'm not sleepy.

594
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,917
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

595
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,546
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

596
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:40,549
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

597
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:43,677
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

598
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,889
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

599
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:48,557
After all, he did say "please."

600
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,393
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

601
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,729
- he'll never break the...
- Splendid to see you

602
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:55,481
out and about, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

603
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,192
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

604
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,655
- This is Lumiere.
- <i>Enchanté, chérie.</i>

605
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:06,909
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

606
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,204
can do to make your stay
more comfortable... Ow!

607
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:12,581
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?

608
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:14,416
Hear that? She's hungry.

609
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,586
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

610
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:20,005
Remember what the master said.

611
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,425
Oh, pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

612
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,428
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

613
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,388
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

614
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,809
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

615
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,521
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

616
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:37,397
Well, keep it down.

617
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,650
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

618
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:41,819
Of course, of course.

619
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,905
But what is dinner
without a little music?

620
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,740
Music?

621
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,619
<i>Ma chére mademoiselle!</i>

622
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:54,206
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

623
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,083
that we welcome you tonight.

624
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,794
And now, we invite you to relax.

625
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:03,757
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

626
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,217

Thank you, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

713
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:41,433
My goodness, look at
the time. Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

714
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,894
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

715
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,937
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

716
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,148
Enchanted!

717
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:51,401
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

718
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,070
It was you, wasn't it?

719
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,197
I figured it out for myself.

720
00:42:57,115 --> 00:42:59,493
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

721
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,704
- Would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

722
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,248
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

723
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,044
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

724
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:10,587
if you know what I mean.

725
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,130
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

726
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,342
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

727
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:18,553
Oh, well. Actually, I...

728
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,971
Yes, I do.

729
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,726
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

730
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,270
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

731
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,065
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

732
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:33,819
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

733
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,364
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

734
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,493
Where was I?

735
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,829
As you were!

736
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:49,251
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

737
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,418
Uh, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

738
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,927
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.

739
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,096
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

740
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,181
Dusty, dull, very boring.

741
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:06,685
Ah, so, that's the west wing!

742
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,103
Nice going.

743
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:10,647
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

744
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,149
Hiding?

745
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,318
- The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

746
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,823
Perhaps <i>mademoiselle</i>
would like to see something else?

747
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,534
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

748
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,744
- Maybe later.
- The gardens.

749
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,997
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

750
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,248
You have a library?

751
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:31,084
- Oh, yes. Indeed.
- With books.

752
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,628
- Scads of books.
- Mountains of books.

753
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,130
- Forests of books.
- Cascades.

754
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:36,756
- Cloudbursts.
- Swamps of books.

755
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,509
More books than
you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.

756
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,594
Books on every subject ever studied

757
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:44,556
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

758
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:37,651
Oh, oh.

759
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,951
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

760
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:31,746
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.

761
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,541
Do you realize
what you could have done?

762
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,793
Please! Stop!

763
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:39,045
- Get out!
- No!

764
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:44,301
Get out!

765
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,855
Where are you going?

766
00:46:56,896 --> 00:47:00,233
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.

767
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,570
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

768
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:20,021
No!

769
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:32,302
Here, now. Don't do that.

770
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:38,183
Just hold still.

771
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,060
That hurts!

772
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,062
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

773
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,356
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

774
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:48,860
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

775
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,946
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

776
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,033
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

777
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,788
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.

778
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,373
Hmm?

779
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:08,254
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

780
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,427
You're welcome.

781
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:25,772
I don't usually leave
the asylum in the middle of the night,

782
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:28,608
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

783
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:30,944
Ah!

784
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,738
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.

785
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:37,116
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

786
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,036
but she needs a little persuasion.

787
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,705
Turned him down flat.

788
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,792
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

789
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:49,212
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

790
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,964
Maurice is harmless.

791
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:56,302
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

792
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:59,764
Yeah, even marry him.

793
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,103
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

794
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:07,480
unless she agrees to marry you.

795
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,650
That is despicable.

796
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,319
I love it.

797
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,992
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

798
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,161
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

799
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:24,706
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...

800
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:26,833
I'll get her out of there.

801
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,800
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.

802
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,344
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

803
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,680
They have to come back sometime.

804
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,517
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

805
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,815
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

806
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,400
But... But I...

807
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:56,195
Ah, nuts.

808
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:21,596
I've never felt this way about anyone.

809
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:27,310
I want to do something for her.
But what?

810
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:29,228
Well, there's the usual things.

811
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,815
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

812
00:52:33,274 --> 00:52:37,028
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

813
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,281
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

814
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,077
Belle?

815
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,413
There's something I want to show you.

816
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,709
But first, you have to close your eyes.

817
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:55,463
It's a surprise.

818
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,643
- Can I open them?
- No, no. Not yet.

819
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,562
Wait here.

820
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:20,947
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now.

821
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:31,749
I can't believe it.

822
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,293
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

823
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,630
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful.

824
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,298
Then it's yours.

825
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,592
Thank you so much.

826
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:45,138
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.

827
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:47,473
What? What works?

828
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,977
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?

829
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:53,312
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.

830
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,148
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

831
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,818
But what are they talking about?

I'll tell you when you're older.

Tonight is the night.

romantic candlelight

It's past your bedtime.

908
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,678
Good night, love.

909
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:24,870
Belle?

910
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:30,209
Are you happy here with me?

911
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,877
Yes.

912
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,134
What is it?

913
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:43,347
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

914
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,141
I miss him so much.

915
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,106
There is a way.

916
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,778
This mirror will show you anything.

917
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,864
Anything you wish to see.

918
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:03,242
I'd like to see my father, please.

919
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,002
Papa. Oh, no.

920
01:01:13,794 --> 01:01:17,590
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

921
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,016
Then you must go to him.

922
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:29,101
What did you say?

923
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,646
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

924
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,567
- You mean I'm free?
- Yes.

925
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:42,198
Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

926
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,911
Take it with you

927
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:50,873
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

928
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,380
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

929
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,518
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

930
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,480
I knew you had it in you.

931
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:16,649
I let her go.

932
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,734
Yes, yes, splen...

933
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,862
You what?

934
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,990
- How could you do that?
- I had to.

935
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,826
Yes, but... But why?

936
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:31,121
Because I love her.

937
01:02:31,705 --> 01:02:33,415
He did what?

938
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:37,670
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?

939
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:39,797
But he was so close.

940
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:44,343
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

941
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,971
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

942
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:50,933
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

943
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,519
Now it's too late.

944
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,113
Papa?

945
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,031
Papa?

946
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:19,753
Ooh, ooh!

947
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,922
They're back.

948
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:26,051
- Belle.
- Shh.

949
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:29,346
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

950
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:33,517
I thought I'd never see you again.

951
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,979
- I missed you so much!
- But the Beast...

952
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:39,732
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.

953
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:43,110
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?

954
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:47,573
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

955
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,206
- Hi!
- Oh! A stowaway.

956
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:59,168
Why, hello there,
little fella.

957
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:01,879
Didn't think I'd see you again.

958
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,548
Belle, why'd you go away?

959
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,092
Don't you like us anymore?

960
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,970
Chip, of course I do. It's just that...

961
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:17,061
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.

962
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:19,980
- My father?
- Don't worry, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

963
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,566
We'll take good care of him.

964
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,945
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!

965
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,281
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!

966
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:33,786
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?

967
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:37,206
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

968
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:40,626
Just how big was the beast?

969
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:43,962
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

970
01:04:44,004 --> 01:04:47,883
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 10 feet!

971
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,930
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

972
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,641
It's true, I tell you.

973
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:59,186
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!

974
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:01,480
No! You can't do this!

975
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:06,110
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

976
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:08,737
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

977
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:13,700
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

978
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:16,662
- If what?
- If you marry me.

979
01:05:16,703 --> 01:05:18,956
- What?
- One little word, Belle.

980
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:20,999
- That's all it takes.
- Never!

981
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,376
Have it your way.

982
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:25,671
Belle? Let go of me!

983
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,133
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

984
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:30,843
Show me the Beast.

985
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:39,226
- Is it dangerous?
- No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

986
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:43,355
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

987
01:05:44,314 --> 01:05:46,483
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better,

988
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,570
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

989
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:52,448
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

990
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:55,909
She's as crazy as the old man.

991
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:57,828
The Beast will make off
with your children.

992
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,247
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No.

993
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,208

is mounted on my wall!
