1
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:27,812
'Twas a long time ago,

2
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:29,739
longer now than it seems,

3
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,619
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

4
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:35,335
For the story that you
are about to be told...

5
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:38,220
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

6
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:41,579
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

7
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:45,419
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun.

8
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:03,012
# Boys and girls #
# of every age #

9
00:01:03,117 --> 00:01:05,736
# Wouldn't you like to see #
# something strange #

10
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,619
# Come with us #
# and you will see #

11
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:11,335
# This, our town #
# of Halloween #

12
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:14,055
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

13
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,775
# Pumpkins scream #
# in the dead of night #

14
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,659
# This is Halloween #
# Everybody make a scene #

15
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:22,375
# Trick or treat till the #
# neighbor's gonna die of fright #

16
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,260
# It's our town #
# Everybody scream #

17
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:27,332
# In this town #
# of Halloween #

18
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,892
# I am the one hiding #
# under your bed #

19
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:32,780
# Teeth ground sharp #
# and eyes glowing red #

20
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:35,496
# I am the one hiding #
# under your stairs #

21
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,379
# Fingers like snakes #
# and spiders in my hair #

22
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:41,095
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

23
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:44,612
# Halloween, Halloween #
# Halloween, Halloween #

24
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,815
# In this town #

25
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,535
# Everyone hail #

26
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:53,506
# In this town #
# Don't we love it now #

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,296
# Everybody's waiting #
# for the next surprise #

28
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,852
# 'Round that corner, man #
# Hiding in the trash can #

29
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,892
# Something's waiting now to #
# pounce and how you'll scream #

30
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,819
- # This is Halloween #
- # Red and black #

31
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,510
- # Slimy green #
- # Aren't you scared #

32
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,461
# Well, that's just fine #
# Say it once, say it twice #

33
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,380
# Take a chance #
# and roll the dice #

34
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,779
# Ride with the moon #
# in the dead of night #

35
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:15,495
# Everybody scream #
# Everybody scream #

36
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:17,572
# In our town #
# of Halloween #

37
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:20,295
# I am the clown #
# with the tear-away face #

38
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:23,179
# Here in a flash #
# and gone without a trace #

39
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,895
# I am the "who" when you call #
# "Who's there?" #

40
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,615
# I am the wind blowing #
# through your hair #

41
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,336
# I am the shadow #
# on the moon at night #

42
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:34,056
# Filling your dreams #
# to the brim with fright #

43
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:36,775
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:45,099
# Tender Lumplings #

00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,979
# Life's no fun #
# without a good scare #

47
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,695
- # That's our job #
- # But we're not mean #

48
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,580

00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,259
# Skeleton Jack #

52
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:04,521
# And scream like a banshee #
# Make you jump out of your skin #

53
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,436
# This is Halloween #
# Everybody scream #

54
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,053
# Won't ya please make way #

55
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,775
# Our man Jack is king #

56
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,496
# Everyone hail #

# La la la la la la #
# Whee #

65
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,817
Whee!

66
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,794
- It's over!
- We did it!

67
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,250
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

68
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,332
Great Halloween,
everybody.

69
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,023
I believe it was
our most horrible yet.

70
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,947
Thank you, everyone.

71
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,867
No. Thanks
to you, Jack.

72
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:09,097
- Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.

73
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,499
You're such a scream, Jack!

74
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,898
You're a witch's
fondest dream.

75
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,583
You made walls fall, Jack.

76
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:20,842
"Walls fall"? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

77
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:25,730
- The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go.

78
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:30,060
- You're not ready for much excitement.
- Yes, I am.

79
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:33,386
- You're coming with me.
- No, I'm not!

80
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,652
Come back here,
you foolish--

81
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,124
Ow! Oh. Oh!

82
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:46,760
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

83
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:48,933
Thank you.
Thank you.

84
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:51,011
Thank you very much.

85
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:55,623
Hold it!
We haven't given out the prizes yet.

86
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,442
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

87
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,224
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

88
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:04,456
Our second
and honorable mention...

89
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:08,452
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon Leeches.

90
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,837
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

91
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,908
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year.

92
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:23,526
And the year before that,
and the year before that.

93
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:04,132
# There are few who deny #

94
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,376
# At what I do #
# I am the best #

95
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:10,536
# For my talents #
# are renowned far and wide #

96
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,695
# When it comes to surprises #
# in the moonlit night #

97
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:18,692
# I excel without ever #
# even trying #

98
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,099
# With the slightest #
# little effort #

99
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:23,335
# Of my ghostlike charms #

100
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,503
# I have seen grown men #
# give out a shriek #

101
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,420
# With a wave of my hand #

102
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,656
# And a well-placed moan #

103
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:35,499
# I have swept the very bravest #
# off their feet #

104
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:41,096
# Yet year after year #
# it's the same routine #

105
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:46,053
# And I grow so weary #
# of the sound of screams #

106
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:50,696
# And I, Jack #
# the Pumpkin King #

107
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:56,165
# Have grown so tired #
# of the same old thing #

108
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,732
# Oh, somewhere deep #

109
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,619
# Inside of these bones #

110
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,652
# An emptiness #

111
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:10,605
# Began to grow #

112
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,898
# There's something #
# out there #

113
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,582
# Far from my home #

114
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,816
# A longing that #

115
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:24,773
# I've never known #

116
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,296
# I'm the master of fright #

117
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,371
# And a demon of light #

118
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:34,372
# And I'll scare you #
# right out of your pants #

119
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:38,700
# To a guy in Kentucky #
# I'm Mr. Unlucky #

120
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:42,692
# And I'm known throughout #
# England and France #

121
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:47,019
# And since I am dead #
# I can take off my head #

122
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:51,012
# To recite Shakespearean #
# quotations #

123
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:55,493
# No animal nor man #
# can scream like I can #

124
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:59,492
# With the fury #
# of my recitations #

125
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:02,379
# But who here #

126
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,779
# Would ever understand #

127
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:09,579
# That the Pumpkin King #
# with the skeleton grin #

128
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:14,532
# Would tire of his crown #
# If they only understood #

129
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:21,315
# He'd give it all up #
# if he only could #

130
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:25,098
# Oh, there's an empty #

131
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,652
# Place in my bones #

132
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,540
# That calls out for #

133
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,572
# Something unknown #

134
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,611
# The fame and praise #

135
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,499
# Come year after year #

136
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:43,492
# Does nothing for #

137
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:49,740
# These empty tears #

138
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:56,940
Jack.

139
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,655
I know how you feel.

140
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,855
Sally.

141
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,125
You've come back.

142
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,694
- I had to.
- For this.

143
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,739
Yes.

144
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,976
Shall we, then?

145
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:51,656
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.

146
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,375
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know.

147
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:58,700
I made you
with my own hands.

148
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,253
You can make
other creations.

149
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:04,139
I'm restless.
I can't help it.

150
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,783
It's a phase, my dear.
It'll pass.

151
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:11,181
We need to be patient,
that's all.

152
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,961
But I don't want
to be patient.

153
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:18,851
No, Zero.
Not now.

154
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:20,780
I'm not in the mood.

155
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,055
All right.

156
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,979
Here you go, boy.

157
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,616
Mornin', gents.

158
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:12,456
Jack?
You home?

159
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:24,460
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

160
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:28,451
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

161
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,819
Jack, please, I'm only
an elected official here.

162
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:35,430
I can't make decisions
by myself.

163
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,348
Jack!
Answer me!

164
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,780
He's not home.

165
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:48,139
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

166
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,681
Where are we?

167
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:07,819
It's someplace new.

168
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,882
What is this?

169
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:04,903
Whoa!

170
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:11,176
Whoa!

171
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,819
# What's this? What's this? #
# There's color everywhere #

172
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,932
# What's this #
# There's white things in the air #

173
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:59,493
# What's this? I can't believe my eyes #
# I must be dreaming #

174
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,637
# Wake up, Jack! This isn't fair #
# What's this #

175
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,813
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la #

176
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,851
# What's this, What's this #
# There's something very wrong #

177
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:09,706
# What's this, there's people #
# singing songs, what's this #

178
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,660
# The streets are lined with #
# little creatures laughing #

179
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:14,539
# Everybody seems so happy #
# Have I possibly gone daffy #

180
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,452
# What is this #
# What's this #

181
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,735
# There's children throwing snowballs #
# instead of throwing heads #

182
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,620
# They're busy building toys #
# And absolutely no one's dead #

183
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,500
# There's frost in every window #
# Oh, I can't believe my eyes #

184
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,899
# And in my bones #
# I feel the warmth #

185
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:33,412
# That's coming #
# from inside #

186
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:37,063
# Oh, look, what's this #
# They're hanging mistletoe They kiss #

187
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,172
# Why, that looks so unique #
# Inspired #

188
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,100
# They're gathering around #
# to hear a story #

189
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,783
# Roasting chestnuts on a fire #
# What's this #

190
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,092
# What's this in here #
# They've got a little tree How queer #

191
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:51,084
# And who would ever think #
# And why #

192
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,997
# They're covering it #
# with tiny little things #

193
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,628
# They've got electric #
# lights on strings #

194
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,352
# And there's a smile on everyone, #
# so now correct me if I'm wrong #

195
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,795
# This looks like fun #
# This looks like fun #

196
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,282
# Oh, could it be I got my wish #
# What's this #

197
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,343
# Oh my, what now #
# The children are asleep #

198
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,300
# But look #
# There's nothing underneath #

199
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:11,332
# No ghouls, no witches here to scream #
# and scare them or ensnare them #

200
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,412
# Only little cozy things #

201
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:17,740
# Secure inside #
# their dreamland #

202
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:20,903
# What's this #

203
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:24,934
# The monsters are all missing #
# and the nightmares can't be found #

204
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:27,972
# And in their place there seems #
# to be good feeling all around #

205
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,696
# Instead of screams, I swear #
# I can hear music in the air #

206
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:35,783
# The smell of cakes and pies #
# are absolutely everywhere #

207
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,660
# The sights, the sounds #
# They're everywhere and all around #

208
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,732
# I've never felt #
# so good before #

209
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:45,098
# This empty place #
inside of me is filling up
# I simply cannot get enough #

210
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:47,815
# I want it Oh, I want it #
# Oh, I want it for my own #

211
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:51,179
# I've got to know, I've got to know #
# what is this place that I have found #

212
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:53,896
# What is this #

213
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,355
Christmas Town?

214
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,300
Hmm.

215
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,372
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

216
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:09,739
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

217
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,976
Hmm.

218
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,532
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

219
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,776
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

220
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,779
Stand aside. Coming through.

221
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,652
We've got to find Jack!

222
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:31,881
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

223
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,803
364!

224
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:37,196
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

225
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:41,571
- I looked in every mausoleum.
- We opened the sarcophagi!

226
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,459
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

227
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,175
I peeked behind
the Cyclops' eye.

228
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:49,698
I did,
but he wasn't there.

229
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:52,391
It's time to sound
the alarms!

230
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:23,651
Frog's breath will
overpower any odor.

231
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,548
Oh!

232
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:33,257
Bitter!

233
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:37,667
Worm's wart. Wh-Where's
that worm's wart?

234
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:40,391
Sally!

235
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,013
Is that soup
ready yet?

236
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,764
Ah.
Coming!

237
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,980
Lunch!

238
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:02,215
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart!

239
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,292
Mmm!

240
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,764
And frog's breath.

241
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:09,097
Wh-What's wrong?

242
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,019
I-I thought you
like frog's breath.

243
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:14,695
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

244
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:19,499
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

245
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:22,314
I'm not hungry.
Oops.

246
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:25,729
You want me to starve.

247
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:30,475
An old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

248
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:34,218
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

249
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,034
Oh, don't be silly.

250
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:41,061
Mmm! See?

251
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:43,020
Scrumptious!

252
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:54,532
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

253
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:56,874
This morning.

254
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:02,438
- Hear that? Shh.
- What?

255
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,061
Zero!

256
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:10,059
Jack's back!

257
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:11,979
Yea!
Jack's back!

258
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,540
Where have you been?

259
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,994
Call a town meeting
and I'll tell everyone all about it!

260
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:27,949
- When?
- Immediately!

261
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:37,256
Town meeting!
Town meeting!

262
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,812
Town meeting tonight!

263
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:44,135
Town meeting!

264
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:47,139
Town meeting
tonight!

265
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,372
Listen, everyone.

266
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:10,634
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

267
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:15,180
# There were objects #
# so peculiar #

268
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,100
# They were not #
# to be believed #

269
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,816
# All around things #
# to tantalize my brain #

270
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:23,594
# It's a world unlike #
# anything I've ever seen #

271
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:26,857
# And as hard as I tried #
# I can't seem to describe #

272
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:30,055
# Like a most #
# improbable dream #

273
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:33,572
# But you must believe #
# when I tell you this #

274
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:38,859
# It's as real as my skull #
# and it does exist #

275
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:41,062
Here, let me show you.

276
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:45,798
Ooh!

277
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:48,290
# This is a thing #
# called a present #

278
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:51,080
- # The whole thing starts with a box #
- # A box #

279
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:52,774
- # Is it steel #
- # Are there locks #

280
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,106
- # Is it filled with a pox #
- # A pox How delightful, a pox #

281
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,895
If you please.

282
00:20:57,997 --> 00:20:59,819
# Just a box with #
# bright colored paper #

283
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,535
# And the whole thing's #
# topped with a bow #

284
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,979
- # A bow #
- # But why #

285
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,736
- # How ugly! What's in it #
- # What's in it #

286
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,463
# That's the point of the thing #
# Not to know #

287
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:08,776
- # It's a bat #
- # Will it bend #

288
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,219
- # It's a rat #
- # Will it break #

289
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,772
# Perhaps it's the head #
# that I found in the lake #

290
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:15,333
# Listen now #
# You don't understand #

291
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:18,536
# That's not the point #
# of Christmasland #

292
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:20,460
# Now pay attention #

293
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,663
# We pick up #
# an oversized sock #

294
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:25,100
# And hang it like this #
# on the wall #

295
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,020
# Oh, yes, does it #
# still have a foot #

296
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:30,216
# Let me see, let me look #
# Is it rotted and covered with gook #

297
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,139
Um, let me explain.

298
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:34,538
# There's no foot inside #
# but there's candy #

299
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,612
# Or sometimes it's filled #
# with small toys #

300
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:39,467
- # Small toys, do they bite #
# or explode in the sack #
- # Do they snap #

301
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,053
# Perhaps they just spring out #
# and scare girls and boys #

302
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,612
# What a splendid idea #
# This Christmas sounds fun #

303
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,750
# I fully endorse it #
# Let's try it at once #

304
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,740
# Everyone, please #
# Now not so fast #

305
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:52,871
# There's something here #
# that you don't quite grasp #

306
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:55,177
I don't know.
Do you get it?

307
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:58,375
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

308
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:01,892
# And the best I must confess #
# I have saved for the last #

309
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:05,258
# For the ruler #
# of this Christmasland #

310
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,619
# Is a fearsome king #
# with a deep, mighty voice #

311
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:11,978
# Least, that's what #
# I've come to understand #

312
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:15,339
# And I've also heard it told #
# that he's something to behold #

313
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:18,535
# Like a lobster #
# Huge and red #

314
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,052
# When he sets out to slay #
# with his rain gear on #

315
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:25,418
# Carting bulging sacks #
# with his big, great arms #

316
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:28,779
# That is, #
# so I've heard it said #

317
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:32,292
# And on a dark, cold night #
# Under full moonlight #

318
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:37,733
# He flies into a fog like #
# a vulture in the sky #

319
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,936
# And they call him #

320
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:47,082
# Sandy Claws #

321
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:52,452
# Well, at least #
# they're excited #

322
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:55,078
# But they don't #
# understand #

323
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,004
# That special kind #
# of feeling #

324
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,654
# In Christmasland #

325
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:02,059
Oh, well.

326
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,419
Hmm.

327
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,539
Hmm.

328
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:38,378
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

329
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:54,372
You've poisoned me for the last time,
you wretched girl.

330
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:05,899
Oh, my head!

331
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:11,651
The door is open!

332
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:15,106
- Hello?
- Jack Skellington!

333
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:17,515
Up here, my boy.

334
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:20,777
Doctor, I need to borrow
some equipment.

335
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,430
Is that so?
Whatever for?

336
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:27,494
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

337
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:30,696
How perfectly
marvelous.

338
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:34,691
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

339
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:38,953
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

340
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,541
Hmm.
Experiments?

341
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,889
Zero, I'm home.

342
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,019
Interesting reaction.

343
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,092
But what does it mean?

344
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:33,256
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

345
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,332
Sally?

346
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,259
Sally?

347
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:41,132
Oh! Gone again!

348
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,659
Hmm.

349
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:43,819
Oh!

350
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,451
# Something's up with Jack #
# Something's up with Jack #

351
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:14,051
# Don't know if we're ever #
# going to get him back #

352
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,176
# He's all alone up there #
# Locked away inside #

353
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,819
- # Never says a word #
- # Hope he hasn't died #

354
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:27,081
# Something's up with Jack #
# Something's up with Jack #

355
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:37,732
# Christmastime #
# is buzzing in my skull #

356
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:40,772
# Will it let me be #
# I cannot tell #

357
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:43,811
# There's so many things #
# I cannot grasp #

358
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,852
# When I think I've got it #
# then at last #

359
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,892
# Through my bony fingers #
# it does slip #

360
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,939
# Like a snowflake #
# in a fiery grip #

361
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:55,787
# Something here I'm not quite getting, #
# though I try I keep forgetting #

362
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:59,497
# Like a memory #
# long since past #

363
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,419
# Here in an instant #
# Gone in a flash #

364
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,452
# What does it mean #
# What does it mean #

365
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:06,216
# In these little #
# bric-a-brac #

366
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:07,975
# A secret's waiting #
# to be cracked #

367
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,899
# These dolls and toys #
# confuse me so #

368
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:12,299
# Confound it all #
# I love it though #

369
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:14,220
# Simple objects #
# Nothing more #

370
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:16,140
# But something's hidden #
# through a door #

371
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:19,499
# Though I do not #
# have the key #

372
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:21,255
# Something's here #
# I cannot see #

373
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,812
# What does it mean #
# What does it mean #

374
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,632
# What does it mean #

375
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:31,654
Hmm. Hmm.

376
00:30:31,757 --> 00:30:34,212
# I've read these Christmas #
# books so many times #

377
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:37,416
# I know the stories #
# and I know the rhymes #

378
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:40,451
# I know the Christmas carols #
# all by heart #

379
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:43,492
# My skull's so full #
# It's tearing me apart #

380
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:46,379
# As often as I've read them #
# something's wrong #

381
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,511
# So hard to put #
# my bony finger on #

382
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,777
# Or perhaps it's really not as deep #
# as I've been led to think #

383
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:56,138
# Am I trying #
# much too hard #

384
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:58,059
# Of course, I've been #
# too close to see #

385
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,256
# The answer's right in front of me #
# Right in front of me #

386
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,180
# It's simple really #
# Very clear #

387
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,100
# Like music drifting #
# in the air #

388
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,231
# Invisible #
# but everywhere #

389
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,155
# Just because #
# I cannot see it #

390
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,075
# Doesn't mean #
# I can't believe it #

391
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:16,133
# You know I think this Christmas thing #
# is not as tricky as it seems #

392
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:19,499
# And why should they have all the fun #
# It should belong to anyone #

393
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:21,420
# Not anyone, in fact #
# but me #

394
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:23,176
# Why, I can make #
# a Christmas tree #

395
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:24,619
# And there's no reason #
# I can find #

396
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,539
# I couldn't handle #
# Christmastime #

397
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,295
# I bet I could #
# improve it too #

398
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:31,658
# And that's exactly #
# what I'll do #

399
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,645
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

400
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,978
Eureka!

401
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:40,681
This year...
Christmas will be ours!

402
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,693
Patience, everyone.

403
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:50,375
Jack has a special job
for each of us.

404
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:55,019
Dr. Finkelstein!

405
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,736
Your Christmas
assignment is ready.

406
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:04,456
Dr. Finkelstein, to
the front of the line.

407
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,337
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

408
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,220
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem.

409
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:16,140
I knew it!

410
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,791
Doctor!
Thank you for coming.

411
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,479
We need
some of these.

412
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:23,818
Hmm.

413
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:27,747
Their construction
should be exceedingly simple, I think.

414
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:31,017
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

415
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,703
No!
How jolly!

416
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:37,417
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

417
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:43,015
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

418
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,092
- Specifically.
- By name.

419
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,946
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.

420
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:49,900
Jack!
Jack!

421
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,884
It's Boogie's boys.

422
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,137
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.

423
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:59,499
The job I have for you
is top secret.

424
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,444
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

425
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,258
And we thought you
didn't like us, Jack.

426
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:10,537
Absolutely no one is to know about it.
Not a soul!

427
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:12,906
Now...

428
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:17,740
...tree...

429
00:33:17,837 --> 00:33:20,138
...Christmas Town...

430
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:23,718
Ow! Hmm.

431
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:25,894
And one more thing.

432
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:29,575
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

433
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,237
Whatever you say, Jack.

434
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,829
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

435
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,659
# Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws #

436
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:59,019
- # I want to do it #
- # Let's draw straws #

437
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:01,899
- # Jack said we should work together #
- # Three of a kind #

438
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:06,274
- # Birds of a feather #
- # Now and forever La la la la la la #

439
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:10,538
# La la-la la la-la #
# La la-la la-la #

440
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:13,637
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Lock him up real tight #

441
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:17,090
# Throw away the key and then #
# turn off all the lights #

442
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:20,613
# First we're going to set some bait #
# inside a nasty trap and wait #

443
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:24,547
# When he comes a-sniffing we will #
# snap the trap and close the gate #

444
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:27,020
# Wait, I've got a better plan #
# to catch this big red lobster man #

445
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:30,313
# Let's pop him in a boiling pot and #
# when he's done we'll butter him up #

446
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,893
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Throw him in a box #

447
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:37,412
# Bury him for 90 years #
# Then see if he talks #

448
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:42,056
# Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man #

449
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:44,459
# Can take the whole thing #
# over then #

450
00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:48,939
# He'll be so pleased #
# I do declare #

451
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:51,655
# That he will cook him rare #
# Whee #

452
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,937
# I say that we take a cannon #
# aim it at his door and then #

453
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:04,518
# Knock three times and when he answers #
# Sandy Claws will be no more #

454
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:07,655
# You're so stupid! Think now #
# if we blow him up to smithereens #

455
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:11,019
# We may lose some pieces and then #
# Jack will beat us black and green #

456
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:14,794
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Tie him in a bag #

457
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,260
# Throw him in the ocean #
# Then see if he is sad #

458
00:35:17,357 --> 00:35:20,935
# Because Mr. Oogie Boogie #
# is the meanest guy around #

459
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:26,056
# If I were on his boogie list #
# I'd get out of town #

460
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:30,503
# He'll be so pleased #
# by our success #

461
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:33,256
# That he'll reward us too #
# I'll bet #

462
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:37,347
# Perhaps he'll make #
# his special brew #

463
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:40,235
- # Of snake and spider stew #
- Mmm!

464
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,853
# We're his little henchmen and #
# we take our job with pride #

465
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:46,056
# We do our best to please him #
# and stay on his good side #

466
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,132
# I wish my cohorts #
# weren't so dumb #

467
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:50,060
- # I'm not the dumb one #
- # You're no fun #

468
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:51,980
- # Shut up, I've got something #
# Listen now #
- # Make me #

469
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:53,736
# This one is real good #
# You'll see #

470
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,495
# We'll send a present #
# to his door #

471
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:57,320
# Upon there'll be #
# a note to read #

472
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,291
# Now in the box we'll wait and hide #
# until his curiosity #

473
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:03,659
# Entices him to look inside And then #
# we'll have him! One, two, three #

474
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:07,173
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Beat him with a stick #

475
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:10,376
# Lock him up for 90 years #
# See what makes him tick #

476
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:14,056
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Chop him into bits #

477
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:17,256
# Mr. Oogie Boogie #
# is sure to get his kicks #

478
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:20,870
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# See what we will see #

479
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:24,356
# Lock him in a cage #
# and then throw away #

480
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:27,014
# The key #

481
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:33,739
Sandy Claws, huh?

482
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,208
It goes something
like this.

483
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,415
How about it?
Think you can manage?

484
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,939
A-one and a-two
and a-three and a--

485
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,131
Next!

486
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:02,342
Fantastic!

487
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:06,089
Now, why don't you all practice
on that? And we'll be in great shape.

488
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:09,572
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

489
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:12,612
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

490
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,979
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

491
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:20,201
- There was smoke and fire--
- That's not my Christmas!

492
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,400
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy...

493
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:27,046
and... this:
My Sandy Claws outfit.

494
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:29,702
- I want you to make it.
- Jack,

495
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:34,060
- please listen to me. It's going to be a disaster.
- How could it be?

496
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:37,769
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red. The trim is white.

497
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,000
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

498
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:44,135
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

499
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:47,947
- Next!
- I have every confidence in you.

500
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:51,623
But it seems wrong
to me, very wrong.

501
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:55,074
This device is called a nutcracker.

502
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,799
Jack, Jack!
We caught him! We got him!

503
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:01,675
Perfect!
Open it up, quickly.

504
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,182
That's not Sandy Claws.

505
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,580
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

506
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:12,743
Bunny!

507
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:17,123
Not Sandy Claws. Take him back!

508
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:19,946
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.

509
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,914
Which door?
There's more than one!

510
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:26,982
Sandy Claws is behind
the door shaped like this.

511
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:30,282
I told you!

512
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,421
- You knock it off!
- Ow! Ow!

513
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:38,757
I'm very sorry for
the inconvenience, sir.

514
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:42,538
Take him home first!
And apologize again.

515
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,452
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.

516
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:47,556
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.

517
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,963
- We'll get it right...
- next time!

518
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,607
You will be a decided
improvement...

519
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,459
over that
treacherous Sally.

520
00:38:56,558 --> 00:39:01,097
Master! The plans!

521
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:06,920
Excellent, Igor.

522
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:24,202
# This time #

523
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:26,123
# This time #

524
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:29,766
# Making Christmas #

525
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,454
# Making Christmas #

526
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:35,819
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

527
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:38,820
- # Is so fine #
- # It's ours this time #

528
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:42,024
# And won't the children #
# be surprised #

529
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,973
# It's ours this time #

530
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,720
- # Making Christmas #
- # Making Christmas #

531
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:49,709
# Making Christmas #

532
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,707
# Time to give them #
# something fun #

533
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:56,108
# They'll talk about it #
# for years to come #

534
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:59,467
# Let's have a cheer #
# from everyone #

535
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,539
# It's time to party #

536
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:04,612
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

537
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,764
# Snakes and mice #
# get wrapped up so nice #

538
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,001
# With spider legs #
# and pretty bows #

539
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:15,622
# It's ours this time #

540
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,759
# Altogether #
# That and this #

541
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:23,618
# With all our tricks #
# we're making Christmastime #

542
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,994
Here comes Jack!

543
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,460
# I don't believe #

544
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:32,234
# What's happening to me #

545
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,977
# My hopes #
# My dreams #

546
00:40:36,077 --> 00:40:39,972
# My fantasies #

547
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:43,426
Ha-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

548
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,475
# Won't they be #
# impressed #

549
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,916
# I am a genius #

550
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:51,177
# See how I transform #
# this old rat #

551
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:54,441
# Into a most #
# delightful hat #

552
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56,428
Hmm.

553
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,624
# My compliments from me to you #
# on this your most intriguing hat #

554
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,337
# Consider, though this substitute, #
# a bat in place of this old rat #

555
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,259
# No, no, no #
# Now that's all wrong #

556
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:07,746
# This thing will never make a present, #
# it's been dead for much too long #

557
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:09,741
# Try something fresher #
# Something pleasant #

558
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:11,660
# Try again #
# Don't give up #

559
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:14,245
# Altogether #
# That and this #

560
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:19,335
# With all our tricks #
# we're making Christmastime #

561
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:28,423
- # This time This time #
- # It's ours #

562
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:31,591
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

563
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:34,410
# La la-la #
# It's almost here #

564
00:42:34,509 --> 00:42:36,265
# And we can't wait #

565
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:39,431
# So ring the bells #
# and celebrate #

566
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:44,355
# 'Cause when the full moon #
# starts to climb, we'll all sing out #

567
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,527
# It's Christmastime #

568
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:50,346
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

569
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,577
Kathleen,
Bobby, Susie.

570
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:06,434
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--

571
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:09,192
There are hardly any
naughty children this year.

572
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:12,609
Now who could that be?

573
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:17,093
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?

574
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:19,499
Ya!

575
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,808
You don't look like yourself, Jack.
Not at all.

576
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:27,876
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

577
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,916
- But you're the Pumpkin King.
- Not anymore.

578
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:34,698
And I feel so much better now.

579
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:38,572
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but--

580
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,578
- Ow!
- Sorry!

581
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:44,646
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?

582
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:48,426
I've got the beard,
the coat, the boots, the belt--

583
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,340
Jack! Jack!
This time we bagged him.

584
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:54,917
- This time we really did.
- He sure is big, Jack.

585
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:57,574
- And heavy!
- Let me out!

586
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,361
Oh, Sandy Claws.

587
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:03,309
In person! What
a pleasure to meet you.

588
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:05,641
Wh-Why,
you have hands!

589
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:09,319
- You don't have claws at all.
- What?

590
00:44:09,421 --> 00:44:11,974
Where am I?

591
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:14,925
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.

592
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:18,534
You don't need to have
another worry about Christmas this year.

593
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:22,183
- Wha-- Wh-Wha--
- Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.

594
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,587
It's your turn
to take it easy.

595
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:27,881
- B-But there must be some mistake.
- See that he's comfortable.

596
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:31,527
Just a second, fellas.
Of course!

597
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:34,477
- That's what I'm missing. Thanks.
- B-B-But--

598
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:38,283
You just can't-- Hold on!
Where are we going now?

599
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:40,836
Ho-ho-ho!
No.

600
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:44,290
- This is worse than I thought, much worse.
- Ho-ho-ho!

601
00:44:44,397 --> 00:44:46,852
- Ho-ho-ho!
- I know.

602
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:49,805
Me on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?

603
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:51,876
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?

604
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,120
To Oogie Boogie,
of course.

605
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:57,004
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.

606
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:01,160
- And Jack said to make him
comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did!

607
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:05,571
Haven't you heard of peace
on earth and good will toward men?

608
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:08,492
No!

609
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:15,717
Oh! This'll stop Jack.

610
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:29,770
What a joy
to think of...

611
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,651
all we'll have
in common.

612
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:35,564
We'll have
conversations...

613
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:39,010
worth having.

614
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:44,228
Don't do this!

615
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,722
Naughty children
never get any presents.

616
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,863
- I think he might be too big!
- Oooh!

617
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:53,194
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney,

618
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:56,523
he can fit...
down... here.

619
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:27,078
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

620
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:31,436
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!

621
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:35,494
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.

622
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,484
# You're jokin' #
# You're jokin' #

623
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,621
# I can't believe #
# my eyes #

624
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:41,635
# You're jokin' me #
# You gotta be #

625
00:46:41,741 --> 00:46:43,749
# This can't be #
# the right guy #

626
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:45,860
# He's ancient #
# He's ugly #

627
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:48,037
# I don't know #
# which is worse #

628
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:52,364
# I might just split a seam now #
# if I don't die laughin' first #

629
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:56,422
# Mr. Oogie Boogie says #
# there's trouble close at hand #

630
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,532
# You better #
# pay attention now #

631
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,524
# 'Cause I'm #
# the Boogie Man #

632
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:02,988
# And if you #
# aren't shakin' #

633
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:04,972
# There's somethin' #
# very wrong #

634
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:08,681
# 'Cause this may be the last time #
# you hear the Boogie song #

635
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:10,821
- # Whoa-oh #
- # Wah-ah #

636
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:12,900
- # Whoa-ho #
- # Ow #

637
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:15,012
- # Whoa-oh #
- # Wow #

638
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:17,572
# I'm the Oogie Boogie Man #

639
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:21,834
# Release me now or you must #
# face the dire consequences #

640
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:25,894
# The children are expecting me #
# so please, come to your senses #

641
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:28,169
# Ah, you're jokin' #
# You're jokin' #

642
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,309
# I can't believe #
# my ears #

643
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,300
# Would someone #
# shut this fella up #

644
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:34,502
# I'm drownin' #
# in my tears #

645
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,579
# He's funny #
# I'm laughin' #

646
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:38,823
# You really are #
# too much #

647
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:40,780
# And now #
# with your permission #

648
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:44,193
- # I'm goin' to do my stuff #
- What are you going to do?

649
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:46,276
I'm gonna do
the best I can.

650
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:48,323
# Whoa #

651
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:52,586
# The sound of rolling dice #
# to me is music in the air #

652
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:55,947
# 'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man #
# although I don't play fair #

653
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:58,631
# It's much more fun #
# I must confess #

654
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,806
# With lives on the line #

655
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,048
# Not mine, of course #
# But yours, old boy #

656
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,255
# Now that'd be #
# just fine #

657
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:09,580
# Release me fast or you will #
# have to answer for this heinous act #

658
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:13,386
# Oh, brother, you're somethin' #
# You put me in a spin #

659
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:18,122
# You aren't comprehending #
# the position that you're in #

660
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,833
# It's hopeless You're finished #
# You haven't got a prayer #

661
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,006
# 'Cause I'm #
# Mr. Oogie Boogie #

662
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:28,038
# And you ain't goin' #
# nowhere #

663
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:57,547
Hurray! It's Jack!

664
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,688
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky,

665
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,472
outshining every star;

666
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,435
your silhouette,
a dark blot on the moon.

667
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,811
You, who are our pride.

668
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:19,779
You, who are our glory.

669
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:23,682
- You, who have frightened
millions into an early grave.
- Ow!

670
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,211
You, who have, uh,

671
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,027
devastated the, the souls
of the... living?

672
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,802
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.

673
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:37,316
- The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.
- Phew!

674
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,269
This fog's
as thick as, as--

675
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:42,983
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

676
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:46,217
- There go all of my hopes,
- Oh!

677
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,060
My precious plans,
my glorious dreams.

678
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:54,281
There goes Christmas.

679
00:49:54,381 --> 00:49:58,342
No, Zero. Down, boy.

680
00:49:58,445 --> 00:50:02,188
My, what a brilliant
nose you have.

681
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:04,522
The better
to light my way!

682
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:08,515
To the head of the team, Zero.

683
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:11,109
We're off!

684
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:15,627
Wait, Jack! No!

685
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:24,715
Ho-ho-ho!

686
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,748
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!

687
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:38,437
Good-bye, Jack.

688
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,930
My dearest Jack.

689
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:45,794
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.

690
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:54,794
# I sense there's something #
# in the wind #

691
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:59,944
# That feels like #
# tragedy's at hand #

692
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:05,162
# And though I'd like #
# to stand by him #

693
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:09,669
# Can't shake this feeling #
# that I have #

694
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:15,337
# The worst is #
# just around the bend #

695
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:19,496
# And does he notice #

696
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:23,907
# My feelings for him #

697
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:26,664
# And will he see #

698
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:30,694
# How much #
# he means to me #

699
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:35,532
# I think #
# it's not to be #

700
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:41,193
# What will become #
# of my dear friend #

701
00:51:41,293 --> 00:51:45,636
# Where will his actions #
# lead us then #

702
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:51,240
# Although I'd like #
# to join the crowd #

703
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:56,426
# In their #
# enthusiastic cloud #

704
00:51:56,525 --> 00:52:01,065
# Try as I may #
# it doesn't last #

705
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:05,672
# And will we ever #

706
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:09,832
# End up together #

707
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:12,999
# No, I think not #

708
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:17,193
# It's never to become #

709
00:52:17,293 --> 00:52:22,563
# For I am not #
# the one #

710
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:42,403
Ho-ho-ho!

711
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,739
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

712
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:54,981
Santa!

713
00:53:14,765 --> 00:53:17,253
Santa?

714
00:53:17,357 --> 00:53:18,669
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

715
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:21,571
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

716
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:24,044
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.

717
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:26,924
I have a special present
for you anyway.

718
00:53:27,021 --> 00:53:28,964
There you go, sonny.

719
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:32,331
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

720
00:53:37,773 --> 00:53:40,905
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?

721
00:53:41,005 --> 00:53:45,446
Merry Christmas!

722
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:48,451
Hello. Police.

723
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,426
Attacked by Christmas toys?

724
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,729
That's strange. That's the second
toy complaint we've had.

725
00:53:56,653 --> 00:54:00,515
Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

726
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:05,829
Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

727
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:30,243
Huh?

728
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:33,665
Oh, wait!

729
00:54:36,717 --> 00:54:39,302
Whoa! Help! Help!

730
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:18,211
You're welcome,
one and all!

731
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:20,489
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

732
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:23,371
Police. I know, I know,
a skeleton. Keep calm.

733
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:26,568
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.

734
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:31,209
Reports are pouring in from all over
the globe that an impostor...

735
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:35,052
is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus,
mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.

736
00:55:35,149 --> 00:55:38,498
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...

737
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:42,729
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

738
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:45,677
- Jack. Someone has to help Jack.
- ...wherever you are,

739
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:49,635
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- Come back and save Christmas.

740
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:02,508
Look, Zero,
searchlights.

741
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:11,780
They're celebrating!

742
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:15,562
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.

743
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:19,818
Whoa! Careful down there!
You almost hit us!

744
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:22,339
It's okay, Zero!

745
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,260
Head higher!

746
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,611
Are you a gamblin' man,
Sandy? Let's play!

747
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:34,757
Hmm?

748
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:40,419
My, my!
What have we here?

749
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:42,827
Hmm.

750
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:52,485
I'll get you out of here.

751
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:55,688
Ah! Lovely.

752
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:59,018
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

753
00:56:59,117 --> 00:57:01,125
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

754
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:08,451
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me?

755
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:20,746
Who's next
on my list?

756
00:57:20,845 --> 00:57:25,035
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

757
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:41,926
They're trying to hit us. Zero!

758
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,361
Merry Christmas
to all...

759
00:57:52,461 --> 00:57:59,498
and to all
a good night!

760
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:19,464
I knew this Christmas
thing was a bad idea.

761
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:23,111
I felt it in my gut.

762
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:25,766
Terrible news, folks!

763
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:29,546
The worst tragedy
of our times!

764
00:58:29,645 --> 00:58:33,638
Jack has been blown
to smithereens!

765
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:39,074
Terrible, terrible news!

766
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,686
Attention.
Attention, citizens.

767
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,611
Terrible news.

768
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:49,287
There's still no sign
of Santa Claus.

769
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:52,487
Although the impostor
has been shot down,

770
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:57,193
it looks like Christmas will have to
be canceled this year.

771
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,398
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,

772
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:01,674
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,

773
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:05,897
but there's
still no sign of Santa.

774
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:20,167
# What have I done #

775
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:23,717
# What have I done #

776
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:26,756
# How could I #

777
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:30,157
# Be so blind #

778
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:33,287
# All is lost #

779
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,521
# Where was I #

780
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,760
# Spoiled all #

781
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:43,113
# Spoiled all #

782
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:46,377
# Everything's #

783
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:49,641
# Gone all wrong #

784
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:52,872
# What have I done #

785
00:59:52,973 --> 00:59:56,137
# What have I done #

786
00:59:56,237 --> 01:00:00,165
# Find a deep cave #
# to hide in #

787
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,401
# In a million years #

788
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:08,138
# They'll find me #
# Only dust #

789
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:12,460
# And a plaque #
# that reads #

790
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:18,470
# Here lies #
# poor old Jack #

791
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:23,275
# But I never intended #
# all this madness #

792
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,195
# Never #

793
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:29,221
# And nobody #
# really understood #

794
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,234
# Well, how could they #

795
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,513
# That all #
# I ever wanted #

796
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,588
# Was to bring them #
# something great #

797
01:00:35,693 --> 01:00:39,206
# Why does nothing ever #
# turn out like it should #

798
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:42,124
# Well, what the heck #

799
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,425
# I went and did my best #

800
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:46,565
# And, by God #
# I really tasted #

801
01:00:46,669 --> 01:00:48,589
# Something swell #

802
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:49,385
# Something swell #

803
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:53,707
# And for a moment #
# why, I even touched the sky #

804
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:57,799
# And at least I left #
# some stories they can tell I did #

805
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:02,091
# And for the first time since #
# I don't remember when #

806
01:01:02,189 --> 01:01:06,117
# I felt just like #
# my old bony self again #

807
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:08,293
# And I, Jack #

808
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:10,982
# The Pumpkin King #

809
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:15,493
# That's right #
# I am the Pumpkin King # Ha-ha-ha! #

810
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:19,209
# And I just can't wait #
# until next Halloween #

811
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,349
# 'Cause I've got #
# some new ideas #

812
01:01:21,453 --> 01:01:23,395
# That will really #
# make them scream #

813
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:28,356
# And, by God, I'm really going #
# to give it all my might #

814
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:32,138
Uh-oh. I hope
there's still time...

815
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:35,532
to set things right.

816
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,760
- Sandy Claws.
- Hmm.

817
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,163
You wait till Jack
hears about this!

818
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:44,044
By the time he's through with you,
you'll be lucky if you--

819
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:45,964
The King of Halloween...

820
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:49,640
has been blown
to smithereens!

821
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:51,880
Skeleton Jack...

822
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,298
is now a pile of dust!

823
01:01:55,437 --> 01:01:59,747
C'mon, Zero! Christmas isn't over yet.

824
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:10,125
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?

825
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:17,738
Help! Help! Help!

826
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:20,619
Shhh!

827
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,822
Seven!

828
01:02:22,925 --> 01:02:25,794
It's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.

829
01:02:25,901 --> 01:02:29,349
One... two... three... four...

830
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:32,901
five, six, seven.

831
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:35,144
This can't be happening.

832
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,922
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

833
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,477
Oh! I'm feeling weak...

834
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:43,556
with hunger!

835
01:02:43,661 --> 01:02:47,404
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.

836
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,818
What?
Snake eyes?

837
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:56,226
Eleven!

838
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,781
Looks like I won
the jackpot!

839
01:02:59,885 --> 01:03:02,668
Bye-bye, doll face...

840
01:03:02,765 --> 01:03:05,100
and sandman!

841
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:09,481
What the--

842
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,715
Hello, Oogie.

843
01:03:12,813 --> 01:03:16,075
J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.

844
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:19,489
You must be...
double dead!

845
01:03:19,598 --> 01:03:21,801
Oh!

846
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:30,566
Well, come on,
bone man!

847
01:03:38,029 --> 01:03:40,648
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!

848
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:47,720
Fire!

849
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:52,259
Ooooh!

850
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:59,492
Jack, look out!

851
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:08,620
So long, Jack!

852
01:04:08,717 --> 01:04:12,197
How dare you treat my friends...

853
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:15,083
so shamefully!

854
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:18,279
No, no, no, no, Jack!

855
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:22,058
Now look what
you've done!

856
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:25,637
My bugs!
My bugs!

857
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,715
My bugs!

858
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:30,985
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

859
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:33,541
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs!

860
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:36,961
My bugs! My bugs!

861
01:04:38,029 --> 01:04:40,298
Forgive me,
Mr. Claws.

862
01:04:40,397 --> 01:04:44,936
- I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess of your holiday.
- Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

863
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:50,340
The next time you get the urge to take over
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.

864
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:54,339
She's the only one who makes any sense
around this insane asylum!

865
01:04:54,445 --> 01:04:57,576
- Skeletons, boogie men--
- I hope there's still time.

866
01:04:57,677 --> 01:05:01,092
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!

867
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,783
I'm Santa Claus!

868
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:11,878
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

869
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:15,843
- How did you get down here, Sally?
- Oh, I-I was trying to--

870
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:19,561
- Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.

871
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:21,963
- I couldn't let you just--
- Sally.

872
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:24,876
I can't believe I never
realized that you--

873
01:05:24,973 --> 01:05:27,144
Jack! Jack!

874
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:29,798
- Here he is!
- Alive! Just like we said!

875
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:32,454
Grab ahold, my boy!

876
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:34,532
Whoa!

877
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:37,452
Good news, folks.
Santa Claus, the one and only,

878
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:39,654
has finally been spotted.

879
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:42,627
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling
at supersonic speed.

880
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:45,122
He's setting things right,

881
01:05:45,229 --> 01:05:47,684
bringing joy and cheer
wherever he goes.

882
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:51,106
Yes, Kriss Kringle has pulled it out
of the bag and delivered Christmas...

883
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,247
to excited children all over the world.

884
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:58,342
# La la la la #
# la la-la-la #

885
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:00,420
# La la la la #
# la la-la-la #

886
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:02,914
- Jack's back!
- Jack?

887
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:05,607
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!

888
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:08,459
# Jack's okay #
# and he's back #

889
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:10,892
- # Oh, yea #
- # He's all right #

890
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:12,811
# Let's shout #
# Make a fuss #

891
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:15,364
# Scream it out #
# Wheee #

892
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:17,738
# Jack is back now #
# Everyone sing #

893
01:06:17,837 --> 01:06:21,220
# In the town #
# of Halloween #

894
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:24,970
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

895
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:29,160
Happy Halloween!

896
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:31,814
Merry Christmas!

897
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:33,924
- What's this?
- # What's this #

898
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:35,851
# I haven't got #
# a clue #

899
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:38,764
- # What's this #
- # Why, it's completely new #

900
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,065
- # Must be a Christmas thing #
- # What's this #

901
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,685
# It's really #
# very strange #

902
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:52,356
# This is Halloween #
# Halloween, Halloween #

903
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:55,014
# Halloween #
# What's this, what's this #

904
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:03,531
Careful,
my precious jewel.

905
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:33,353
# My dearest friend #
# if you don't mind #

906
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:39,170
# I'd like to join you #
# by your side #

907
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:41,481
# Where we can gaze #

908
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:45,159
# Into the stars #

909
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:49,637
# And sit together #

910
01:07:49,741 --> 01:07:53,603
# Now and forever #

911
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:57,091
# For it is plain #

912
01:07:57,197 --> 01:08:01,255
# As anyone can see #

913
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:07,107
# We're simply #
# meant to be #
