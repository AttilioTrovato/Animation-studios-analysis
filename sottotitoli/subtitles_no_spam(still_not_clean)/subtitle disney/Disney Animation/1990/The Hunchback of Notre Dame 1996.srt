1
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,142
Morning in Paris
The city awakes

2
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,479
To the bells of Notre Dame

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,107
The fisherman fishes
The baker man bakes

4
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,235
To the bells of Notre Dame

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,739
To the big bells as loud as the thunder

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,409
To the little bells soft as a psalm

7
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,829
And some say the soul
of the city's the toll

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,082
Of the bells

9
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:31,090
The bells of Notre Dame

10
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,259
Listen. They're beautiful, no?

11
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,180
So many colours of sound,
so many changing moods.

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,433
Because you know they don't
ring all by themselves.

13
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,602
-They don't?
-No, you silly boy.

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,356
Up there, high,
high in the dark bell tower,

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,275
lives the mysterious bell ringer.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,528
-Who is this creature?
-Who?

17
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,946
-What is he?
-What?

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,365
-How did he come to be there?
-How?

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,950
Hush.

20
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,035
Clopin will tell you.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,789
lt is a tale, a tale of a man...

22
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,291
And a monster.

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,711
Dark was the night
when our tale was begun

24
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,172
On the docks near Notre Dame

25
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,841
-Shut it up, will you?
-We'll be spotted!

26
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,883
Hush, little one.

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,178
Four frightened gypsies
slid silently under

28
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,806
The docks near Notre Dame

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,766
Four guilders
for safe passage into Paris.

30
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,727
A trap had been laid for the gypsies

31
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,273
And they gazed up in fear and alarm

32
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,108
At a figure whose clutches

33
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,986
Were iron as much as the bells

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,237
Judge Claude Frollo!

35
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,075
The bells of Notre Dame

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,828
Kyrie eleison

37
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:48,083
Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge
the world of vice and sin

38
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,836
Kyrie eleison

39
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,422
And he saw corruption

40
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,092
Everywhere except within

41
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,095
Bring these gypsy vermin
to the palace ofjustice.

42
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,763
You there! What are you hiding?

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,100
Stolen goods, no doubt.
Take them from her.

44
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,269
She ran.

45
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,856
Dies irae
Dies irae

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,276
Dies illa
Dies illa

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,529
Solvet saeclum in favilla

48
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,037
Quantus tremor est futurus

49
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,956
Quando judex est venturus

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,542
Sanctuary! Please, give us sanctuary!

51
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,129
Quantus tremor est futurus

52
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,636
Dies irae

53
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,472
A baby?

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,642
A monster!

55
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,229
Solvet saeclum in favilla

56
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,816
Dies irae
Dies irae

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,660
"Stop!" cried the archdeacon.

58
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,328
This is an unholy demon.

59
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,830
l'm sending it back to hell,
where it belongs.

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,167
See, there, the innocent blood
you have spilt

61
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,461
On the steps of Notre Dame

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,005
l am guiltless. She ran. l pursued.

63
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,259
Now you would add this child's
blood to your guilt

64
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,302
On the steps of Notre Dame

65
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,679
My conscience is clear.

66
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,765
You can lie to yourself
and your minions

67
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,977
You can claim that you haven't a qualm

68
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,437
But you never can run from

69
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,899
Nor hide what you've done
from the eyes

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,568
The very eyes

71
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,030
Of Notre Dame

72
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,574
Kyrie eleison

73
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,452
And for one time in his life

74
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,454
Of power and control

75
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,207
Kyrie eleison

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,131
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
for his immortal soul

77
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,257
What must l do?

78
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,176
Care for the child
and raise it as your own.

79
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,888
What? l am to be saddled
with this misshapen...

80
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,016
Very well.

81
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,476
But let him live with you in your church.

82
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,562
Live here? Where?

83
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,147
Anywhere.

84
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,318
Just so he's kept locked away
where no one else can see

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,320
The bell tower, perhaps.

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,324
And who knows? Our Lord works
in mysterious ways.

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,038
Even this foul creature
may yet prove one day to be

88
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,500
Of use to me

89
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,004
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name,

90
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,923
a name that means "half-formed."

91
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,259
Quasimodo.

92
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,930
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,434
Sing the bells of Notre Dame

94
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,773
Who is the monster and who is the man

95
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,777
Sing the bells, bells
Bells, bells

96
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,113
Bells, bells
Bells, bells

97
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:10,786
Bells of Notre Dame

98
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,312
Good morning.

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,400
Will today be the day?
Are you ready to fly?

100
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,986
You sure? Good day to try.

101
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,658
Why, if l picked a day to fly,
this would be it.

102
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,952
The Festival of Fools.

103
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,584
lt will be fun with jugglers
and music and dancing.

104
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,431
Go on. Nobody wants
to be cooped up here forever.

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Man!

106
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,359
l thought he'd never leave.
l'll be spittin' feathers for a week.

107
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,529
Well, that's what you get
for sleeping with your mouth open.

108
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,864
Go scare a nun.

109
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,324
Hey, Quasi, what's goin' on out there?
A fight? A flogging?

110
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,368
-A festival.
-You mean a Feast of Fools?

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,705
All right, all right!
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.

112
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,333
It is a treat to watch the colourful
pageantry of the simple peasant folk.

113
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,627
Boy, nothin' like balcony seats
for watching the ol' FOF.

114
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,296
Yeah, watchin'.

115
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,548
Look. A mime.

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,222
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What gives?

117
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,058
Aren't you
going to watch the festival with us?

118
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,768
-I don't get it.
-Perhaps he's sick.

119
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,853
Impossible.

120
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,982
If 20 years of listenin' to you two hasn't
made him sick by now, nothin' will.

121
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,609
Watching the Festival of Fools

122
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,069
has always been the highlight
of the year for Quasimodo.

123
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,489
What good is watchin' the party
if you never get to go?

124
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,325
Here, get away from me!
Go on, ya bunch of buzzards!

125
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,452
He's not made of stone, like us.

126
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,516
Quasi, what's wrong?
You want to tell ol' Laverne all about it?

127
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,102
I just don't feel
like watching the festival, that's all.

128
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,605
Well, did ya ever think
of goin' there instead?

129
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,024
Sure. But I'd never fit in out there.

130
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,443
I'm not normal.

131
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,196
Quasi, Quasi, Quasi.

132
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,364
Do ya mind?

133
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,784
I would like to have a moment
with the boy, if it's all right with you!

134
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,369
Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower.

135
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,579
What do we gotta do, paint ya a fresco?

136
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,707
As your friends and guardians,
we insist you attend the festival.

137
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,085
-Me?
-No, the pope. Of course, you!

138
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,796
It would be a veritable potpourri
of educational experience.

139
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,172
Wine, women and song.

140
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,299
You can learn to identify
various regional cheeses.

141
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,635
-Bobbin' for snails.
-Study indigenous folk music.

142
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,470
Playin' dunk the monk!

143
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,641
Quasi, take it from an old spectator.
Life's not a spectator sport.

144
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,476
Ifwatchin' is all you're gonna do,

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,145
then you're gonna watch
your life go by without ya.

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,983
Yeah, you're human, with the flesh
and the hair and the navel lint.

147
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,151
We're just part of the architecture.
Right, Victor?

148
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,572
Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake?

149
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,367
If you moisten us,
do we not grow moss?

150
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,203
Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic
and a clean pair of hose, and...

151
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,915
Thanks for the encouragement.
But you're all forgetting one big thing.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,083
What?

153
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,669
My master, Frollo.

154
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,963
Yeah. Oh, dear, yes.

155
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,259
Well, when he says you're forbidden
from ever leaving the bell tower,

156
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,011
does he mean "ever," ever?

157
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,930
Never ever.
And he hates the Feast of Fools.

158
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,517
-He'd be furious if I asked to go.
-Who says ya gotta ask?

159
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,519
-Oh, no.
-Ya sneak out.

160
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,187
-It's just one afternoon.
-I couldn't.

161
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,064
And ya sneak back in.

162
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,400
-He'll never know you were gone.
-And if I got caught?

163
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,360
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

164
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,445
He might see me.

165
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,697
You could wear a disguise.
Just this once.

166
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,616
What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt ya.

167
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,534
-Ignorance is bliss.
-Look who's talkin'.

168
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,579
Nobody wants to stay
cooped up here forever.

169
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,998
You're right. I'll go.

170
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,125
-I'll get cleaned up.
-Yes, sir!

171
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,044
-I'll stroll down those stairs.
-There ya go!

172
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,503
I'll march through the doors and...

173
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,213
Good morning, Quasimodo.

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,885
Good morning, Master.

175
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,888
Dear boy, whomever are you talking to?

176
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,891
My friends.

177
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,561
I see. And what are your
friends made of, Quasimodo?

178
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,979
Stone.

179
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,150
-Can stone talk?
-No, it can't.

180
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,486
That's right. You're a smart lad.

181
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,905
Now, lunch.

182
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,579
Shall we review your alphabet today?

183
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,499
Yes, Master.
I would like that very much.

184
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,002
-Very well. "A"?
-Abomination.

185
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,754
-"B"?
-Blasphemy.

186
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,756
-"C"?
-Contrition.

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,257
-"D"?
-Damnation.

188
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,426
-"E"?
-Eternal damnation.

189
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,261
-Good. "F"?
-Festival.

190
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,599
-Excuse me?
-Forgiveness.

191
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,185
-You said, "Festival."
-No!

192
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,105
You are thinking
about going to the festival.

193
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,399
It's just that you go every year.

194
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,860
I am a public official. I must go.

195
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,947
But I don't enjoy a moment.

196
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,283
Thieves and cutpurses,
the dregs of humankind,

197
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,871
all mixed together
in a shallow, drunken stupor.

198
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,999
I didn't mean to upset you, Master.

199
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,044
Quasimodo, can't you understand?

200
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,297
When your heartless mother
abandoned you as a child,

201
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,883
anyone else would have drowned you.

202
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,637
And this is my thanks for taking you in
and raising you as my son?

203
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,222
I'm sorry, sir.

204
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,891
My dear Quasimodo.

205
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,477
You don't know what it's like out there.

206
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,731
I do. I do.

207
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,316
The world is cruel

208
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,569
The world is wicked

209
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,573
lt's l alone whom you can
trust in this whole city

210
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,326
l am your only friend

211
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,998
l, who keep you, teach you
feed you, dress you

212
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,752
l, who look upon you without fear

213
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,963
How can l protect you, boy

214
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,092
Unless you always stay in here

215
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,803
Away in here

216
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,432
Remember what
I've taught you, Quasimodo.

217
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,642
-You are deformed
-l am deformed

218
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,853
-And you are ugly
-And l am ugly

219
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,607
And these are crimes
for which the world shows little pity

220
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,901
You do not comprehend

221
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,820
You are my one defender

222
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,573
Out there they'll
revile you as a monster

223
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,200
l am a monster

224
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,036
Out there they
will hate and scorn and jeer

225
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,370
Only a monster

226
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,500
Why invite their calumny
and consternation

227
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,460
Stay in here

228
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,129
-Be faithful to me
-l'm faithful

229
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,216
-Grateful to me
-l'm grateful

230
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,135
Do as l say

231
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,720
Obey

232
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:31,976
-And stay in here
-l'll stay in here

233
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,063
You are good to me, Master.

234
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,982
-I'm sorry.
-You are forgiven.

235
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,237
But, remember, Quasimodo,
this is your sanctuary.

236
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,490
My sanctuary.

237
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,578
Safe behind these windows
and these parapets of stone

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,499
Gazing at the people down below me

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,920
All my life, l watch them
as l hide up here alone

240
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,882
Hungry for the histories they show me

241
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,262
All my life l memorize their faces

242
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,432
Knowing them
as they will never know me

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,186
All my life, l wonder
how it feels to pass a day

244
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,605
Not above them

245
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,111
But part of them

246
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,614
And out there

247
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,201
Living in the sun

248
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,038
Give me one day out there

249
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,458
All l ask is one

250
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,961
To hold forever

251
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,796
Out there

252
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,467
Where they all live unaware

253
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,761
What l'd give

254
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,391
What l'd dare

255
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,935
Just to live

256
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,104
One day

257
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:05,153
Out there

258
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,490
Out there among the millers
and the weavers and their wives

259
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,911
Through the roofs and gables
l can see them

260
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,748
Every day they shout and scold
and go about their lives

261
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,001
Heedless of the gift it is to be them

262
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,130
lf l was in their skin

263
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,008
l'd treasure

264
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,677
Every instant

265
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,512
Out there

266
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,266
Strolling by the Seine

267
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,686
Taste the morning out there

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,690
Like ordinary men

269
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,527
Who freely walk about there

270
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,114
Just one day and then

271
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:55,453
l swear l'll be content

272
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,040
With my share

273
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,627
Won't resent
Won't despair

274
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,297
Old and bent
l won't care

275
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:11,719
l'll have spent
One day

276
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:18,768
Out there

277
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,586
You leave town for a couple of decades,
and they change everything.

278
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,757
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for
the palace ofjustice. Would you...

279
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,259
I guess not.

280
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,022
Stay away, child. They're gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.

281
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,252
All right, gypsy.

282
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,255
-Where'd ya get the money?
-For your information, I earned it.

283
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,633
-Gypsies don't earn money.
-They steal it.

284
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,510
You'd know a lot about stealing.

285
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,220
Troublemaker, eh?

286
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,474
Maybe a day in the stocks
will cool ya down.

287
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,646
Come back here, gypsy!

288
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,484
Achilles, sit.

289
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,863
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

290
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,740
Naughty horse! Naughty!

291
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,993
He's just impossible.
Really, I can't take him anywhere.

292
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,163
Get this thing off me!

293
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,999
I'll teach you a lesson, peasant!

294
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,419
You were saying, Lieutenant?

295
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,922
Captain!

296
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,425
At your service, sir!

297
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,262
I know you have a lot
on your mind right now,

298
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,890
but the palace ofjustice?

299
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,310
-Make way for the captain!
-Go on, make way!

300
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,645
Make way!

301
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,857
-Everybody out of the way!
-You, make way for the captain!

302
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,276
-Make way!
-Make way, now!

303
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,575
Come on, boy. Achilles, heel!

304
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,886
-Stop.
-Sir?

305
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,556
Ease up. Wait between lashes.

306
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,308
Otherwise the old sting
will dull him to the new.

307
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,643
Yes, sir.

308
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:10,398
So this is the gallant Captain Phoebus,
home from the wars.

309
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,233
Reporting for duty, as ordered, sir.

310
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,069
Your service record
precedes you, Phoebus.

311
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,739
I expect nothing but the best
from a war hero of your calibre.

312
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,783
And you shall have it, sir. I guarantee it.

313
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,951
Yes.

314
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:26,706
You know, my last captain of the guard
was a bit of a disappointment to me.

315
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,003
Well, no matter.
I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape.

316
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,674
Thank you.
It's a tremendous honour, sir.

317
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,427
You've come to Paris
in her darkest hour, Captain.

318
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,180
It will take a firm hand
to save the weak-minded

319
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,516
-from being so easily misled.
-Misled, sir?

320
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,852
Look, Captain. Gypsies.

321
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,521
The gypsies live outside
the normal order.

322
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,442
Their heathen ways inflame
the people's lowest instincts.

323
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,278
And they must be stopped.

324
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,030
I was summoned from the wars

325
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,115
to capture fortune tellers
and palm readers?

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,702
The real war, Captain,
is what you see before you.

327
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:09,081
For 20 years, I have been
taking care of the gypsies,

328
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,709
one by one.

329
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,380
And yet, for all my success,
they have thrived.

330
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,885
I believe they have a safe haven
within the walls of this very city.

331
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,054
A nest, if you will.

332
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,307
They call it the court of miracles.

333
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,101
What are we going to do about it, sir?

334
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,397
You make your point quite vividly, sir.

335
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,484
You know, I like you, Captain. Shall we?

336
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,738
Duty calls.

337
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,491
Have you ever attended
a peasant festival, Captain?

338
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,117
Not recently, sir.

339
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,245
Then this should be
quite an education for you.

340
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,329
Come along.

341
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,343
Come, one

342
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,512
Come, all

343
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,639
Leave your looms and milking stools

344
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,433
Coop the hens and pen the mules

345
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,352
Come, one

346
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,437
Come, all

347
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,648
Close the churches and the schools

348
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,942
lt's the day for breaking rules

349
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:24,532
Come and join the Feast Of Fools

350
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,498
Once a year we throw
a party here in town

351
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,876
Once a year we turn
all Paris upside-down

352
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,297
Every man's a king
and every king's a clown

353
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,550
Once again it's topsy-turvy day

354
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,970
lt's the day the devil in us gets released

355
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,307
lt's the day we mock the prig
and shock the priest

356
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:54,186
Everything is topsy-turvy
at the Feast of Fools

357
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,938
Topsy-turvy

358
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,191
-Everything is upsy-daisy
-Topsy-turvy

359
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,068
Everyone is acting crazy

360
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,238
Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet

361
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,408
That's the way on topsy-turvy day

362
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,495
Hey! Are you all right?

363
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,415
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

364
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,001
Well, you're not hurt, are you?
Here, here, let's see.

365
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,170
-No, no! No!
-There.

366
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,630
See? No harm done.

367
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,508
Just try to be a little more careful.

368
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,427
I will.

369
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,513
By the way, great mask.

370
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,270
-Topsy-turvy
-Beat the drums and blow the trumpets

371
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,980
Topsy-turvy

372
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,607
Join the bums
and thieves and strumpets

373
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,943
Streaming in from Chartres to Calais

374
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,364
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
on the sixth of Januervy

375
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,117
All because it's topsy-turvy day

376
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,370
Come, one

377
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,622
Come, all

378
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,707
Hurry, hurry
Here's your chance

379
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,668
See the mystery and romance

380
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,464
Come, one
Come, all

381
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,050
See the finest girl in France

382
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,260
Make an entrance to entrance

383
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:13,933
Dance la Esmeralda

384
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,476
Dance

385
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,318
-Look at that disgusting display.
-Yes, sir.

386
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,933
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the pièce de résistance!

387
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,687
Here it is
The moment you've been waiting for

388
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,190
Here it is
You know exactly what's in store

389
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,527
Now's the time we laugh
until our sides get sore

390
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,530
Now's the time
we crown the king of fools

391
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,283
You all remember last year's king

392
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,871
So make a face that's
horrible and frightening

393
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,665
Make a face that's gruesome
as a gargoyle's wing

394
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,708
Hey!

395
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,545
For the face that's ugliest
will be the king of fools

396
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,588
Why?

397
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,047
Topsy-turvy

398
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,217
-Ugly folks forget your shyness
-Topsy-turvy

399
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,178
You could soon be called
your highness

400
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,431
Put your foulest features on display

401
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,559
Be the king of topsy-turvy day

402
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,824
-That's no mask.
-It's his face!

403
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,242
He's hideous!

404
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,162
It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame!

405
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,463
Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.

406
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,926
We asked for the ugliest face in Paris,
and here it is!

407
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,180
Quasimodo,
the hunchback of Notre Dame!

408
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:21,852
Everybody!

409
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:26,065
Once a year we throw a party

410
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,193
-Here in town
-Hail to the king

411
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,947
Once a year
we turn all Paris upside-down

412
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,782
What a king

413
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,867
Once a year
the ugliest will wear a crown

414
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,286
Girls, give a kiss.

415
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,038
We never had a king like this

416
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,625
And it's the day we do
the things that we deplore

417
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,087
On the other three hundred
and sixty-four

418
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,340
Once a year we love to drop in
where the beer is never stopping

419
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,218
For the chance to pop some popinjay

420
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,303
And pick a king who put the "top"

421
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,723
ln topsy-turvy

422
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,185
Topsy-turvy
Mad-and-crazy upsy-daisy

423
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,272
Topsy-turvy day

424
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,655
Quasimodo! Quasimodo!

425
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,032
You think he's ugly now? Watch this.

426
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,993
Quasimodo!

427
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,914
Now that's ugly!

428
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,793
Hail to the king!

429
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,755
Bon appétit!

430
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,513
-Where are you goin', hunchback?
-The fun's just beginning.

431
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,293
Master!

432
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,047
Master, please, help me!

433
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,304
Sir, request permission
to stop this cruelty.

434
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,600
In a moment, Captain.
A lesson needs to be learned here.

435
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,533
Don't be afraid.

436
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,661
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,664
This wasn't supposed to happen.

438
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,793
You! Gypsy girl!

439
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,961
Get down at once!

440
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,298
Yes, your honour.
Just as soon as I free this poor creature.

441
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,466
I forbid it!

442
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,513
How dare you defy me?

443
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,849
You mistreat this poor boy
the same way you mistreat my people.

444
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,687
You speak ofjustice, yet you are cruel
to those most in need of your help.

445
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,772
-Silence!
-Justice!

446
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,906
Mark my words, gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.

447
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,701
Then it appears
we've crowned the wrong fool.

448
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,328
The only fool I see is you!

449
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,291
Captain Phoebus, arrest her.

450
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,463
Now, let's see.

451
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,632
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

452
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,886
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?

453
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,309
Witchcraft!

454
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,271
Oh, boys. Over here.

455
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,482
-There she is!
-Get her!

456
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,019
I'm free! I'm free!

457
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,605
Dang it.

458
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,372
What a woman.

459
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,571
Find her, Captain. I want her alive.

460
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,698
Yes, sir. Seal off the area, men.

461
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,867
Find the gypsy girl
and do not harm her.

462
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:43,215
I'm sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.

463
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,428
Stand back. Stand back.

464
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,808
Oh, he's hideous.

465
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,964
You, there, get away! Move on.

466
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,619
You!

467
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,746
Easy, easy. I just shaved this morning.

468
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,624
-Oh, really? You missed a spot.
-All right, all right.

469
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,376
Just calm down.
Just give me a chance to apologize.

470
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,171
-For what?
-That, for example.

471
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,548
You sneaky son of a...

472
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,675
Watch it. You're in a church.

473
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,887
Are you always this charming,
or am I just lucky?

474
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,017
Candlelight, privacy, music.

475
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,436
Can't think of a better place
for hand-to-hand combat.

476
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,105
You fight almost as well as a man.

477
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,108
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

478
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,194
That's hitting a little below the belt,
don't you think?

479
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,737
No. This is.

480
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,700
Touché.

481
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,537
-I didn't know you had a kid.
-Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers.

482
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,665
I noticed.

483
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,541
Permit me.

484
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,045
I'm Phoebus. It means "sun god."

485
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,634
-And you are?
-Is this an interrogation?

486
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,053
I believe it's called an introduction.

487
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,723
-You're not arresting me?
-Not as long as you're in here. I can't.

488
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,726
You're not at all like the other soldiers.

489
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,061
Thank you.

490
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:05,357
So, if you're not going to arrest me,
what do you want?

491
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,109
I'd settle for your name.

492
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,737
-Esmeralda.
-Beautiful.

493
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,701
Much better than Phoebus, anyway.

494
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,917
Good work, Captain. Now arrest her.

495
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,295
Claim "sanctuary."

496
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,508
-Say it!
-You tricked me.

497
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm waiting, Captain.

498
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,304
I'm sorry, sir. She claimed sanctuary.

499
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,764
There's nothing I can do.

500
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,267
Then drag her outside and...

501
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,729
Frollo, you will not touch her!
Don't worry.

502
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,358
Minister Frollo learned years ago
to respect the sanctity of the church.

503
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,037
All right, all right. I'm going.

504
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,792
You think you've outwitted me.

505
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,878
But I'm a patient man.

506
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:12,299
And gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.

507
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,762
What are you doing?

508
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:21,475
I was just imagining a rope
around that beautiful neck.

509
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,603
I know what you were imagining.

510
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,146
Such a clever witch.

511
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,899
So typical of your kind to twist the truth.

512
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,235
To cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.

513
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,196
Well, no matter.

514
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,075
You've chosen a magnificent prison.

515
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,994
But it is a prison, nonetheless.

516
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,748
Set one foot outside, and you're mine.

517
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,341
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.

518
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,346
Don't worry, Djali.

519
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,598
If Frollo thinks he can keep us here,
he's wrong.

520
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,391
Don't act rashly, my child.

521
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,978
You created quite a stir at the festival.

522
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,190
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.

523
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,027
You saw what he did out there,
letting the crowd torture that poor boy.

524
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,823
I thought ifjust one person
could stand up to him, then...

525
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,827
What do they have against people
who are different, anyway?

526
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,539
You can't right
all the wrongs of this world by yourself.

527
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,874
No one out there is going to help,
that's for sure.

528
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,878
Well, perhaps there's
someone in here who can.

529
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,401
l don't know if You can hear me

530
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,904
Or if You're even there

531
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,950
l don't know if You would listen

532
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,912
To a gypsy's prayer

533
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,624
Yes, l know l'm just an outcast

534
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,920
l shouldn't speak to You

535
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,925
Still, l see your face and wonder

536
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:25,765
Were You once an outcast, too?

537
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,025
God help the outcasts

538
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,944
Hungry from birth

539
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:42,032
Show them the mercy

540
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:46,077
They don't find on earth

541
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,247
God help my people

542
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,251
We look to You still

543
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,963
God help the outcasts

544
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,508
Or nobody will

545
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,222
l ask for wealth

546
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,099
l ask for fame

547
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,311
l ask for glory

548
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:15,315
To shine on my name

549
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,110
l ask for love

550
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,697
l can possess

551
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,868
l ask for God and His angels

552
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:31,039
To bless me

553
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,668
l ask for nothing

554
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,796
l can get by

555
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,633
But l know so many

556
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,262
Less lucky than l

557
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,765
Please help my people

558
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,727
The poor and downtrod

559
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,856
l thought we all were

560
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,403
The children of God

561
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:08,159
God help the outcasts

562
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:12,872
Children of

563
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:19,921
God

564
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,689
You! Bell ringer!
What are you doing down here?

565
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,401
Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

566
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,527
Wait.

567
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,322
I want to talk to you.

568
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,908
Look, he's got a friend with him.

569
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,494
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't
a total loss after all.

570
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,205
-A vision of loveliness.
-The one in the dress ain't bad either.

571
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,166
-Way to go, Quasi!
-Congratulations.

572
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,085
-We knew you had it in ya.
-Got the girls chasin' ya already.

573
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,170
Actually, I...

574
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,172
You mustn't run too fast,
or she'll get away.

575
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,673
Yes, I know. That's what I...

576
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,425
Give her some slack, then reel her in.

577
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,260
Then give her some slack,
then reel her in.

578
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,429
-Then give her some slack...
-Knock it off, Hugo.

579
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,598
She's a girl, not a mackerel.

580
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,684
Here you are. I was afraid I'd lost you.

581
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,936
Yes. Well, I...

582
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,609
I have chores to do.
It was nice seeing you again.

583
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,861
No, wait!

584
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,951
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.

585
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,162
I would never in my life
have pulled you...

586
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,707
Up on the...

587
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,086
Stage.

588
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,549
-What is this place?
-This is where I live.

589
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,344
Did you make all these things yourself?

590
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,595
Most of them.

591
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,930
This is beautiful.

592
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,350
If I could do this, you wouldn't find me
dancing in the streets for coins.

593
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,268
But you're a wonderful dancer.

594
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,480
It keeps bread on the table, anyway.
What's this?

595
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,108
No, please! I'm not finished.

596
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,776
I still have to paint them.

597
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,321
It's the blacksmith and the baker!

598
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,744
You're a surprising person, Quasimodo.

599
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,164
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.

600
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,166
Well, it's notjust me.

601
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,504
There's the gargoyles
and, of course, the bells.

602
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,091
-Would you like to see them?
-Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?

603
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,387
Follow me. I'll introduce you.

604
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,724
-I never knew there were so many.
-That's Little Sophia.

605
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,144
And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.

606
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,478
Triplets, you know.

607
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,689
-And who's this?
-Big Marie.

608
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,357
Hello!

609
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,862
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?

610
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,196
How about it, Djali?

611
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,992
-We'd love to.
-Good.

612
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,327
I've saved the best for last.

613
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,550
I bet the king himself
doesn't have a view like this.

614
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,345
-I could stay up here forever.
-You could, you know.

615
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,763
No, I couldn't.

616
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,892
-Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
-But not freedom.

617
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,603
"Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls."

618
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:26,274
But you're not like other gypsies.
They are evil.

619
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,360
-Who told you that?
-My master, Frollo.

620
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,570
He raised me.

621
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,281
How can such a cruel man have
raised someone like you?

622
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,200
Cruel? Oh, no.

623
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,578
He saved my life.
He took me in when no one else would.

624
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,664
-I am a monster, you know.
-He told you that?

625
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,416
Look at me.

626
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,086
-Give me your hand. Just let me see it.
-What?

627
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,632
A long lifeline.

628
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,384
And this one means you're shy.

629
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,640
-Well, that's funny.
-What?

630
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,100
-I don't see any...
-Any what?

631
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,103
Monster lines. Not a single one.

632
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,149
Now you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?

633
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,654
No! No, no.
You are kind and good and...

634
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,991
And a gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong
about the both of us.

635
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,326
What did she say?

636
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,578
Frollo's nose is long,
and he wears a truss.

637
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,288
Told ya! Pay up.

638
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,123
-Oh, dear.
-Chump.

639
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,338
You helped me. Now I will help you.

640
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,132
But there's no way out.
There are soldiers at every door.

641
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,009
We won't use a door.

642
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,470
-You mean, climb down?
-Sure.

643
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,723
-You carry him. I carry you.
-Okay.

644
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,851
Come on, Djali.

645
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,105
-Ready?
-Yes.

646
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,023
-Don't be afraid.
-I'm not afraid.

647
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,319
-Now I'm afraid.
-The trick is not to look down.

648
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,701
You've done this before?

649
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,952
No.

650
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,798
Wow, you're quite an acrobat.

651
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,091
Thank you.

652
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,269
-Check the alley!
-This way!

653
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,783
-I hope I didn't scare you.
-Not for an instant.

654
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,703
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.

655
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,706
-Come with me.
-What?

656
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,166
To the court of miracles.
Leave this place.

657
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,250
Oh, no.

658
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,128
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.

659
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,048
No. This is where I belong.

660
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,050
All right, then I'll come to see you.

661
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,220
-Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!
-I'll come after sunset.

662
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:05,016
But at sunset, I ring the evening mass,
and after that I clean the cloisters.

663
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,561
And then I ring the vespers, and...
Whatever is good for you.

664
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,649
If you ever need sanctuary,
this will show you the way.

665
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,567
-But how?
-Just remember.

666
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,655
When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand.

667
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,495
Hurry. You must go.

668
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,330
Check the alley.

669
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,875
Yes, sir. No one here, sir.

670
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,251
No one here, sir.

671
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,295
Check the street.

672
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,344
Hi, there.

673
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,555
I'm looking for the gypsy girl.
Have you seen her?

674
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,726
-Whoa, whoa! Easy!
-No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out!

675
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,603
-Wait! All I want is to...
-Go!

676
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,438
I mean her no harm.

677
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,607
Go!

678
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,947
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here.

679
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,741
But it was the only way
I could save her life.

680
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,286
Will you tell her that? Will you?

681
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,664
If you go. Now.

682
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,958
I'll go.

683
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,461
Now, will you put me down, please?

684
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,637
And one more thing.

685
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,974
-Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.
-Why?

686
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,184
To have a friend like you.

687
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,192
Hey, there he is.

688
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,324
You ejected that tin-plated buffoon
with great panache.

689
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,286
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here,
tryin' to steal your girl.

690
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,413
-My girl?
-Esmeralda.

691
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,749
Dark hair,
works with a goat, remember?

692
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,126
Boy, I do. Way to go, lover boy.

693
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,545
"Lover boy"? Oh, no, no, no, no.

694
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,255
Don't be so modest.

695
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,467
Look, I appreciate
what you're all trying to do.

696
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,763
But let's not fool ourselves.
"Ugliest face in all Paris," remember?

697
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,266
I don't think I'm her type.

698
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:16,606
So many times out there
l've watched a happy pair

699
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,860
Of lovers walking in the night

700
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,532
They had a kind of glow around them

701
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,037
lt almost looked like heaven's light

702
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,874
l knew l'd never know

703
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,210
That warm and loving glow

704
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:42,048
Though l might wish with all my might

705
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,094
No face as hideous as my face

706
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:52,391
Was ever meant for heaven's light

707
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,771
But suddenly an angel has
smiled at me

708
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:01,692
And kissed my cheek
without a trace of fright

709
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,072
l dare to dream that she

710
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,199
Might even care for me

711
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,703
And as l ring these bells tonight

712
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:19,293
My cold dark tower seems so bright

713
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:24,257
l swear it must be heaven's light

714
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,613
Confiteor Deo

715
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,993
Omnipotenti

716
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:57,206
Beatae Mariae

717
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,628
Semper Virgini

718
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:09,135
Beato Michaeli archangelo

719
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:13,264
Sanctis apostolis

720
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,308
Omnibus

721
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:20,938
Sanctis

722
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,444
Beata Maria

723
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,780
You know l am a righteous man

724
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:35,286
-Of my virtue l am justly proud
-Et tibit Pater

725
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,997
Beata Maria

726
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,875
You know l'm so much purer than

727
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,378
The common, vulgar, weak
licentious crowd

728
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,339
Quia peccavi nimis

729
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,008
Then tell me, Maria

730
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,011
Why l see her dancing there

731
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,848
Why her smouldering eyes
still scorch my soul

732
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,850
Cogitatione

733
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,519
l feel her, l see her

734
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,731
The sun caught in her raven hair

735
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,360
ls blazing in me out of all control

736
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,862
Verbo et opere

737
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,156
Like fire

738
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,076
Hellfire

739
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,705
This fire in my skin

740
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,251
This burning desire

741
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:29,215
ls turning me to sin

742
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,344
-lt's not my fault
-Mea culpa

743
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,388
-l'm not to blame
-Mea culpa

744
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,848
lt is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame

745
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,266
Mea maxima culpa

746
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,061
-lt's not my fault if in God's plan
-Mea culpa

747
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,145
Mea Culpa

748
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,734
He made the devil so much
stronger than a man

749
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,404
Protect me, Maria

750
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,198
Don't let this siren cast her spell

751
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:59,370
Don't let her fire
sear my flesh and bone

752
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,123
Destroy Esmeralda

753
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,084
And let her taste the fires of hell

754
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:10,047
Or else let her be mine and mine alone

755
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,386
Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.

756
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,930
-What?
-She's nowhere in the cathedral.

757
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:22,727
-She's gone.
-But how? Never mind.

758
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,855
Get out, you idiot. I'll find her.

759
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,442
I'll find her if I have to
burn down all of Paris.

760
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,613
Hellfire
Dark fire

761
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,284
Now, gypsy
lt's your turn

762
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,622
Choose me or your pyre

763
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,836
Be mine or you will burn

764
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:55,009
-Kyrie eleison
-God have mercy on her

765
00:50:55,093 --> 00:51:00,723
-Kyrie eleison
-God have mercy on me

766
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:05,811
-Kyrie eleison
-But she will be mine

767
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:09,106
Or she

768
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,692
Will

769
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:18,783
Burn

770
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,210
'Tention!

771
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,755
Good morning, sir.

772
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:38,636
-Are you feeling all right?
-I had a little trouble with the fireplace.

773
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,431
-I see. Your orders, sir?
-Find the gypsy girl.

774
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,317
Ten pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.

775
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,029
Lock them up.

776
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,790
Twenty pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.

777
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,209
Take them away!

778
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,721
-Poor miller.
-He's never harmed anyone!

779
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,723
Frollo's gone mad.

780
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,726
We found this gypsy talisman
on your property.

781
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,228
Have you been harbouring gypsies?

782
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,772
Our home is always open
to the weary traveller.

783
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,399
Have mercy, my lord.

784
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,985
I am placing you and your family
under house arrest

785
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,278
until I get to the bottom of this.

786
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,196
Ifwhat you say is true
and you are innocent,

787
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,447
then you have nothing to fear.

788
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:45,077
But we are innocent. I assure you,
we know nothing of these gypsies.

789
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,209
-Burn it.
-What?

790
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,795
Until it smoulders.

791
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,673
These people are traitors
and must be made examples of.

792
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,260
With all due respect, sir, I was
not trained to murder the innocent.

793
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,430
But you were trained to follow orders.

794
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,438
Insolent coward.

795
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,221
The sentence
for insubordination is death.

796
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:49,558
Such a pity.
You threw away a promising career.

797
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,228
Consider it my highest honour, sir.

798
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,490
Get him! And don't hit my horse!

799
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:19,630
Don't waste your arrows.
Let the traitor rot in his watery grave.

800
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,257
Find the girl.

801
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,261
If you have to burn the city
to the ground, so be it.

802
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:51,036
Kyrie eleison

803
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,206
Sir, we've looked everywhere
and still no sign of the gypsy girl.

804
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,043
I had the entire cathedral surrounded.

805
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,131
Guards at every door. There was
no way she could have escaped.

806
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,216
Unless...

807
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,641
It doesn't look good.

808
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,645
-It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
-You're tellin' me.

809
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,230
I'm losin' to a bird!

810
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,734
But that poor gypsy girl.
I'm beginning to fear the worst.

811
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,321
I know. But now don't you say
anything to upset Quasimodo.

812
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,947
He's worried enough already.

813
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,615
Yeah, you're right. We better lighten up.

814
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,076
-Here he comes.
-Nowjust stay calm.

815
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,494
-Not a word.
-Easy does it.

816
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,247
-Stone-faced.
-Any sign of her?

817
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,794
It's a lost cause!
She could be anywhere!

818
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,548
In the stocks,
in the dungeon, on the rack!

819
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:49,595
-Nice work, Victor.
-No, he's right. What are we gonna do?

820
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,221
What are you guys talkin' about?

821
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,431
If I know Esmeralda,

822
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,768
she's three steps ahead of Frollo
and well out of harm's way.

823
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,852
Do you really think so?

824
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,314
Hey, when things cool off,
she'll be back. You'll see.

825
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,025
-What makes you so sure?
-Because she likes ya.

826
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,777
We always said you were the cute one.

827
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,278
I thought I was the cute one.

828
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,114
No, you're the fat, stupid one
with the big mouth!

829
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,241
What are you sayin', exactly?

830
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,953
Take it from us, Quasi.
You got nothin' to worry about.

831
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,622
Yeah. You're irresistible.

832
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,708
Knights in shining armour
certainly aren't her type.

833
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,086
And those guys are a dime a dozen.

834
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:26,465
But you, you're one of a kind. Look.

835
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:31,553
Paris, the city of lovers
is glowing this evening

836
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,308
True, that's because it's on fire

837
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,354
But still there's l'amour

838
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,733
Somewhere out there in the night

839
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,404
Her heart is also alight

840
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:55,160
And l know the guy
she just might be burning for

841
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,832
A guy like you

842
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,210
She's never known, kid

843
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,503
A guy like you

844
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,840
A girl does not meet every day

845
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,134
You've got a look

846
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:14,388
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two?

847
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,558
Like you?
No way

848
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,185
Those other guys

849
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,438
That she could dangle

850
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:27,276
All look the same from every
boring point of view

851
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,778
You're a surprise

852
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,030
From every angle

853
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,535
Mon Dieu above
She's gotta love a guy like you

854
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,954
A guy like you

855
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,457
Gets extra credit

856
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:45,127
Because it's true you've got
a certain something more

857
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,295
You're aces, kid.

858
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:50,048
You see that face
Ya don't forget it

859
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,384
Want something new

860
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,510
That's you.

861
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,888
For sure

862
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:00,309
We all have gaped at some Adonis

863
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:05,063
But then we crave a meal
more nourishing to chew

864
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,399
And since you're shaped

865
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,651
Like a croissant is

866
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:14,406
No question of
she's gotta love a guy like you

867
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,786
Call me a hopeless romantic

868
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,414
But Quasi
l feel it

869
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,043
She wants you so

870
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:30,422
Any moment she'll walk
through that door

871
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,758
For

872
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,552
A guy so swell

873
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,306
A guy like you with all you bring her

874
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,351
A fool could tell it's why she fell

875
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,770
For you-know-who

876
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,022
You'll ring the bell

877
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,067
You're the bell ringer

878
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:54,446
When she wants ooh-la-la
And she wants you-la-la

879
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,615
She will discover, guy

880
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,784
You're one heck of a guy

881
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:02,120
Who wouldn't love a guy

882
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,664
Like You

883
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,332
-You got a lot
-The rest have not

884
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,125
She's gotta love a guy like you

885
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,711
Quasi?

886
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,381
Quasimodo?

887
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,049
Esmeralda?

888
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,303
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!

889
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,473
You've done so much
for me already, my friend.

890
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,559
But I must ask your help one more time.

891
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,143
Yes, anything.

892
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,317
This is Phoebus.
He's wounded and a fugitive like me.

893
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,655
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.

894
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,407
Please, can you hide him?

895
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,075
This way.

896
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,334
Esmeralda.

897
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,505
You'll hide here
until you're strong enough to move.

898
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,176
Great. I could use a drink.

899
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,013
Yes.

900
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:06,602
Feels like a 1470 burgundy.
Not a good year.

901
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,937
That family owes you their lives.

902
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,609
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.

903
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,527
Ex-soldier, remember?

904
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,616
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?

905
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,118
You're lucky.

906
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,370
That arrow almost pierced your heart.

907
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,373
I'm not so sure it didn't.

908
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:49,144
l knew l'd never know
that warm and loving glow

909
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:53,899
Though l might wish with all my might

910
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,737
No face as hideous as my face

911
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:04,159
Was ever meant for heaven's light

912
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,724
Frollo's coming. You must leave.

913
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:32,020
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.

914
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:36,358
Be careful, my friend. Promise
you won't let anything happen to him.

915
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,111
-I promise.
-Thank you.

916
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,449
Quick, we gotta stash the stiff.

917
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,635
Master, I didn't think you'd be coming.

918
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,305
I am never too busy to share
a meal with you, dear boy.

919
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,183
I brought a little treat.

920
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,990
Is there something troubling you,
Quasimodo?

921
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,993
-No!
-But there is.

922
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,954
I know there is.

923
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,843
I think you're hiding something.

924
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,845
No, Master. I... There's no...

925
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,180
You're not eating, boy.

926
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,100
It's very good. Thank you.

927
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,443
Seeds.

928
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,781
What's different in here?

929
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,532
Nothing. Sir.

930
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,828
Isn't this one new?

931
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,541
It's awfully good.
It looks very much like the gypsy girl.

932
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:22,047
I know you helped her escape!

933
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:27,219
And now all Paris is burning
because of you!

934
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,304
She was kind to me, Master.

935
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:33,350
You idiot!
That wasn't kindness. It was cunning!

936
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:37,729
She's a gypsy!
Gypsies are not capable of real love!

937
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,149
Think, boy. Think of your mother.

938
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:49,157
But what chance could
a poor, misshapen child like you

939
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:53,078
have against her heathen treachery?

940
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,081
Well, never you mind, Quasimodo.

941
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,583
She'll be out of our lives soon enough.

942
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,920
I will free you from her evil spell.

943
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,589
She will torment you no longer.

944
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,591
What do you mean?

945
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,427
I know where her hideout is.

946
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,430
And tomorrow at dawn, I attack

947
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,058
with 1 ,000 men.

948
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,364
We have to find the court
of miracles before daybreak.

949
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,534
If Frollo gets there first...
Are you coming with me?

950
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,204
-I can't.
-I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.

951
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,957
Frollo is my master.
I can't disobey him again.

952
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,878
She stood up for you. You've got
a funny way of showing gratitude.

953
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,218
Well, I'm not going to sit by and
watch Frollo massacre innocent people.

954
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,137
You do what you think is right.

955
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,895
What? What am I supposed to do?

956
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,814
Go out there and rescue
the girl from the jaws of death,

957
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,650
and the whole town will cheer
like I'm some kind of a hero?

958
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,696
She already has her knight
in shining armour, and it's not me.

959
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:16,411
Frollo was right.
Frollo was right about everything.

960
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,706
I'm tired of trying to be
something that I'm not.

961
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,519
I must be out of my mind.

962
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,273
Phoebus!

963
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,776
-I'm coming with you!
-Glad you changed your mind.

964
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,028
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for her.

965
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,196
You know where she is?

966
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,865
No, but she said
that this will help us find her.

967
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,285
Good, good, good. Great.

968
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:58,954
What is it?

969
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,374
I'm not sure.
It must be some sort of code.

970
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,543
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.

971
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:10,131
"When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand."

972
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,383
-What?
-It's the city.

973
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,801
-What are you talking about?
-It's a map.

974
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,720
See, here's the cathedral and the river,
and this little stone must be...

975
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:19,224
-I've never seen a map that looks like...
-I've lived in the tower for 20 years.

976
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,685
And I think I know what
the city looks like from above.

977
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,687
-This is it.
-This is not it.

978
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:29,734
All right. Okay.
If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map.

979
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,071
But ifwe're going to find Esmeralda,
we have to work together.

980
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,489
Truce?

981
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,117
Well, okay.

982
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,495
Sorry.

983
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,914
No, you're not.

984
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,429
This looks like the symbol on the map.

985
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,930
But what does it mean?

986
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,434
I'm not sure.

987
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,852
I can make out an inscription,

988
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,604
but it's going to
take a few minutes to translate it.

989
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,693
Yes, well.
Or we could just go down those stairs.

990
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,579
Is this the court of miracles?

991
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:26,291
Offhand, I'd say it's
the court of ankle-deep sewage.

992
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,418
Must be the old catacombs.

993
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,758
Cheerful place.

994
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,304
Kinda makes ya wish
ya got out more often, eh, Quasi?

995
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,347
Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda

996
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,975
and get back to the bell tower
before I get in more trouble.

997
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,645
Speaking of trouble, we should
have run into some by now.

998
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,316
-What do you mean?
-You know. A guard. A booby trap.

999
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,027
Or an ambush.

1000
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,577
Well, well, well. What have we here?

1001
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,995
-Trespassers!
-Spies!

1002
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,164
-We're not spies.
-You've got to listen...

1003
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,999
Don't interrupt me.

1004
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,044
You're very clever
to have found our hideaway.

1005
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:15,423
Unfortunately, you won't
live to tell the tale.

1006
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,842
Maybe you've heard of a terrible place

1007
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,345
Where the scoundrels of Paris
collect in a lair

1008
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,932
Maybe you've heard of that mythical
place called the court of miracles

1009
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,016
Hello, you're there.

1010
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,976
Where the lame can walk

1011
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,437
And the blind can see

1012
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,689
But the dead don't talk

1013
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,609
So you won't be around
to reveal what you found

1014
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,861
We have a method
for spies and intruders

1015
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,447
Rather like hornets
protecting their hive

1016
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:44,119
Here in the court of miracles
where it's a miracle if you get out alive

1017
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,875
Gather around, everybody.
There's "good noose" tonight.

1018
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,796
It's a doubleheader.
A couple of Frollo's spies.

1019
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,048
And notjust any spies.

1020
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:02,595
His captain of the guard
and his loyal, bell-ringing henchman.

1021
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,056
Justice is swift in the court of miracles

1022
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,475
l am the lawyers and judge all in one

1023
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,561
We like to get the trial over with quickly

1024
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,063
Because it's the sentence
that's really the fun

1025
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,149
Any last words?

1026
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,736
That's what they all say.

1027
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,698
-Now that we've seen all the evidence
-Wait, l object

1028
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,949
-Overruled.
-I object.

1029
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,909
-Quiet.
-Dang.

1030
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,329
We find you totally innocent

1031
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,499
Which is the worst crime of all

1032
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,168
So you're going to hang

1033
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,128
Stop!

1034
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,592
These men aren't spies.
They're our friends.

1035
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:43,553
-Why didn't they say so?
-We did say so.

1036
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,763
This is the soldier
who saved the miller's family.

1037
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,183
And Quasimodo helped me
escape the cathedral.

1038
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,019
We came to warn you. Frollo's coming!

1039
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,604
He says he knows where you're hiding,

1040
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:56,024
and he's attacking at dawn
with 1 ,000 men.

1041
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,110
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.

1042
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,116
You took a terrible risk coming here.

1043
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,827
It may not exactly show,
but we're grateful.

1044
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,041
Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo.

1045
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,710
Without his help,
I would never have found my way here.

1046
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,462
Nor would I.

1047
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,934
After 20 years of searching,

1048
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,896
the court of miracles is mine at last.

1049
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,732
Dear Quasimodo.

1050
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,902
I always knew
you would someday be of use to me.

1051
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,154
-No.
-What are you talking about?

1052
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:47,283
-Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
-You're a liar.

1053
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,161
And look what else
I've caught in my net.

1054
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,331
Captain Phoebus, back from the dead.

1055
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:56,501
Another "miracle," no doubt.

1056
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,419
I shall remedy that.

1057
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,549
There'll be a little bonfire
in the square tomorrow.

1058
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,511
And you're all invited to attend.

1059
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,179
Lock them up.

1060
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,348
No, please, Master!

1061
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,271
No, no.

1062
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:20,525
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.

1063
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:33,871
The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been
found guilty of the crime ofwitchcraft.

1064
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,875
The sentence...

1065
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,002
Death!

1066
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:58,438
The time has come, gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.

1067
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,232
Yet even now it is not too late.

1068
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:05,862
I can save you from the flames
of this world and the next.

1069
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,574
Choose me. Or the fire.

1070
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,916
The gypsy, Esmeralda,
has refused to recant.

1071
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:23,755
This evil witch has put the soul
of every citizen in Paris

1072
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,965
in awful jeopardy.

1073
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,053
Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it!

1074
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,764
-Your friends are down there.
-It's all my fault.

1075
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,432
You gotta break these chains.

1076
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,185
I can't. I tried.
What difference would it make?

1077
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:40,271
-But you can't let Frollo win!
-He already has.

1078
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,024
So you're givin' up? That's it?

1079
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,777
These chains aren't what's
holding you back, Quasimodo.

1080
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,403
Leave me alone.

1081
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,035
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave ya alone.

1082
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,621
After all, we're only made out of stone.

1083
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,916
We just thought maybe
you were made of somethin' stronger.

1084
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,756
Forjustice, for Paris,

1085
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,634
and for her own salvation,

1086
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:14,764
it is my sacred duty
to send this unholy demon

1087
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,475
back where she belongs.

1088
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,521
No!

1089
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,030
Quasimodo!

1090
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:36,929
Sanctuary!

1091
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,681
-Captain.
-Sir?

1092
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,016
Seize the cathedral.

1093
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,312
Don't worry. You'll be safe here.

1094
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,563
Charge!

1095
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,749
Come back, you cowards!

1096
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,794
You, men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.

1097
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,088
Alone at last.

1098
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,094
Citizens of Paris!

1099
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:21,599
Frollo has persecuted our people,
ransacked our city!

1100
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:26,479
Now he has declared war
on Notre Dame herself!

1101
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,607
Will we allow it?

1102
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,452
I think the cavalry is here.

1103
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:42,578
Hey, isn't that...

1104
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,704
-Feeble?
-Doofus.

1105
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,997
Phoebus!

1106
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,131
Sorry. Sorry.

1107
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,598
Harder!

1108
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,859
I'm free! I'm free!

1109
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:16,737
Dang it!

1110
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,459
Ready, aim, fire!

1111
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,757
Are you sure that's how it works?

1112
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,844
Works for me.

1113
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:48,728
Achilles, sit.

1114
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,814
Get off me!

1115
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,109
Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly!

1116
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,409
Put your backs into it!

1117
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,152
Frollo, have you gone mad?

1118
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:41,155
I will not tolerate
this assault on the house of God!

1119
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,491
Silence, you old fool!

1120
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,410
The hunchback and I
have unfinished business to attend to.

1121
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,038
And this time you will not interfere.

1122
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,835
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!

1123
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,379
Come and see.

1124
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,093
Esmeralda, wake up.

1125
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,427
You're safe now.

1126
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,597
Esmeralda?

1127
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:28,452
No.

1128
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,488
You killed her.

1129
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:09,535
It was my duty, horrible as it was.
I hope you will forgive me.

1130
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:15,332
There, there, Quasimodo.
I know it hurts.

1131
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:19,670
But now the time has come
to end your suffering...

1132
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,047
Forever.

1133
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:35,186
Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo.

1134
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,353
No, you listen!

1135
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,690
All my life, you have told me
the world is a dark, cruel place.

1136
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:44,028
But now I see that the only thing dark
and cruel about it is people like you.

1137
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,529
Quasimodo?

1138
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,531
Esmeralda!

1139
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,200
She lives.

1140
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,326
No!

1141
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,099
Leaving so soon?

1142
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,063
Look, up there!

1143
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:21,065
Hang on!

1144
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:39,500
I should have known you'd risk your life
to save that gypsy witch,

1145
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:43,587
just as your own mother
died trying to save you.

1146
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:44,672
What?

1147
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:49,760
Now I'm going to do
what I should have done 20 years ago!

1148
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:11,282
Hold on.

1149
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:26,297
And he shall smite the wicked
and plunge them into the fiery pit!

1150
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,815
Quasimodo! Quasi!

1151
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,318
No!

1152
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:50,482
Three cheers for Quasimodo!

1153
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:57,156
So here is a riddle to guess if you can

1154
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,784
Sing the bells of Notre Dame

1155
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:06,331
What makes a monster
and what makes a man

1156
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:10,169
Sing the bells, bells
Bells, bells

1157
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:11,712
Whatever their pitch

1158
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:16,842
You can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells

1159
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:18,510
Of the bells

1160
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:23,766
Of Notre

1161
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:30,481
Dame

1162
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,409
Don't you ever migrate?

1163
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,682
Good night, everybody!
