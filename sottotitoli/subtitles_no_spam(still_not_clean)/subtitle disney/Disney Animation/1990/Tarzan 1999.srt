1
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,395
Put your faith in what
you most believe in

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,357
Two worlds, one family

3
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,445
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

4
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:16,200
To guide these lives we see

5
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,080
A paradise untouched by man

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,833
Within this world blessed with love

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,922
A simple life
They live in peace

8
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,343
Softly tread the sand
below your feet now

9
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,055
Two worlds, one family

10
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:42,267
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,814
To guide these lives we see

12
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,985
Beneath the shelter of the trees

13
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,781
Only love can enter here

14
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,869
A simple life
They live in peace

15
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,706
Raise your head up
Lift high the load

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,919
Take strength from those
that need you

17
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:13,340
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams

18
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,592
A new life is waiting

19
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,263
But danger's no stranger here

20
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,457
No words describe a mother's tears

21
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,171
No words can heal a broken heart

22
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,383
A dream is gone
but where there's hope

23
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:01,138
Somewhere, something is calling for you

24
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,558
Two worlds, one family

25
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,937
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,442
To guide these lives we see

27
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,390
Every moment now
the bond grows stronger

28
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,894
Two worlds, one family

29
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,106
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

30
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,777
To guide these lives we see

31
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,540
Mama, look!
Look over there!

32
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,542
- Kala!
- She's back.

33
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,129
- I told you she was comin' back.
- We looked everywhere for you.

34
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,132
Are you all right, dear?

35
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,134
I'm fine. No, really, honestly.

36
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,263
It's just that I got a little bit...
sidetracked.

37
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,975
Well, isn't that...

38
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,771
- Well, it's so...
- Why, it's, it's just so...

39
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,398
It's freaky-lookin'.
That's what it is.

40
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,651
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

41
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,403
I mean, what the heck is it anyway?

42
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,572
He's a baby.

43
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,408
I can't...

44
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,788
So, where's his mama?

45
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,874
Well, I'm going to be his mother now.

46
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,800
You know, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.

47
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,095
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

48
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,812
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

49
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,651
Kala, it won't replace the one we lost.

50
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,738
I know that.
But he needs me.

51
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,367
But it, it...

52
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,954
Kala, look at it.
It's not our kind.

53
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,833
No, you have to take it back.

54
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,794
Take him back?
But he'll die.

55
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,088
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

56
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,424
I cannot let you
put our family in danger.

57
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,260
Does he look dangerous to you?

58
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,146
Was it alone?

59
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,648
Yes. Sabor killed his family.

60
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,859
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

61
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,902
There are no others.

62
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,157
Then you may keep him.

63
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,077
Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.

64
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,912
I said he could stay.

65
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,707
That doesn't make him my son.

66
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,462
We will nest here for the night.

67
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,845
So, what you gonna call it?

68
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,473
I'm gonna call him...

69
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,807
...Tarzan.

70
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,144
Tarzan? OK, he's your baby.

71
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,481
All right, little lady, come on.
It's past your nest time.

72
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,940
- Oh, Mom.
- No.

73
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,110
Five more minutes?
Two more minutes?

74
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,154
One more minutes?

75
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,958
Don't cry. I'm here.
Come on. Come on.

76
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,503
Come, stop your crying

77
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,381
It will be all right

78
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:19,135
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

79
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,890
I will protect you
from all around you

80
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:29,145
I will be here, don't you cry

81
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,275
For one so small
You seem so strong

82
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,446
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm

83
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,618
This bond between us
Can't be broken

84
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,206
I will be here, don't you cry

85
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,627
Cos you'll be in my heart

86
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:57,048
Yes, you'll be in my heart

87
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,135
From this day on

88
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,305
Now and forever more

89
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,771
You'll be in my heart

90
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:16,985
No matter what they say

91
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,698
You'll be here in my heart

92
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,284
Always

93
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,498
Always.

94
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,024
Tarzan.

95
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,485
Tarzan?

96
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,239
I sure scared you, Mom.

97
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,450
You sure did.

98
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,827
Can't you imitate any quieter animal?

99
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,871
Mom, they're no fun.

100
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,040
Wanna see me be a leopard?

101
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,711
Why don't you just come up
with your own sound?

102
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,761
Kala.

103
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,433
Oops.

104
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,648
Tarzan! Thank goodness
you're all right!

105
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,652
Kala and I have been so worried.

106
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,655
Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

107
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,866
You are such a wise and caring leader.

108
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,160
Run.

109
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,959
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

110
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,002
How many times
do I have to tell you?

111
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,714
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him.

112
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,424
Come on, Terk, step on it!

113
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,262
- Last one there is a dung beetle!
- The first one's gotta eat it.

114
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,555
Terk, can I come?

115
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,892
Well, you could if you could keep up,
but, you know, you can't really keep up.

116
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,813
Wait up, guys!
Wait up! Right behind you!

117
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,614
You're standing on my spleen.

118
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,658
Take that!
Stop hitting yourself.

119
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,120
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

120
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,707
The fun has arrived

121
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,293
- Thank you very much.
- What took you so long?

122
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,963
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

123
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,425
Hi, guys.

124
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,969
Terk, what is this,
some kind ofjoke?

125
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,055
Tell me I'm not looking
at the hairless wonder.

126
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,100
Well, Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

127
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,478
- No, no.
- Terk. Come on.

128
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,524
I'll handle this, guys, OK?
Listen, buddy. Come here.

129
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,861
We got a tiny, little, itsy-bitsy
problem here, OK?

130
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,072
I'd love to hang out with you.
You know I would.

131
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,200
But the guys... they need
a little convincing, you know?

132
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,038
- OK, what do I gotta do?
- Do? What do you gotta do?

133
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,206
It's so stupid.

134
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,333
What?

135
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,129
Well, you gotta...
you gotta go get a hair.

136
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,215
- A hair?
- Yeah, a hair.

137
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,303
An elephant hair.

138
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,392
An elephant hair?

139
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,187
Like I said, it's stupid, right?

140
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,023
Listen, take it from me.
Go home. OK?

141
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,233
Who needs this aggravation?

142
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,028
You know, I'm probably
gonna leave soon myself.

143
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,031
You go, I'll catch up, all right?

144
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,326
You see? Leave it to me.
I told you I could...

145
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,954
Tarzan! Tarzan!

146
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,965
That one hurt him.

147
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,651
Look! There he is!

148
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,403
He's alive!

149
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,406
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

150
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,453
Come back! Come back.

151
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,080
This guy's great.

152
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,041
If he lives, you should
bring him around more often.

153
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,794
Come on, come on.
Let's go get a better seat.

154
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,174
You can never get enough sleep,
let me tell you.

155
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,843
- I get enough sleep.
- Mom?

156
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,888
- It burns up the calories.
- Are you sure this water's sanitary?

157
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,808
It looks questionable to me.

158
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,977
It's fine, honey.

159
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,106
But what about bacteria?

160
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,901
Tantor, can't you see
Mummy's talking?

161
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,034
Watch out!
There's something swimming!

162
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,829
- It's coming right at you!
- Honey, Mummy's losing her patience.

163
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,166
- But this time I really see something.
- Oh, boy.

164
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,835
Piranha! It's a piranha!

165
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,380
Sweetheart, there are no
piranhas in Africa.

166
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,009
Don't tell the kid that.
Of course there are piranhas in Africa.

167
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,970
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

168
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,764
- Get outta here.
- It's true.

169
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,223
- No way.
- Come on, now.

170
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,059
Think I'd be here if there were?

171
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,227
It's right behind you! Run!

172
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,232
For the last time, honey,
there are no piranhas in...

173
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,692
My butt!

174
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,904
- Told you!
- There's something on my butt!

175
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,740
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

176
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,454
- What is it?
- It's a piranha.

177
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,335
Piranha!

178
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,090
Tantor, where are you?

179
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,726
He's dead.

180
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,395
We're dead!

181
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,321
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

182
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,133
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

183
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,721
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on!

184
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,974
Tarzan, don't die on me!
Don't die!

185
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,393
- You weren't supposed to do it!
- Get away!

186
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,646
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh in seconds?

187
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,023
What? He's not a piranha!

188
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,943
He's alive!

189
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,279
He's alive! He's alive!

190
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,322
- He's alive!
- He's...

191
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,824
You idiot!

192
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,869
You nearly gave me a heart attack!
You happy?

193
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,582
I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

194
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,253
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

195
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,422
- Tarzan?
- Terkina?

196
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,923
Oh, no.

197
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,634
- Who's that?
- My mom.

198
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,386
- Tarzan.
- Hi.

199
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,889
- Hi, Aunt Kala.
- Oh, you scared me!

200
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,141
- What happened?
- Well, I...

201
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,310
It's sort of a long...
It's involved.

202
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,645
Because what happened,
it was a weird...

203
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,439
What happened?

204
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,401
It was my fault, Kerchak.

205
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,694
Tarzan.

206
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:01,824
We were playing, and...
Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak.

207
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,951
You almost killed someone.

208
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,204
- It was an accident.
- He's only a child.

209
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,998
That's no excuse.
You can't keep defending him.

210
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,667
- He'll learn.
- You can't learn to be one of us.

211
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,795
- You never give him a chance.
- Give him a chance?

212
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,966
Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

213
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,260
Kerchak!

214
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,221
Tarzan.

215
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,232
Tarzan, what are you doing?

216
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,859
Why am I so different?

217
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,112
You're covered with mud,
that's why.

218
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,282
- Kerchak said I didn't belong in...
- Close your mouth.

219
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,701
Kerchak said I don't
belong in the family.

220
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,287
Never mind what Kerchak said.

221
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,206
- Hold still.
- But look at me!

222
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,502
I am, Tarzan.

223
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,296
And do you know what I see?

224
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,841
I see two eyes, like mine,

225
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,845
and a nose, somewhere.

226
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,014
Here.

227
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,433
Two ears.

228
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,186
- And let's see, what else?
- Two hands?

229
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,022
That's right.

230
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,206
Close your eyes.

231
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,251
Now, forget what you see.

232
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,295
What do you feel?

233
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,006
My heart.

234
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,008
Come here.

235
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,553
- Your heart.
- See?

236
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,222
We're exactly the same.

237
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,644
Kerchak just can't see that.

238
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,690
I'll make him see it.

239
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,651
I'll be the best ape ever.

240
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,029
Oh, I bet you will.

241
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,962
Oh, the power to be strong

242
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,591
And the wisdom to be wise

243
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:10,554
All these things
will come to you in time

244
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,142
On this journey that you're making

245
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,021
There'll be answers that you'll seek

246
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,233
And it's you who'll climb the mountain

247
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,945
It's you who'll reach the peak

248
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,490
Son of Man, look to the sky

249
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,743
Lift your spirit, set it free

250
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,205
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

251
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,252
Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be

252
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,267
Though there's no one there
to guide you

253
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,020
No one to take your hand

254
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,315
But with faith and understanding

255
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,194
You will journey from boy to man

256
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,281
Son of Man, look to the sky

257
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,784
Lift your spirit, set it free

258
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,163
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

259
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:22,168
Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be

260
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,592
In learning you will teach

261
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:34,221
And in teaching you will learn

262
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:39,185
You'll find your place
beside the ones you love

263
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,023
Oh, and all the things
you dreamed of

264
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,735
The visions that you saw

265
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,946
Well, the time is drawing near now

266
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,325
It's yours to claim it all

267
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,828
Son of Man, look to the sky

268
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,207
Lift your spirit, set it free

269
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:05,002
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

270
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:10,132
Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be

271
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,641
Son of Man

272
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:23,646
Son of Man's a man for all to see

273
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,790
Don't even think about it.

274
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,295
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

275
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,215
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

276
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,678
Hey, Auntie K, you're looking
remarkably groomed today.

277
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,346
Hello, Terk.

278
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,182
Not the neck!
Not the neck there, T.

279
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,394
Watch it!

280
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,150
OK, it's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

281
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,653
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt here.

282
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,281
- And it's always me.
- Cramp in the calf.

283
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,908
- Please!
- OK. OK, you win.

284
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,454
OK, OK, you win. Hello!
Down here. Yo, yo! Let go!

285
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,499
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

286
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,210
I been thinking lately
that maybe Tarzan

287
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,462
could be some subspecies of elephant.

288
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,590
What are you, crazy?
An elephant?

289
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:36,552
Listen to me. Think about it.
He enjoys a peanut, I enjoy a peanut.

290
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,554
He looks nothing like you.

291
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,432
OK everybody, move aside.
Outta my way.

292
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,685
Best friend coming through.
That would be me.

293
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,979
And you,
don't make a habit of that.

294
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,482
There are other ways
of getting attention.

295
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,817
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

296
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,737
I was right behind you.
I had you covered.

297
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,901
What was that?

298
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,695
It wasn't me, I swear.

299
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,239
OK, well, maybe it was.

300
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,408
Everyone, let's move.

301
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,918
I was reminded of a safari
I led up the Zambezi.

302
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,089
Marvellous. Lots of hunting, yes.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

303
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,049
Wildebeest everywhere.

304
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,846
Two bearers loading three rifles
for me, blasting away.

305
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:35,100
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa

306
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,270
and Africa was created for...

307
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,905
Clayton?

308
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,198
Clayton...
Oh, there you are.

309
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,327
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

310
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,162
I thought I saw something.

311
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,790
Is it a Hippopotamus amphibious
or a Rhinoceros bihornus?

312
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,418
- Professor, don't move!
- Oh, right.

313
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,045
Daddy?

314
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,382
Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about?

315
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,138
What is it, Daddy?

316
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,308
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

317
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,437
I moved.

318
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,398
Uh, Mr Clayton?
Sorry, excuse me.

319
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,027
But my father and I came on this
expedition to study gorillas,

320
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,197
and I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

321
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,741
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter,

322
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,826
and protect you I shall.

323
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,120
And you're doing a marvellous job of it.

324
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,707
But we only have a short time
before the ship returns, you see...

325
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,336
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

326
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,838
- A gorilla's nest!
- Daddy!

327
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,384
At last! Our first sign in days.

328
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,178
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

329
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,847
Could be. Why, I mean,
there's the evidence.

330
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,724
They can't be very far, anyway.

331
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,601
Look! Over there and there...

332
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,186
Where?
Yes, more nests!

333
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,355
- I see them!
- Just as you predicted!

334
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,898
Family groups!

335
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,858
Oh, Jane, I love you.

336
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,070
Family groups?

337
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,614
Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts

338
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,701
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

339
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,577
On the contrary, Mr Clayton.

340
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,081
Daddy's theory is these are
social creatures, not monsters.

341
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,922
Mr Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

342
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,049
It's no gorilla.

343
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,556
- Perhaps we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

344
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,518
We should keep heading west,
following the Ganoderma ablonatum.

345
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,353
Excellent, professor.

346
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,440
I could've used your expertise
on my last safari.

347
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,067
I was in the mountainous region
of Zambia.

348
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,570
Yes, very dangerous.

349
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,616
Are you what all the fuss was about?

350
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,786
Daddy! Daddy, quick!

351
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,872
No, wait. Hold still.

352
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,540
Oh, my good...

353
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:08,420
You may not be a gorilla,
but you are one sweet little...

354
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,593
There. What do you think?

355
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,476
Why, you little...

356
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,353
Well, this is absolutely peachy.

357
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:30,233
Come to study gorillas and get my
sketchbook pinched by a baboon.

358
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,159
Give me that!

359
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,623
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

360
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,374
One.

361
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,168
Two.

362
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,544
Look, bananas!

363
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,467
I can't believe you fell for that one.

364
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:59,137
No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

365
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,348
What would your parents have to say?

366
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,562
You see, I told you they'd be cross.

367
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,315
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

368
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,503
I'm flying!

369
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,588
What on earth am I...

370
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,844
Get off! Get off!

371
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,143
Put me down! Put me down!

372
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,187
No, pick me up, pick me up!

373
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,694
Help!

374
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,425
Unhand me, monkey!

375
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,238
Over there!

376
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,250
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

377
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,294
I can't do this. I can't...

378
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,922
This is good.
This is very good.

379
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,216
Wait.

380
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,677
One, two.

381
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,224
It can't get any worse, can it?

382
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,145
Obviously it can.

383
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,740
Stay back. No, don't...
Don't come any closer.

384
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,992
Please, don't.

385
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,160
What are you...
What are you doing?

386
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,789
No, please don't.
That tickles.

387
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,833
No, get off, get off. Get off!

388
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,377
It serves you right.

389
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,046
Stay away from me,
like a very good wild man.

390
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,340
You stay. I'm warning you.

391
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,426
My father won't take kindly to you...

392
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,804
No. That's...
That's close enough.

393
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,098
How dare you?

394
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,854
Oh, dear.

395
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,357
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

396
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,275
Yes, thank you.

397
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,237
That's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

398
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,575
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

399
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,870
I can't do a thing with it
in this humidity though.

400
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,330
You do speak!

401
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,417
All this time I thought you were a big,
wild, quiet, silent person thing.

402
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,380
Why didn't you tell me? I must say
I'm rather curious as to who you are.

403
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:53,807
Tarzan.

404
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,684
Tarzan?

405
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,733
Oh, I see.

406
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,568
Tarzan.

407
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,570
Oh, I see.

408
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:17,747
I'm Jane.

409
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,294
Jane. Tarzan.

410
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,132
Jane.

411
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,509
Exactly.

412
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,344
Clayton!

413
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,893
- Clayton.
- Extraordinary.

414
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:43,398
Please, can you take me to my camp?

415
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,985
Yes, Clayton. Wonderful.

416
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,614
Can't we walk?

417
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,534
Can't we walk?!

418
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,292
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak.
- Maybe he's lost.

419
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,420
- Or found something more interesting.
- Are you nuts?

420
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,714
What could be more interesting than us?

421
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,176
Hey, what's everybody looking at?

422
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,808
The horror!

423
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,768
It's gruesome. Hide me!

424
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,897
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

425
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,900
These things aren't alive.

426
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,610
I knew that.

427
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,781
Hello?

428
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:39,787
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

429
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,298
Come here, you guys!
Come here, come here!

430
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,300
- Look at this.
- What is that thing?

431
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,260
Funny.

432
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,686
Do it again, do it again.

433
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,480
Like this?

434
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,653
Rip it!

435
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,240
Ding! I love that part.

436
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,660
Let me hear it, big fella.

437
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,287
Now, hit it!

438
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,962
Nice.

439
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,965
What the heck? Bye-bye.

440
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,299
Terk.

441
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,261
Yeah, Tant.

442
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,596
Now, hit it.

443
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,973
Come on, Tantor.

444
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,059
I love it.

445
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,936
Stay with me, fellas.

446
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,439
I feel something happening here.

447
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,986
Gorillas!

448
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,663
He's one of them.

449
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,854
Oh, my...

450
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,896
Jane, where are you?

451
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,484
- Thank goodness.
- Good heavens, what happened?

452
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,945
Are you all right?
We've been everywhere.

453
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,196
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,116
Daddy, I was out walking...

455
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,785
- Yes, yes.
- Little baby. Little baby monkey.

456
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,328
- I drew a picture.
- Go on.

457
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,664
- The monkey starts crying.
- Poor baby.

458
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,542
I turned round,
and there's a whole fleet of them!

459
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,294
- Of what?
- An army of monkeys!

460
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,379
- A tree full of them...
- Monkeys?

461
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,047
...screaming at me!

462
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,925
Theropithecus baboonus.
She's very good at this.

463
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,719
- Really?
- Terrified, I was.

464
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,097
Suddenly, I was swinging
in the vines, up in the air!

465
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,849
- With the monkeys?
- Flying.

466
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,101
- In the air.
- And I'm all surrounded.

467
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,146
- What did you do?
- And, Daddy, they took my boot!

468
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,940
- Those are the ones I bought you.
- And I was saved!

469
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,486
I was saved by a flying wild man
in a loincloth.

470
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,405
- Loincloth, good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

471
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,742
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother.

472
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,912
She'd come up with stories.
Not about men in loincloths...

473
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,164
- And there were gorillas!
- Gorillas?

474
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:37,084
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas? Where, Jane?

475
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,338
- He left with them.
- Who, dear, who?

476
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,632
Tarzan.

477
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,966
Tarzan?

478
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,219
The ape man.

479
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,433
Everyone. We will avoid the strangers.

480
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,019
Do not let them see you,
do not seek them out.

481
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,771
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

482
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,899
- I don't know them.
- I do. I've spent time with them.

483
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,568
You may be willing to risk our safety,
I'm not.

484
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,155
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

485
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:12,787
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

486
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,626
Tarzan, for once,
listen to Kerchak.

487
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,129
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that look like me?

488
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,224
Well, he didn't stand upright.
He sort of...

489
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,642
...crouched.
- Really?

490
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,853
He supported himself
on his knuckles.

491
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,856
- On the knuckles.
- See? Exactly like a gorilla.

492
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,817
- Extraordinary.
- It was amazing!

493
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,279
He'd bend his elbows like this.
And then he walks, like this.

494
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,490
Oh, I see! Like Aunt Isabel.

495
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,994
This is capital!

496
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,162
Janey-Jane, what a discovery!

497
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,790
A man with no language,
no human behaviour...

498
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,251
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

499
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,670
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy.

500
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,005
Staring at me.

501
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,341
He seemed confused at first,

502
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,011
as if he's never seen
another human before.

503
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:15,266
And his eyes were intense
and focused, and...

504
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,520
I've never seen such eyes.

505
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,027
Shall I leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

506
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,070
Daddy, stop it.

507
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:32,909
The point is, think of what we could
learn from him. We must find him.

508
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,413
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

509
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,082
not indulge some girlish fantasy.

510
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,877
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him.

511
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,211
Tarzan is...

512
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,923
...real.

513
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,008
It's him!

514
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,302
It's him, it's him. Tarzan!

515
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,221
- Professor, Jane, stand back!
- Wait!

516
00:48:55,307 --> 00:49:01,020
Clayton.

517
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,814
Have we met?

518
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,609
How does he know my name?

519
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,111
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

520
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,407
Yes. Hello, Tarzan.

521
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,160
I see what you mean
about personal boundaries.

522
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,412
What's he doing?

523
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,248
Look at him, Jane.

524
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,376
Moves like an ape,
looks like a man.

525
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,462
He could be the missing link.

526
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,216
Or our link to the gorillas.

527
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,760
Yes, yes.

528
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,888
Where are the gorillas?

529
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,018
Go-ri-llas!

530
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,730
Shouting won't help.
He doesn't understand English.

531
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,691
Then I'll make him understand.

532
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,568
If I can teach a parrot to sing
God Save the Queen,

533
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,614
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

534
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:59,662
Gorilla.

535
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,331
- He's got it!
- Gorilla.

536
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,250
Go-ril-la.

537
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,376
Perhaps not.

538
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,215
Gimme that. Leave it.

539
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,552
Mr Clayton, I think
I'll take it from here.

540
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,773
Whatever you do, I'll do it too

541
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:32,028
Show me everything and tell me how

542
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,280
It all means something

543
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,825
And yet nothing to me

544
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,748
I can see there's so much to learn

545
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:48,044
It's all so close
and yet so far

546
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,589
I see myself as people see me

547
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:56,052
Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there

548
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,014
I wanna know, can you show me

549
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,018
I wanna know about
these strangers like me

550
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,980
Tell me more, please show me

551
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,277
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

552
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:24,163
Every gesture,
every move that she makes

553
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:28,125
Makes me feel like never before

554
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,964
Why do I have this growing need
to be beside her

555
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,470
These emotions I never knew

556
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:43,933
Of some other world
far beyond this place

557
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,686
Beyond the trees,
above the clouds

558
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:52,149
I see before me a new horizon

559
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:56,028
I wanna know, can you show me

560
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:00,199
I wanna know about
these strangers like me

561
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,869
Tell me more, please show me

562
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,124
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

563
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:13,170
Come with me now to see my world

564
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,258
Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams

565
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:21,345
Can you feel the things I feel

566
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,641
Right now, with you

567
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,562
Take my hand

568
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:34,024
There's a world I need to know

569
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,044
We've wasted all this time
on what he wants.

570
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,174
The boat could arrive any day.
Now, ask him straight out.

571
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,097
Tarzan, will you take us
to the gorillas?

572
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,266
Do you understand?

573
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,476
I understand.

574
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,562
- Good work, Jane.
- Well?

575
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,939
- I can't.
- What?

576
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,276
- Why not, Tarzan?
- Kerchak.

577
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:01,070
Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy.

578
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,197
Yeah? I give it a week.

579
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,870
- Aye, cut her loose!
- Come on, pull it down.

580
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:13,123
- All right, move it, ya bilge rats!
- Heave ho, lads.

581
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,458
Put your back in it.

582
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,044
- OK, move it.
- Wait. Please, don't...

583
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:21,048
I've waited 30 years for this
and I won't leave until I see a gorilla.

584
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,678
Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?
No! No, no, wait!

585
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,930
Pick your barrel up.
Pick it up.

586
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,015
Here we go. Here we go.

587
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,725
You're the captain.

588
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,020
Say you've had engine trouble,
and give us two more days.

589
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,606
And be late at every port
from here to London?

590
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,233
We'll have come for nothing.

591
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:43,279
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

592
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,656
This is your fault.

593
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,243
I should've followed my instincts
and set traps for the beasts.

594
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,329
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

595
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,581
You are absolutely impossible!

596
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,460
I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

597
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,837
The boat's arrived.

598
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,007
The boat that's come to take us home,
to England.

599
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:07,511
And Daddy and I were...
Well, I was wondering...

600
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,639
Well, we really hope
that you'll come with us.

601
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,141
Won't you?

602
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,562
Go see England today.
Come home tomorrow.

603
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,859
Well, see, it would be very difficult
to come back...

604
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,152
...ever.

605
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,778
Not come back?

606
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,866
I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us, with people.

607
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,909
Jane must stay with Tarzan.

608
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,619
Stay here?

609
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,246
My laundry.

610
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,791
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

611
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,210
I'm with my father, and...

612
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,672
Jane... stay.

613
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,425
- But...
- Please.

614
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,388
But, I can't.

615
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,726
Women.

616
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,645
How typical. Thank you, Jones.

617
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,733
Even if you hadn't grown up
a savage, you'd be lost.

618
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,320
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

619
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,948
- Jane is going.
- Yes.

620
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:14,119
If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

621
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,455
She's so disappointed.

622
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,124
Crushed, really.

623
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,960
Sorry, old boy.

624
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,923
Oh, well, I best get Jane's things
to the ship.

625
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,178
Clayton.

626
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:37,101
If Jane sees gorillas,
she stays?

627
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,896
Say, that's why she came, isn't it?

628
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,651
- I'll do it.
- Good man!

629
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,277
- Snipes?
- Sir?

630
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:52,032
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

631
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,118
Terk, just get Kerchak out of the way.

632
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,161
- What?
- I'd be happy to get...

633
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,832
Hey! Shut your trunk
and get me out of here.

634
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,167
Can you believe that guy?

635
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,712
Drops us like a newborn giraffe,
kerplop!

636
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,216
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

637
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,969
Terk, I'm asking you as a friend.

638
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,433
With the face and the eyes
and the...

639
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:22,062
All right! But don't make me
do anything embarrassing.

640
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,773
I'm gonna kill him!!

641
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,193
I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

642
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,613
Really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

643
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,577
How does she move in this thing?

644
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,040
Look out!

645
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,610
- Look, Daddy!
- Where?

646
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,158
Now, be careful, professor.

647
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,910
Mustn't, mustn't frighten.

648
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,163
She's beautiful.

649
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,874
She's my mother.

650
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,877
This is your...

651
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,880
...mother?

652
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,268
- What's happening?
- I don't know, Daddy.

653
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,397
- It's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

654
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,783
Yes, absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

655
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,203
What are you doing?
Want to frighten them?

656
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,205
Get up. Get...

657
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,541
Don't get up.

658
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,906
Hello.

659
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,414
It's very nice to meet you, too.

660
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,796
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

661
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,674
Whoa! Hello. Hello.

662
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,385
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

663
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,346
Quite a grip you've got.

664
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,725
Thank you, yes.
Is that one of mine?

665
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,228
This is wonderful, Mr Clayton!

666
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,938
Look, look! Social grooming.

667
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:13,233
Congratulations, professor.

668
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,528
Our dream has come true.

669
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,742
Give me that!

670
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,244
What are you doing?
Now, stop that! Stop!

671
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,954
Hold on now. Leave that!

672
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,206
That is not to be played with!

673
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,389
Can you teach me?

674
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,726
- Speak gorilla?
- Yes.

675
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,668
Good heavens, what did I say?

676
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,921
That Jane stays with Tarzan.

677
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,424
Stay? But I, I thought we'd already...

678
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,885
Tarzan, I...

679
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,185
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

680
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,148
Daddy.

681
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,487
Give it to me!

682
01:01:43,658 --> 01:02:04,261
Go!

683
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,806
Wait, wait! Tarzan!

684
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,057
Go now!

685
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,436
Jane, quickly! Hurry!
Come along!

686
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,124
Kerchak, I didn't...

687
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:38,628
- I'm sorry, I...
- I asked you to protect our family.

688
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,382
And you betrayed us all.

689
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,913
I'm so confused.

690
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,042
Come with me.

691
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,462
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

692
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,043
Is this me?

693
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,300
And this is my father,

694
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,885
and...

695
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,761
and my...

696
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,348
Now you know.

697
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,769
Tarzan, I just want you to be happy,

698
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,606
whatever you decide.

699
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,991
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

700
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,207
And you will always be in my heart.

701
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,187
Goodbye, Tarzan.

702
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,692
I'm so glad you found us in time.

703
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,914
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

704
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,792
If you had pulled over
and asked for directions...

705
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,877
We didn't get to say goodbye.

706
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,006
Well, good riddance, all right?
Who needs you, huh?

707
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,133
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!

708
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:56,052
You, you ingrate!
You bald ingrate!

709
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,138
Go on and rot, for all I care!

710
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,931
Go!

711
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,977
What are you looking at?

712
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,979
I'm gonna miss him, too.

713
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:17,323
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

714
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,658
You'll see the world.

715
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,746
Everyone will want to meet you.
Kings, scientists, famous writers.

716
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,082
Yes. Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria!

717
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,460
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's nice.

718
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,170
And I'll be with Jane?

719
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,133
Yes, with Jane.

720
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,386
Slippery.

721
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,329
Get him!

722
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,692
What's going on here?

723
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,153
Clayton! Clayton, help!

724
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,782
Have we met?

725
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,997
Yes, the ape man.

726
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,464
So sorry about the rude welcome,
old boy,

727
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,591
but I couldn't have you
making a scene

728
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:02,762
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

729
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,057
Why?

730
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,893
For three hundred pounds sterling
a head.

731
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,438
Actually, I have you to thank, my boy.

732
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,567
Couldn't have done it without you.

733
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,946
Lock him up with the others.

734
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,327
That sounded like Tarzan.

735
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,746
He sounded like he was in trouble.

736
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,375
Well, why doesn't he get his new friends
to help him? I don't care.

737
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,712
That's it!

738
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,882
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

739
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,801
Tarzan needs us
and we're gonna help him!

740
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,014
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight!

741
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,308
We've got a boat to catch.

742
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,528
I've never felt so alive!

743
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,323
Good! Cos I'm gonna kill you!

744
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,617
No time for that now, missy.

745
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,056
Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

746
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:39,484
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

747
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,738
Clayton betrayed us all.
I'm so sorry, Tarzan.

748
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,449
No, I did this.

749
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:51,037
I betrayed my family.
Kerchak was right.

750
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:55,917
Those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages.

751
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,920
What is this world coming to?

752
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,470
Oh, by Jove!
Don't know my own strength.

753
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,935
What was that?

754
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,562
You are an animal!

755
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,400
That sounded just like an elephant.

756
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,734
Tantor!

757
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,487
Thanks, guys.

758
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,490
I thought I would never
see you again!

759
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,284
And here you are.

760
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,204
Sometimes you embarrass me.

761
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,608
I remember you.

762
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,862
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

763
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,594
You came back.

764
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,262
I came home.

765
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,071
Fire!

766
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,454
You! Take what you can
back to the boat.

767
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:39,914
Aye, aye, sir.

768
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,794
I've got some hunting to do.

769
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,278
Don't worry.

770
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,822
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

771
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,662
This should do the trick.

772
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,479
Hiding, are we?

773
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,939
- Good!
- Clayton, you...

774
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,401
I could use a challenge.
Because after I get rid of you,

775
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:55,615
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

776
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,101
Go ahead, shoot me.

777
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,565
Be a man.

778
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,158
Not a man like you!

779
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,235
Clayton, don't!

780
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:11,459
Kerchak, forgive me.

781
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:17,673
No, forgive me
for not understanding

782
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:22,053
that you have always
been one of us.

783
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,058
Our family will look to you now.

784
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:31,103
No, Kerchak.

785
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,938
Take care of them...

786
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,692
...my son.

787
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:47,495
Take care of them.

788
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,371
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

789
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,874
I will miss you, Jane.

790
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,961
- Miss Porter!
- I know. I'm coming.

791
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:24,633
Well... I suppose we
should say goodbye.

792
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:38,272
Goodbye.

793
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:51,327
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

794
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:54,038
I'm going to miss that boy.

795
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:07,510
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

796
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,054
Please don't.
We've been through this.

797
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,181
I couldn't possibly...

798
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:16,727
I belong in England with you,
with people...

799
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,276
But you love him.

800
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,866
Go on.

801
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,770
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

802
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,314
Thank you.

803
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:21,166
What am I doing?

804
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:24,503
Captain, tell them that you
never found us, eh?

805
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,215
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day.

806
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,550
Tootle-pip.

807
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,949
Put your faith in what you
most believe in

808
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:57,703
Two worlds, one family

809
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:01,624
Trust your heart, let fate decide

810
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,667
To guide these lives

811
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,880
To guide these lives we see

812
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,887
Two worlds, one family
