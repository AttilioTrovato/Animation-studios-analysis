1
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,797
Thundershowers are expected
in the Crocodile Falls area

2
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,383
and some of the surrounding gullies,
so take out your...

3
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,057
Cody!

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,266
Yeah, Mom?

5
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,728
-What about your breakfast?
-I've got some sandwiches in my pack.

6
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,232
-Be home for supper.
-No worries, Mom.

7
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,292
I know, I'm coming.

8
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,546
Hustle up, Nelson.
Faloo's sounding the call!

9
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,597
Come on, little wombats, hurry!

10
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,864
Who's caught this time?

11
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,073
You don't know her, Cody.

12
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,701
Her name is Marahute,
the great golden eagle.

13
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,743
Where is she?

14
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,872
She's caught, high on a cliff
in a poacher's trap.

15
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,708
-You're the only one who can reach her.
-I'll get her loose.

16
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,794
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.

17
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,984
She's up on top of that ridge.
Be careful, little friend.

18
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,679
Marahute!

19
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,152
Calm down, calm down.

20
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,904
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,032
That's a girl. Stay still.

22
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,535
It's okay.

23
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,958
No, wait! I'm here to help you.

24
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,710
Easy! Easy!

25
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,678
You're free!

26
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,613
Higher!

27
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,449
You're a mom!

28
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,874
They're very warm.
Are they gonna hatch soon?

29
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,099
Where's the daddy eagle?

30
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,190
My dad's gone, too.

31
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,148
Hey, little fella, what happened to you?

32
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,316
No! Get away!

33
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,027
-Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
-It's a trap. Careful!

34
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,001
Got one!

35
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,255
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I think so.

36
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,675
-Okey-dokey.
-Wait! Hey, come back!

37
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,316
Here you go, grab on.

38
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,403
That's great. Just a little more,
a little further...

39
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,822
There! I got it.

40
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,864
Well, Joanna, what'd we get today?

41
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:43,202
A dingo, a fat ol' razorback,
or a nice big...

42
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,536
Boy?

43
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,338
Joanna, you been diggin' holes
out here again?

44
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,841
Dumb lizard always trying
to bury squirrels out here.

45
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,012
It's a trap,
and poaching's against the law.

46
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,516
Trap? Where'd you get
an idea like that?

47
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,644
I think you've been
down in that hole for too long.

48
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,605
Come on, grab hold.

49
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,781
We'll get you out of this old lizard hole
and you can just run along home.

50
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,451
This is a poacher's trap
and you're a poacher.

51
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,499
Let go! Hey, get off of me.

52
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,002
I'm gonna kill her.

53
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,758
I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy,
egg-sucking salamander.

54
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,845
Cut it out! Get off of me.

55
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,151
Good girl, Joanna.

56
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,072
Say, where'd you get
this pretty feather, boy?

57
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,907
It was a present.

58
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,827
That's real nice. Who gave it to you?

59
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,121
It's a secret.

60
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,707
That's no secret, boy.

61
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,169
You see, I already got the father.

62
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,675
You just tell me where Momma
and those little eggs are.

63
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,427
No!

64
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,220
Joanna, sic him!

65
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,871
You're coming with me, boy.

66
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,956
My mom'll call the rangers!

67
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,084
No. Not the rangers. What'll I do?

68
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,130
What'll I do?
Don't let your mom call the rangers!

69
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,341
Please don't!

70
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,138
"My poor baby boy got eaten
by the crocodiles!"

71
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,184
Let's go, boy!

72
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,439
Help!

73
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,458
Help! Someone, help!
McLeach took a little boy.

74
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,960
Send for help!

75
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,799
Code red, code red! Attention
all Rescue Aid Society delegates.

76
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,177
All delegates report immediately
to the main assembly hall.

77
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,012
This is an emergency meeting.

78
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,349
l repeat, this is a code red
emergency meeting!

79
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,186
Order!

80
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,065
Yes, I know it's late, but I'm...
Really? Pyjamas?

81
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,693
Hello, Frank, how are you?
Nice to see you!

82
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,528
And Esmerelda, there you are!

83
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,406
Quiet now, please,
everyone pay attention.

84
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,242
There has been
a kidnapping in Australia.

85
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,161
A young boy needs our help.

86
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,623
This is a mission
requiring our very finest,

87
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,002
and l know we are all thinking
of the same two mice.

88
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,591
What's this? Gone?

89
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,721
We must find Bernard
and Miss Bianca at once!

90
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,985
Pea soup.

91
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,164
Pea soup!

92
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,725
To my dear Bernard,
and our wonderful partnership.

93
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,479
Yeah, wonderful.

94
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:33,153
You've been very quiet this evening.
Is there something on your mind?

95
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,822
Well, actually...

96
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,826
-I was wondering...
-Yes, darling?

97
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,996
I... Miss Bianca, would you...

98
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,791
Would you...

99
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,251
Would you excuse me for a minute?

100
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,898
Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle Bianca,
I have important news.

101
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,775
Yes, Francois? What is it?

102
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,486
You and Bernard
have been asked to accept

103
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,072
a dangerous mission to Australia.

104
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,451
The poor boy. This is dreadful.

105
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,329
Now where is Bernard?
I must tell him at once!

106
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,041
Allow me, madame,
I will tell him immediately.

107
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,602
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?

108
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,814
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard!
I must speak with you.

109
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,568
-Not now, Francois, I'm busy!
-No, monsieur, you don't...

110
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,200
-Bernard, did you talk to Francois?
-Yes, but there's something I want...

111
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,787
I know what you're going to say.
Francois told me about it.

112
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,038
He did? How did he...

113
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,584
It doesn't matter,
I think it's a marvellous idea.

114
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,960
You do?

115
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,129
I mean, you really want to?

116
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:18,466
I don't think it's a matter of wanting,
it's a matter of duty.

117
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,845
Duty? I never thought of it...

118
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,682
Well, all right.
How does next April sound to you?

119
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,519
Heavens, no!
We must act immediately, tonight!

120
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,480
Tonight? But wait!

121
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:37,569
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't
you at least need a gown or something?

122
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,656
No, just a pair of khaki shorts
and some hiking boots!

123
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,074
Hiking boots?

124
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,410
There you are.

125
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,746
Come along, come along.

126
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,961
Delegates, we have
an important announcement.

127
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,966
Bernard and I have decided
to accept the mission to Australia.

128
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,051
Australia?

129
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,596
Good show!
Now, you must fly out immediately!

130
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,266
It's a little nippy outside,
but we won't let that stop us, will we?

131
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,616
Miss Bianca,
I'm not sure it's a good idea

132
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,701
to fly this soon after eating!

133
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,204
Darling, you'll be just fine!

134
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,499
But aren't you supposed
to wait 45 minutes?

135
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:37,754
Just knock on the door
and see if Orville is there!

136
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,677
Nobody's home, let's go.

137
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:48,723
This is no time to play in the snow.

138
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,477
I wasn't playing in the snow.
It was an avalanche.

139
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,688
Look, Bernard!

140
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,732
"Under new management, see Wilbur."

141
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,990
Come on, darling. Let's get a move out!

142
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,754
l'm the cat's pyjamas

143
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,048
Always run around
with crazy little mamas

144
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,760
Mr Wilbur!

145
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,554
Get down there, son!

146
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,722
Hello?

147
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,600
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!

148
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,939
Here we go! Let's walk!

149
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,611
Look out! Excuse me, sir.

150
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,282
Do something! He can't hear us!

151
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,576
Big time, big time!

152
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,204
The girls all look when l go by...

153
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,415
Who killed the music?

154
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,666
That's better.

155
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,713
Excuse us for interrupting.
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.

156
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,549
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...

157
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,052
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.

158
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:11,556
My brother, Orville, told me all about
you. Boy. This is an honour to have...

159
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,976
May I just say, "Enchanté senorita, "
to you? May I?

160
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,898
We need to charter a flight.

161
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,693
You've come to the right place,
buddy boy. Welcome to...

162
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,572
"Albatross Air.
A fair fare from here to there."

163
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,493
Get it? A fair fare?
It's a play on... Never mind.

164
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,662
I've got tons of exotic
destinations, faraway places,

165
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,541
custom designed for
a romantic weekend getaway.

166
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,377
The finest in-flight accommodations.

167
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,963
Speaking of which, what can I get you?

168
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,759
How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
Very nice, very tasty.

169
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,010
No, thank you.

170
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,014
A coconut, guava nectar?
It's carbonated.

171
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,267
I got little umbrellas for each one,
and a little coconut thing.

172
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,854
-It's urgent that we leave immediately!
-Nothing? Nothing at all?

173
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,399
-How about a cream soda?
-We need a flight to Australia.

174
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,777
Australia? The land down under?

175
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,405
That's a fabulous idea!
So when can I pencil you in?

176
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,534
After spring thaw?
Mid-June would be very nice.

177
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,619
We must leave tonight.

178
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,455
Tonight?

179
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,917
Come on, you're kidding me, right?

180
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,129
Have you looked outside?
It's suicide out there.

181
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,965
No. No.

182
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,093
I'm afraid yourjolly little holiday
will have to wait.

183
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,553
What a bunch ofjokers.

184
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,390
But you don't understand,
a boy needs our help. He's in trouble.

185
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,685
Boy? You mean, a little kid kinda boy?

186
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,019
He was kidnapped.

187
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,898
Kidnapped? That's awful.

188
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,192
Locking up a little kid.

189
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,819
A kid should be free.

190
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,030
Free to run wild through the house
on Saturday mornings.

191
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,951
Free to have cookies and milk,
and get those little white moustaches.

192
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,496
Nobody's gonna take
a kid's freedom away while I'm around.

193
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,040
Does that mean you'll take us?

194
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,421
Storm or no storm,
Albatross Airlines, at your service!

195
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,924
Passengers are requested
to fasten their seat belts

196
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,426
and secure all carry-ons.

197
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,889
We'll be departing following our
pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.

198
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,726
Loosen up, get the blood flowing
up to the head.

199
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,103
And a couple of these...

200
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,064
Okay, one's enough, there we go.

201
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,028
Yeah! That feels better. Baby.

202
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,488
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!

203
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,158
Here we come!

204
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:40,205
Let's go for it! Hey!
I didn't adjust for the winds.

205
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,208
All right, we're gonna make it!
Gotta duck down lower.

206
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,836
Go under the wind, go under it!
Here we go!

207
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
This is cold!

208
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,092
Slippery! Ice!

209
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,552
We got ice!

210
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,804
Hang on now!

211
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,351
Here we go!

212
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:07,899
Cowabunga!

213
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,033
Captain, is this
a non-stop flight to Australia?

214
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,912
Well, not exactly no.
I could definitely say no.

215
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,831
We're gonna have to make
connections with a bigger bird.

216
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,126
Non-stop? What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh?

217
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,517
Let me out of here!
Let me go! You can't do this!

218
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,353
Help!

219
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,063
Breaker, breaker, little mate.

220
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:52,193
l forgot to tell you around here,
you need to be quiet!

221
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,780
Or the rangers might hear you.

222
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,617
Now sit down and relax,
enjoy the view.

223
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:05,206
Nothing but abandoned opal mines
as far as the eye can see.

224
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,253
And dead ahead, is home sweet home.

225
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,923
Home, home on the range

226
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:17,218
Where the critters
are tied up in chains

227
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,097
l cut through their sides
And l rip off their hides

228
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,058
And the next day, l do it again

229
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,226
Everybody!

230
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,396
Home, home on the range...

231
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,775
Cody! Cody!

232
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,946
Cody!

233
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,831
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12
is now approaching Sydney airport.

234
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,917
Make sure your seat belts
are fastened and tables secured.

235
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,253
Enjoy your stay in Australia.

236
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,718
-Are we there yet?
-Yes.

237
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,887
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.

238
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,389
All right, I'll get him up.

239
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,600
Wilbur.

240
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,561
Wilbur!

241
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,855
Just five more minutes, Ma.

242
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,483
-Wilbur!
-That's all I need, five more minutes.

243
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,736
Wilbur, are you awake?

244
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,238
-Get up, we're there!
-I'm up, I'm up.

245
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,740
Watch out!

246
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,619
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.

247
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,414
Oh, boy.

248
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,709
Throw another shrimp on the barbie,
'cause here I come!

249
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,880
-Here we go again!
-Cannonball!

250
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,721
Gangway! Coming through.
Mice on board!

251
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,057
Clear the way!
Move over madam, there you go!

252
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Coming through, sir. Thank you.

253
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,482
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.

254
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,402
Did we lose anyone back there?

255
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,239
Miss Bianca, from now on,
can't we just take the train?

256
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:15,169
Well, Sparky,
you've had this coming for a long time.

257
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,672
And now, you're gonna get it.

258
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,225
Wise fly.

259
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,186
Mugwomp tower,

260
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:36,858
this is Albatross 1-3
requesting permission to land. Over?

261
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,861
Albatross? Let's see.

262
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,904
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet,

263
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,948
freckled duck, galah,
kookaburra, parrot,

264
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,034
cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!

265
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,370
Negative, you'll have to turn back.

266
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,707
-Our runway isn't long enough for you.
-Not long enough?

267
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,460
Look pal,
l can land this thing on a dime!

268
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,212
Wilbur,
if the runway isn't long enough...

269
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:02,383
You can't let radarjockeys
push you around. Leave it to me.

270
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,595
I say again, mate,
our runway is too short.

271
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,223
And l say again, mate, l'm coming in!

272
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,727
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky,
we gotta extend the runway.

273
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,150
Here we go!

274
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,693
We'll never make it!

275
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,240
Hot!

276
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,659
Passengers, please remain seated

277
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,412
until the aircraft comes
to a full and complete stop.

278
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,164
Thank you.

279
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,256
Quick, Sparky,
we need to make a drag line!

280
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,313
Don't try and tell me
the runway's too short.

281
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,649
Hold this for me, will you, pal?

282
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,613
Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.

283
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,533
Captain thanks you
for flying Albatross Airlines...

284
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,076
Crazy Yanks.

285
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,329
They think they can do any fool thing
without regard for...

286
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,008
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.

287
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,303
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant,

288
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,639
don't hesitate to ask.

289
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,976
-How kind.
-Allow me to get that bag for you.

290
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,313
I've got a lot of luggage here.

291
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,232
Let me give you a hand with those.

292
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,526
Part of the friendly service
at Albatross...

293
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,945
Big time hurt!

294
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,405
Back! It's out!

295
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,491
-Are you all right?
-Don't worry, I'll handle this.

296
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,911
Sparky, watch the tower.
We gotta get this bird to the hospital.

297
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,498
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!

298
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,713
-Heave! Ho!
-What are you doing?

299
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,632
What's going on? Wait!

300
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,095
-Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
-Wilbur, don't worry.

301
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,764
We'll come back the moment
we find the boy.

302
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,018
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!

303
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.

304
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm even ready to mambo.

305
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,070
Doctor, will he be all right?

306
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:31,115
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.

307
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:35,244
They all come in with a whimper,
and leave with a grin.

308
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:39,540
Off with you now. Leave everything
to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.

309
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,252
Hop to it, ladies.
We've got a bent bird on our hands.

310
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,964
-Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
-Will it hurt, Doc?

311
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,342
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.

312
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,720
-Launch the back brace!
-Hey, wait!

313
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,766
I've been skewered!

314
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,976
I've already missed tea, Mr Albatross.

315
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:03,022
Now don't force me to take
drastic measures. You must relax.

316
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,192
Relax? I have never been
more relaxed in my life!

317
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,903
If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!

318
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,156
I'm not convinced.

319
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,741
60 milligrams!

320
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,118
60 milligrams.

321
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,411
Hey! What?

322
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,706
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!

323
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,958
I'm an American citizen, buddy!

324
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,835
-Better double it!
-Double?

325
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,213
-Double, coming up!
-No!

326
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,507
Prepare the albatross for medication.

327
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,302
I'm dreaming!
Come on, Wilbur. Wake up, boy!

328
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,929
-Three degrees right.
-Come on!

329
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,682
-Three degrees right.
-Down two degrees.

330
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,016
Don't go down two!

331
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,559
-Down two degrees.
-Ready!

332
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,687
No, I'm not ready! No, please!

333
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,771
Aim!

334
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,649
Please don't do this to me.

335
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,733
Fire!

336
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,075
Now we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

337
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,871
So are you and your husband here
on a little outback excursion?

338
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,957
No, we're not married.

339
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,379
In fact, we're here
on a top secret mission.

340
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,089
Very hush-hush.

341
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,842
Gonna rescue that kid
McLeach nabbed?

342
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,553
Why, that's right! How did you know?

343
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,140
You'll find it's tough
to keep secrets in the outback, miss.

344
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,934
So which way you taking?

345
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,521
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?

346
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,815
-"Suicide Trail"?
-Good choice.

347
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,401
More snakes, less quicksand.

348
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,613
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek,
you're scot-free, that is until...

349
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,323
Dead Dingo Pass.

350
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,828
Wait a minute, I don't see
any of that stuff on the map.

351
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,872
A map's no good in the outback!

352
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:47,752
What you really need is someone
who knows the territory.

353
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,421
Mr Jake, will you guide us?

354
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,423
At your service!

355
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,093
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.

356
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:00,264
I remember the time it was just me
and 400 of these big, giant...

357
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,350
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.

358
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,984
This is how we get around
in the outback, Miss B.

359
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,321
The only way to travel, Berno.

360
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,949
Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here.

361
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,043
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.

362
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,216
Hold it, not yet!

363
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,993
Well, boy, let's see
if we can do something

364
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,705
to refresh that
rusty, old memory of yours.

365
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,003
Is she on Satan's Ridge?

366
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,549
Or Nightmare Canyon?

367
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,925
What do you think?

368
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,471
Yeah, that's it.

369
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:27,268
Right smack dab in the middle
at Croc Falls!

370
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,939
-Am I getting warm?
-I told you, I don't remember.

371
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,277
Don't you realise
a bird that size is worth a fortune?

372
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,197
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.

373
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:43,868
You won't have any money
after the rangers get through with you.

374
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,801
Jake's been gone...

375
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,305
Been gone a long time.

376
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,639
Maybe I should go...

377
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,143
Maybe I should go look for him.

378
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,688
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.

379
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,481
Yeah, I noticed.

380
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,234
I am just sure he'll be back in no time.

381
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,872
You know,
now that we're alone, there's...

382
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,459
There's something that
I've been wanting to ask you.

383
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,502
Yes? What is it?

384
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,672
Well, it's like this.

385
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,594
Miss Bianca, I would be most honoured

386
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,096
if...

387
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,098
Look out!

388
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,230
No mice for you, Twister, not today!

389
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,357
There!

390
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,151
Miss Bianca!

391
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,779
I've been looking all over for you.

392
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,489
Now look.

393
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,326
We got a long way to go,
and you're gonna take us there.

394
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,079
You're not gonna give us
any trouble about it.

395
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,790
Right?

396
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,253
They're harmless once you look them
in the eye, let them know who's boss.

397
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,131
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.

398
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,970
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.

399
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,597
Yeah, I noticed.

400
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:34,728
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.

401
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,065
There was this one time,
it was just me and 300

402
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,693
of these ferocious,
mouse-eating dingoes.

403
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,070
Had me surrounded...

404
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,798
I'll give you a night down here
to think it over.

405
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:08,929
But tomorrow, no more Mr Nice Guy.

406
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,268
Joanna! You thick-headed
chunk of fish-bait!

407
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,480
I'll never tell you where she is!

408
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,191
Never! Never!

409
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:28,073
Yeah, we'll never tell!
You'll have to drag it out of us!

410
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,284
Hey, where did you come from?

411
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,953
The desert?

412
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,415
Well, fancy that!

413
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,002
Looks like McLeach
has begun trapping his own kind!

414
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,047
There's no hope for any of us now.

415
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,174
No hope? No hope!

416
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,218
-No!
-But there must be a way out of here.

417
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,471
There's a way out, all right.

418
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:51,930
-There is?
-There is?

419
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,557
Absolutely.

420
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:59,229
You'll go as a wallet, you'll go
as a belt, and our dear Frank...

421
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,066
-I don't want to hear it.
-Frank will go as...

422
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,984
I can't hear you!

423
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,575
-A purse.
-No!

424
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,744
A lovely ladies' purse.

425
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,622
I don't want to go as a purse.

426
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,583
Please, don't let him do it!

427
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,586
-Don't worry, we'll get out of here.
-We are?

428
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,299
Yeah. If we all put our heads together,
I'm sure we'll think of something.

429
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,468
Yeah, something.

430
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,345
Frank, what's wrong?

431
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,597
Here he goes again.

432
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,433
Take it easy.
You don't want to hurt yourself again.

433
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,061
I got it!

434
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,272
All we gotta do is get the keys!

435
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:48,070
Is that all? Well then,
we better start packing our bags.

436
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,030
No, wait. He's right.

437
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,325
If we could get
these long pieces of wood...

438
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,160
Yeah, wood, good.

439
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,704
Maybe we could...

440
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,292
That's right, just a little more. There!

441
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,837
Come on, everybody.
Get some more stuff!

442
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,048
The kid's right.
What are we waiting for?

443
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,094
That's it, you've got it!

444
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,556
Hurry. We need something
to tie it together.

445
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,645
Hey, what do you got?

446
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,021
Shoelaces!

447
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,112
Almost.

448
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,160
-A little further.
-Yeah, yeah.

449
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,705
-It's okay. Let's try again.
-Yeah, yeah.

450
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,332
Easy. Easy does it.

451
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,918
Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah.

452
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,920
Will somebody shut him up?

453
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,591
-We did it!
-You've got it!

454
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:30,714
I've got it! I'll just take my tail,
and I'll pick the lock, like this!

455
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,091
Frank, give it a rest.

456
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,010
You'll thank me when you're free.

457
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,681
Look, I just insert my tail,
like this, and I turn it like this,

458
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,810
just a quarter turn to the left,
and then push it a little bit further.

459
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,948
Show him who's boss, Berno!

460
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,277
I feel like I got my head in a vice.

461
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,288
-Are we ready, nurse?
-Ready, Doctor.

462
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,624
All right, ladies, snap to it!

463
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,086
That smarts!

464
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,715
Let me see here.

465
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,971
-Forceps!
-Forceps.

466
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,724
No, what now?

467
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:09,021
-Spinal stretch-u-lator.
-That's gonna hurt.

468
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,231
Artery router.

469
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,317
Mother!

470
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,487
This is rusted tight. I wouldn't
dream of using such a tool.

471
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,407
Bring me
the epidermal tissue disrupter!

472
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,326
The epidermal what?

473
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,703
No! No!

474
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,839
Mr Albatross, we haven't operated yet!

475
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,134
-You gotta catch me first, Doc.
-Mr Albatross, please!

476
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,969
Cowabunga!

477
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,350
Mr Albatross, we must return you
to the operating room!

478
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,226
You'll never take me alive!

479
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,021
Please don't do this!

480
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,899
Your spine needs tender...

481
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,402
...loving...care!

482
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,119
My back!

483
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,621
Hey! Hey!

484
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,915
I can... It works! I'm cured!

485
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,625
My back!

486
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,253
Don't worry! I'm coming, you little mice.

487
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,798
This is the finest fleet
on two webbed feet.

488
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,968
Oh, boy, I gotta go on a diet
when I get home.

489
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,138
Here we go!

490
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,905
In other news,
authorities in Mugwomp Flats

491
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,199
called off the search
for the missing boy.

492
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,203
His backpack was found near
Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe

493
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,289
he was yet another victim
of crocodile attack.

494
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:55,210
Authorities once again warn residents
to use extreme caution...

495
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,588
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?

496
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,800
Who outsmarted who?
Who? Who outsmarted who?

497
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,721
I still gotta get that boy to talking.

498
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,311
I'm hungry.
Can't think on an empty stomach.

499
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:17,315
Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs.

500
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,485
Everyone's got his price.

501
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,029
All I gotta do is offer him
whatever he wants,

502
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,449
and then not give it to him.

503
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,829
Did you take one of my eggs?

504
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,914
Open your mouth.

505
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,753
These are not Joanna eggs.

506
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,215
Let's see. The boy's got the eagle.

507
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,426
I want the eagle.

508
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,553
The boy won't give me the eagle.

509
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,060
If I could just find the boy's weak spot,

510
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,606
I could get him to tell me
where the eagle is.

511
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:11,077
But the boy's only got one weak spot,
and that is the eagle.

512
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,213
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill,

513
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,673
that would loosen his tongue and then...

514
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,050
I got it!

515
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,137
Got your hand caught in the cookie jar.

516
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,390
Who you think you're messing with,
you dumb animal?

517
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:37,771
My mental facilities are twice
what yours are, you pea brain.

518
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:46,530
Joanna, I give you platypus eggs,
I give you snake eggs,

519
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:51,952
why, I'll even give you eagle eggs,
but I want you to stay away from my...

520
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,998
The eagle's eggs!

521
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,625
That's it!

522
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,628
That's the boy's weak spot!

523
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,424
Push it in a little bit farther,

524
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,635
take it back a little bit...

525
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,481
I give up!

526
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,110
I'll never get this. We're doomed!

527
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,195
Doomed!

528
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,533
Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!

529
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,910
Frank, you're free!

530
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,245
Free?

531
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,833
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!

532
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,544
Joanna'll hear!

533
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,339
Double or nothing,
he's caught in five minutes.

534
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,759
-Calm down, little mate.
-Didn't I tell you?

535
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,387
Look at me, I'm free!

536
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,972
Frank, get the keys.

537
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,016
I should get the keys.

538
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,352
I'm stuck!

539
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,271
Quiet!

540
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,897
Quiet, you fool!

541
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,692
Take it easy, I'll get you loose.

542
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,402
There you go.

543
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,281
Now go get the keys.

544
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,159
The keys.
Yeah, yeah. Keys, keys, keys.

545
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,912
I can't reach them.

546
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,914
Quick, get something to stand on.

547
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,875
Stand on, something to stand on.

548
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,460
This ought to be rich.

549
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,378
Stand on...

550
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,886
Frank.

551
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,182
Use the box! Climb up on the box!

552
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,809
Of course, a box!

553
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,448
-Quiet!
-These darn things are heavy!

554
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,712
Whoops.

555
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,594
The keys, give us the keys!

556
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,432
Over here! Give us the keys!

557
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,821
Ride him, Frank!

558
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,533
Howdy, howdy!

559
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,785
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

560
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,963
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

561
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,721
No! No! No!

562
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,559
No! No! No! No!

563
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,489
Missed.

564
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,161
Surprise!

565
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,080
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you didn't like it here.

566
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,751
Let me go, let go! Let go!

567
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,172
What are you doing out of your cage?

568
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,509
That's better.

569
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,512
Come on, boy.

570
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,850
Say goodbye to your little friends.

571
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,269
It's the last you'll ever see of them.

572
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,616
There is no time to waste.

573
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,328
-We must try to get in.
-Here, Miss Bianca, start digging.

574
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,043
Has anyone considered
trying, "Open sesame"?

575
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,047
Hey, it worked!

576
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,683
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

577
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,728
Look, Bernard, it's the boy!

578
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,438
And McLeach.

579
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,944
It's all over, boy.

580
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,782
Your bird's dead. Someone shot her.

581
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,118
Shot her, right outta the sky.

582
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,956
No!

583
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,416
What do you mean, no?
You callin' me a liar?

584
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,585
I heard it on the radio.

585
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,838
And she could have been mine
if it weren't for you.

586
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,424
Now you better get,
before I change my mind.

587
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,884
Go on, get!

588
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,389
-Why is he letting him go?
-It's gotta be a trick.

589
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,434
Too bad about those eggs, Joanna.

590
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,479
They'll never survive
without their mother.

591
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,067
Well. Survival of the fittest, I guess.

592
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,198
Bingo!

593
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,248
-Bird?
-Eggs?

594
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,916
Listen.

595
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:46,180
I didn't make it all the way
through third grade for nothing.

596
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,187
Don't know where he's going,
but we can't let him get away.

597
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:57,650
-Hurry up, you two!
-Quickly, Bernard, now!

598
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:09,662
No!

599
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,716
Get between the treads!

600
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,313
Bernard, Bianca, here, catch!

601
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,692
Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it!

602
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,880
Boy, this is some head wind.

603
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:06,219
Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't
have seen two little mice

604
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,764
running around down there, would you?

605
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,224
Hey, where you going?

606
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,227
I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice!

607
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,937
Is it something I said?

608
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,213
He's going down the cliff.
Come on, we gotta warn him.

609
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,278
Cody.

610
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,449
-Who are you?
-There is no time to explain.

611
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,118
You're in great danger.

612
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,996
Marahute? It can't be!

613
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,876
Cody, wait!

614
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,256
She's alive!

615
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,343
Cody, please! You must listen!

616
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,637
That's right, McLeach is on the cliff.

617
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,563
Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back!

618
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,315
Stay away! It's a trap!

619
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,950
I got her! I got her!

620
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,160
Did you see that?

621
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,497
Perfect shot! Perfect shot!

622
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,748
She's mine!

623
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,084
All mine!

624
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,841
No!

625
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,515
Hold tight you two.
We're going for a ride!

626
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,227
-Bianca!
-Bernard!

627
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,823
Meddlin' brat.
Gonna get rid of him for good.

628
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,498
Help, I'm slipping!

629
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,084
Cody, don't move!

630
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,857
There she is, Joanna.

631
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,361
Just look at her. Look at the size of her.

632
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,406
The rarest bird in the world.

633
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,367
That bird's gonna make me rich.

634
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,453
Filthy rich.

635
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:06,334
I got what I want.
Now, what does Joanna want?

636
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:11,005
Does she wanna make sure
that bird stays rare?

637
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,888
How about some great, big,
triple-A, jumbo eagle eggs?

638
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,389
You want them?

639
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,517
You want them? Go get them!

640
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,645
No! Please!

641
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:39,784
Why, whatever is the matter?

642
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,289
Get moving!

643
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,603
Joanna!

644
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,607
You hurry up and eat those eggs
and get your tail up here!

645
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,984
Move it!

646
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,566
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.

647
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,652
Looks like the coast is clear.

648
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,739
Girls? Girls, I'm here!

649
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,951
Where are you, you little chickees, you?

650
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,620
Wilbur?

651
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,288
Wilbur!

652
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,876
Don't ever do that to me again!

653
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,463
Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one.

654
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,632
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!

655
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,301
-Help me with these eggs, will you?
-Sure.

656
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,638
Wait a minute, what the heck
are you doing up here?

657
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:09,225
The kidnapper took the boy and Jake.
Miss Bianca.

658
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,811
Miss Bianca's in trouble?

659
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:17,066
That's terrible! We gotta do something!
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.

660
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,068
Hiding under a nest
while Bianca needs help.

661
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,904
-I gotta talk to you, mister.
-Wilbur.

662
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:26,450
You should start searching the desert
for her, and I'll scan the coastline!

663
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:29,036
That's what I'll do.
Ask the chicks on the beach.

664
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,162
What?

665
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,290
Listen! There's some chicks
here that need help.

666
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,126
Really?

667
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,756
No. Wait a minute. Hold it.

668
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:44,176
I know what you're thinking,
and you're wrong. Don't even, no.

669
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,721
Don't look at me! You're getting "no."
Understand?

670
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,932
I will not ever sit on those eggs!

671
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,518
Nuts!

672
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:57,398
Gotta learn to be more assertive.
No is no is no.

673
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,733
Hey, quit moving in there!

674
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,746
Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck
has finally decided to smile on us.

675
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,416
Everything's going our way.

676
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,087
You can't do this!
You're gonna get in big trouble!

677
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,840
I'll tell the rangers where you are!

678
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,551
I almost forgot.

679
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,181
We got a loose end to tie up,
haven't we, girl?

680
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,199
Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope.

681
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,118
-Bernard is still out there.
-That's right!

682
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:54,538
If anyone can get us
out of this scrape, it's old Berno!

683
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,335
-Nice bluff, Miss B.
-I wasn't bluffing.

684
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,505
You don't know Bernard like I do.

685
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,381
He'll never give up.

686
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,491
Oh, my gosh!

687
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,237
Excuse me.

688
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,243
Look, I've got a long way to go,
you're going to take me there,

689
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,996
and you're not going
to give me any trouble, right?

690
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:21,834
Good.

691
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,337
Now, get!

692
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,610
Are you ready, boy?

693
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:51,655
It's time you learned
how to fish for crocs!

694
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:55,993
They like it when you use live bait.

695
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,746
And you're as live as they come.

696
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:08,297
You get a line
And l'll get a pole, matey

697
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,551
You get a line
l'll get a pole, friend

698
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,389
You get a line, l'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole

699
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,851
Buddy, pal of mine

700
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,356
That's right, babies. Suppertime!

701
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,826
It don't look good, Miss B.
I can't see any way out of this one.

702
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,913
Bernard, please hurry!

703
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,627
Now, this is my idea of fun.

704
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:54,551
Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't
want to disappoint the rangers.

705
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,179
They was looking so hard for you,

706
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,890
and now they're gonna find you!

707
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,606
What the blaze is going on here?

708
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,780
Joanna.

709
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:21,495
Did you know there was a razorback
in my truck? Did ya?

710
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,497
There was a razorback in my truck!

711
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:28,544
Now you quit playing around and
do yourjob, you four-legged python!

712
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,467
Hey, what happened to them keys?

713
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,011
Must be around here somewhere.

714
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,639
They couldn't just get up
and walk away.

715
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:47,896
Something weird's going on
around here. I smell a big, fat rat.

716
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,167
-Look, it's Bernard!
-I don't believe it!

717
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,837
-Way to go, mate!
-Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!

718
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:25,350
Well, there's more than one way
to skin a cat.

719
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,875
Blast!

720
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,630
Oh, my gosh!
I hope I know what I'm doing.

721
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,065
Hey, get off me!

722
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,578
Joanna! Joanna!

723
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,540
You stupid lizard! Get off me!

724
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,124
You idiot!

725
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,044
Get off of me!

726
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,590
No! No!

727
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,140
Bernard, the boy!

728
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:07,953
Help!

729
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,418
Get back!

730
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,672
Get away. Get away!

731
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,885
I whooped you! I whooped you all!

732
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:27,431
You'll think twice before messing
with Percival C. McLeach!

733
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,986
No!

734
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,496
Don't give up, Cody!

735
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:53,665
There!

736
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,376
Hop on, Miss B!

737
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,382
Help! Help!

738
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,165
It's okay.

739
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,376
Come on.

740
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,046
Thanks, little mate.

741
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:50,722
Bernard, you are magnificent.
You are absolutely the hero of the day.

742
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,226
Miss Bianca,
before anything else happens,

743
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,064
-will you marry me?
-Bernard.

744
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,650
Of course, I will!

745
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,569
Well done, mate.

746
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,740
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.

747
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,097
Help!

748
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,765
Anybody!

749
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,726
Bernard!

750
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,061
Bianca!

751
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,439
Where are you?

752
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,067
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here.
This is ridiculous.

753
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,486
You can't leave me here alone.

754
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,697
I'm gone! I am gone.

755
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:54,494
No, stay in those eggs!
That's a direct order!

756
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:01,168
Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller.
