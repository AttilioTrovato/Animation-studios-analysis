00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,372
Long ago,
in the faraway land of ancient Greece,

2
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:25,919
there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.

3
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:31,883
And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.

4
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:35,470
But what is the measure of a true hero?

5
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:38,557
- Ah, that is what our stoy is...
- Will you listen to him?

6
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,560
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.

7
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:45,230
- Lighten up, dude.
- We'll take it from here, darling.

8
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:48,567
You go, girl.

9
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:54,656
We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.

10
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,533
Heroes like Hercules.

11
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,577
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules."

12
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:00,912
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

13
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:07,961
Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.

14
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:09,725
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Ah</i>

15
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:12,841
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Back when the world was new</i>

16
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,761

18
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:24,936
<i><font color=yellow>♪ It was a nasty place</i>

19
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,939
<i><font color=yellow>♪ There was a mess

20
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:33,278
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Where chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept</i>

21
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:34,362
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!</i>

22
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:36,072
<i><font color=yellow>♪ And then along came Zeus</i>

23
00:01:36,157 --> 00:01:38,950
<i><font color=yellow>- ♪ He hurled his thunderbolt

25

28
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:54,508

29
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:55,592
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Yeah, baby.</i>

30
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,470
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Zeus tamed the globe

36
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:26,456

<i><font color=yellow>♪ Hey, yeah ♪</i>

39
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,700
Hercules!

40
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,120
Behave yourself.

41
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,458
Oh, look at this.

42
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,794
Look how cute he is.

43
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,761
Hah! Oh, he's strong like his dad, hmm?

44
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:26,057
Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming through!
Excuse me. One side, Ares.

45
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:29,728
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

46
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,272
Yeah, you know,
I had Orpheus do the arrangement.

47
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,566
Isn't that too nutty?

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,775
Fabulous party. You know,

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,821
I haven't seen this much love in a room
since Narcissus discovered himself.

50
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,160
Dear, keep those away from the baby.

51
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:47,412
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

52
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,956
Let the kid have a little fun.

53
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:00,675
On behalf of my son,

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,263
I want to thank you all
for your wonderful gifts!

55
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,015
What about our gift, dear?

56
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,268
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.

57
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:14,940
A little cirrus
and a touch of nimbostratus

58
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:18,526
and a dash of cumulus.

59
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:25,450
His name is Pegasus,

60
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,745
and he's all yours, son.

61
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:42,092
Mind his head.

62
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:44,094
He's so tiny.

63
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,142
My boy.

64
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:54,270
My little Hercules.

65
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:56,898
How sentimental.

66
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,652
You know,
I haven't been this choked up

67
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:04,239
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat! Huh?

68
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,909
So is this an audience or a mosaic?

69
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:10,453
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

70
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:15,000
So, Hades, you finally made it.
How are things in the underworld?

71
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:18,003
Well, they're just fine.
You know, a little dark, a little gloomy.

72
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,255
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

73
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:21,506
What are you gonna do? Ah!

74
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,384
There's the little sunspot.
Little snootchie.

75
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:27,554
And here is a sucker
for the little sucker, eh?

76
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:29,431
Here you go. Ya just...

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,393
Sheesh!

78
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,562
Uh, powerful little tyke.

79
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:39,357
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

80
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:40,608
Hey.

81
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:44,904
Love to, babe, but unlike you gods
lounging about up here,

82
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:47,532
I regrettably have a full-time gig

83
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:51,161
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

84
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:54,247
So, can't. Love to, but can't.

85
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:58,251
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

86
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,296
Hah! Work yourself to death!

87
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,258
Oh, I kill myself!

88
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:09,054
If only. If only.

89
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:13,308
If there's one god you don't want to
get steamed up, it's Hades.

90
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:16,102
'Cause he had an evil plan.

91
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:20,690
<i><font color=yellow>♪ He ran the underworld</i>

92
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:24,569
<i><font color=yellow>♪ But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth</i>

93
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:28,114
<i><font color=yellow>♪ He was as mean as he was ruthless</i>

94
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,160
<i><font color=yellow>♪ And that's the gospel truth</i>

95
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:36,581
<i><font color=yellow>♪ He had a plan to shake things up</i>

96
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:43,671
<i><font color=yellow>♪ And that's the gospel truth ♪</i>

97
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,348
Pain!

98
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:56,851
Coming, your most lugubriousness. Ow!

99
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,106
Panic!

100
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,025
Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!

101
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,369
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

102
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,287
- Reporting for duty!
- Reporting for duty!

103
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,372
Fine, fine, fine.

104
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,708
Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

105
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:21,918
Oh. They're here.

106
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:25,421
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

107
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:31,553
- We are worms! Worthless worms!
- We are worms! Worthless worms!

108
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:36,182
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.

109
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:43,648
Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life

110
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:46,526
good and tight.

111
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,240
Incoming!

112
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,668
Ladies! I am so sorry that I'm...

113
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:04,752
- Late!
- Late!

114
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:08,047
- We knew you would be.
- We know everything.

115
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,216
- Past.
- Present.

116
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:12,343
And Future.

117
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:15,305
Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big.

118
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,141
Great, great. Anyway, see, ladies,
I was at this party, and I lost track of...

119
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:21,519
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

120
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:25,190
So here's the deal. Zeus,

121
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:29,027
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, you,
get off of my cloud," now he has...

122
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:32,614
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

123
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:36,868
I know you know. I know.
I got it. I got the concept.

124
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:37,911
So let me just ask.

125
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:41,080
Is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

126
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:42,248
What do you think?

127
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,711
Oh, no you don't.
We're not supposed to reveal the future.

128
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:50,006
Wait. I'm sorry. Time out. Can I...

129
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,716
Can I ask you a question, by the way?
Are you...

130
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,968
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

131
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:57,639
I mean, you look like
a Fate worse than death.

132
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:02,769
- Oh, gross!
- Yech! It's blinkin'!

133
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,232
Ladies, please.

134
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:10,818
My fate is in your lovely hands.

135
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,488
- Yeah!
- Oh, all right.

136
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,787
In 18 years precisely,

137
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:26,876
the planets will align ever so nicely.

138
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:28,127
Ay, verse. Oy.

139
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:30,838
The time to act will be at hand.

140
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:35,260
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

141
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:36,719
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

142
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:42,100
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall,

143
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:48,439
and you, Hades, will rule all!

144
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:51,192
Yes! Hades rules!

145
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:54,237
A word of caution to this tale.

146
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,488
Excuse me?

147
00:09:55,572 --> 00:10:00,159
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.

148
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,125
What?

149
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,169
Okay, fine, fine. I'm cool. I'm fine.

150
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,466
Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya.

151
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,720
How do you kill a god?

152
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:22,265
- I do not know!
- You can't. They're immortal?

153
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,600
Bingo! They're immortal.

154
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:29,897
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot mortal.

155
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:01,346
- Huh?
- Wha... What is it?

156
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,264
- The baby!
- The baby!

157
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:11,230
Hercules!

158
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,318
Oh!

159
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:21,616
No!

160
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,534
Now we did it!

161
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,703
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

162
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,705
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.

163
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:32,502
Hurry!

164
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:35,004
Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

165
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,258
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

166
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:43,721
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

167
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:48,976
No, no, no, he has to drink the whole potion.
Every last drop.

168
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:50,269
Who's there?

169
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,985
Alcmene, over here.

170
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:02,281
Oh, you poor thing.

171
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,617
- Don't cry.
- Is anybody there?

172
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,452
- Now?
- Now.

173
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,082
Well, he must have been abandoned.

174
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,001
Amphitryon, for so many years

175
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:17,171
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

176
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:21,300
- Perhaps they've answered our prayers.
- Perhaps they have.

177
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,052
"Hercules"?

178
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,032
Help, help, help!

179
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:47,785
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

180
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,288
You mean, if he finds out.

181
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,623
Of course he's gonna f...

182
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,001
If. If is good.

183
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,504
It was tragic.

184
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,632
Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

185
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:05,595
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Look out!

201
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,463
Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!

202
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,882
- Hey, watch where you're goin'.
- Sunday driver!

203
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,930
Thanks, son.

204
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:34,767
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

205
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,185
No problem, Pop.

206
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,064
Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
First, I have to finagle with Phideas.

207
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,524
Okay.

208
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:44,902
Oops. Sorry, Penelope.

209
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:48,239
Now, Hercules, this time, please just...

210
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,616
I know. I know.

211
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,577
Stay by the cart.

212
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,204
That's my boy.

213
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,793
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

214
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:02,628
Careful!

215
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,173
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

216
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:08,551
Why, Hercules!

217
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:09,719
I-I-It's you!

218
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:12,930
- Let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

219
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,683
I'm fine. You just run along.

220
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,351
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

221
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,020
Absolutely.

222
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,526
Yo! Give it here!

223
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,612
Hey, you need an extra guy?

224
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,824
Uh, sorry, Herc.

225
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:35,661
Uh, we already got five,
and we want to keep it an even number.

226
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,538
Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an even...

227
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,498
- See ya, Herc.
- What a geek!

228
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,669
- Destructo Boy.
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."

229
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,136
- Yeah!
- Heads up!

230
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,387
I-I got it!

231
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:54,930
No! Stop!

232
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,979
Uh-oh.

233
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,728
Oh, no.

234
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,731
It's okay.

235
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,989
Hey! Whoa!

236
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,165
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

237
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,793
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't! No, no, no, no!

238
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:26,253
No, no, no, no, no, no!

239
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,178
Watch out!

240
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,779
Nice catch, Jerkules.

241
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,365
Son...

242
00:16:55,617 --> 00:17:00,204
This is the last straw, Amphitryon!

243
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,415
That boy is a menace!

244
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,292
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

245
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,338
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

246
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:13,259
He-He just can't control his strength.

247
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:15,219
I'm warning you.

248
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:19,473
You keep that-that-that...
freak away from here!

249
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,184
Freak! Yeah, go away!

250
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:39,702
Ah, son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to you.

251
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:44,915
But, Pop, they're right. I-I am a freak.
I-I try to fit in. I really do.

252
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,501
I just can't.

253
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,425
Sometimes I feel like
I really don't belong here,

254
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,346
like I'm supposed to be someplace else.

255
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,349
Hercules, son...

256
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,393

there's something your mother and I
have been meaning to tell ya.

271
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:20,594
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

272
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,638
Why was I left here?

273
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,102
This was around your neck
when we found you.

274
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:32,022
It's the symbol of the gods.

00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:06,367

295
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:23,384
My little Hercules.

296
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:29,098
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, kiddo!

What's your hurry?

00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:34,353
After all these years, is this the kind of
hello you give your father?

00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,939
F-F-Father?

300
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:40,025
Didn't know you had a famous father,
did you?

301
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,736
Surprise!

302
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:45,197
Look how you've grown.

303
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:50,619
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes and my strong chin.

304
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,205
- Hah!
- I-I don't understand.

305
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:57,334
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

306
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,587
- A god.
- A god.

307
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:01,714
A god!

308
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,382
Hey, you wanted answers,

309
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:06,969
and by thunder, you're old enough
now to know the truth.

310
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:10,639
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

311
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,307
Of course we did.

312
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:15,352
Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

313
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:19,106
Someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal,

314
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,192
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

315
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,194
And you can't do a thing?

316
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,321
I can't, Hercules, but you can.

317
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:29,491
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

318
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:32,870
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth,

319
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:34,955
your godhood will be restored!

320
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,458
A true hero. Great!

321
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:41,587
Uh, exactly how do you
become a true hero?

322
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:46,175
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

323
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,053
Seek out Philoctetes. Right. I'll...

324
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:51,346
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

325
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,307
Which reminds me.

326
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:05,486
Ha-ha! You probably don't remember Pegasus,
but you two go way back, son.

327
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, Pegasus!

328
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:20,584
He's a magnificent horse
with the brain of a bird.

329
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:25,422
I'll find Philoctetes
and become a true hero.

330
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:26,840
That's the spirit!

331
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:28,467
I won't let you down, Father!

332
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,067
Yee-hah!

333
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:33,472

00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:33,071
Whoa!

343
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,535
You sure this is the right place?

344
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,458
What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

345
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:53,926
- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
- Ugh!

346
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:57,431
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back, come back, come back.

347
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,806
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!

348
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:03,000
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!

349
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,982
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

350
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:13,147
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

351
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:16,033
Uh, no. Can you help us?

352
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:19,786
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

353
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,164
Call me Phil.

354
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,624
- Phil!
- Ow!

355
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,376
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.

356
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:28,962
And this is Pegasus.

357
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,507
Animals! Disgusting!

358
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,218
I need your help.

359
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,386
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

360
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,266
- Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.
- Wait!

361
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,352
- Whoo!
- Uh, sorry.

362
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:48,065
- Why not?
- Two words, I am retired.

363
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:51,068
Look, I gotta do this.

364
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,861
Haven't you ever had a dream,

365
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:55,656
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

366
00:25:58,493 --> 00:26:01,828
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you something.

367
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:13,215
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

368
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,050
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:17,344
Who do you think
taught Jason how to sail?

370
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:18,720
Cleopatra?

371
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,265
I trained all those would-be heroes.

372
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:26,186
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus."

373
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:30,607
And every single one of those bums
let me down flatter than a discus.

374
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:33,193
None of 'em could go the distance.

375
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,697
And then there was Achilles.

376
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:40,909
Now, there was a guy who had it all,
the build, the foot speed.

377
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:45,414
He could jab, he could take a hit,
he could keep on comin'.

378
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:48,166
But that furshlugginer heel of his!

379
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:51,169
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom!

380
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:53,213
He's history.

381
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,009
Yeah, I had a dream once.

382
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,595
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

383
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:06,977
So great, the gods would hang a picture
of him in the stars all across the sky,

384
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:10,314
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy."

385
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,316
That's right.

386
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,192
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

387
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:16,445
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

388
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:18,822
But I'm different than
those other guys, Phil!

389
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:22,242
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show you.

390
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:24,995
Geez! You don't give up, do ya?

391
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,413
Watch this.

392
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:32,836
Holy Hera.

393
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,340
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

394
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:38,550
I'm too old
to get mixed up in this stuff again.

395
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:42,971
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll
never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.

396
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:44,473
Hold it!

397
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,601
Zeus is your father, right?

398
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,105
Zeus. The big guy. He's your daddy.

399
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,982
Mr Lightning Bolts!

400
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,151
Read me a book, would ya, Da-da?

401
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:59,279
Zeus! "Once upon a time..."

402
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:00,530
It's the truth!

403
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,157
Please!

404
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,287

- You mean you'll do it?
- You win.

415
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,736
- You won't be sorry, Phil.
- Oh, gods.

416
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:41,530
So when do we start?
Can we start now?

417
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,756

434
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:42,299
Rule number six.

435
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:46,761
When rescuing a damsel,
always handle with care.

436
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:50,474
No!

437
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:54,728
Rule number 95, kid. Concentrate!

438
00:29:56,814 --> 00:29:58,648
Rule number 96.

439
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,484
Aim!

440
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:06,156
<i><font color=yellow>♪ Demigods have faced the odds

457
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,837
Yeah!

458
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:04,837
Ha, ha, ha!

459
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,342
Did you see that?

460
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,136
Next stop, Olympus.

461
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:12,847
All right, just take it easy, champ.

462
00:31:12,932 --> 00:31:15,183
I am ready. I want to get off this island.

463
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,686
I want to see battles and monsters.

464
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,604
Rescue some damsels.

465
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,773
You know, heroic stuff.

466
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:25,402
- Well...
- Aw, come on, Phil!

467
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:28,905
Well, okay. Okay, you want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.

468
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,324
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

469
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:35,245
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

470
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:38,873
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

471
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,255
Sounds like your basic DID,
Damsel in Distress.

472
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,681
Not so fast, sweetheart.

473
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,267
I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I'll...

474
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,312
Whoo! I like 'em fiey!

475
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,147
Now, remember, kid.

476
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,149
First, analyse the situation.

477
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,484
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

478
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,989
He's losin' points for this!

479
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,033
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

480
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:18,830
Step aside, two legs.

481
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:22,751
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

482
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,586
I'll have to ask you to
release that young...

483
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,631
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

484
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:31,217
But you... Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

485
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:34,387
I'm a damsel, I'm in distress.

486
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:37,274
I can handle this. Have a nice day.

487
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:43,045
Uh... Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be
too close to the situation to realise...

488
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:49,152
- Ohhh! What are you doin'? Get your sword!
- Sword. Right, right.

489
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:52,405
Rule number 15,
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

490
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:03,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

491
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,836
Come on, kid! Concentrate!

492
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,588
Use your head!

493
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:19,057
All right! Not bad, kid!

494
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:22,227
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

495
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:28,900
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry. That was dumb.

496
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,027
Yeah.

497
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:33,613
Excuse me.

498
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:42,372
Nice work! Excelente!

499
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:44,541
Is Wonderboy here for real?

500
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:48,411
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

501
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:54,300
And by the way, sweet cheeks,
I'm real, too.

502
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,737
Ugh!

503
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,983
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

504
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,979
Whoa!

505
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,633
- How was that, Phil?
- Rein it in, rookie.

506
00:34:35,718 --> 00:34:38,553
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons,

507
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,264
but this is the big leagues!

508
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:43,266
At least I beat him, didn't I?

509
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:47,145
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

510
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:52,484
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
You gotta stay focused, and... You...

511
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:05,121
Are you, uh, all right. Miss, uh...

512
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:09,083
Megara. My friends call me Meg.
At least, they would if I had any friends.

513
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:13,880
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

514
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:17,708
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...

515
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:20,512
- Uh, uh...
- Are you always this articulate?

516
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:23,640
Hercules. My... My name is Hercules.

517
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,185
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

518
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,273
So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...

519
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,818
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

520
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:38,655
They think that "No" means "Yes," and
"Get lost" means "Take me, I'm yours."

521
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:44,118
Don't worry.
Shorty here can explain it to ya later.

522
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:49,749
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
It's been a real slice.

523
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:53,628
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

524
00:35:57,424 --> 00:36:00,301
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

525
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:05,348
Pegasus? Oh, no. Don't be silly.
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!

526
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:13,231
I'll be all right. I'm a big, tough girl.
I tie my own sandals and everything.

527
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:16,860
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

528
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,778
Bye.

529
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:23,324
She's something. Isn't she, Phil?

530
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,119
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really something.

531
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:27,662
A real pain in the patella!

532
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:30,957
Earth to Herc!
Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc!

533
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,877
We got a job to do, remember?

534
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,712
Thebes is still waitin'.

535
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,673
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

536
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,603
Aw, how cute.

537
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,314
A couple of rodents
looking for a theme park.

538
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:57,859
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
I'm a bunny!

539
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:59,360
A-And I'm his gopher!

540
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,117
Ta-dah!

541
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,031
I thought I smelled a rat.

542
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:04,824
Meg?

543
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:06,743
Speak of the devil.

544
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:10,914
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut, Meg.

545
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,957
What exactly happened here?

546
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,043
I thought you were gonna
persuade the river guardian

547
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,711
to join my team for the uprising,

548
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:19,589
and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

549
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,718
I gave it my best shot,
but he made me an offer I had to refuse.

550
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:26,429
Fine. So, instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence,

551
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,264
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

552
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,432
Give that your best shot.

553
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:32,560
It wasn't my fault.
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

554
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:37,190
Hercules?
Why does that name ring a bell?

555
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:40,109
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

556
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:44,781
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

557
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,950
He comes on with
this big, innocent farm boy routine,

558
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:48,743
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

559
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:49,786
Wait a minute.

560
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,081
Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

561
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:55,208
- Oh, my gods!
- Oh, my gods!

562
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,668
Run for it!

563
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,963
So you took care of him, huh?

564
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,048
Dead as a door nail.

565
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:04,968
Weren't those your exact words?

566
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:06,928
This might be a different Hercules.

567
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:10,682
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

568
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:14,143
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason,

569
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:15,937
and the girls were all named Brittany?

570
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:20,566
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos,

571
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:27,615
and the one schlemiel who can louse
it up is waltzing around in the woods!

572
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,663
Wait. Wait, big guy.

573
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:36,124
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right!

574
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:39,377
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

575
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,087
Didn't we?

576
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,590
Hmm. Fortunately for the three of you,

577
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:48,511
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

578
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:52,056
And this time, no foul-ups. Wow!

579
00:38:57,896 --> 00:39:01,357
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

580
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:05,695
The one and only Thebes.
The Big Olive itself.

581
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:08,990
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

582
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,376
Stick with me, kid.
This city is a dangerous place.

583
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:24,464
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

584
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:27,133
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you, wackos.

585
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:30,553
Pitta bread. Pitta bread.
Get your pitta bread here.

586
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:33,521
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

587
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,642
- You wanna buy a sundial?
- He's not interested, all right?

588
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:37,769
Come on, kid.

589
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:40,980
The end is coming! Can't you feel it?

590
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:45,318
Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes.
We'll ponder that for a while.

591
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:46,694
Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on.

592
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,238
Don't make eye contact.
People here are nuts.

593
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,491
That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

594
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:52,617
Trust me, kid.

595
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,994
You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

596
00:39:55,996 --> 00:40:00,291
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

597
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,669
Everything except old Snowball here.

598
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:07,507
Now, were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

599
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,759
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

600
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:11,260
But before the flood.

601
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:14,764
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

602
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,434
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

603
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,103
Tell me about it.

604
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,230
It seems like every time I turn around,

605
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:24,607
there's some new monster
wreaking havoc and I...

606
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:28,277
All we need now is a plague of locusts.

607
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:33,282
That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta!

608
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,617
Excuse me.

609
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:41,374
It, uh... seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

610
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,669
Yeah, and who are you?

611
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:51,384
I'm Hercules, and, uh...
I happen to be a hero.

612
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,096
- Is that so?
- A hero!

613
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,725
- Have you ever saved a town before?
- Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...

614
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,311
Have you ever
reversed a natural disaster?

615
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,814
Well, uh, no.

616
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:08,025
Oh, listen to this.
He's just another chariot chaser.

617
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,278
- This we need.
- That's a laugh.

618
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:12,697
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

619
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:15,074
This kid is the genuine article.

620
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:19,162
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

621
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:20,913
Watch it, pal.

622
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:23,249
Yeah, you're right.

623
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,835
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

624
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:28,504
Ya missed a spot!

625
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,590
You... I got your heel right here!

626
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:32,800
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

627
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:36,179
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! Take it easy. Phil.

628
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,139
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

629
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:44,312
Young man, we need
a professional hero, not an amateur.

630
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,857
Well, wait. Stop!

631
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:57,033
How am I supposed to prove myself
a hero if nobody will give me a chance?

632
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,242
You'll get your chance.

633
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:01,996
You just need some kind of
catastrophe or disaster.

634
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,164
Please.

635
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:06,459
Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

636
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:08,711
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

637
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:12,423
Wonderboy! Hercules!
Thank goodness!

638
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:13,966
Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

639
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:17,386
Oh! Outside of town, two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

640
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,139
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

641
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:22,975
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

642
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,644
Phil, this is great!

643
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,520
You're really choked up about this,
aren't ya?

644
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:27,563
Come on!

645
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:32,401
No, I... You don't under...
I, I have this terrible fear of heights!

646
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:40,034
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

647
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:42,036
I'm way behind ya, kid.

648
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,497
I got a fur wedgie.

649
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:53,214
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

650
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:55,508
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

651
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:58,636
- Help! I can't breathe!
- Hurry!

652
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,180
- Get us out!
- We're suffocating!

653
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:05,559
Somebody call IX-I-I!

654
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,270
Easy, fellas. You'll be all right.

655
00:43:07,354 --> 00:43:11,857
- We can't last much longer!
- Get us out before we get crushed!

656
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,920
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

657
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:36,632
Jeepers, mister. You're really strong.

658
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:40,219
Well, try to be a little more careful
next time, okay, kids?

659
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:41,971
We sure will.

660
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:49,395
A stirring performance, boys.

661
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:51,314
I was really moved.

662
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,900
"Jeepers, mister"?

663
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:58,195
I was going for innocence.

664
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,491
And, hey, two thumbs
way, way up for our leading lady.

665
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:04,285
What a dish. What a doll.

666
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:07,079
Get outta there, you big lug,
while you still can.

667
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,790
Phil, I-I did great.

668
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:12,001
They even applauded, sort of.

669
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,715
Huh! I hate to burst your bubble, kid,
but that ain't applause.

670
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:27,975
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

671
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,268
Two words.

672
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,438
Am-scray!

673
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:39,695
Let's get ready to rumble!

674
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:48,537
That's it. Dance around! Dance around!

675
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:51,749
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

676
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:55,294
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left! Your other left!

677
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,601
Whoa! All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

678
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:56,355
See, Phil? That... That wasn't so hard.

679
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,149
Kid, kid, kid.

680
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,733
How many horns do ya see?

681
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:01,569
Six?

682
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:04,530
Eh, close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.

683
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:11,620
Guys, guys, relax.

684
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:13,581
It's only half-time.

685
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,669
That doesn't sound good.

686
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,928
Definitely not good!

687
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,668
Will you forget the head-slicing thing?

688
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,846
I don't think we covered
this one in basic training!

689
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:24,777
My favourite part of the game,

690
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:29,782
sudden death.

691
00:47:52,722 --> 00:47:56,600
Oh. There goes another one.
Just like Achilles.

692
00:47:59,187 --> 00:48:01,063
Game.

693
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:02,982
Set.

694
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,441
Match.

695
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:33,304
Phil, you gotta admit.
That was pretty heroic.

696
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:37,933
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
You won by a landslide!

697
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:42,646
Hades mad.

698
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:48,152
Well, what do ya know?

699
00:48:52,198 --> 00:48:56,160
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

700
00:48:56,244 --> 00:48:59,663
He was so hot, steam looked cool.

701

Pull!

753
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:23,307
Nice shootin', Rex.

754
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,933
I can't believe this guy.

755
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:28,604
I throw everything I've got at him
and it doesn't even...

756
00:51:29,355 --> 00:51:32,858
What are those?

757
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:37,070
Oh, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

758
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:40,908
I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo,

759
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:46,622
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke,

760
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,377
and you are wearing his merchandise!

761
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:00,427
Thirsty?

762
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:13,065
Looks like your game's over.

763
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:15,901
Wonderboy is hitting
every curve you throw at him.

764
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,695
Oh, yeah.

765
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:22,366
I wonder if maybe

766
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:28,747
I haven't been throwing
the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet.

767
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:30,999
Don't even go there.

768
00:52:31,084 --> 00:52:35,629
See, he's gotta have a weakness
because everybody's got a weakness.

769
00:52:35,713 --> 00:52:38,173
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

770
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:40,926
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

771
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,887
We simply need to
find out Wonderboy's.

772
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:46,139
I've done my part. Get your little imps...

773
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:47,391
They couldn't handle him as a baby.

774
00:52:47,475 --> 00:52:50,853
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

775
00:52:50,937 --> 00:52:52,938
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

776
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:57,025
Well, you know, that's good because that's what
got you into this jam in the first place, isn't it?

777
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,529
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

778
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:03,198
And how does this creep thank you?

779
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:06,368
By running off with some babe.

780
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:08,537
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

781
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:10,581
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

782
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:15,210
Which is exactly why I got a feelin'
you're gonna leap at my new offer.

783
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:18,338
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath,

784
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:24,428
and I give you the thing that
you crave most in the entire cosmos,

785
00:53:24,888 --> 00:53:26,805
your freedom.

786
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:30,961
Ha!

787
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:32,561
You should have been there, Father.

788
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:37,900
I mangled the Minotaur,
grappled with the Gorgon.

789
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,234
Just like Phil told me.

790
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:43,155
I analysed the situation,
controlled my strength and kicked.

791
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,492
The crowds went wild!

792
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:51,246
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:56,585
Hah! You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

794
00:53:56,669 --> 00:53:58,879
I'm glad to hear you say that, Father.

795
00:53:58,963 --> 00:54:01,340
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

796
00:54:01,383 --> 00:54:03,592
Hmm. What day is that, son?

797
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:06,720
The day I rejoin the gods.

798
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:10,724
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

799
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:12,643
You're just not there yet.

800
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:16,772
You haven't proven yourself a true hero.

801
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:20,275
But, Father, I've beaten every single
monster I've come up against.

802
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,612
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

803
00:54:23,696 --> 00:54:27,574
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

804
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:33,288
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same as being a true hero.

805
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,123
What more can I do?

806
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:38,710
It's something
you have to discover for yourself.

807
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:43,048
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

808
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,468
Father, wait!

809
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:04,695
On your left is Hercules' villa.

810
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:07,114
Our next stop is
the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop

811
00:55:07,198 --> 00:55:08,198
where you can pick up

812
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:12,244
the great hero's 30-minute
workout scroll Buns of Bronze.

813
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:14,663
At 1:00,
you got a meeting with King Augeas.

814
00:55:14,747 --> 00:55:16,498
He's got a problem with his stables.

815
00:55:16,582 --> 00:55:18,333
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

816
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:20,752
- Phil?
- I told you, don't move!

817
00:55:20,837 --> 00:55:22,462
DGR, the Daughters of
the Greek Revolution.

818
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:23,588
- Phil.
- At 3:00,

819
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:25,674
you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.

820
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:28,802
Phil, what's the point?

821
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,222
That's it!

822
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:34,266
Keep your toga on, pal.

823
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:39,646
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

824
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:41,481
You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya?

825
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:45,652
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

826
00:55:45,737 --> 00:55:48,321
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

827
00:55:48,406 --> 00:55:50,699
I gave this everything I had.

828
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:55,871
Listen to me, kid. I seen 'em all.

829
00:55:55,955 --> 00:56:00,167
And I am tellin' you,
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth,

830
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:03,253
- you got somethin' I never seen before.
- Really?

831
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:07,007
I can feel it right down
to these stubby bowlegs of mine.

832
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,968
There is nothin' you can't do, kid.

833
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:12,637
It's him!

834
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:14,639
Hey, watch it! Watch it! Watch...

835
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:18,477
- I touched his elbow! Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

836
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:20,812
Phil, help!

837
00:56:20,897 --> 00:56:23,398
- Okay. Escape plan, beta.
- Gotcha.

838
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:25,901
Hey. Where is he?

839
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:28,320
There he goes! On the veranda!

840
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:45,879
Whoa! Let's see.

841
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:48,423
What could be behind
curtain number one?

842
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:49,758
Meg!

843
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:52,969
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

844
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:56,098
Gee, i-i-it's great to see you.

845
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:57,808
I-I-I missed you.

846
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,352
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

847
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:02,687
Nah. I'm no hero.

848
00:57:02,772 --> 00:57:05,107
Sure ya are. Everybody in Greece

849
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:07,692
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pitta.

850
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:10,445
I know, it's... it's crazy.

851
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,280
You know, I can't go anywhere
without being mobbed.

852
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:14,616
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

853
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,828
Think your nanny goat
would go berserk

854
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:19,621
if you played hooky this afternoon?

855
00:57:19,705 --> 00:57:21,206
Oh, gee, I-I don't know.

856
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,958
Uh, Phil's got the rest of the day
pretty much booked.

857
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:26,002
Ah, Phil, schmill. Just follow me.

858
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:30,382
Out the window, round the dumbbells,
you lift up the back wall and we're gone.

859
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,973
Wow. What a day.

860
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:43,520
First, that restaurant by the bay,
and then that play, that Oedipus thing.

861
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:46,148
Man! I thought I had problems.

862
00:57:50,236 --> 00:57:53,780
- Stop foolin' around!
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

863
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:57,367
I didn't know that
playing hooky could be so much fun.

864
00:57:57,451 --> 00:58:01,204
- Yeah. Neither did I.
- Thanks, Meg.

865
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:05,250
Oh. Don't thank me just yet.

866
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:08,295
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

867
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:10,463
Sorry. Weak ankles.

868
00:58:10,548 --> 00:58:13,967
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

869
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:20,473
So, uh, do you have any problems
with things like this?

870
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:24,144
- Uh...
- Weak ankles, I mean.

871
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:27,063
Oh, uh, no, not really.

872
00:58:27,148 --> 00:58:30,984
No weaknesses whatsoever?

873
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:33,153
- No trick knee?
- Uh...

874
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:36,489
Ruptured disks?

875
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:42,621
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle..

876
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:46,124
Wonderboy, you are perfect.

877
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:47,960
Thanks.

878
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:50,483
Whoops!

879
00:58:53,216 --> 00:58:55,383
It looks better that way.

880
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:57,802
No, it really does.

881
00:59:04,602 --> 00:59:06,895
You know, when I was a kid,

882
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:11,066
I, I would have given anything
to be exactly like everybody else.

883
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,777
You wanted to be petty and dishonest?

884
00:59:13,861 --> 00:59:15,028
Everybody's not like that.

885
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:17,739
Yes, they are.

886
00:59:17,823 --> 00:59:19,616
You're not like that.

887
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,368
How do you know what I'm like?

888
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:28,458
All I know is you're the most amazing
person with weak ankles I've ever met.

889
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:33,410
Oh!

890
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:39,511
Meg, when I'm with you,
I-I don't feel so alone.

891
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:43,265
Sometimes it's better to be alone.

892
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:44,599
What do you mean?

893
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:46,768
Nobody can hurt you.

894
00:59:50,439 --> 00:59:51,731
Meg?

895
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,735
I would never, ever hurt you.

896
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:02,033
And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both
do ourselves a favour and stop this

897
01:00:03,494 --> 01:00:05,745
before we...

898
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:10,041
All right! Break it up! Break it up!
Party's over!

899
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:12,961
- I been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

900
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,337
It was all my fault.

901
01:00:14,422 --> 01:00:17,257
You're already on my list, sister,
so don't make it worse!

902
01:00:20,261 --> 01:00:22,971
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium

903
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:25,015
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

904
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,393
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

905
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:32,355
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

906
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:41,156
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

907
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:51,124
Hey, watch it, watch it! Watch it!
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

908
01:00:53,919 --> 01:00:57,505
That's it. Next time, I drive.

909
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:08,224
Oh, what's the matter with me?

910
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:11,144

Hey, what's the buzz, Meg?

946
01:03:33,037 --> 01:03:36,456
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

947
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,833
Get yourself another girl.
I'm through.

948
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:40,710
I'm sorry. Do you mind
runnin' that by me again?

949
01:03:40,794 --> 01:03:43,463
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

950
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:47,675
Then read my lips! Forget it.

951
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,263
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet, deluded little minion.

952
01:03:52,348 --> 01:03:57,143
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

953
01:03:57,228 --> 01:03:59,187
I own you!

954
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,900
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

955
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:06,361
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

956
01:04:06,445 --> 01:04:09,697
If I say, "Sing," you say,
"Hey, name that tune."

957
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:14,285
If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head
on a platter," you say...

958
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:16,454
Medium or well-done.

959
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:21,042
I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

960
01:04:21,126 --> 01:04:24,212
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

961
01:04:24,296 --> 01:04:29,133
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

962
01:04:29,218 --> 01:04:32,345
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

963
01:04:33,138 --> 01:04:37,141
I can't believe you're
getting so worked up about some guy.

964
01:04:37,226 --> 01:04:39,477
This one is different.
He's honest, and he's sweet...

965
01:04:39,562 --> 01:04:40,562
Please!

966
01:04:40,646 --> 01:04:42,397
- He would never do anything to hurt me.
- He's a guy!

967
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:46,693
Besides, O oneness,
you can't beat him.

968
01:04:46,777 --> 01:04:50,572
He has no weaknesses. He's gonna...

969
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:54,742
I think he does, Meg.

970
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:58,162
I truly think he does.

971
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,646
Hey, Phil! What happened to you?

972
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:25,148
Kid, we gotta talk.

973
01:05:25,232 --> 01:05:28,901
Oh, Phil I just had
the greatest day of my life!

974
01:05:28,986 --> 01:05:31,321
I, I, I can't stop thinking about Meg.

975
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:33,781
She's something else.

976
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:37,118
Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya!
Will you come down here and listen?

977
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:42,040
How can I come down there
when I'm feeling so up?

978
01:06:07,316 --> 01:06:08,816
Gotcha!

979
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:11,235
Ah, very nice!
What I'm tryin' to say is...

980
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,863
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.

981
01:06:13,947 --> 01:06:15,782
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

982
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:17,617
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

983
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:20,328
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

984
01:06:20,412 --> 01:06:23,498
- Phil, I got two words for ya, duck!
- Listen to me! She's...

985
01:06:23,582 --> 01:06:24,999
- A dream come true?
- Not exactly.

986
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:27,210
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

987
01:06:27,294 --> 01:06:31,506
- The most wonderful...
- She's a... She's a fraud!

988
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,175
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

989
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:37,303
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

990
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:39,097
- She...
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

991
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:40,223
Kid, you're missin' the point.

992
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:42,725
- The point is, I love her.
- She don't love you.

993
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,019
- You're crazy.
- She's nothin' but a two-timin'...

994
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:47,188
- Stop it!
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...

995
01:06:47,272 --> 01:06:48,606
Shut up!

996
01:06:51,944 --> 01:06:53,778
Phil. I...

997
01:06:54,822 --> 01:06:55,863
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

998
01:06:55,948 --> 01:06:59,867
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

999
01:06:59,952 --> 01:07:02,453
Phil, wait. Where you going?

1000
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:06,040
I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.

1001
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:08,876
Fine! G...

1002
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:11,963
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1003
01:07:14,341 --> 01:07:17,593
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ,

1004
01:07:17,678 --> 01:07:20,179
not the all-time chump.

1005
01:07:23,058 --> 01:07:25,810
Geez Louise! What got his goat, huh?

1006
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,773
Name is Hades, Lord of the Dead.

1007
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:32,900
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

1008
01:07:32,985 --> 01:07:35,653
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1009
01:07:35,738 --> 01:07:38,573
See, I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1010
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:40,742
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1011
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:43,077
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

1012
01:07:43,162 --> 01:07:44,370
You've got the wrong guy.

1013
01:07:44,455 --> 01:07:47,957
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?

1014
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,084
So I would be eternally grateful

1015
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:53,254
if you would just take a day off
from this hero business of yours.

1016
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:56,466
Jeez, I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?

1017
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,760
- You're out of your mind.
- Not so fast, because, ya see,

1018
01:07:58,844 --> 01:08:02,221
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1019
01:08:03,015 --> 01:08:05,057
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1020
01:08:07,603 --> 01:08:09,604
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1021
01:08:09,688 --> 01:08:12,774
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1022
01:08:12,858 --> 01:08:14,859
Say the next 24 hours.

1023
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:16,986
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1024
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:19,238
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1025
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:20,740
What do ya say? Come on.

1026
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:23,868
People are gonna get hurt, aren't they?

1027
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:27,497
Nah! I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.

1028
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:30,166
But what can I tell ya? Anyway,
what do you owe these people, huh?

1029
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:33,085
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face you,
isn't she more important than they are?

1030
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,213
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1031
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:37,965
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1032
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,967
Fine, okay. I'll give you that one.

1033
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:42,720
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

1034
01:08:42,805 --> 01:08:46,390
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?

1035
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:48,810
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.

1036
01:08:48,894 --> 01:08:50,686
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1037
01:08:50,771 --> 01:08:53,898
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

1038
01:08:53,982 --> 01:08:56,400
- All right!
- Yes, we're there! Bam!

1039
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,745
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kinda natural.

1040
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,747
Maybe you should sit down!

1041
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:16,045
Now you know how it feels
to be just like everybody else.

1042
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:19,090
Isn't it just peachy?

1043
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:22,093
Oh! You'll love this. One more thing.

1044
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:26,722
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
You're off the hook.

1045
01:09:27,474 --> 01:09:30,601
And by the way, Herc,
is she not a fabulous little actress?

1046
01:09:30,686 --> 01:09:32,186
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1047
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:36,524
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1048
01:09:37,526 --> 01:09:39,610
- Duh.
- You're... You're lying!

1049
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:45,366
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1050
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,035
Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.

1051
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,453
No! It's... It's not like that.

1052
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:52,415
I didn't mean to... I-I couldn't... I...

1053
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:54,667
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:59,088
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!

1055
01:10:00,215 --> 01:10:02,049
Well, gotta blaze.

1056
01:10:02,134 --> 01:10:06,679
There's a whole cosmos up there
waiting for me with, hey, my name on it.

1057
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:12,727
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1058
01:10:25,782 --> 01:10:29,076
Brothers! Titans!

1059
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:32,413
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1060
01:10:32,497 --> 01:10:35,583
Who put you down there?

1061
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,793
Zeus!

1062
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:44,342
And now that I set you free, what is
the first thing you are going to do?

1063
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:48,054
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1064
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,435
Crush Zeus!

1065
01:10:57,147 --> 01:11:00,358
Freeze him!

1066
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,239
Melt Zeus!

1067
01:11:08,325 --> 01:11:13,204
Blow him away!

1068
01:11:15,707 --> 01:11:17,875
Zeus!

1069
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,796
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1070
01:11:22,255 --> 01:11:24,173
Olympus would be that way.

1071
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,386
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1072
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:31,097
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

1073
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:34,225
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1074
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:44,928
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

1075
01:11:45,696 --> 01:11:48,906
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

1076
01:11:49,491 --> 01:11:51,909
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped,

1077
01:11:51,994 --> 01:11:53,995
and they're practically at our gates!

1078
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,165
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1079
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,793
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1080
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:07,102
Huh?

1081
01:12:10,137 --> 01:12:11,637
Charge!

1082
01:12:12,514 --> 01:12:14,640
On to battle!

1083
01:12:25,944 --> 01:12:27,987
You windbag!

1084
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:31,434
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

1085
01:12:31,857 --> 01:12:32,727
Ha!

1086
01:12:35,954 --> 01:12:39,457
Hercules!

1087
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:42,710
Where are you?

1088
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:47,048
What can we do?

1089
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:50,342
- Where is Hercules?
- Yeah, Hercules'll save us.

1090
01:12:51,427 --> 01:12:54,388
Hercules!

1091
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:59,143
Come out! Face me!

1092
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,773
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1093
01:13:04,316 --> 01:13:06,400
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

1094
01:13:06,485 --> 01:13:07,735
Run!

1095
01:13:07,819 --> 01:13:10,072
Wait! Stop!

1096
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:14,116
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods!

1097
01:13:14,201 --> 01:13:17,161
- We're saved!
- So...

1098
01:13:17,245 --> 01:13:20,289
You mighty Hercules.

1099
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,742
- Oh!
- Oh!

1100
01:13:32,886 --> 01:13:35,262
Easy, horsefeathers.

1101
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:37,765
Stop twitching.

1102
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:41,060
Listen. Hercules is in trouble.

1103
01:13:41,812 --> 01:13:42,937
We've gotta find Phil.

1104
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:45,523
He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1105
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:52,446
Get back, blast you!

1106
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,995
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

1107
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:05,251
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!

1108
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:06,877
Phil!

1109
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:09,171
Phil, Hercules needs your help!

1110
01:14:09,256 --> 01:14:11,924
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1111
01:14:12,008 --> 01:14:16,554
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned something.

1112
01:14:16,638 --> 01:14:19,890
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me.

1113
01:14:19,975 --> 01:14:24,270
It's about him.
If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die.

1114
01:14:24,396 --> 01:14:26,689
I need more thunderbolts!

1115
01:14:26,773 --> 01:14:29,275
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord.

1116
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:31,735
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!

1117
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,779
Hey, hey! Watch the glasses.

1118
01:14:40,078 --> 01:14:42,997
Zeusy, I'm home!

1119
01:14:43,081 --> 01:14:46,917
Hades. You're behind this!

1120
01:14:47,002 --> 01:14:48,919
You are correct, sir!

1121
01:14:53,383 --> 01:14:55,259
Flea.

1122
01:14:59,806 --> 01:15:02,725
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1123
01:15:02,809 --> 01:15:04,810
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.

1124
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:07,980
Come on, you can take this bum.
This guy's a pushover. Look at him.

1125
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:10,107
You were right all along, Phil.

1126
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:13,194
Dreams are for rookies.

1127
01:15:13,278 --> 01:15:16,530
No, no, no, no, kid.
Givin' up is for rookies.

1128
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:18,657
I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1129
01:15:18,742 --> 01:15:20,951
I'm willing to go the distance.

1130
01:15:21,036 --> 01:15:22,786
How 'bout you?

1131
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:28,542
Me bite off head!

1132
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,632
Whoa, baby!

1133
01:15:48,188 --> 01:15:50,481
Hercules! Look out!

1134
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:53,400
Meg! No!

1135
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:04,119
What's happening?

1136
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:08,666
H-Hades' deal is broken.

1137
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:12,002
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1138
01:16:12,754 --> 01:16:14,505
Meg.

1139
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:17,383
Why... why... why did ya...

1140
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:18,759
You didn't have to...

1141
01:16:18,843 --> 01:16:24,014
Oh, people always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1142
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:27,184
Oh, Meg.

1143
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,353
Meg, I... I...

1144
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:33,315
Are you always this articulate?

1145
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:40,447
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1146
01:16:41,574 --> 01:16:44,076
I'll watch over her, kid.

1147
01:16:44,953 --> 01:16:46,912
You're gonna be all right.

1148
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:49,206
I promise.

1149
01:16:51,668 --> 01:16:53,544
Let's go, Pegasus!

1150
01:16:56,006 --> 01:16:58,966
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!

1151
01:16:59,134 --> 01:17:01,093
I can't hear you!

1152
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:05,973
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of this...

1153
01:17:06,057 --> 01:17:08,976
I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.

1154
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,478
And I think I'm gonna like it here.

1155
01:17:11,563 --> 01:17:14,356
Don't get too comfortable, Hades!

1156
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:17,484
Hercules!

1157
01:17:17,569 --> 01:17:19,903
This ought to even the odds!

1158
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:25,159
Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.

1159
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:26,577
Get them!

1160
01:17:29,164 --> 01:17:30,306
Whoa! Hey!

1161
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:35,461
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1162
01:17:37,255 --> 01:17:41,759
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse.

1163
01:17:48,641 --> 01:17:50,476
Thank you, my boy.

1164
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:55,314
Nice horsey! My intentions were pure!
I really was attracted to you.

1165
01:17:58,318 --> 01:17:59,693
Throw!

1166
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:04,031
Ah! Now watch your old man work!

1167
01:18:08,703 --> 01:18:13,916
Guys, get your titanic rears in gear
and kick some Olympian butt!

1168
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:16,460
Whoa! Is my hair out?

1169
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,531
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.

1170
01:18:45,615 --> 01:18:48,409
But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize,

1171
01:18:48,493 --> 01:18:52,246
a friend of yours who's dying to see me.

1172
01:18:53,164 --> 01:18:54,636
Meg.

1173
01:19:21,164 --> 01:19:22,636
Ha! Meg.

1174
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:25,636
Meg.

1175
01:19:32,412 --> 01:19:34,204
Meg, no.

1176
01:19:54,392 --> 01:19:56,560
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1177
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:02,232
There's some things
you just can't change.

1178
01:20:04,777 --> 01:20:06,653
Yes, I can.

1179
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:12,826
We were so close!

1180
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:14,411
So close.

1181
01:20:14,496 --> 01:20:16,371
We tripped at the finish line. Why?

1182
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:20,417
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1183
01:20:24,797 --> 01:20:27,508
- Where's Meg?
- Look who's here.

1184
01:20:27,592 --> 01:20:29,801
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1185
01:20:29,886 --> 01:20:33,722
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

1186
01:20:33,806 --> 01:20:35,933
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

1187
01:20:36,935 --> 01:20:40,437
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?

1188
01:20:41,523 --> 01:20:43,482
Meg!

1189
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:45,359
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1190
01:20:45,443 --> 01:20:47,986
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.

1191
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:49,947
And not a very lively one, at that.

1192
01:20:51,783 --> 01:20:55,035
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1193
01:20:55,119 --> 01:21:00,707
Oh, hmph, well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1194
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:03,210
- Going once.
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

1195
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:06,380
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1196
01:21:06,464 --> 01:21:09,925
You get her out. She goes, you stay.

1197
01:21:12,887 --> 01:21:14,471
Oh, you what slipped my mind?

1198
01:21:14,556 --> 01:21:16,431
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1199
01:21:16,516 --> 01:21:18,100
That's not a problem, is it?

1200
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:45,454
Oh!

1201
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:48,922
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1202
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:51,508
The thread won't cut.

1203
01:21:59,058 --> 01:22:01,768
This is... This is impossible!

1204
01:22:01,853 --> 01:22:04,771
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...

1205
01:22:04,856 --> 01:22:06,273
- A god?
- A god?

1206
01:22:10,945 --> 01:22:14,656
Hercules, stop!
You can't do this to me. You can't...

1207
01:22:14,741 --> 01:22:17,034
Fine. Okay. Listen.

1208
01:22:17,118 --> 01:22:20,120
Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?

1209
01:22:20,204 --> 01:22:22,122
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

1210
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:24,416
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1211
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,793
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

1212
01:22:26,878 --> 01:22:29,463
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...

1213
01:22:32,592 --> 01:22:37,304
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

1214
01:22:38,348 --> 01:22:40,891
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1215
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:43,852
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

1216
01:22:43,936 --> 01:22:45,896
- If. If is good.
- Taxi!

1217
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,231
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little...

1218
01:23:12,757 --> 01:23:15,676
Wonderboy, what...

1219
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,302
Why did you...

1220
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:21,014
People always do crazy things

1221
01:23:21,099 --> 01:23:22,599
when they're in love.

1222
01:23:31,776 --> 01:23:33,276
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1223
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:47,749
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules!

1224
01:23:47,834 --> 01:23:50,377
Oh, yeah! Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1225
01:24:04,308 --> 01:24:08,311
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1226
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,731
Mother.

1227
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:16,570
Fine work, my boy! You've done it!

1228
01:24:16,654 --> 01:24:19,072
You're a true hero.

1229
01:24:19,157 --> 01:24:23,368
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1230
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:27,205
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1231
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:30,250
but by the strength of his heart.

1232
01:24:31,002 --> 01:24:35,255
Now, at last, my son,

1233
01:24:35,923 --> 01:24:38,633
you can come home.

1234
01:24:52,064 --> 01:24:56,318
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1235
01:25:04,368 --> 01:25:08,747
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.

1236
01:25:09,707 --> 01:25:11,041
But...

1237
01:25:13,044 --> 01:25:17,756
A life without Meg,
even an immortal life,

1238
01:25:18,049 --> 01:25:20,884
would be empty.

1239
01:25:22,553 --> 01:25:23,762
I...

1240
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:27,641
I wish to stay on Earth with her.

1241
01:25:27,725 --> 01:25:30,101
I finally know where I belong.

1242
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:46,201

Anybody listenin'?

1260
01:32:37,154 --> 01:32:39,405
It's like I'm...
What am I, an echo or something?

1261
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:44,911
Hello? Hello? Am I talking to, what?
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.

1262
01:32:44,995 --> 01:32:46,371
Nobody listens.
