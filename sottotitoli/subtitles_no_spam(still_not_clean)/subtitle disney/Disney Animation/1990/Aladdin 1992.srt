Please, please, come closer.

19
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,954
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,664
There.

21
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,083
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,379
city of mystery, of enchantment,

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,506
and the finest merchandise
this side of the River Jordan,

24
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,550
on sale today. Come on down.

25
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,302
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:19,805
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,642
Will not break. Will not...

28
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,226
It broke.

29
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,979
Ohh! Look at this.

30
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,940
I have never seen
one of these intact before.

31
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,901
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

32
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:35,237
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,198
Wait. Don't go.

34
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,202
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:45,373
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

36
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,377
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

37
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:52,129
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

38
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,965
but what is inside that counts.

39
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,842
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,762
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:04,058
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,352
A diamond in the rough.

43
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,021
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?

44
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,608
It begins on a dark night,

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,279
<i>where a dark man waits</i>

46
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,533
<i>with a dark purpose.</i>

47
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,665
You are late.

48
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,668
A thousand apologies, O patient one.

49
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,961
You have it, then?

50
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,381
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.

51
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,633
Ah-ah-ahhh.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,427
The treasure.

53
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,511
Ow!

54
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:46,142
Trust me, my pungent friend.

55
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,812
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!

56
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,239
Quickly! Follow the trail.

57
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,078
Faster.

58
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:29,518
At last,
after all my years of searching,

59
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,396
the Cave of Wonders.

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,565
Awk. Cave of Wonders.

61
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,318
By Allah.

62
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,530
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

63
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,701
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

64
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,124
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.

65
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,127
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

66
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,254
Shh.

67
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:13,896
Who disturbs my slumber?

68
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,568
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

69
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,403
Know this.

70
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,532
Only one may enter here,

71
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,868
one whose worth lies far within.

72
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,038
A diamond in the rough.

73
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,208
What are you waiting for? Go on.

74
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,270
No!

75
00:05:54,353 --> 00:06:00,484
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

76
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,492
I can't believe it. I just don't believe it.

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,872
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

78
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,459
Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

79
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,881
Patience, Iago. Patience.

80
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,259
Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

81
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,887
Oh, there's a big surprise.

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,641
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

83
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:37,187
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

84
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,523
Yes.

85
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,693
Only one may enter.

86
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,070
I must find this one, this...

87
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,781
Diamond in the rough.

88
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,910
Stop! Thief!

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,330
I'll have your hands for a trophy,
street rat.

90
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,082
All this for a loaf of bread?

91
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,959
Whoa!

92
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,348
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!

93
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,433
You think that was easy?

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,687
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

95
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:21,065
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.

96
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:25,027
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

97
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,364
Trouble? No way.
You're only in trouble if you get caught.

98
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,032
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,492
And this time...

100
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,371
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

101
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,248

Hey!

151
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,783
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

You are a worthless street rat.

157
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,470
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,709
I've never been so insulted.

174
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,838
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

175
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,840
Good luck marrying her off.

176
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,676
Oh! Jasmine.

177
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,929
Jasmine!

178
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,681
Jasmine!

179
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,142
Jasmine!

180
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,603
Confound it, Rajah.

181
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,817
So, this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

182
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,444
Oh, Father.

183
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,322
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

184
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,532
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

185
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,369
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

186
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,960
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

187
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,672
The law says
you must be married to a prince

188
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,841
by your next birthday.

189
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,385
The law is wrong.

190
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,804
You've only got three more days.

191
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,432
Father, I hate being forced into this.

192
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,019
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

193
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,312
Jasmine,

194
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,066
it's not only this law.

195
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,947
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I...

196
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,952
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

197
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,453
Provided for.

198
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,664
Please try to understand.

199
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:56,335
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

200
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,171
Except you, Rajah.

201
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,592
I've never even been outside
the palace walls.

202
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,345
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

203
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,014
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

204
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,767
Oooh! I... I...

205
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,062
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

206
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
Hmm?

207
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,537
I don't know where she gets it from.

208
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,999
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

209
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,877
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

210
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,172
My most trusted advisor.

211
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,049
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

212
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,052
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

213
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:51,390
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

214
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,643
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

215
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,770
Oh!

216
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,900
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

217
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,612
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

218
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,326
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

219
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,369
to this thorny problem.

220
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,205
If anyone can help, it's you.

221
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:19,084
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

222
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,338
Oh. Uh, my ring?

223
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,715
But it's been in the family for years.

224
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,760
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

225
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,762
Don't worry.

226
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,307
Everything will be fine.

227
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,352
Everything will be fine.

228
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,562
The diamond.

229
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,981
Here, Jafar.

230
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,610
Whatever you need will be fine.

231
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,820
You are most gracious, my liege.

232
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,116
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

233
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,079
Yes. That will be pretty good.

234
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,042
I can't take it anymore!

235
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:06,167
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

236
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,425
Bam! Whack!

237
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,135
Calm yourself, Iago.

238
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!

239
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,058
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addlepated twit.

240
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:21,230
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat. Ha, ha!

241
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,167
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

242
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,046
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

243
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,966
I'll miss you.

244
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,227
Goodbye.

245
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,364
Okay, Abu. Go.

246
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,911
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

247
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,708
Get your paws off that.

248
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,834
Why, you...

249
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,755
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

250
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,799
Goodbye.

251
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,719
Nice going, Abu.

252
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,846
Breakfast is served.

253
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,688
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

254
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,232
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

255
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,610
Sugar dates and pistachios.

256
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
Would the lady like a necklace?

257
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,781
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

258
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,366
Fresh fish!

259
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,742
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

260
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,494
Oh, no. I don't think so.

261
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,746
Oh!

262
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,123
Excuse me.

263
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,380
I'm really very sorry.

264
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,257
Wow.

265
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,098
Uh-oh.

266
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,684
Hello? Hello?

267
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, you must be hungry.

268
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,732
Here you go.

269
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,777
You'd better be able to pay for that.

270
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,447
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

271
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,409
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

272
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,160
- Thief!
- Please...

273
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,955
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

274
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,125
Do you know
what the penalty is for stealing?

275
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,668
No! No, please!

276
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,839
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

277
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,298
I've been looking all over for you.

278
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,925
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

279
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,553
You, uh, know this girl?

280
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,597
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

281
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
She's a little crazy.

282
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,977
She said she knew the sultan.

283
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,271
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

284
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,318
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

285
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,991
Tragic, isn't it?

286
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,285
But no harm done.

287
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,996
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

288
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,331
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

289
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,002
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.

290
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,424
Huh? What?

291
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,760
Come back here, you little thieves!

292
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,184
With all due respect, Your Rottenness,

293
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,395
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

294
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,898
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

295
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,443
Yes, O mighty evil one.

296
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,282
Part, sands of time.

297
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,286
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

298
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,498
Yes! Yes!

299
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,375
There he is.

300
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,753
My diamond in the rough.

301
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,256
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

302
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:22,805
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

303
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,057
Swell.

304
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,271
Almost there.

305
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,657
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

306
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,992
Uh, forget it.

307
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,288
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

308
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,417
Is it that obvious?

309
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,546
Well, you do kind of stand out.

310
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,009
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

311
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,763
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

312
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,265
Wow.

313
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,308
Hey.

314
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,354
Come on. This way.

315
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,691
Whoa. Watch your head there.

316
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,234
Be careful.

317
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,944
Is this where you live?

318
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,823
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

319
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,658
That sounds fabulous.

320
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,829
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

321
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,499
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

322
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,836
Oh, it's wonderful.

323
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,213
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

324
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,966
and have servants and valets.

325
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,303
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

326
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,055
It's better than here.

327
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,641
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

328
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,019
You're not free
to make your own choices.

329
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,479
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

330
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,148
- Trapped.
- Trapped.

331
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,655
So, where are you from?

332
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,991
What does it matter?

333
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,577
I ran away and I am not going back.

334
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,789
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

335
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,127
My father's forcing me to get married.

336
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,422
That's... That's awful.

337
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,885
Abu!

338
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,470
What?

339
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,682
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

340
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,850
What?

341
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,728
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

342
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,857
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

343
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,069
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

344
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,695
Oh, boy.

345
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,530
Hmm.

346
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,159
Tell him that's very sweet.

347
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,205
Here you are.

348
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,499
- They're after me!
- They're after you?

349
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,917
My father must have sent them...

350
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,168
- Do you trust me?
- What?

351
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,837
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

352
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,297
Then jump!

353
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:12,224
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

354
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,560
Run! Go! Get out of here!

355
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,562
Get this thing off of me!

356
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,400
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

357
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,567
Let him go.

358
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:27,072
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

359
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,951
Unhand him, by order of the princess.

360
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,912
Princess Jasmine.

361
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,831
- The princess?
- Princess?

362
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,084
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

363
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,255
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

364
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:47,092
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

365
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,887
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

366
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,104
Jafar?

367
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,106
Oh, Princess.

368
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,608
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

369
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,861
How may I be of service to you?

370
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,989
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

371
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,285
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

372
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,246
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

373
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,622
I can't breathe, Jafar.

374
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,293
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

375
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,628
If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

376
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,298
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

377
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,467
Oh, dear.

378
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,346
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

379
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,307
What do you mean?

380
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,977
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

381
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,312
What sentence?

382
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,314
Death.

383
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,983
- By beheading.
- No.

384
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,782
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

385
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,617
How could you?

386
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,129
So, how did it go?

387
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,841
I think she took it rather well.

388
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,899
It's all my fault, Rajah.

389
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,279
I didn't even know his name.

390
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,718
She was the princess. I can't believe it.

391
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,055
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

392
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,767
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!

393
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,645
Abu. Down here.

394
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,774
Come on, help me out of these.

395
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,577
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

396
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,412
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,956
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

398
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,876
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

399
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,336
She's gotta marry a prince.

400
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,882
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

401
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,260
I'm a fool.

402
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,889
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

403
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,016
Who are you?

404
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,894
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

405
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,022
But together, perhaps we can be more.

406
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm listening.

407
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,361
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

408
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,407
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

409
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,950
Ooh!

410
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,580
Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

411
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,291
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

412
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,960
But the law says only a prince can...

413
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,630
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

414
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,466
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

415
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,845
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

416
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,475
I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

417
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,477
Uh, one problem.

418
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,729
It's out there. We're in here.

419
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:32,859
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

420
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,613
So, do we have a deal?

421
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,824
Oh, I don't know.

422
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,173
Who disturbs my slumber?

423
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,719
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

424
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,765
Proceed.

425
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,227
Touch nothing but the lamp.

426
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,189
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp,

427
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,151
and then you shall have your reward.

428
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,945
Come on, Abu.

429
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,712
Would you look at that!

430
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,218
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

431
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,429
Abu!

432
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,766
Don't touch anything.

433
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,476
We gotta find that lamp.

434
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,495
Huh?

435
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,719
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

436
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,661
Abu, what are you, crazy?

437
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,792
A magic carpet.

438
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,629
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

439
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

440
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,768
Thanks.

441
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,237
Wait a minute. Don't go.

442
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,197
Maybe you can help us.

443
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,201
Hey! Whoa!

444
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,912
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

445
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,084
I think he knows where it is.

446
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,059
Wait here.

447
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,734
Oh!

448
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,429
This is it?

449
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,015
This is what we came
all the way down here to...

450
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,101
Abu! No!

451
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,896
- Infidels!
- Uh-oh.

452
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:43,109
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

453
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:49,866
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

454
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,368
Whoa!

455
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,604
Help! Help! Help!

456
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,107
Gotcha!

457
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,363
Carpet, let's move.

458
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,463
Abu!

459
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,924
Abu, this is no time to panic.

460
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,301
Start panicking.

461
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
Whoa!

462
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,793
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

463
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,337
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

464
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,339
First give me the lamp.

465
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,264
Yes!

466
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,641
At last!

467
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,396
What are you doing?

468
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,065
Giving you your reward.

469
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,153
Your eternal reward.

470
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,598
It's mine.

471
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,475
It's all mine.

472
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,728
I... Where is it?

473
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,104
No.

474
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,940
No!

475
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,322
Jasmine?

476
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,534
Oh, dearest.

477
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,828
What's wrong?

478
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,916
Jafar has

479
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,543
done something terrible.

480
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,338
There, there, my dear.

481
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,548
We'll set it right.

482
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,259
Now, tell me everything.

483
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,222
Oh.

484
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,308
Aladdin. Wake up.

485
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,643
Aladdin.

486
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,063
Oh! My head.

487
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,567
We're trapped.

488
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,821
That two-faced son of a jackal!

489
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,451
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

490
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,869
Aha!

491
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,289
Why, you hairy little thief.

492
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,293
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

493
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,796
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

494
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,674
but it's hard to make out.

495
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,313
Aaaaahhhhh!

496
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,815
Oy!

497
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:56,612
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

498
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,114
Hang on a second.

499
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,825
Whoa! Whoa!

500
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,327
Does it feel good to be outta there.

501
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm telling you,
nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.

502
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,582
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

503
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,250
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

504
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,170
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

505
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,422
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

506
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,676
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

507
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,971
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

508
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,891
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

509
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,602
Oh, sorry, Cheeta.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

510
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,271
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

511
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,900
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

512
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,695
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

513
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,113
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

514
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,324
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

515
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,327
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

516
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,497
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

517
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,707
The ever impressive,

518
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,044
the long contained,

519
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,128
the often imitated,

520
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,214
but never duplicated...

521
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,382
Duplicated, duplicated...

522
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,303
Genie of the Lamp!

523
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,138
Right here direct from the lamp,

524
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,808
right here
for your very much wish fulfilment.

525
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,059
Thank you.

526
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,479
- Whoa. Wish fulfilment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

527
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,398
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

That's it. Three. <i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

529
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,570
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

530
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,905
Now I know I'm dreaming.

531
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,867
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

532
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:30,122
So why don't you just ruminate

So, what'll it be, master?

584
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,979
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

585
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,230
Ah, almost.

586
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,441
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

587
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,609
Like?

588
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,904
Ah, rule number one, I can't kill anybody.

589
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,322
So don't ask.

590
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,657
Rule number two.

591
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,327
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

592
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,955
You little <i>ponem</i> there.

593
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:20,626
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

594
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,504
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

595
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,215
Other than that, you got it.

596
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,758
- Hmm.
- Oh!

597
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,139
Provisos? You mean limitations?

598
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,267
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

599
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,186
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

600
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,690
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

601
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,151
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

602
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
Excuse me?

603
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,072
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

604
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,117
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

605
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,202
And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

606
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,164
I don't think so, not right now.

607
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,624
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!

608
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,960
In case of emergency,

609
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,588
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

610
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,965
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

611
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,967
We're...

612
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,471
Outta here!

613
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,641
Jafar, this is an outrage.

614
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,561
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

615
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:25,024
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

616
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,610
before they are beheaded.

617
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,613
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

618
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,073
Jasmine...

619
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:36,994
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

620
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,162
Please.

621
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:42,833
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

622
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,795
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

623
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,132
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

624
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,178
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

625
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,349
Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business... Jasmine?

626
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,351
Jasmine!

627
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,648
If only I had gotten that lamp.

628
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,818
"I will have the power to get rid of you."

629
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,488
To think we gotta keep kissing up

630
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,242
to that Chump and his Chump daughter

631
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,828
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

632
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,706
Only until she finds a Chump husband.

633
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,583
Then she'll have us banished.

634
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,253
Or beheaded.

635
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,879
Eww!

636
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,341
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

637
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,261
What if you were the chump husband?

638
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,554
What?

639
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,890
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

640
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,477
And, uh, then you become the sultan.

641
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,562
Oh.

642
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,898
Marry the shrew.

643
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,817
I become the sultan.

644
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,737
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

645
00:42:53,821 --> 00:43:00,327
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

646
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,413
Yaaah!

647
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,373
Kersplat!

648
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,336
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

649
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,266
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

650
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,978
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

651
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,190
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Goodbye. Thank you.

652
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,402
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

653
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,407
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

654
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,618
Dost mine ears deceive me?

655
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,787
Three? You are down by one, boy.

656
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,666
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

657
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,460
You did that on your own.

658
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,797
Well, I feel sheepish.

659
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,092
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

660
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,346
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

661
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,556
I want them to be good.

662
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,308
What would you wish for?

663
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,809
Me?

664
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,687
No one's ever asked me that before.

665
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,066
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

666
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,692
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

667
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,153
Come on. Tell me.

668
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,113
Freedom.

669
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,240
You're a prisoner?

670
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,659
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

671
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,454
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

672
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,956
Itty bitty living space.

673
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,166
Genie, that's terrible.

674
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,336
But, oh, to be free...

675
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

676
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,882
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

677
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,884
To be my own master.

678
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,845
Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

679
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,182
and all the treasures in all the world.

680
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,600
But what am I talking about?

681
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,019
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

682
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,522
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

683
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,856
Why not?

684
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:56,777
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

685
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,446
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

686
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,115
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

687
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,452
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

688
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,121
After I make my first two wishes,

689
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,456
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

690
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,835
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

691
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,045
Let's make some magic.

692
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,840
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

693
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,969
Well, there's this girl.

694
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,137
Wrong.

695
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,931
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

696
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,436
Oh, but, Genie,
she's smart and fun and...

697
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,479
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

698
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,774
She's got these eyes that just...
And this hair. Wow.

699
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,027
And her smile...

700
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,611
<i>Ami.</i>

701
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,947
<i>C'est l'amour.</i>

702
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,074
But she's the princess.

703
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,535
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

704
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,413
Hey, can you make me a prince?

705
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,914
Let's see here.

706
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,751
Chicken à la king? Nope.

707
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,004
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

708
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,548
Caesar salad. Ah! <i>Et tu, Brute?</i> No.

709
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,468
Aha. "To make a prince."

710
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,387
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

711
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,265
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

712
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,767
All right!

713
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,101
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

714
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,272
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

715
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,274
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

716
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,610
No. Let's work with me here.

717
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,780
Ooh. I like it. <i>Muy macho.</i>

718
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,116
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

719
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,952
It says mode of transportation.

720
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,955
Excuse me, monkey boy.
<i>Aqui.</i> Over here.

721
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,249
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.

722
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,211
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

723
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,881
than riding
your very own, brand-new camel?

724
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,216
Watch out. They spit.

725
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,301
Mmm. Not enough.

726
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:49,056
Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

727
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,642
Yes!

728
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,228
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

729
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,355
Whoa!

730
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,024
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

731
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,575
Abu, you look good.

732
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,869
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

733
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,955
But we're not through yet.

734
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:17,543
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

735
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,346
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

736
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,474
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

737
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,351
Oh, really?

738
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,727
Right here.

739
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,190
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

740
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,277
"then the sultan shall choose for her."

741
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,613
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

742
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,699
How could I choose someone
she hates?

743
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,118
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

744
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,539
"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found..."

745
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,623
Jerk.

746
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,127
"A princess must then be wed to..."

747
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,755
Hmm. Interesting.

748
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,591
What? Who?

749
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,217
The royal vizier.

750
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,596
Why, that would be me.

751
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:16,059
But I thought the law says
that only a prince can marry a princess.

752
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,394
I'm quite sure that...

753
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,106
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

754
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,693
Yes. Desperate measures.

755
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:29,239
You will order the princess to marry me.

756
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:34,077
I will order the princess to...

757
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,080
But you're so old.

758
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,292
The princess will marry me.

759
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,294
The princess will marry...

760
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,088
What? What is that?

761
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,423
That music.

762
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,388

Your Majesty,

811
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,348
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

812
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,183
Prince Ali Ababwa.

813
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,353
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

814
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,399
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

815
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,401
Ecstatic.

816
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,445
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

817
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,697
Whatever.

818
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,866
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

819
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,286
By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

820
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,538
Ooh.

821
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,291
I don't suppose I might...

822
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,461
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

823
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,799
Sire, I must advise against this.

824
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,844
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

825
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,512
Ow, ow, ow.

826
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,140
Ahh! Whoa!

827
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,975
Look out, here I come.

828
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:32,065
Just where did you say you were from?

829
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,945
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

830
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,281
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.

831
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,993
Hey, watch it.

832
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,120
Watch it with the dumb rug.

833
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,997
Aah!

834
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,707
Whew!

835
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,257
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

836
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,176
Jafar, watch this.

837
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,678
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

838
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,475
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

839
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,935
This is a very impressive youth.

840
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,271
And a prince besides.

841
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,941
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

842
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,694
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

843
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:22,407
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

844
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,118
Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

845
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,789
Jasmine will like this one.

846
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,041
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

847
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:35,253
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

848
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,589
This boy is no different from the others.

849
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,383
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

850
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,720
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

851
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,723
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

852
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,391
How dare you.

853
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,270
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

854
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,190
I am not a prize to be won.

855
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,567
Oh, dear.

856
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,989
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

857
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,119
I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abubu.

858
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,917
What am I gonna do?

859
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,336
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

860
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:20,048
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

861
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,220
So move.

862
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,681
Hey.

863
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,767
That's a good move.

864
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,186
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

865
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,355
Genie, I need help.

866
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,108
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

867
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,570
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

868
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,072
- Do you got it?
- What?

869
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,868
No way.

870
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:52,289
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

871
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,582
she'd laugh at me.

872
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,126
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

873
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,798
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

874
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,800
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

875
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,969
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

876
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:10,265
I just...
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

877
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,435
How do I look?

878
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,105
Like a prince.

879
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,828
Princess Jasmine?

880
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,999
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

881
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,628
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

882
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,296
I do not want to see you.

883
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,673
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

884
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,509
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

885
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,137
So, how's our little beau doing?

886
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,974
Good kitty, take off.

887
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,184
Down, kitty.

888
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,644
Wait. Wait.

889
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,854
Do I know you?

890
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,273
Uh, no. No.

891
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:05,028
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

892
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,489
The marketplace?

893
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,866
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

894
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,537
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

895
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,206
so it couldn't have been me you met.

896
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,627
No. I guess not.

897
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,588
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

898
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,383
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

899
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,968
Anything. Pick a feature.

900
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,971
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

901
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,764
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

902
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,140
- punctual.
- Punctual.

903
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,392
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

904
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,936
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

905
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,020
Hmm.

906
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,730
I'm rich, too, you know.

907
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,234
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

908
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,528
I know.

909
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,531
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

910
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,867
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

911
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,494
Warning! Warning!

912
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,705
Right. A prince like you.

913
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,042
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

914
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,794
Mayday! Mayday!

915
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,715
Just go jump off a balcony!

916
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,050
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

917
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,927
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

918
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,764
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

919
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,599
- Yeah, right.
- What?

920
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,352
Uh... Uh, you're right.

921
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,940
You aren't just
some prize to be won.

922
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,735
You should be free
to make your own choice.

923
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,695
I'll go now.

924
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,780
- No!
- What? What?

925
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,615
How...

926
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,409
How are you doing that?

927
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,370
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

928
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,457
You, uh...

929
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,293
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

930
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,296
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

931
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,631
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

932
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,761
- What?
- Do you trust me?

933
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,598

It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

969
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,476
Nah. He hates fireworks.

970
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,478
He doesn't like flying, either.

971
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:52,607
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

972
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,817
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

973
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,278
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

974
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,072
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

975
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,074
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

976
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:05,286
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

977
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,372
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

978
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,123
The truth?

979
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,710
The truth. Um...

980
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,005
The truth is...

981
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,092
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um,

982
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,636
to escape the pressures of palace life.

983
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,682
But I really am a prince.

984
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,060
Why didn't you just tell me?

985
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,771
Well, you know,

986
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,357
royalty going out into the city
in disguise,

987
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,943
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

988
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,194
Hmm.

989
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,488
Not that strange.

990
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,097
Good night, my handsome prince.

991
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,890
Sleep well, Princess.

992
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,583
Yes!

993
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:42,091
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

994
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,264
Abu. Abu.

995
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,932
Hold him.

996
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:58,024
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.

997
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,650
Why, you...

998
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,195
Make sure he's never found.

999
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,866
Never fails. You get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

1000
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,160
Hello? Al?

1001
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,330
Al! Kid, snap out of it.

1002
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,708
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

1003
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:01,254
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

1004
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,506
Come on, Aladdin!

1005
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,009
I'll take that as a yes.

1006
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,678
Up scope.

1007
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,023
Don't you scare me like that.

1008
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,860
Genie, I, uh...

1009
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,903
I...

1010
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,740
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

1011
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,868
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

1012
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,871
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

1013
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,795
Jasmine.

1014
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,799
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

1015
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,553
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1016
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,723
I have chosen a husband for you.

1017
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:56,434
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

1018
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:01,314
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

1019
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,191
I will never marry you.

1020
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,403
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

1021
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,655
Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

1022
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,407
Prince Ali!

1023
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,993
How in the... Uh. Awk!

1024
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:18,039
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1025
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,209
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1026
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,419
He is obviously lying.

1027
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,922
Obviously lying.

1028
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,049
Father, what's wrong with you?

1029
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,759
I know what's wrong.

1030
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,929
Oh, my!

1031
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,681
Your Highness,
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

1032
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,809
What? Jafar?

1033
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,312
You, you traitor!

1034
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,523
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

1035
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,650
Guards! Guards!

1036
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,860
Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it.

1037
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,779
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

1038
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,949
Arrest Jafar at once.

1039
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,243
This is not done yet, boy.

1040
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,667
Find him! Search everywhere!

1041
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,211
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

1042
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,297
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

1043
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,882
plotting against me all this time.

1044
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,301
This is horrible, just horrible.

1045
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,470
How will I ever...

1046
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,888
Huh?

1047
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,474
Can this be true?

1048
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:22,144
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

1049
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,356
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1050
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,277
You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.

1051
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,445
I won't. I'll leave that to my...

1052
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,490
But you two will be wed at once.

1053
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,785
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1054
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,163
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1055
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,415
- Sultan?
- Yes.

1056
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,750
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1057
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,211
a person of your unimpeachable
moral character

1058
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:50,464
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1059
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,802
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing. Only essentials.

1060
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,886
We gotta travel light.

1061
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,181
Bring the guns, the weapons,
the knives, and how about this picture?

1062
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,684
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

1063
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,649
Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

1064
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:12,320
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

1065
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,405
Good grip.

1066
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:18,367
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1067
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,621
- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...

1068
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,290
But you are going to relieve him of it.

1069
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,416
Me?

1070
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,380
Sultan?

1071
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,715
They want me to be Sultan?

1072
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,718
Huzzah!

1073
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,471
♪ <i>Hail the conquering hero</i> ♪

1074
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,065
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

1075
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,233
What are you gonna do next?

1076
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:01,744
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

1077
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,412
Any time.

1078
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,916
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

1079
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:10,419
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

1080
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,088
I'm serious.

1081
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:15,758
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1082
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,928
No. They wanna make Prince Ali sultan.

1083
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,597
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

1084
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,016
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

1085
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,603
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

1086
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,897
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1087
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,109
What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her.

1088
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,612
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.

1089
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,448
I can't wish you free.

1090
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,578
Fine. I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

1091
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,706
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1092
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,000
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

1093
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,965
Genie, I'm really sorry.

1094
01:08:57,174 --> 01:09:00,970
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

1095
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,557
What are you guys looking at?

1096
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,229
Look, I... I'm sorry.

1097
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,481
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1098
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,483
Wait. Come on.

1099
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,949
What am I doing?

1100
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,077
Genie's right.

1101
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,998
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1102
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,209
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

1103
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,546
Well, here goes.

1104
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,048
Jasmine? Where are you?

1105
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,718
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

1106
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,803
I'm coming.

1107
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:49,268
You got a problem, Pinky?

1108
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,728
Jerk.

1109
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,275
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.

1110
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,943
"Excellent work, Iago."

1111
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,278
Ah, go on.

1112
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:03,199
"No, really. On a scale
of one to 10, you are an 11."

1113
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,618
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

1114
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,578
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

1115
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,373
People of Agrabah,

1116
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:16,212
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

1117
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,798
Jasmine.

1118
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,800
Ali, where have you been?

1119
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,093
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

1120
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,222
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

1121
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,808
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

1122
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,392
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

1123
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:33,437
Ali Ababwa!

1124
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,064
Oh, boy.

1125
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:42,196
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

1126
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,698
Let them cheer.

1127
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,410
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

1128
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,288
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

1129
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:54,124
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

1130
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,545
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

1131
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,881
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1132
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,552
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1133
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,017
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

1134
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,895
What is this? What's going on?

1135
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,147
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1136
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,524
Father.

1137
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,280
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1138
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,491
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1139
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:29,869
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

1140
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,621
The lamp.

1141
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,083
Finders keepers, Abubu.

1142
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,225
Genie, no!

1143
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,895
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

1144
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,773
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1145
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,234
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1146
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,069
My order.

1147
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,156
Finally, you will bow to me.

1148
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,991
We will never bow to you.

1149
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,327
Why am I not surprised?

1150
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,954
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1151
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,166
then you will cower before a sorcerer!

1152
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:19,335
Genie, my second wish...

1153
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:25,549
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!

1154
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,760
Genie, stop!

1155
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,846
Ladies and gentlemen,

1156
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:36,352
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1157
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,646
Now, where were we?

1158
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,983
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1206
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,065
I'll teach you some respect.

1207
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,903
No. Genie.

1208
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:18,532
I have decided to make my final wish.

1209
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,660
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1210
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,621
to fall desperately in love with me.

1211
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,339
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos...

1212
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,466
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.

1213
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:41,722
You will do what I order you to do, slave.

1214
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,183
Jafar.

1215
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:50,689
I never realized how
incredibly handsome you are.

1216
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,943
Mmm. That's better.

1217
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,989
Now, pussycat,

1218
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,950
tell me more about myself.

1219
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:06,580
You're tall, dark,

1220
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,625
well dressed...

1221
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,960
Al. Al, little buddy.

1222
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,170
Shh.

1223
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,425
Al, I can't help you.

1224
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,470
I work for <i>Señor</i> Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1225
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:25,515
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1226
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:28,644
Cute little gaps
between your teeth.

1227
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:31,188
Go on.

1228
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:36,652
And your beard is so twisted.

1229
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:42,449
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jafar...

1230
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,203
And the street rat?

1231
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,288
What street rat?

1232
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,674
Yech!

1233
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,718
That was...

1234
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,181
You!

1235
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:10,018
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1236
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,148
Get the lamp.

1237
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,068
No!

1238
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:21,530
Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up.

1239
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,535
Jasmine.

1240
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,871
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1241
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,042
Don't toy with me.

1242
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,420
Abu!

1243
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:39,631
Things are unravelling
fast now, boy.

1244
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,219
Get the point?

1245
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,102
I'm just getting warmed up.

1246
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,525
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1247
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,862
A snake, am I?

1248
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:06,867
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1249
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:24,926
♪ <i>Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake</i> ♪

1250
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,094
♪ <i>Stick that sword into that snake</i> ♪

1251
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,846
You stay out of this.

1252
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,141
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!

1253
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,105
Aladdin.

1254
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,117
Jasmine, hang on.

1255
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,122
You little fool.

1256
01:19:55,332 --> 01:20:00,462
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1257
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:03,965
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1258
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,220
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1259
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,972
The genie. The genie.

1260
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,975
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1261
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,102
What?

1262
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,896
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1263
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,690
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1264
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,486
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1265
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,030
You're right.

1266
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:30,200
His power does exceed my own.

1267
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,120
But not for long.

1268
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,289
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1269
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,833
One too many hits with the snake.

1270
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,836
Slave, I make my third wish.

1271
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:45,173
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

1272
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:52,556
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1273
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,063
Yes.

1274
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,233
Yes!

1275
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:04,985
The power.

1276
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:12,617
The absolute power!

1277
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,995
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1278
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:21,209
The universe is mine to command,
to control!

1279
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:24,713
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1280
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,091
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

1281
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,384
What?

1282
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,595
And everything that goes with it.

1283
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,432
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1284
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,434
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1285
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:40,520
You're the genie. I don't want...

1286
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,980
Itty bitty living space.

1287
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,275
Al, you little genius, you.

1288
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,743
Ahh!

1289
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,501
Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1290
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,129
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1291
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,422
Allow me.

1292
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:11,468
Ten thousand years in a
Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.

1293
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,764
Shut up!

1294
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,271
Jasmine...

1295
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,650
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1296
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,527
I know why you did.

1297
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:35,242
Well, I guess this is goodbye?

1298
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,286
Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair.

1299
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,539
I love you.

1300
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:45,710
Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

1301
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,796
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1302
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,965
But, Genie, what about your freedom?

1303
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,093
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1304
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,262
This is love.

1305
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:59,641
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1306
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:01,935
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1307
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,355
Jasmine, I do love you,

1308
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:08,775
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1309
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,069
I understand.

1310
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,740
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1311
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,577
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1312
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,830
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1313
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:45,478
I'm free. I'm free.

1314
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,856
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1315
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:50,191
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

1316
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,028
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1317
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,073
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1318
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,702
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1319
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:03,997
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world. I'm...

1320
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:14,549
Genie, I'm...

1321
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,093
I'm gonna miss you.

1322
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,387
Me, too, Al.

1323
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,849
No matter what anybody says,

1324
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,394
you'll always be a prince to me.

1325
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:28,730
That's right.

1326
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:31,983
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1327
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,570
It's that law that's the problem.

1328
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,865
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1329
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,575
From this day forth,

1330
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:45,246
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1331
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,083
Him. I choose...

1332
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,920
I choose you, Aladdin.

1333
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,423
Call me Al.

1334
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,928
Oh, all of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1335
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:01,721
Group hug.

1336
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,348
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1337
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,308
Ooh, hairball.

1338
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,936
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this popsicle stand.

1339
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,480
I'm outta here!

1340
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,982
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1341
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,777
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1342
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,445
No, I'm mythology.

1343
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,448
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
