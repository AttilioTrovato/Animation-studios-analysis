1
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
<i>The neck bone's connected</i>

2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
<i>To the head bone</i>

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,360
<i>The head bone's connected
to the horn bone</i>

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,000
<i>The horn bone's right above
the wing bones</i>

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,320
- I scared you!
- No, you didn't.

6
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay! Remember our field trip rules,
everyone.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
No pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

8
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,280
What did I just say?

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
Eighteen, nineteen...

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,680
Mike Wazowski.

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,720
Thanks, Joe.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,560
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,680
- Sorry, Michael. I didn't see you.
- That's okay.

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,360
When I was on the bus, I found a nickel!

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,160
I wish I had pockets.

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,640
Jeremy! You and me? Okay, no biggie.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Hailey? No? Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice. She's a good egg.

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,160
Russell.

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Mike? Wazowski?

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
We car-pool?

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,840
Okay. Good catching up.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
Come on, Karen. We're falling behind.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
Please don't call me Karen.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,120
We're entering a very dangerous area.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,200
This is where
we collect the Scream Energy

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
to power our whole world.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
And can anyone tell me
whose job it is to go get that scream?

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,840
- Scarers!
- That's right!

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,680
Me, me, me!

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,000
Sir! Right here! Little green guy,

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
two o'clock!

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,040
No, it's like this.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Hey, guys, watch this one.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,640
Hey, I got a really good...

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,040
Well, hey there, kids.
Are you on a tour with your school?

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
- Yeah!
- Yes.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,240
We're here to learn about Scream
Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Well, hey, you're in luck,
because I just happen to be a Scarer.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,600
I learned everything
I know from my school,

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Monsters University.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,140
It's the best Scaring School there is.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,280
You wish! Fear Tech's the best.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,400
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me
which school's the best. All right?

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
MU is.

52
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,200
Let's go, everybody!

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,920
<i>West coast coming online.</i>

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
<i>Scarers coming out.</i>

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,080
Oops. Stop right there.

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Don't cross over that safety line.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,760
Human children are extremely toxic.

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
Look at that!

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,920
Hey, guys, watch the eye!

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Look at that! It's amazing!

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
I know!

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Excuse me. Fellas.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,800
How about we do
tallest in the back?

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,120
Look, he's going to

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,440
do a real Scare!

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,400
- Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
Come on, guys. I want to see.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,880
Out of the way, Wazowski.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,880
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
Brian! Do not step over the line.

71
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Mrs. Graves, Michael went over the line.

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,280
Michael!

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,000
See? I told you. He's fine.

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,360
Well,
I thought I heard something.

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,560
What?

76
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you okay?

77
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
You could have gotten hurt!

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
I don't understand
how this could happen!

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,720
That was real dangerous, kid.
I didn't even know you were in there.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,760
I didn't even know
you were in there.

81
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Not bad, kid.

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,640
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,920
How do I become a Scarer?

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

85
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Well, everyone,
I don't mean to get emotional,

86
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,400
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

87
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,200
Let it not be
just the beginning of my dream

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,920
but the beginning of all of our dreams.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

90
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
Marie, Mr. Right is out there somewhere.

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

92
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,360
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

93
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off.

94
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,360
Hello. How are you doing?

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Stroke! Stroke!

96
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on, put all you have into it!

97
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,240
Stroke! Stroke!

98
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,160
Okay! First thing on my list,
get registered.

99
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,360
Hey there, freshman. I'm Jay the R.A.,

100
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,280
and I'm here to say
that registration is thataway!

101
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,200
- Okay, Jay.
- Have a great first day.

102
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,080
Hey, I'm Kay!
Here's your orientation packet.

103
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,400
Thanks, Kay.

104
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,360
You can drop your bags off here
and get your picture taken with Trey.

105
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
- Say hooray!
- Hooray!

106
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
I can't believe it.

107
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm officially a college student!

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

109
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

110
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
Here are the labs
where students learn

111
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
to design and build the doors
to the Human World.

112
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,720
Looks like the professor is
about to test a door!

113
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,200
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
three meals a day.

114
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
I personally believe we have
some of the best chefs in the world.

115
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,720
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

116
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,880
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

117
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,680
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

118
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Welcome to the Debate Team.
We're happy to have you.

119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,880
I disagree for the following reasons.

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,460
True happiness
is a theoretical construct...

121
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky

122
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
at the Astronomy Club!

123
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Hey, hey, hey!
Come join the Improv Club.

124
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,200
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

125
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Dang it!

126
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
MU's Greek Council. We sponsor
the annual Scare Games.

127
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
The Scare what now?

128
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,400
The Scare Games!

129
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,520
A super-intense Scaring competition!

130
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

131
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,360
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
- You could totally die.
- And it's worth it.

133
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,040
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

134
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,040
Cool.

135
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Wazowski, Room 319.

136
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,560
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

137
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,520
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
That's too bland.

138
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
Don't force it. Just let it happen.

139
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,760
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

140
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,600
Hey there. I'm your roomie.

141
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,320
Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major.

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,180
I can tell we're going to be
best chums, Mike.

144
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
Take whichever bed you want.

145
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
I wanted you to have first dibs.

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,920
You just disappeared.

147
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,480
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
I'll be a joke.

148
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,280
No,
it's totally great. You got to use it.

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,740
- Really?
- Yeah, but lose the glasses.

150
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
They give it away.

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,240
Okay!

152
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check.

153
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
Now I just need to ace my classes,
graduate with honors,

154
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
and become the greatest Scarer ever.

155
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,680
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.

156
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
Aren't you even a little nervous?

157
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
Actually, no.

158
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,240
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

159
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,880
I just can't wait to get started.

160
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,720
Man! I can't be late on the first day!

161
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
You got to be kidding me.

162
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm so nervous!

163
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
Relax. It will be fine.

164
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Good morning, students.

165
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,120
Welcome to Scaring 101.

166
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
I am Professor Knight.

167
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,840
Now I'm sure all of you
were the scariest monster in your town.

168
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,280
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
and I do not scare easily.

170
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

171
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
She's a legend.

172
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,400
She broke the all-time Scare Record
with the scream in that very can!

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,360
I don't mean to interrupt.

174
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
I just thought I'd drop by

175
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,640
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

176
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,140
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

177
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
a few words of inspiration.

178
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,680
Inspiration? Very well.

179
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,200
Scariness is the true measure
of a monster.

180
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,680
If you're not scary

181
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,040
what kind of a monster are you?

182
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,120
It's my job to make
great students greater,

183
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,280
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

184
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,760
That is why at the end of the semester
there will be a final exam.

185
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,080
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

186
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,600
So, I should hope
you're all properly inspired.

187
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,200
All right. All right.

188
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,280
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

189
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes?

190
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
There are actually five.

191
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,120
Those include the roar's resonance,

192
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,320
the duration of the roar, and the...

193
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,920
Whoops. Sorry.

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,880
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

195
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Excuse me, sorry.

196
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

197
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Very impressive, Mister...

198
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,200
Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan.

199
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Sullivan.

200
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,640
Yeah. He's my dad.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
He's a Sullivan!

203
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,320
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

204
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,040
Well, you won't be disappointed.

205
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?

206
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

207
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,120
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

208
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,080
and open them to chapter one.

209
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,120
Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil?

210
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,840
I forgot all my stuff.

211
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,000
All right. Yes.
There we go. That will get it.

212
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,760
Yeah.

213
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity

214
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
and sorority party. We have to go!

215
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
If we flunk that Scaring final,
we are done.

216
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not taking any chances.

217
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,500
You've got
the whole semester to study,

218
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,280
but this might be our only chance

219
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
to get in good with the cool kids.

220
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,880
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.

221
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,920
That could
have been embarrassing.

222
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,860
When I'm a Scarer,
life will be a nonstop party.

223
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

224
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,160
Wild man.

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
What the...

226
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Archie!

227
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,040
Boo!

228
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
Hey! What are you...

229
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

230
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

231
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,400
- That guy's in big trouble.
- Yeah, he is.

232
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,560
Hey, guys! Over here!

233
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,360
Fear Tech dummies.

234
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,400
- Sorry about that, buddy.
- Why are you in my room?

235
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,600
Your room? This is my...

236
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,640
This is not my room.

237
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
Archie! Come here, boy.

238
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,000
Archie?

239
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,200
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

240
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,760
Why is it here?

241
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,000
I stole it. Going to
take it to the RORs.

242
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,160
The what?

243
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

244
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,320
They only accept the highly elite.

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,060
Okay, I'll lift the bed,
you grab the pig.

246
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
- Ready? One, two, three.
- What? No, no... What...

247
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
That's it. Don't let go.

248
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,600
Careful. He's a biter.

249
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
Hey...

250
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,520
I got him!

251
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
That was awesome!

252
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,920
What am I doing? James P. Sullivan.

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
Mike Wazowski.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,580
Listen, it was quite delightful
meeting you

255
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,720
and whatever that is,

256
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,880
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

257
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,560
You don't need to study Scaring.

258
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,720
You just do it.

259
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Really? I think there's
a little more to it than that.

260
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,200
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.

261
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,680
Let go of that!

262
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,480
- My hat!
- My pig!

263
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
Hey! Come here!

264
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,080
Hey!

265
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Catch it!

266
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,360
Come back here!

267
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah!

268
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,360
Ride it to frat row!

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,360
<i>Tentacles and serpent's wings,
they...</i>

270
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Hey!

271
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
Go, go, go!

272
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Hey...

273
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,520
Come on! Hey!

274
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,640
Cupcake?

275
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,800
Got it!

276
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules!

277
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
M-U! M-U! M-U!

278
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,480
Did you see him catch that pig?

279
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,720
You are Jaws Theta Chi material,
freshman.

280
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Thanks. I don't know...

281
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,120
No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy.

282
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,680
- Back off. We saw him first.
- No way. We did!

283
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,120
I'll take it from here,
gentlemen.

284
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,040
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.

285
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,840
What's your name, big blue?

286
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,840
Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley.

287
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,400
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

288
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,160
I can't believe it! That is crazy!

289
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,800
- Chet, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

290
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,760
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

291
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,240
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

292
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

293
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
Slow down, squirt.
This party is for Scare students only.

294
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,840
Sorry, killer,
but you might want to hang out

295
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,640
with someone a little more your speed.

296
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,480
They look fun!

297
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Hey there.
Want to join Oozma Kappa?

298
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,400
We have cake.

299
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
Go crazy.

300
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,360
Is that a joke?

301
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Sulley, talk to your friend.

302
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,360
He's not really my friend, but sure.

303
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,760
You heard him.
This is a party for Scare students.

304
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,440
I am a Scare student.

305
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,560
I mean for Scare students who actually,

306
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
you know, have a chance.

307
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
Snap!

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,240
My chances are just as good as yours.

309
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,160
You're not even
in the same league with me.

310
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,200
Just wait, hotshot.

311
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,560
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

312
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Okay.
I'd like to see that.

313
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't worry. You will.

314
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,040
Ready position.

315
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,520
Common crouch.

316
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,720
I want to see matted fur
and yellow teeth. Basic snarl.

317
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
Show me some slobber.

318
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,080
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.

319
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,040
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

320
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,560
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

321
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

322
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
Yeah!

323
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
Give me another one.

324
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,640
- Fear of spiders.
- Arachnophobia.

325
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,020
- Fear of thunder.
- Keraunophobia.

326
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,080
- Fear of chopsticks!
- Consecotaleophobia.

327
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,000
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

328
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,040
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!

329
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,080
The answer is C, fangs.

330
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

331
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,520
- A bowl of spiders!
- Correct!

332
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,720
- A clown running in the dark!
- Right again.

333
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,840
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.

334
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,400
Outstanding!

335
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Ogre slump.

336
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,800
Zombie snarl.

337
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,040
Dominant silverback gorilla.

338
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,960
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

339
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,320
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

340
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,280
A Tauntaun Grimace with Extra Slobber.

341
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,280
- You got it!
- That's what I'm saying.

342
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,200
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

343
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,800
Yes, you are, big blue.

344
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,840
Hey, wait. What are you guys...

345
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,600
It's just a precaution.

346
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,920
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

348
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
I am on a roll.

349
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,160
I'm going to destroy that guy.

350
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,560
Well, then you'll get this back
right away.

351
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,960
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

352
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,400
Today's final will judge your ability
to assess a child's fear

353
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,640
and perform the appropriate Scare
in the Scare Simulator.

354
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,880
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised

355
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,880
from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper,

356
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,560
so give it everything you've got.

357
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,920
Dean Hardscrabble is with us
this morning

358
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,280
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

359
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,160
and who will not.

360
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's get started.

361
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I am a five-year-old girl
afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.

362
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,040
Which Scare do you use?

363
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,800
That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl.

364
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
Demonstrate.

365
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

366
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,960
Focus.

367
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,120
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

368
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
Hey. Do you mind?

369
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Don't mind at all.

370
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Come on, Mike. Let's just move.

371
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,520
Stay out of my way.

372
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,920
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

373
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,440
That's because you don't belong here.

374
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,320
That's what I thought.

375
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,800
I'm so sorry.

376
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,800
It was an accident.

377
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,200
What? This?

378
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,960
My one souvenir
from a lifetime of Scaring?

379
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,360
Accidents happen, don't they.

380
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
The important thing is no one got hurt.

381
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,200
You're taking this remarkably well.

382
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,000
Now, let's continue the exams.

383
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl

384
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,160
on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.

385
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,880
Which Scare do you use?

386
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
Shouldn't I go up on the...

387
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
Which Scare do you use?

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,520
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

389
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Demonstrate.

390
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
- Stop. Thank you.
- But I didn't get to...

391
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
I've seen enough.

392
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

393
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,880
I wasn't finished.

394
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,280
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

395
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
That "stuff" would've informed you

396
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,000
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

397
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,440
So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
it would make him cry,

398
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,360
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

399
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,040
destroying life as we know it,

400
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
and of course we can't have that.

401
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,120
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

402
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,720
in the Scaring program. Good day.

403
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,920
Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan.

404
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,680
Well then, I'm sure your family

405
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,720
will be very disappointed.

406
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,440
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

407
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
that cannot be taught.

408
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,120
You're not scary.

409
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,320
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

410
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

411
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,760
Surprise me? I doubt that very much.

412
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,040
<i>Welcome back.</i>

413
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,880
<i>I hope everyone had a pleasant break.</i>

414
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,600
Some say that a career
as a scream-can designer is boring,

415
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,440
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

416
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Open your textbooks to chapter three.

417
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,200
We will now plunge into the rich history

418
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
of scream-can design.

419
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,880
Out of my way!

420
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,920
Coming through! Sorry.

421
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,480
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

422
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,240
<i>The Scare Games! Yeah!</i>

423
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,400
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

424
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,520
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

425
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

426
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,880
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

427
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,520
<i>As a student, I created these games</i>

428
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,280
<i>as a friendly competition,</i>

429
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,000
<i>but be prepared.</i>

430
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,520
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

431
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,000
<i>you must be the most fearsome
monsters on campus.</i>

432
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,160
<i>So good luck,
and may the best monsters win.</i>

433
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,520
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

434
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,880
<i>We're closing down sign-ups,
so we'll see you all...</i>

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Wait!

436
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,280
I'm signing up!

437
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
What?

438
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>You have to be
in a fraternity to compete.</i>

439
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,000
Behold the next winning fraternity
of the Scare Games,

440
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,760
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

441
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,880
Hi.

442
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,960
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?

443
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,680
You just said the winners are the most
fearsome monsters on campus.

444
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
If I win, it means
you kicked out the best Scarer

445
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,920
in the whole school.

446
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,120
That won't happen.

447
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,120
How about a little wager?

448
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,640
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

449
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,640
And what would that prove?

450
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
That you were wrong.

451
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Very well.

452
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,200
If you win, I will let your entire team

453
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,800
into the Scare program.

454
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,960
But if you lose,

455
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,480
you will leave Monsters University.

456
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,760
Deal.

457
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,400
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

458
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
We need six guys, right?

459
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

460
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,200
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

461
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,920
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

462
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late.

463
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,640
- Can I squeeze by you?
- Randy!

464
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,480
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

465
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,360
Sorry. I'm already on a team.

466
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Boggs.

467
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.

468
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,440
Don't blow this for me.

469
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,080
Do the thing.

470
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,360
Where did he go?

471
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Please, anybody.

472
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,920
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

473
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,000
<i>Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.</i>

474
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,560
<i>We have to move on.
Your team doesn't qualify.</i>

475
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes, it does!

476
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,360
The star player has just arrived.

477
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,480
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

478
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?</i>

479
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
Come on! Let's go!

480
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,240
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.

481
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,880
Good luck.

482
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,440
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?

483
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,600
This is a fraternity house?

484
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,400
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!

485
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,440
As the president of Oozma Kappa,

486
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,240
it is my honor to welcome you
to your new home.

487
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,800
We call this room "Party Central."

488
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,240
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

489
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,680
But when we do, we'll be ready!

490
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,440
The hot cocoa train
is coming through!

491
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,360
Next stop... You!

492
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
I would like to start us off first by...

493
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,880
So, you guys are Scaring majors?

494
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
We were!
None of us lasted very long.

495
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,720
I guess we just weren't what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

496
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,680
Don Carlton, mature student.

497
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Thirty years in the textile industry

498
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,280
and then old dandy Don got downsized.

499
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,200
Figured I could throw
myself a pity party,

500
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,320
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

501
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...

502
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,360
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

503
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,600
And I'm not.

504
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,600
Five, six, seven, eight!

505
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,080
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

506
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,960
Because we never agreed to do this!

507
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,780
- You said this was going to be cool!
- No one said this was gonna be cool.

508
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,100
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- Now you're embarrassed?

509
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,540
Yes, because it's in front of people!

510
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,960
You should wake up embarrassed.

511
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,160
Hey, hey, hey!

512
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,480
I'm Art! New Age philosophy major.

513
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,800
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

514
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
and cry with you.

515
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

516
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,440
Guess that leaves me.

517
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,000
My name's Scott Squibbles.

518
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,640
My friends call me Squishy.

519
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
I'm undeclared, unattached,

520
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,640
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

521
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,380
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

522
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,000
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

523
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,080
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!

524
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,640
You're about the scariest fella
I've ever seen.

525
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Even with them pink polka dots.

526
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,480
Thanks.

527
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

528
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,360
Your hands are as big as my face!

529
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,920
He's like a mountain with fur!

530
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Come on. I don't even work out.

531
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,840
- Yeah, me neither.
- I don't want to get too big.

532
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,680
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win,

533
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,440
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.

534
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,360
We're going to be real Scarers!

535
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,320
- The best!
- You betcha!

536
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,040
Yeah! Right.

537
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,880
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

538
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,120
Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom.

539
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,360
Great! We're sharing this room?

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,160
We'll let you guys get settled.

541
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,680
Anything you need,
you just give a big holler-oonie!

542
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,680
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

543
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,580
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.

544
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,720
Really? And who's going to carry you?

545
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,620
Hey, if you want to go back
to can design,

546
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,880
you know where the door is.

547
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,800
Great.

548
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,280
Guys?

549
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,600
Anybody home?

550
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
Hello?

551
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,200
Fellas?

552
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,040
Do you pledge your souls

553
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,920
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

554
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,440
Do you swear to

555
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,720
- keep secret...
- ...all that you learn here?

556
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,600
No matter how horrifying?

557
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
Hey!

558
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,240
Will you take the sacred oath
of the...

559
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
- For crying out loud.
- Sweetie!

560
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,280
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

561
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,840
You're going to ruin your eyes!

562
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,840
Mom! We're doing an initiation!

563
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,000
Scary. Well, carry on.

564
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,040
Just pretend I'm not here.

565
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,240
This is my mom's house.

566
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

567
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,440
no matter what the peril?

568
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,840
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

569
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,320
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

570
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
From evils both great and small?

571
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,320
In the face of unending pain and...

572
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,840
Forget it! You're in.

573
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
Look, we know
we're no one's first choice

574
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
for a fraternity,

575
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,560
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

576
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,520
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

577
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,400
- Time for a celebration!
- Yeah!

578
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,400
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen,

579
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,160
because we're building a fort!

580
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,800
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?

581
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,480
I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

582
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,360
Yuck!

583
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,280
- Mom! What are you doing?
- Your grubby paw was in my bed!

584
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,680
Were you kissing my hand?

585
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,700
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

586
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,160
- I don't shed.
- Really.

587
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,860
- Excuse me.
- I just want to get my stuff.

588
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,980
- Would you just...
- Hey. Come on!

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,360
...let me get my stuff!

590
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
First morning in the house.

591
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
That's going in the album!

592
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,120
- Guys! We got a letter!
- A letter?

593
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
We never get mail.

594
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,080
- Sorry. It's stuck.
- Would you... Give me that!

595
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,920
Tentacles. They're sticky.

596
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,720
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

597
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
"A child's room is where you scare,"

598
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
"but avoid the toxicity lurking there."

599
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,880
Wait a minute.
Where do they want us to meet?

600
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,840
Of all the sewers on campus,
this one has always been my favorite.

601
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,320
Art, you've been here before?

602
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,440
I have a life outside of the house,
you know.

603
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,240
Welcome to your worst nightmare,

604
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
the Scare Games!

605
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
Scare Games! Scare Games!

606
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,360
Yes! Yes, I love it!

607
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
I love this energy!

608
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,800
Okay. Okay, everybody.

609
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,440
Let's hear it
for the frats and sororities

610
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,840
competing in this year's games...

611
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,840
Jaws Theta Chi!

612
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,000
Python Nu Kappa!

613
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,440
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

614
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
Roar Omega Roar!

615
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
Eta Hiss Hiss!

616
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,600
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

617
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,480
Yay!

618
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,280
Hi, Mom!

619
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,040
Smile!

620
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,980
Let's begin the first competition,

621
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,480
the Toxicity Challenge!

622
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,320
Human children are toxic!

623
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,640
And anything they touch is toxic.

624
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
We don't have any human toys,

625
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,560
but thanks to MU's biology department,

626
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,480
we found a close second,

627
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,560
the stinging glow urchin!

628
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Trust me when I say,

629
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,280
you are not gonna
want to touch this bad boy!

630
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,640
I want to touch it.

631
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

632
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,480
Yeah, I want to touch them.

633
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,480
This is the starting line.

634
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,840
The light at the end of the tunnel
is the finish line.

635
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,000
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.

636
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,480
- Mike...
- What is it?

637
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,020
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?

638
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,400
- Don't worry, Smoothie.
- Squishy!

639
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,000
Squishy. We're not going to lose,

640
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,760
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

641
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Heart.

642
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,520
No! Me. I'm going
to win the race for us.

643
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
All right, all right.
That's very cute,

644
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
but move, move, move.
I'm going to win this.

645
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,800
It's an obstacle course.
What are you going to do? Roar at it?

646
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,720
I can get through
faster than you, little guy.

647
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
Take your place at the starting line!

648
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,840
This is all about teamwork.

649
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,400
Everybody, stick together.

650
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,560
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

651
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,080
Get ready to eat my dust.

652
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,880
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

653
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,600
Attention, teams. One last thing.

654
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,480
Scarers work in the dark.

655
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
- I want to go home!
- On your marks...

656
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,800
Hey, good luck, ladies.

657
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,600
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

658
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,800
What?

659
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
Get set...

660
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,480
Go!

661
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,920
I'm going to touch them!

662
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
Come on!

663
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,560
Guys!
We're falling behind a little! Fellas!

664
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,080
Cheese and crackers!

665
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,480
Son of a moustache!

666
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

667
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,200
Is that as fast as you can go?

668
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,920
- Just getting started!
- What the...

669
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,720
That's got to hurt!

670
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,280
Terry!

671
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,120
Don't worry, we'll be fi...

672
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,720
Yikes!

673
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,920
Roar Omega Roar wins!

674
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,600
Take that, Wazowski!

675
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,760
Are you delirious? I beat you!

676
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,120
Get your eye checked!

677
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,760
- Way to blow it, Oozmas!
- Hey! Second place ain't bad.

678
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,520
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

679
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
What?

680
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,360
Your whole team
has to cross the finish line.

681
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,720
Third place, EEKs!

682
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,280
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

683
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,680
- Fifth place, HSS!
- No, no, no!

684
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,000
And in last place,

685
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,680
Oozma Kappa.

686
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,360
I can't feel my anything.

687
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,760
Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

688
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,640
No.

689
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,760
Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski.

690
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,480
It would have taken a miracle
for you to...

691
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,800
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

692
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,800
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.

693
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,480
The use of illegal protective gel
is cause for elimination.

694
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,800
What!

695
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,880
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

696
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,880
It's a miracle!

697
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,240
Your luck will run out, eventually.

698
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,400
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

699
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,320
Okay! Listen up, Oozmas.

700
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,140
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

701
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,440
so that means I'm going to need

702
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,160
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

703
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,440
- Mike?
- What is it?

704
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,840
We've made a list of
our strengths and weaknesses.

705
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,080
In high school, I was
the master of the silent scare.

706
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,200
I could sneak up on a field mouse

707
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,600
in a pillow factory.

708
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,960
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

709
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
My gosh, that's terrible.

710
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,040
We're experts in the ancient craft
of close-up magic.

711
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,960
It's all about misdirection.

712
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,120
I have an extra toe.

713
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,360
Not with me, of course.

714
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,800
Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
and we're goners.

715
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,000
So for this to work,

716
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,720
I'm gonna need you
to take every instinct you have

717
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,320
and bury it deep, deep down.

718
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
- Done.
- From now on, we are of one mind.

719
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
My mind.

720
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Please.

721
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,280
I will tell you exactly what to do,
and how to do it.

722
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,400
Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.

723
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,000
All right. Give me scary steps.

724
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,960
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!

725
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,720
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

726
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,560
We can't just "get a new team"!

727
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

728
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,620
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

729
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,240
No, no. We are not cheating.

730
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
It's not cheating. I'm just, you know,

731
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,120
leveling the playing field.

732
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,460
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

733
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,520
They're not exactly
the scariest group in the world.

734
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,760
A ladybug!
Make a wish! Make a wish!

735
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,080
This is not going to work.

736
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,800
Where are you going? We're training.

737
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
I'm a Sullivan.

738
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,080
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

739
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,480
You're charging ahead when you...

740
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Bup, bup, bup!

741
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,840
You tell them what to do but not me.

742
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,560
So long, Coach.

743
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,920
Okay, Oozmas...

744
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,920
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

745
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,600
Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming,
they'll call Mom or Dad",

746
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,720
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

747
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,180
In the next event,
if even one of us gets caught,

748
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
we're all out.

749
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,520
So remember, do exactly what I do.

750
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,400
We are at
the halfway point of the second event,

751
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,320
and things are getting interesting.

752
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,240
Got it.

753
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,560
Only two teams left.

754
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,000
Who will make it out with their flag,

755
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,640
and who will be eliminated?

756
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,720
In a real Scare,

757
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,400
you do not want to get caught
by a kid's parent.

758
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,600
And in this event,
you do not want to get caught by

759
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,200
the librarian.

760
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,080
Quiet.

761
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
What's so scary
about a little old librarian?

762
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,200
I said, "Quiet."

763
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,480
- Faster.
- Slow and steady.

764
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,360
- Slow and steady.
- Slow and steady.

765
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,480
Slow and steady.

766
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,240
Slow and steady.

767
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
- Sullivan!
- Sullivan!

768
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,920
- Sullivan!
- Sullivan!

769
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,120
No!

770
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,960
Five, six, seven, eight!

771
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,160
Look over here!

772
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
- Is that legal?
- You better believe it, mop top!

773
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,080
The only rule is don't get caught.

774
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,280
Hey! Over here!

775
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,400
- Come and get me!
- Come and get me!

776
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,520
Guys, what are you doing?

777
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,860
They said don't let her catch you.

778
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,400
But they didn't say how!

779
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,080
Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on!

780
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
We did it!

781
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,200
No, we didn't. We forgot the flag!

782
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,720
Mike?

783
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,760
- Way to go, Squishy!
- Way to go, Squishy!

784
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,080
How?

785
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,160
Misdirection.

786
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
The EEKs have been eliminated

787
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,640
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

788
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,040
We're OK! We're OK! We're OK!

789
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,960
I've never felt so alive!

790
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,160
We were awesome!

791
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,440
Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring.

792
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,160
It was better than what you did.

793
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,600
You should've stuck to my strategy.

794
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,920
Whatever.

795
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,680
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

796
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,600
Hey! You guys going to the party?

797
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,760
I think you've got the wrong guys.

798
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,800
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

799
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,680
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.

800
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,760
It's for the top Scare Teams.

801
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,960
You're one of us now, right?

802
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,520
See you there!

803
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
- Did you hear that?
- I can't believe it!

804
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,720
- Bad idea.
- This is great.

805
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,640
They're finally seeing us
as real Scarers. We're going!

806
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,560
Do young people still dance?

807
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,400
Because my moves are a little rusty.

808
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,280
We forgot to bring a hostess gift.

809
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,320
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.

810
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,880
Calm down. We earned this.

811
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,960
What if there's
a lull in the conversation?

812
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
I never know what to... You know...

813
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
Say?

814
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,880
How are you so good at this?

815
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

816
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,080
and you're afraid of a little party?

817
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,360
Take a deep breath...

818
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,840
and in you go!

819
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,560
Hello.

820
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,440
- It's Oozma Kappa!
- These guys are crazy!

821
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,680
What you did today was insane!

822
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,920
That was awesome!

823
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,080
Oozma Kappa,
tonight we party like Scarers!

824
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,360
I've never stayed
up this late in my life!

825
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,960
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

826
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,240
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.

827
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,720
All right. On behalf of the RORs,

828
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,400
we'd like to congratulate all the teams
that have made it this far.

829
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,800
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!

830
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,000
I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS!

831
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,720
Very creepy.

832
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,040
And finally, the surprise team
of the Scare Games,

833
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,920
Oozma Kappa!

834
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,480
Come on over, guys.

835
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,880
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

836
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,400
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.

837
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,680
But, boy, was I wrong.

838
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,040
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

839
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,240
Oozma Kappa!

840
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,120
What?

841
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,360
The most adorable monsters
on campus.

842
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,200
Release the stuffed animals.

843
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,320
Faced!

844
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,360
Don't worry.
Nobody reads the school paper.

845
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,960
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
they read the quad.

846
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,000
Thank you very much.

847
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,700
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

848
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,960
Thanks. Tell your friends.

849
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,560
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

850
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,040
Raising a little money for charity.

851
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,400
Yeah? Well, stop it.

852
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,100
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.

853
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,480
This guy hates charity!

854
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,560
I want you to stop making us
look like fools.

855
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,480
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

856
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,320
Let's be honest, boys.

857
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,360
You're never going to be real Scarers,

858
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,240
because real Scarers look like us.

859
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,600
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

860
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,840
they're always hiring in the mailroom.

861
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,920
Guys, hold on!

862
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,200
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

863
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,960
We just need to keep trying.

864
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,200
No, you need to stop trying!

865
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,640
You can train monsters like this
all you want,

866
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,240
but you can't change who they are.

867
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Mike...

868
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,400
We appreciate everything you've done,
but he's right.

869
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,040
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

870
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,000
We're built

871
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,160
for other things.

872
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Sorry, squirt!

873
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,920
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

874
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,080
The big leagues.

875
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,840
Guys.

876
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,480
We're going on a little field trip.

877
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,480
My tentacle fell asleep.

878
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,480
- Thanks, Mom.
- Have fun, kids!

879
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,280
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.

880
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,600
Hey, where are we?

881
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,000
The big leagues.

882
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,920
Holy roly-poly.

883
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,680
Nice fence.

884
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,600
This is amazing, Mike.

885
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,440
We're not stopping here.

886
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,680
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

887
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,400
<i>All Scare Floors now active.</i>

888
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,240
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

889
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Look at them.

890
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,920
They're going into the human world,

891
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
and they don't even look scared!

892
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,960
Take a good look, fellas.

893
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,920
See what they all have in common?

894
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,160
No, not really.

895
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,680
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.

896
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,000
The best Scarers use their differences
to their advantage.

897
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,920
Terri? Look.

898
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,840
Hey!

899
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,680
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

900
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,960
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

901
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,440
What? Where? That's really him?

902
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,760
He held the Scare Record
for three years!

903
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,920
Third door from the end!

904
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,360
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

905
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,600
Look!
It's "Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

906
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,600
- I still have his rookie card.
- Me, too!

907
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,060
Doesn't have the speed anymore,
but his

908
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,440
- technique is flawless.
- Technique is flawless.

909
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,400
You collected Scare Cards?

910
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,240
450 of them.

911
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,120
Impressive.
I have 6,000 still in mint condition,

912
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,760
but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too.

913
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,120
Hey, look at me!
I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

914
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,880
That's great!

915
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,520
That's a pretty good one, Squish.

916
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,800
I've been a real jerk.

917
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,520
So have I.

918
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,880
But it's not too late.

919
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,120
We could be a great team.

920
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,280
We just need to start working together.

921
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,800
Hey!

922
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,920
What are you doing up there?

923
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,760
I can't go back to jail!

924
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Come on!

925
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,560
They're right behind us!

926
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,680
Get back here!

927
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,600
Up there! Get them!

928
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,240
- Thanks, brother!
- Don't mention it.

929
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,200
I'm fine, really!
It's just a little heart attack.

930
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,680
I want a piece of that action!

931
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,040
Mom! Start the car!

932
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,400
- What?
- Start the car!

933
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,800
Stop the bar?

934
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,000
The car! Start the car!

935
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,400
Okay.

936
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,960
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

937
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Get in! Get in!

938
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,320
- Mom, go!
- Seatbelts.

939
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,560
- Okay, go!
- Does anyone want gum?

940
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,640
Just drive!

941
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,600
Okay. Here we go!

942
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,560
Yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

943
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,600
Rise and shine!

944
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,840
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

945
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,800
Scary feet, scary feet...
He's back!

946
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,760
Wake up!

947
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,800
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

948
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,360
Do I hear thirty-nine?

949
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,720
Come on!

950
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,640
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

951
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,200
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare."

952
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,040
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

953
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,880
Okay, scare the little kid.

954
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,880
Avoid the teenager!

955
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,560
I'm on the phone!

956
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,920
No one understands me!

957
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Whatever.

958
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,720
But, Daddy, I love him!

959
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,240
<i>First place, Roar Omega Roar!</i>

960
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,280
<i>Second place, Oozma Kappa!</i>

961
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,200
<i>Third place, HSS.</i>

962
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,520
You're lame.

963
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,420
"Someone is coming,
this could ruin your night."

964
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,720
"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"

965
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,160
You got 10 seconds. Go!

966
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

967
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,560
And there should be one more.

968
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,560
How did I do?

969
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,360
Not too shabby, Don!

970
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,840
Thanks! I cannot get down.

971
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,600
Zombie snarl!

972
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,640
Angry poodle. Jazz clown.

973
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,880
My Aunt Phyllis.

974
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
In the morning.

975
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,280
That's what I'm talking about!

976
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,800
Time to go to work.

977
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,360
You're out!

978
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,080
You're out.

979
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

980
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,080
Thank you.

981
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,920
Yeah!

982
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,680
Yeah!

983
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,900
<i>We're down to two remaining teams,</i>

984
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,040
<i>Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Kappa!</i>

985
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,200
Which leads us to the final event!

986
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,200
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test."

987
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,600
"The Scare Simulator will prove
who's the best!"

988
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,760
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare

989
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,000
in front of the whole school!

990
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,600
Enjoy the attention while it lasts,
boys.

991
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,480
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

992
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,760
Maybe. But when you lose,
no one will let you forget it.

993
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,120
Boy. That is a good point.

994
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,720
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!

995
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,760
You've got to teach us your moves.

996
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,480
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

997
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Sure, I can teach you.

998
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,540
All right. You want to hide
behind the chair?

999
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,720
You have to become the chair.

1000
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,520
Thanks for coming, Dean.

1001
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,200
Dean Hardscrabble!

1002
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,880
If we get back into the Scaring program,

1003
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,280
I hope there's no hard feelings.

1004
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,520
Tomorrow, each of you must prove

1005
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,040
that you are undeniably scary.

1006
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,760
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

1007
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,080
No. He works harder than anyone.

1008
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,480
Do you think he's scary?

1009
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,160
He's the heart and soul of the team!

1010
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,400
Do you think he's scary?

1011
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,960
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

1012
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,680
We'll finally have our
lives back on track.

1013
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,760
Hey, Mike?

1014
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,040
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

1015
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,640
I'd love to return the favor sometime.

1016
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,360
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

1017
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,920
- We're doing this now?
- Okay.

1018
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,720
You've memorized every textbook,

1019
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,720
every Scare Theory, and that is great.

1020
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,120
Hey!

1021
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,960
But now it's time to forget all that.

1022
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,040
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1023
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,960
Just feel it.

1024
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,520
Exactly. Go wild.

1025
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,960
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

1026
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,400
Give it a try.

1027
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,880
Good, but bigger!

1028
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,120
Nope. You're thinking again.

1029
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,960
From the gut!

1030
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,360
Let the animal out!

1031
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,640
Come on! Dig deep!

1032
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,800
Boys! It's a school night!

1033
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,840
So, how was that?

1034
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,400
Up top.

1035
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,880
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.

1036
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,880
Yup, this time tomorrow
the whole school is finally going to see

1037
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,800
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1038
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,440
You're darn right.

01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,440
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1058
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,640
and I think it's only right
if he's the one who finishes it.

1059
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,520
I think you should go last.

1060
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,960
Yes!

1061
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,080
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

1062
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,920
All right. Don, you okay going first?

1063
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,160
I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1064
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,720
Oozma Kappa!

1065
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,480
Go Oozmas!

1066
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,320
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to beat this guy.

1067
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,480
Hey, Bruiser!
You take it easy on grandpa.

1068
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,920
Unleash the beast, Don!

1069
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,960
Okay, then.

1070
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,560
Thanks for taking it easy on grandpa.

1071
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,440
<i>Next group to the starting line.</i>

1072
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,720
Let's do this.

1073
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,760
Yes! Yeah!

1074
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,660
- Come on, Art.
- Come on, buddy.

1075
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,840
You can do it.

1076
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,800
Yes!

1077
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,000
<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

1078
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,160
You got this, Sull.

1079
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,920
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

1080
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,040
<i>Tough break for the RORs.</i>

1081
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Hearts?

1082
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,840
Way to go, Boggs!

1083
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,760
Yay!

1084
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,920
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.

1085
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,280
<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

1086
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
Hey.

1087
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,120
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

1088
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,520
Don't worry about anyone else.

1089
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,400
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1090
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,040
Thanks.

1091
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,960
Don't take the loss too hard.

1092
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,880
You never belonged here anyway.

1093
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,000
<i>Amazing
performance by Worthington!</i>

1094
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,920
- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!

1095
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,120
<i>The Oozmas
will need a record-breaking</i>

1096
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,040
<i>Scare to win this.</i>

1097
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,840
<i>You don't belong on a Scare Floor.</i>

1098
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:09,920
<i>No one will remember you.</i>

1099
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,560
<i>You're not scary.</i>

1100
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,160
<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

1101
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,960
Yeah!

1102
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,960
<i>They did it!</i>

1103
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,200
Yeah! Hey!

1104
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,760
We're in the Scare program! Yeah!

1105
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,720
Come here, you son of a gun!

1106
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,360
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

1107
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,040
A little stuck.

1108
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,720
Pardon me there, Ms. Squibbles.

1109
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,080
It's Sherrie.

1110
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,880
We did it!

1111
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,400
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

1112
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,640
- Thank you!
- Thanks a lot.

1113
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,520
- You rule!
- I have never ruled before.

1114
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,600
You guys killed it out there!

1115
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,720
Awesome!

1116
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,520
Hey, Wazowski!

1117
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,080
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.

1118
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,360
Mike?

1119
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,120
I did it.

1120
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,840
I can't believe it.

1121
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,080
I'm going to be a Scarer!

1122
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,840
Yeah, yes, you are.

1123
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,240
You hear that? Get plenty of rest,
kiddo.

1124
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,200
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

1125
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,840
I knew I was scary.
I didn't know I was that scary.

1126
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,560
Yeah, we're so scary
I guess we broke it.

1127
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,920
Come on.

1128
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,800
It's been tampered with.

1129
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,680
I don't think you should be
messing with that.

1130
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,200
Why are my settings different?

1131
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,800
Mike, we should leave.

1132
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,640
- Did you do this?
- Mike.

1133
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,040
Did you do this?

1134
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,680
I...

1135
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,040
Yes, I did. But you don't understand.

1136
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,040
Why? Why did you do this?

1137
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,480
You know, just in case.

1138
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,960
In case of what?

1139
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,080
You don't think I'm scary.

1140
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,840
- Mike...
- You said you believed in me.

1141
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,520
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!

1142
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,940
Look, you'll get better and better...

1143
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,400
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

1144
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,200
- I just wanted to help.
- No.

1145
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,800
You just wanted to help yourself.

1146
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,220
Well, what was I supposed to do?

1147
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,480
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1148
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,440
So your calculations were a little off.

1149
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,200
That door took me all semester.

1150
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,160
It's too dangerous.
The professor's just going to shred it.

1151
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,920
There he is, the big guy.

1152
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,400
The first of many trophies, I am sure.

1153
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,240
Sullivan.

1154
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,280
Nice work out there.

1155
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,760
I look forward to having you
back in class.

1156
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,280
Hey, there he is!

1157
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,760
Looks like I was wrong about you.

1158
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,160
You're one of us after all.

1159
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,240
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

1160
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,360
You are one of us now, okay?

1161
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,800
Anytime you want to come hang out
and do whatever, you got a crew.

1162
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,920
You're a ROR, buddy!

1163
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Hey!

1164
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,840
Where are you going?

1165
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,200
You did what?

1166
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,240
My team had nothing to do with it.

1167
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,080
It was all me. I cheated.

1168
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,240
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.

1169
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,880
Yes, ma'am.

1170
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,080
You're a disgrace to this university

1171
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,440
and your family name.

1172
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,720
What's going on?

1173
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,200
Someone broke into the door lab!

1174
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,560
What?

1175
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,720
No.

1176
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,960
Open the door! Don't go in there!

1177
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,440
You look funny.

1178
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
What?

1179
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I'm so tired. What's going on?

1180
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,440
It's the middle of the night.

1181
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,520
A little funny green guy.

1182
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,560
I want to touch it! It's so cute!

1183
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,240
James!

1184
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,480
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1185
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,900
You don't think that could be...

1186
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,000
- It's Mike.
- But he could die out there!

1187
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,640
James, wait! We can help.

1188
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,240
Leave it to the old master of sales.

1189
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,340
We got a call in,
but that's the best we can do.

1190
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,360
Ahem!

1191
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,960
Don Carlton, sales.
Folks, today is your lucky day.

1192
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,960
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1193
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,480
- Arrest him.
- Pardon?

1194
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,680
Spread them, pops!

1195
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,400
- Do you mind?
- Don't move!

1196
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,520
What? Sullivan!

1197
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,960
Don't you dare!

1198
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,960
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1199
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,720
Mike?

1200
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,480
Mike!

1201
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,640
The kids said
they saw something in the cabin.

1202
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,960
- They're calling it an alien.
- It was!

1203
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,400
I saw a little green guy!

1204
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,880
What's the problem, ma'am?

1205
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,600
Mike?

1206
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,640
Bear! A bear in the camp!

1207
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,320
Down this way. All right?

1208
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,040
I heard something over here!

1209
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,640
Mike!

1210
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,240
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

1211
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,280
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

1212
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,560
You were right.
They weren't scared of me.

1213
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,320
I did everything right.

1214
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,480
I wanted it more than anyone.

1215
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,280
And I thought...
I thought if I wanted it enough,

1216
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,120
I could show everybody that...

1217
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,760
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

1218
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,680
And I'm just

1219
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,600
not.

1220
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Look, Mike, I know how you feel.

1221
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,080
Don't do that! Please, don't do that!

1222
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,720
- You do not know how I feel.
- Mike, calm down.

1223
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,340
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1224
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,640
You can mess up over and over again

1225
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,340
- and the whole world loves you.
- Mike...

1226
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,780
You'll never know what it's like to fail

1227
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,880
because you were born a Sullivan!

1228
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,080
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.

1229
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,040
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.

1230
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,760
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

1231
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,960
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1232
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,320
that I cheated.

1233
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,800
And I lied.

1234
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,640
Mike, I'll never know how you feel,

1235
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
but you're not the only failure here.

1236
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,040
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time

1237
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm terrified.

1238
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,240
How come you never
told me that before?

1239
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,280
Because

1240
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
we weren't friends before.

1241
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,800
Check the lake!

1242
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,320
I heard something here!

1243
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,320
This way!

1244
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,640
I saw movement!

1245
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,200
Over there!

1246
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,880
Sulley!

1247
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,880
He's cornered!

1248
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,240
No!

1249
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,120
They're still in there!

1250
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,120
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1251
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,840
No! You can't do that! No!

1252
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,600
Enough! I want this room cleared now!

1253
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,240
You can't do this!

1254
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,280
We got to get out of here!

1255
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,920
- Let them come.
- What?

1256
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,040
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

1257
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,920
we could generate enough scream
to power the door from this side!

1258
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,300
What are you talking about?

1259
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,100
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

1260
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,120
This could work!

1261
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,760
They're adults. I can't do this.

1262
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,440
Yes, you can. Just follow my lead.

1263
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,640
<i>Mama!</i>

1264
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,320
<i>Mama!</i>

1265
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,800
<i>Mama...</i>

1266
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,320
What the...

1267
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,280
- Now what?
- Phase two.

1268
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,240
Keep together.

1269
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,200
Are you ready?

1270
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,120
- Mike, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1271
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,200
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1272
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,080
Call for backup.

1273
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,520
Assistance on the north side.

1274
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,040
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1275
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,920
<i>Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?</i>

1276
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,520
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1277
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,880
Look! What was it?

1278
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,200
Let's go.

1279
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Sulley, come on!

1280
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,040
How?

1281
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,920
How did you do this?

1282
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,280
Don't ask me.

1283
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,280
Move, move, move!
This is a 54-23 in progress.

1284
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,680
All right, everybody, clear out.

1285
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,360
Secure the perimeter.

1286
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,520
- No child breach.
- No child breach.

1287
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,280
You ruined our doors!

1288
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,680
I've been working on my door
all semester!

1289
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,760
Let's go, you two.

1290
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,160
- You're alive!
- We are so glad you're safe.

1291
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Hey, wait!

1292
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,100
What's going to happen to them?

1293
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,280
That's for the university
president to decide.

1294
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,880
But you can be sure
we'll be watching these two.

1295
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,960
Always watching.

1296
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,360
- Expelled?
- Yeah, we really messed up.

1297
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,040
So, you're leaving?

1298
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,680
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1299
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,000
Harsh, man.

1300
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,760
I'm sorry, guys.
You'd be in the Scaring program

1301
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,040
right now if it wasn't for us.

1302
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,080
What?

1303
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,600
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1304
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,720
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1305
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,880
What?

1306
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,080
She was impressed with
our performance in the games.

1307
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,160
She invited us to join next semester!

1308
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,760
Congratulations, guys!

1309
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,240
And that's not the only piece
of good news.

1310
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,040
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1311
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,520
Who is Sherrie?

1312
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,640
She's my mom.

1313
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,640
Well,
if it isn't my two favorite fellas!

1314
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,280
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1315
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,760
So uncomfortable.

1316
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,240
Come on, Scott.

1317
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,360
I don't want you to think of me
as your new dad.

1318
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,600
After all,
we're fraternity brothers first.

1319
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,720
This is so weird.

1320
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,560
Just think of me
as your big brother

1321
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,120
that's marrying your mother.

1322
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,280
Wait. Hold on.

1323
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,600
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1324
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,680
That's worse.

1325
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,320
Well, I guess we should be going now.

1326
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,360
Promise me you'll keep in touch.

1327
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,680
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1328
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,040
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1329
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,080
So, what now?

1330
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,160
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.

1331
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,560
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1332
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,400
I think it's time I leave the greatness
to other monsters.

1333
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,160
I'm okay just being okay.

1334
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,720
So long, Sull.

1335
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,200
So long.

1336
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,520
Wazowski!

1337
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,040
Stop the bus!

1338
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,360
Are you crazy?

1339
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,480
Mike,

1340
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,920
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1341
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,240
I know, everyone sees us together,

1342
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,840
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,

1343
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,800
I've been riding your coattails
since day one!

1344
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,840
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.

1345
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,600
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1346
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,160
All I did was catch a pig!

1347
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,800
Technically, I caught the pig.

1348
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,120
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?

1349
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,640
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1350
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,800
- That wasn't me!
- That was you!

1351
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,000
You think I could have done that
without you?

1352
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,440
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1353
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,440
Mike,
you're not scary. Not even a little.

1354
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,960
But you are fearless.

1355
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,680
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...

1356
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,880
I can just what?

1357
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,960
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1358
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,880
Sorry.

1359
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,840
Well, gentlemen,

1360
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,600
it seems you made the front page again.

1361
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,240
The two of you did something together

1362
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,680
that no one has ever done before.

1363
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,240
You surprised me.

1364
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,320
Perhaps I should keep an eye out
for more surprises

1365
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,920
like you in my program.

1366
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,840
But as far as the two of you
are concerned

1367
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,920
there is nothing I can do for you now.

1368
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,320
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1369
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,880
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1370
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,760
You know, there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.

1371
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,440
They're always hiring in the mailroom.

1372
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,640
This is better than I ever imagined!

1373
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,400
I bet we break the all-time record
in our first year.

1374
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,920
Mike, we're mail guys.

1375
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,200
I know. I'm talking about
the record for letters delivered!

1376
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,160
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.

1377
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,800
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1378
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,840
- punishable by banishment!
- Yes, sir.

1379
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,520
We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.

1380
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,040
The team of Wazowski and Sullivan

1381
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,240
are going to change the world
starting today!

1382
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,360
Say scream!

1383
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,480
- Scream!
- Scream!

1384
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,360
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

1385
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,480
Thanks, Merv.

1386
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,560
- Good luck, Mike!
- Thanks, fellas.

1387
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,640
You coming, Coach?

1388
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,440
You better believe it.

1389
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,880
I made it! My first day of class!

1390
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:06,880
The school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1391
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,920
Great.
