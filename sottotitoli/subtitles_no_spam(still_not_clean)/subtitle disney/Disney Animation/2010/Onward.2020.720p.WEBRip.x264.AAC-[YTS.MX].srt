Except we don't have a map.

710
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,534
But we've got this. Behold!

711
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:07,569
{\fad(250,250)}<font color="#00abfd">(SIGHS)</font>

712
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,939
Look, on a quest,
you have to use what you've got.

713
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:11,439
And this is what we've got.

714
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:14,944
Best part is,
little Kayla already solved the puzzle.

715
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:16,779
Well, according to Kayla,

716
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:19,516
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

717
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,053
Raven's Point. Raven's Point.

718
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:26,254
Yes! The gem must
be in the mountain.

719
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,757
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

720
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,758
Tomorrow morning?

721
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,028
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

722
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:34,196
{\fad(250,250)}<font color="#00abfd">(SIGHS)</font>

723
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:36,397
Yeah. Well, it looks like

724
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,401
the expressway should
take us right there.

725
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,704
Mmm. Expressway is a
little too obvious.

726
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:45,507
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

727
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:46,441
What?

728
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,877
During one <i>Quests
of Yore</i> campaign,

729
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,845
Shrub Rosehammer and
I took the easy route,

730
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:52,882
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

731
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,017
Only reason I didn't
suffer the same fate?

732
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,351
I followed my gut.

733
00:33:56,353 --> 00:34:00,355
And it's telling me we
take an ancient trail

734
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,323
called the Path of Peril.

735
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,260
{\fad(250,250)}<font color="#ca6500">IAN:</font> But the
expressway is faster.

736
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:05,627
Maybe not in the long run.

737
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,096
I know you want this to be

738
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:08,998
like one of your
adventure games,

739
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,232
but all that matters

740
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,001
is that we get to
spend as much time

741
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:13,703
as possible with Dad.

742

743
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,879
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

744
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:25,446
Yeah, you're right.

745
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,750
But if you end up inside
a gelatinous cube,

746
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,351
you are on your own.

that when their blood

A magic what?

857

"To magnify an object,

"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."

anything distract you.

You seem a little off yourself.

1133
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:19,135
Uh, actually,
if I'm being completely honest,

1134
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:20,435
I'm not super great

1135

in this kind of situation,

1136

freak out a little bit.

1137
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:27,475
And I'm all sweaty and weird,
and I don't know what to say

1138
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,912
and I just feel like I
can't do anything right,
