3
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,510
Agent Rick Dicker
interrogating.

4
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,292
State your name, please.

5
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,579
Uh, Tony.

6
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:05,431
Tony Rydinger.

7
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:09,546
Tell me about
the incident.

8
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,316
Well, there's this girl,

9
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:12,890
um, in my class.

10
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:14,467
I saw her at the track meet.

11
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,281
You're, uh, Violet, right?
That's me.

12
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,374
I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.

13
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,561
Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.

14
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,774
Cool, cute.

15
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:24,209
I asked her out
to a movie.

16
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,266
So, Friday?

17
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,352
Friday.
Friday.

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,166
And I went to watch
the track meet.

19
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:32,229
Not long after, this
thing happened in the parking lot.

20
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,706
Behold! The Underminer!

21
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:51,359
I am always beneath you,

22
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,766
but nothing is beneath me!

23
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,420
As if things aren't weird
enough,

24
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,305
I look over and I see these
boots.

25
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,796
You two, stay here.
Wait.

26
00:01:58,883 --> 00:01:59,983
Should we be doing this?

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,025
It is still illegal.

28
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,984
They looked like superheroes.

29
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:04,688
We're gonna lose him.
Oh, all right.

30
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,077
One of you patrol
the perimeter,

31
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:07,391
keep the crowds
back and safe.

32
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,538
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

33
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,626
But I thought
we were gonna

34
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,932
go with
You heard your mother.

35
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,495
Trampoline me.

36
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:18,539
I call perimeter!

37
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,686
You're not going anywhere,

38
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,354
you little
maggoty creep!

39
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,225
I see my chance
to get out of there.

40
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:24,756
But there's something

41
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,000
familiar about
one of the kids' voices.

42
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,134
The girl, she's upset

43
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:30,003
and she throws down
her mask

44
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,273
and it's her!

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,164
Oh. Tony!

46
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,219
Hi.

47
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,188
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

48
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,786
It was just getting
too freaky.

49
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:39,791
I couldn't handle it
and ran off.

50
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,483
I feel kinda bad about it.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,266
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

52
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:46,399
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

53
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:48,249
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

54
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,766
I'm pretty secure
manhood wise.

55
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:51,844
What is that?

56
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,891
Have you told anyone else about this?

57
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,514
Your parents?
No, they'd only think

58
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:56,788
I was hiding something.

59
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,898
You know what I mean?
Sure, kid.

60
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,562
I like this girl,
Mr. Dicker.

61
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,662
I'm supposed to go out with her
Friday night.

62
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,713
Now, things are just gonna
be weird.

63
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,814
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

64
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,377
You will, kid.

65
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,684
You will.

66
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,679
<font color=#FF00FF>*INCREDIBLES 2*</font>

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,407
Come on!

68
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,836
Consider yourself
undermined!

69
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:03,565
Ooh.

70
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,299
Underminer!
Oh!

71
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,287
We meet again Huh?

72
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,356
Oh, great!

73
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,841
Now,
he's on the agenda.

74
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,072
Incredible!

75
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,408
Meet Jack Hammer!

76
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,466
Buh-bye!

77
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,255
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,411
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

79
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:23,138
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

80
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,768
I can't steer it or stop it.

81
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,753
And the Underminer's escaped!

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,278
We'll have to stop it
Bob! The monorail!

83
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,943
Frozone!
Yeah!

84
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,643
We have to stop
this thing

85
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,035
before it gets
to the overpass!

86
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,294
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

87
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,638
Hey, lady!

88
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:06,399
Thank you so much,
young man!

89
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,905
What?

90
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,449
Violet!

91
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:21,083
Oh, oh. Ahh!

92
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,557
Stop!

93
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,966
Everybody, stop!

94
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:00,855
Ah, hah!

95
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,286
Heads up, Dad!
Dash!

96
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,713
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,071
Dash is watching him!
Violet,

98
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,793
here, you take him!

99
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,165
It's headed for City Hall!

100
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:27,192
Mom needs help!

101
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:34,183
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

102
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,645
Follow them,
follow Frozone!

103
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,582
Bob!
Help me with the boiler!

104
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,980
That should do it!

105
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,276
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

106
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:14,674
This thing's gonna blow!

107
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,545
There's no time!

108
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,044
We did it!

109
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,497
Freeze, Supers!

110
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,928
Oh, what did we do?

111
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,694
Excuse me,
Mr. Zone?

112
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:45,498
Sorry,
but I'm not really supposed to be here.

113
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,405
Which seems wrong

114
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,620
doesn't it?

115
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:52,334
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

116
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,637
Superheroes including Frozone,

117
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,581
Mr. Incredible,
and Elasti Girl

118
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:59,895
caused further damage
to the city.

119
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,948
The Underminer
remains at large.

120
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,777
We didn't start
this fight.

121
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:05,049
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

122
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,467
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

123
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,855
No.
Did you stop him

124
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,127
from robbing the banks?

125
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:11,924
No.
Did you catch him?

126
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,060
No.
The banks were insured.

127
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,668
We have infrastructure
in place

128
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,643
to deal
with these matters.

129
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,559
If you had simply
done nothing

130
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:19,879
everything would now be

131
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,424
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

132
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,815
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

133
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,678
Without a doubt.

134
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,031
You weren't much help.

135
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:33,196
Do you want
out of the hole?

136
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:36,168
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

137
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,154
Well, that went poorly.

138
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,035
Dad, this is probably

139
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:47,020
not the best time
to tell you about this

140
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:51,027
but something else
happened today with a kid

141
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,202
and my mask.

142
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,726
Oh, hey, Rick.

143
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:10,775
Violet thinks a friend of hers,
a kid named Tony

144
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,664
might have seen her
in the outfit,

145
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,924
without her mask.

146
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,625
Talkative type?
Don't know.

147
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,305
Last name is Rydinger.

148
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,473
Tony Rydinger.

149
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,035
I'll check it out.

150
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,720
Bob, Helen

151
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,762
a word
if you don't mind.

152
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,314
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

153
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,573
What?

154
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:32,314
Politicians don't
understand people

155
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,820
who do good simply
because it's right.

156
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,572
It makes 'em nervous.

157
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,238
They've been gunning for Supers
for years.

158
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,723
Today was all they needed.

159
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:43,315
Anyway

160
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:44,862
I'm done.

161
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,063
I'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel

162
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,715
is the best
I can do for ya.

163
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,986
It ain't much.

164
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,146
You've done plenty, Rick.

165
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,550
We won't forget.

166
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,939
Well, it has been
a great honor

167
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,461
working with
you good people.

168
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,969
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

169
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:01,285
Yeah.
You, too.

170
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,535
Did you wash your hands?

171
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,460
With soap?

172
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,613
Did you dry them?

173
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,619
What?
Is this all vegetables?

174
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:33,353
Who ordered all vegetables?

175
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,524
I did. They're good
and you're going to have some.

176
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,103
Are we going
to talk about it?

177
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,556
What?
The elephant in the room.

178
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,858
What elephant?
I guess not then.

179
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:45,266
You're referring
to today.

180
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,126
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

181
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:48,497
We all made mistakes.

182
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,595
For example,

183
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,457
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

184
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,745
Babysitting,
while you guys did the important stuff.

185
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:55,927
We talked about this.

186
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,512
You're not old enough
to decide about these things.

187
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,481
We are old enough
to help out.

188
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:00,381
Yeah!

189
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:01,951
Isn't that
what you tell us, Dad?

190
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,865
Yeah, well,
"help out" can

191
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,287
mean many different things.

192
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,473
But we're supposed to help,

193
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,802
if there's trouble. Aren't you glad
Well, yeah, but

194
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:10,224
we helped today?
Yeah, I know but

195
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:11,403
You said that you were
proud of us.

196
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,162
Well, yeah,
I was. Am!

197
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,676
We wanna fight
bad guys!

198
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:17,555
No, you don't!

199
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,848
You said things
were different now.

200
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:22,172
And they were,
on the island.

201
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,926
But I didn't mean
that from now on

202
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,817
So now, we've gotta go back
to never using our powers.

203
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,154
It defines who I am.

204
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,660
We're not saying
you have

205
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,060
What?
Someone on TV said it.

206
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:33,306
Can we just eat?

207
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:35,531
The dinner, while it's hot?

208
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,743
Did we do
something wrong?

209
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,172
Yes.
No.

210
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,514
We didn't do
anything wrong.

211
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,818
Superheroes are illegal.

212
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,794
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

213
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,341
The law should be fair.

214
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,691
What are we teaching our kids?

215
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,000
To respect the law!

216
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,645
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

217
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:54,551
If laws are unjust,
there are laws to change them!

218
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,902
Otherwise, it's chaos!

219
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:58,281
Which is exactly
what we have!

220
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,000
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

221
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,094
What was?

222
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,515
Fighting crime
as a family.

223
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:12,753
It was cool.

224
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:16,031
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

225
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,097
We have to adapt.

226
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:19,970
Are things bad?

227
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,620
Things are fine.

228
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,148
May I be excused?

229
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,838
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

230
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,773
Uh
Not much longer, honey.

231
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:42,384
What are we gonna do?

232
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:43,976
I don't know.

233
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:47,182
Maybe Dicker will find something?
Dicker is done, Bob.

234
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,680
Any thought we had about being

235
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,432
Supers again is fantasy.

236
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,180
One of us
has gotta get a job.

237
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,449
One of us?

238
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,705
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

239
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,343
Hated every minute of it.

240
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,971
I know
it was hard on you.

241
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,979
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

242
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,548
and you take care of the kids
No, I'm doing this.

243
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,504
I need to do this.

244
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,934
You know where my suit
and ties are?

245
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,190
Burned up when

246
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:11,024
The jet destroyed our house.
The jet destroyed our house.

247
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,661
Yeah.

248
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,408
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

249
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:16,525
It's just us.

250
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,426
We can't wait for

251
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:28,955
No lifeguard on duty!

252
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,502
Swim at your own risk.

253
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,180
Oh, where'd you go today?

254
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,330
I noticed
you missed all the fun.

255
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,134
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

256
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

257
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,311
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

258
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:43,012
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

259
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,575
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,301
I heard
the program shut down.

261
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,446
How much longer
are you in this motel?

262
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,566
Two weeks.

263
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,418
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

264
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:54,854
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

265
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,525
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

266
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,114
Well, door's always open.

267
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,618
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

268
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:03,268
While you guys
were being detained

269
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:06,963
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

270
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,243
Winston Deavor.
Wants to talk

271
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,576
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

272
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,649
I checked him out.

273
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:14,745
He's legit.

274
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,720
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

275
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,846
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

276
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,118
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

277
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:24,153
When?
Tonight. I'm going there now.

278
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:26,807
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

279
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:28,066
He wants
all three of us.

280
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:31,729
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

281
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:34,605
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

282
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,874
Go in our Supersuits?

283
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,089
Yeah.

284
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,945
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

285
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:43,621
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

286
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:49,013
Where are you going?

287
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,775
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

288
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,058
If Jack-Jack
wakes up

289
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,067
I know the drill.

290
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:06,011
Your security badges.

291
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,781
Please, this way.

292
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,502
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

293
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:10,610
Good to see you.

294
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:14,184
I'm your biggest fan.
Shoot!

295
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,549
I love superheroes!

296
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:42,586
The powers, the costumes

297
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:44,156
the mythic struggles.

298
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:46,344
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

299
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,932
Genuine pleasure
to meet you.

300
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,329
Frozone!
It's good to see you.

301
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,982
Elasti Girl.
Nice to meet you.

302
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:53,066
Mr. Incredible!
Hello.

303
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:55,916
Mr. Incredible,
Incredible

304
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,408
Incredible
Incredible

305
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:58,985
Catching the bad guys
Catching the bad guys

306
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,743
Pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow

307
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:03,995
Who's the cat
Who's always chill

308
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,665
When survival odds
are close to nil

309
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,918
Frozone
Frozone

310
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,138
Frozone
Frozone

311
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,739
Yeah!

312
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,502
Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this

313
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,517
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

314
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,824
is my tardy sister,

315
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,932
Evelyn.
And I'm

316
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,018
I'm scolding myself
so you don't have to, Winston!

317
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:28,324
Spectacular.

318
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,514
My father was so proud

319
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:33,260
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

320
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,961
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

321
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,002
He was
your top supporter.

322
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,691
He donated
to superhero causes.

323
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:41,791
He raised money
for the

324
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,712
Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.

325
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,736
He got to know
many Supers personally.

326
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,245
Even installed a phone

327
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,590
with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic

328
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:52,160
in case of emergencies.

329
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,745
He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.

330
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:56,074
He was heartbroken

331
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,715
when you were all forced
to go underground.

332
00:17:57,802 --> 00:17:59,032
Father believed
the world

333
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,381
would become more dangerous
without you.

334
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,679
He didn't know
how right he was.

335
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:06,935
There was a break in.

336
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,155
My father called Gazerbeam.

337
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:12,683
The direct line.

338
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,448
No answer.

339
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,512
He called Fironic, no answer.

340
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,559
Superheroes had just been
made illegal

341
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,696
The robbers discovered him
on the phone

342
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,902
and shot him.

343
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,557
So

344
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:29,453
It must've been hard.

345
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,988
Especially for Mother.

346
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:34,314
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

347
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:37,259
If superheroes had not been
forced underground

348
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:38,359
it never would've happened.

349
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,717
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

350
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:41,953
as soon as he knew
there was

351
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,436
trouble.
I disagree strongly!

352
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,199
But we're not going
into it right now.

353
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,831
The point is

354
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,462
nobody expected us

355
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,330
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

356
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:55,800
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator

357
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,376
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

358
00:18:58,463 --> 00:18:59,947
into what it is today.

359
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,828
A world class
telecommunications company.

360
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,025
Bigger than ever.

361
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,570
Perfectly positioned
to make

362
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:07,237
some wrong things right.

363
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:08,994
Hence, this meeting.

364
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,566
Let me
ask you something.

365
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,353
What is the main reason

366
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,281
you were all
forced underground?

367
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,447
Ignorance.
Perception.

368
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,796
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

369
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:20,124
Difficult situation.

370
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,548
You were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

371
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:23,801
Oh, tell me about it.

372
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,036
I can't.

373
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,597
Because I didn't see it

374
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,222
neither did anyone else.

375
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,853
So, when you fight bad
guys like today

376
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,642
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

377
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,066
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

378
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,743
They see destruction
and they see you.

379
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,252
So, if we wanna change

380
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,940
people's perceptions
about superheroes

381
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:45,036
we need you

382
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:47,739
to share your perceptions
with the world.

383
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,335
How do we do that?
With cameras.

384
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,895
We need you to share
your perceptions with the world.

385
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:55,066
How do we do that?

386
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,268
We embed tiny cameras, like those,

387
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,597
into your Supersuits.

388
00:19:58,684 --> 00:19:59,903
Wow, so small.

389
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,406
And the picture
is outstanding.

390
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,067
Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

391
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,775
We've got resources, lobbyists,

392
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,261
worldwide connections

393
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:08,567
and very important,
insurance.

394
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,801
Insurance is key.

395
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,301
All we need now
are the superest superheroes.

396
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,830
It needs you three.
Come on!

397
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,958
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

398
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:19,544
This sounds great!

399
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:21,597
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

400
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:23,754
That enthusiasm is golden.

401
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:26,222
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move

402
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,866
Well, Elasti Girl
is our best play.

403
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:32,444
Better than me?

404
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,651
I mean, she's good.

405
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,390
Really, a credit to her

406
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:39,745
You know.
You know.

407
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,015
With great respect

408
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,213
let's not test the whole

409
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,395
"insurance will pay for everything"
idea

410
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:46,890
on the first go 'round, okay?

411
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:50,083
Wait a minute.
You're saying what? I'm messy?

412
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,364
Well, Evelyn did
a cost benefit analysis

413
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,425
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

414
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:55,840
before going underground.

415
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:58,155
And Elasti Girl's numbers
are self explanatory.

416
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:00,356
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

417
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,001
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

418
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,683
Of course!
We're gonna solve

419
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,837
all kinds
of problems together.

420
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:11,476
After the perfect launch
with Elasti Girl!

421
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,400
So, what do you say?

422
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:17,241
What do I say?

423
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,837
I don't know.

424
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:21,848
What do you mean,
you don't know?

425
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:24,159
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over

426
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,333
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

427
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,393
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

428
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,739
and you don't know?

429
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,433
It's not that simple, Bob.

430
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,316
I wanna protect the kids!

431
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:34,691
So do I.

432
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:36,434
From jail, Bob!

433
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,705
And how do you do that?

434
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:39,824
By turning down a chance
to change the law

435
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,630
that forces them to hide
what they are?

436
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,108
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

437
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,653
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers

438
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,080
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

439
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,331
This will benefit them.

440
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,575
What? It's not a good time
to be away.

441
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,356
Dash is having trouble
with homework

442
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,776
Vi is worried
about her first date

443
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:57,309
with that boy she likes,
Tony

444
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:58,432
and Jack-Jack

445
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:00,749
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

446
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,691
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

447
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:05,362
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

448
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,083
I'm just not sure
I can leave.

449
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,466
Of course
you can leave.

450
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:10,546
You've got to.
So that I

451
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,301
we can be Supers again,

452
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:14,395
so our kids can have
that choice.

453
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,374
So you can have that choice.

454
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,825
All right, yes!

455
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:19,921
So I can have
that choice.

456
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,598
And I would do a great job!

457
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:26,741
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever

458
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,819
But they want you.

459
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,165
And you'll do a great

460
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,172
job

461
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,037
too.

462
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:40,398
Well, that was excruciating to watch.

463
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,593
I can't lie to you.

464
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,137
It's nice to be wanted.

465
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,872
Flattering, you know,
but

466
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,971
But what's the choice?

467
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,157
One, do this right,

468
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:49,784
get well paid,
we're out of the motel

469
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:51,378
and things get better
for all Supers,

470
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,851
including our kids.

471
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,238
Or two

472
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:57,093
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

473
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,669
You know
it's crazy, right?

474
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,450
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

475
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:03,690
To fix the law, I gotta break it.
You'll be great.

476
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:04,948
I know I will.

477
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,399
But what about you?
We have kids.

478
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,126
I'll watch the kids,
no problem.

479
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:09,729
Easy.
Easy, huh?

480
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:11,153
You're adorable.

481
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,349
Well, if there is
a problem,

482
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,946
I'll drop this thing
and come right back.

483
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,087
You won't need to.

484
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,880
I got it,
you go do this thing.

485
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,700
Do it so

486
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,563
I can do it better.

487
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,831
Deavor here.

488
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,497
This is Elasti Girl.

489
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:27,660
I'm in.

490
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,151
Mr. Deavor,
it's wonderful

491
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:34,807
but it's too generous.

492
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:36,654
Nonsense!
That's the least we can do.

493
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,166
We're partners now!

494
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:40,165
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

495
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,565
But whose house?
Is it a house?

496
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,188
It's my house.
I have several.

497
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,009
I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.

498
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,566
I don't know
what to say.

499
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,802
How about "thanks"?

500
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,397
This is our new house?

501
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:56,735
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

502
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,744
This is homey.

503
00:23:58,831 --> 00:23:59,946
Look at this place.

504
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,321
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire

505
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,751
who liked to come and go
without being seen

506
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:07,178
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

507
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:09,056
Good thing
we won't stand out.

508
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:12,228
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

509
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:14,228
It's got a big yard!

510
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,361
Isn't this a bit much?

511
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,151
Near a forest!

512
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,181
Would you rather be
at the motel?

513
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,462
And a pool!

514
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,877
What exactly
is Mom's new job?

515
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,138
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

516
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:29,747
I like Mom's new job!

517
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:32,585
Oh, ho, ho!

518
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:39,941
Whoa.

519
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,955
Well, check out
the water features.

520
00:24:46,104 --> 00:24:47,533
Oh!
Wow.

521
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,128
Wicked cool!

522
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,302
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

523
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:00,442
Not the couch! Stop it!
No! Dash!

524
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,076
Stop!

525
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:03,434
Don't touch the buttons!
The couch!

526
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:04,342
Dash!
No!

527
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:06,212
No, no!

528
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,176
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

529
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,995
This isn't me.

530
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:15,725
I'm not all dark
and angsty.

531
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,102
I'm Elasti Girl.

532
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,850
I'm, you know,
flexible.

533
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,391
I mean, look at this.
E designed this?

534
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,530
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

535
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,662
Glad it's you and not me,

536
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,954
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

537
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:29,634
This note came with it.

538
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:30,820
What?

539
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,850
A new Elasticycle.

540
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:42,459
Elasticycle?
I didn't know you had a bike.

541
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,709
Hey, I had a mohawk.

542
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:45,333
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

543
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,225
Yeah, but
A mohawk?

544
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,399
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

545
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:54,592
Oh, yeah!
This one's electric.

546
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,306
What's that mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

547
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:03,238
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

548
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,395
You will be great.

549
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,416
I will be great.
And you will, too.

550
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,009
We will both be great.

551
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:09,448
Bye, sweetie.

552
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,134
Wait a minute!

553
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:34,895
Is that Elasti Girl?
I think that's Elasti Girl.

554
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:37,380
Hey! Elasti Girl!

555
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:45,880
Marry me, Elasti Girl!

556
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,980
Here comes Elasti Girl

557
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,516
No theme songs
Stretching her

558
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:54,302
or I'll turn this bus
right around!

559
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:58,438
Look at that.

560
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,590
New Urbem.

561
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,792
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement

562
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,690
you go where
the crime is big.

563
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:05,915
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

564
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,904
It's like
a superhero's playground!

565
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,565
No Sugar Bombs
on my watch.

566
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,737
Where's Mom?

567
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:19,667
She's up and out.

568
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,546
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

569
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,455
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

570
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,995
They are, for now.

571
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,097
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

572
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:30,388
She's not breaking

573
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:32,757
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

574
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:33,986
It's a new job.

575
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:36,694
So, Mom is going out
illegally

576
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:40,164
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

577
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:42,112
Hey Hey!

578
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,568
The bus is here!

579
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:47,560
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the

580
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,556
Put your homework
in your pack!

581
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:52,557
Bye-bye!

582
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,030
We're gonna get along
just fine

583
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:04,075
'cause you don't ask any hard questions.

584
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,559
All right. All locations,

585
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,935
we need to know
where you want us.

586
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:11,021
Stand by.

587
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,905
Seems strange
to wait for crime.

588
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,733
Relax.
You're smack in the middle

589
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,085
of the worst crime area in the city.
It's perfect.

590
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,060
It's a superhero's playground.
"It's a superhero's

591
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:22,451
playground." Right.

592
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:24,249
You know,
after we went underground

593
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,382
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner

594
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:27,812
waiting for something
to happen.

595
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,646
And I got mad at him
for it.

596
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,921
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

597
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,647
All units.
Something's up.

598
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,088
We've been picking up
some chatter about

599
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,827
potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony.

600
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:41,279
Disruption or threat?
Both.

601
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,249
Station's at Fifty Fourth
and Nottingham.

602
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:44,973
A potential threat!
Perfect!

603
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,759
Fifty fourth and Nottingham.
Go, go, go!

604
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,770
Hey, Vi! I want you
back here by 10:30.

605
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,731
11-ish?

606
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:56,146
10-ish,
heading for 9:30-ish.

607
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,287
10:30-ish it is.

608
00:28:58,374 --> 00:28:59,634
Enjoy the movie.

609
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:01,923
"In the county of Noddoff

610
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:04,083
"the Frubbers of Freep

611
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:09,665
"are all giving in
to the sweet succor of sleep."

612
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:20,954
We will control the horizontal

613
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,446
we will control the vertical.

614
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:32,663
That's not the way
you're supposed to do it, Dad.

615
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,075
They want us
to do it this way.

616
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:37,296
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

617
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,802
It's okay, Dad.
Math is math! Math is math!

618
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,114
I'll just wait for Mom

619
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,419
to get back.
What?

620
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:45,362
She won't understand it
any better than I do

621
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:47,678
The Outer Limits.

622
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,577
"All over Doozle Dorf,

623
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,298
"the Fribbers of Frupp
are going to sleep

624
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:56,520
"'cause they just
can't keep up.

625
00:29:56,607 --> 00:30:00,169
"All over Doozle Dorf,
Doozles are dozing.

626
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:04,295
"Eyelids so heavy,
they're drooping.

627
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,725
"Closing! The point is:

628
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:10,363
"Everyone,
everyone's hitting the sack!

629
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,563
"Everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack."

630
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:16,270
Mayors often brag
about their cities

631
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,582
and I'm no exception.

632
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:19,958
And I'm willing to admit

633
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:22,219
that New Urbem
is not the only city

634
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:24,510
Are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this?

635
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:26,575
Sure. You're making
life easy for them.

636
00:30:26,662 --> 00:30:27,797
They still haven't
forgiven us

637
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:29,537
for the last time we made
life easy for them.

638
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:31,784
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

639
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,084
With all due respect

640
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:35,384
if you alone had handled
the Underminer

641
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:37,189
things would have
been different.

642
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:38,545
I'm just saying.

643
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,951
on budget
and ahead of schedule

644
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,343
to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain.

645
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,018
It can get you
where you need to go

646
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:48,987
at ridiculous speeds.

647
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:52,377
The future is open
for business!

648
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,045
Wait. The train has stopped.

649
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:19,115
It's going
the wrong direction.

650
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,552
It's going the wrong way.

651
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,131
I'm going after it.

652
00:31:27,772 --> 00:31:30,185
This thing's really moving.

653
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:32,904
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

654
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,053
About 25 miles.

655
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:45,305
No one can shut
this thing down?

656
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:46,998
They've tried. No-go.

657
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,553
Is that Elasti Girl?

658
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,222
Overrides?

659
00:31:58,309 --> 00:31:59,936
They're locked out
of the system.

660
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:09,553
What about a fail safe?
Not enough time.

661
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:14,160
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

662
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,018
Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high tops

663
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,541
and Dad
can't find them either.

664
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,721
But he won't call you
and ask, so I am.

665
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,111
Do not call your mother!

666
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:22,791
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

667
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:24,715
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

668
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,577
Less than two minutes!

669
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,839
There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.

670
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,139
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

671
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:49,260
What the heck was that?

672
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:51,424
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

673
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you all right?

674
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:58,107
Your story better be good.

675
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:01,644
Hey. Hey!

676
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,208
What happened?

677
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:37,900
Honey, why are you

678
00:35:37,987 --> 00:35:40,631
Don't say anything.

679
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:47,394
It's Dad.
Are you okay?

680
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,447
I'm fine.
I don't wanna talk about it.

681
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:52,105
Tony didn't even call?

682
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,167
I don't wanna talk about it.

683
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,826
Oh, honey
Dad!

684
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:59,466
If you want me to feel better,
then leave me alone.

685
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:00,574
Please?

686
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,800
See, there's nothing

687
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:02,853
a cop hates worse
than a missing child.

688
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,162
My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.

689
00:36:06,387 --> 00:36:09,185
Oh, but if anybody
can find that child, it's you, Roman.

690
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:11,748
Because you're
a wonderful policeman.

691
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:15,152
This is a holdup.

692
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,347
All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.

693
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:18,447
Put your hands behind

694
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,955
your heads
and keep them there!

695
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,404
Don't move!

696
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,974
Drop that.
All right, now get over there.

697
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:26,521
Watch the door.

698
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,795
You think I'm kiddin'?

699
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,712
Now.

700
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:37,705
I said now!

701
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,704
I got it!
Come on, I tell you, come on!

702
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:44,050
You wanna get killed?

703
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:42,721
Uh-oh.

704
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:21,096
No, no, no!

705
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:27,224
No!

706
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:29,308
No, no, no.

707
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:31,153
No, no, no, no, no, no.

708
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:34,201
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

709
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,323
You have powers!

710
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,924
Yeah, baby,

711
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:48,993
and there's not
a scratch on you!

712
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,834
Did you go through
the locked door?

713
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,182
Are those your powers?

714
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:55,184
Who can multiply
like rabbits

715
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:57,338
and go right through
any solid

716
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,991
Oh, my God!

717
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,282
Hello?
Hey, honey.

718
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:13,359
You weren't gonna call me?
Oh, hey!

719
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:15,509
No. I mean, yes, yeah

720
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:17,828
I just didn't wanna wake you.

721
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,790
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

722
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:22,180
Sounds like I just
woke you up.

723
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,048
No, no.

724
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:25,236
It's just, Jack-Jack
He had an accident!

725
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,134
I knew it!

726
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:27,374
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have

727
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:30,632
No, no, no, accident.
Stay there and finish your mission.

728
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,876
You never should-should
wh-what?

729
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:34,304
You don't think I can do this?
No, no.

730
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:36,339
Sorry. I misspoke.

731
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:38,062
Do you need me
to come back?

732
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:41,130
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

733
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,961
What happened
with Jack-Jack?

734
00:39:44,035 --> 00:39:46,290
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

735
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:48,566
Well, that's good.

736
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:50,830
How was Violet's date?
Uh

737
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,656
That was tonight, right?

738
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,299
Yes. Good.

739
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:57,446
All fine and good.

740
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,368
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

741
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:01,273
Fine, yes, no trouble.

742
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,898
And Dash got
his homework done?

743
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:03,962
All done.

744
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,524
So, things haven't
spiraled out

745
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,757
of control
the moment I left?

746
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:08,361
Amazing as it may seem,

747
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,115
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

748
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:12,538
How about you?

749
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,558
I saved a runaway train!

750
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,766
It was so great!

751
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:21,108
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

752
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:22,986
Elasti Girl pursued the train

753
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,133
and was able
to successfully activate

754
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,511
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon

755
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:28,530
and the train starts pulling

756
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,266
out of the station
backwards

757
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:32,358
track of its brand new hovertrain

758
00:40:32,445 --> 00:40:33,789
hovertrain malfunctioned

759
00:40:33,883 --> 00:40:35,157
thanking Elasti Girl

760
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,226
..deemed to almost

761
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,008
Superhero Elasti Girl

762
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:38,943
Elasti Girl

763
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,344
Boom! No casualties!

764
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,481
specialized motorbike,

765
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:44,829
saving all of
the passengers

766
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,028
One thing leads to another

767
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:47,352
and suddenly,
I go after it!

768
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,507
I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!

769
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,687
That's fantastic, honey!

770
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,898
And on your first night!

771
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:57,149
I am so proud of you, really.

772
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:58,593
I'm proud of you, honey.

773
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,265
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

774
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:03,270
And you'll be amazing.

775
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:06,018
I couldn't have done this
if you hadn't taken over so well.

776
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,917
Thanks for handling
everything.

777
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:09,471
It's nothing.

778
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:12,483
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

779
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:15,488
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams, honey.

780
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,303
"Hey, Dad, it's okay.

781
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,733
"I'll just wait for Mom
to get home."

782
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,313
As if she could
I know how to

783
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,866
I can do math.

784
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:54,459
Oh, brother

785
00:41:57,235 --> 00:41:59,053
Wait for Mom!

786
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,999
What am I,
a substitute parent?

787
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:08,139
It's not my fault
they changed math.

788
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:18,397
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

789
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,102
I think I understand
your math assignment.

790
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:24,780
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

791
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:27,018
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

792
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:28,786
by themselves on one side.

793
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,809
you change the sign.

794
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,542
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus

795
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:34,987
You got it?

796
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:36,897
Yeah, baby!

797
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:52,804
Oh. Uh, hello.

798
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,686
We're in a new house.

799
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,748
I did write my address
on your locker

800
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,677
in permanent ink.

801
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:01,901
Oh, is that what that is?

802
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,476
Did you forget?

803
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:05,858
Forget what?

804
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:08,991
That's funny.

805
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,423
Points for funny.

806
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,723
Oh, was it
the weird outfit?

807
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,509
Because there's a reason.

808
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,418
I'm in a drama class

809
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:22,888
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare

810
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,409
but they're like,
"Try to make it relevant for the kids."

811
00:43:25,496 --> 00:43:27,746
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

812
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,028
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You wanna wear

813
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:30,637
one kind of tights
and then they're like,

814
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:32,036
"No, wear these
other kind of tights."

815
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,249
Do I know you?

816
00:43:42,638 --> 00:43:44,942
Many say your speech
today is critical.

817
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:47,538
Both sides just want the
best for their people.

818
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,960
We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.

819
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:53,130
I haven't done this
in a while.

820
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:55,606
This is good.
The train gives us momentum.

821
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,775
Just go out there and
be your charming self

822
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,221
and capitalize on it.

823
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:01,610
Ms. Elasti Girl,
they're ready for you.

824
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:03,819
Hey, stretch a leg.

825
00:44:05,255 --> 00:44:06,832
Thank you, Chad.
It was fun.

826
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:09,924
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

827
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,280
Oh, Madame Ambassador,
hello!

828
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:13,791
Oh, you are Elasti Girl!

829
00:44:13,878 --> 00:44:16,403
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

830
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,698
It was so sad
when you went underground.

831
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:22,326
I am glad to see you back
in your shiny outfit.

832
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:24,207
That means so much
coming from you.

833
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,926
Good luck with your speech.
This way, Ambassador.

834
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:27,815
Uh, uh. Bring lasting peace!

835
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:29,774
I will,
when you defeat evil.

836
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:31,733
Okay.

837
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:33,850
Three, two

838
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:35,793
For over 15 years,

839
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,448
superheroes have been
in hiding.

840
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,035
Forced into it
by a society

841
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:40,895
no longer willing
to support them.

842
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,315
That may soon be changing

843
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:45,090
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

844
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:46,792
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

845
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,815
heroic save
of a runaway train

846
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:52,176
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elasti Girl.

847
00:44:52,263 --> 00:44:53,621
Welcome!
Hello, Chad.

848
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,887
All the polls are going
in your direction.

849
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:57,468
That's true.
Things are good

850
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:58,762
Hello.

851
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:00,464
Uh, hello?

852
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:02,647
Do I have your attention?

853
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:03,975
Yes, Chad.

854
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,314
Of course I do.

855
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:07,089
I'm appearing
on your screen.

856
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:10,057
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

857
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,990
Screens are everywhere.

858
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,692
We are controlled by screens.

859
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:20,117
And screens
are controlled by me

860
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:21,792
Screenslaver.

861
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:22,789
Hey!

862
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:24,588
I control this broadcast

863
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:27,905
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

864
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,912
What's wrong with him?
The signal's been hijacked.

865
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,027
I'll check it out.
Don't look at any monitors.

866
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:34,454
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade

867
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,841
while it's still airborne.

868
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:38,718
Right, Elasti Girl?

869
00:45:40,725 --> 00:45:43,422
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

870
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,528
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Elasti Girl?

871
00:45:57,615 --> 00:45:59,338
Which one?

872
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:09,567
Elasti Girl!
What are you doing here?

873
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:12,010
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she

874
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:13,524
Look out!

875
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:17,456
Follow them
and get me close!

876
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,762
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

877
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,159
Stand down! It's Elasti Girl.

878
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:36,942
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

879
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,518
We're under attack!

880
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:48,563
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

881
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:53,232
Open the door!

882
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:54,632
Do as she says!

883
00:46:56,534 --> 00:46:57,655
Can you all swim?

884
00:46:57,742 --> 00:46:59,398
Yeah.
No!

885
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:23,529
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

886
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:32,731
Are you all right, ma'am?

887
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:34,703
I'm perfectly fine

888
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:38,719
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

889
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,043
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

890
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,130
Good morning!

891
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,574
He takes one look
at me in that suit

892
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:54,295
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

893
00:47:54,382 --> 00:47:56,209
Well.
He's protecting himself.

894
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:59,302
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

895
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:00,402
It's better for you, too.

896
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:03,224
Um. I can't I can't tell you
how many memories

897
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,012
Dicker's had to erase
over the years

898
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,303
when someone figured out

899
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,246
your mother's
or my identity.

900
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,842
It was Dicker!

901
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,145
You told him about Tony!
Honey

902
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:17,164
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

903
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:32,117
I hate superheroes!

904
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,493
And I renounce them!

905
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:42,119
I renounce them!

906
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:52,983
Is she having adolescence?

907
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,811
A new report out today shows that,

908
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,586
when it comes
to decision making

909
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,202
people have more trust
in a monkey

910
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:00,882
throwing darts than Congress.

911
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:03,032
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

912
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,941
They're here in support.

913
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:07,266
Support?
Support of what?

914
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:09,881
Well, in support of you.

915
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:14,986
Wow. Oh, hey

916
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:17,697
Thanks for coming out.
Hi.

917
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:20,430
Oh, my goodness.
Thanks so much.

918
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:21,603
Oh, hello.

919
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,207
What does your sign say?

920
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:29,040
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

921
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,535
Supers should be legal now!

922
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:33,945
Talk to ya.
Oh, what do ya know!

923
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:35,017
Ellenwood.

924
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:37,134
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

925
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:38,364
about superheroes, huh?

926
00:49:38,451 --> 00:49:40,361
Oh. I'll have to
call you back.

927
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:41,445
Oh, that felt good.

928
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:42,760
Felicia, hold my calls,
please.

929
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,525
Eh! Hey!
It's working!

930
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:46,583
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

931
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,870
about superheroes today.

932
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:49,251
Turns out
saving someone's life

933
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:51,242
makes a good impression on them.
Who knew, huh?

934
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:53,530
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

935
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,080
Media awareness
is up 72%.

936
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,070
The push
for superhero legalization

937
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,126
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

938
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:02,047
I have big plans
for our next move.

939
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:03,869
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

940
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:05,055
We'll use our ship

941
00:50:05,142 --> 00:50:07,361
we'll gather leaders
and Supers

942
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:09,605
from all over the world.
That's great.

943
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:10,940
I'm happy.

944
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,650
I'm happy
the numbers are up.

945
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:15,646
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro superhero

946
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,414
and I'm happy
you're happy.

947
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,126
I'm hearing that you're happy,

948
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:20,640
but
why am I not feeling it?

949
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,118
Because I didn't get him!

950
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:23,765
Screenslaver
is still out there.

951
00:50:23,852 --> 00:50:26,621
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

952
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:27,848
He's gonna want more

953
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:30,142
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

954
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:31,973
One thing
I've learned in business?

955
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,878
Smell the flowers.

956
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,314
They don't bloom that often.

957
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:37,047
What do you want
on your tombstone?

958
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,314
"She worried a lot"?

959
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:40,082
All right, stop talking.

960
00:50:40,478 --> 00:50:41,807
Show her.

961
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:49,687
This is just so exciting, isn't it?
Huh?

962
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,707
Oh, wow. Uh

963
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,924
Wow! Elasti Girl,
there you are.

964
00:50:57,011 --> 00:50:58,360
Hello.
I didn't

965
00:50:58,447 --> 00:50:59,494
Wow!

966
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:01,731
Come on, get yourself
together, Karen.

967
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:05,228
Hi, my superhero name
is Voyd.

968
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:08,744
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

969
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,097
I'm just no, I just like the

970
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:14,942
Okay, what I can do,
um, is this.

971
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,864
Yeah.

972
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:25,549
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

973
00:51:25,636 --> 00:51:27,665
I felt like
an outcast before.

974
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:32,272
But now, with you being
you, I feel like

975
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,136
Yay, me.

976
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:38,111
I flew them in
from all over.

977
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,041
They've all been
in hiding.

978
00:51:40,128 --> 00:51:42,107
They have powers,
secret identities

979
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,582
and names
they've given themselves.

980
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:47,260
I'm Screech.
It's a pleasure.

981
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:48,461
I've always considered you

982
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:50,664
the gold standard
for superheroes.

983
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,789
Well, thanks.
You're too nice.

984
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,678
I am called Brick.

985
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:57,977
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

986
00:51:58,064 --> 00:51:59,437
Wisconsin.

987
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:02,908
Oh. Elasti Girl.
I assume your powers are

988
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,228
You know,
zapping things electrically

989
00:52:05,315 --> 00:52:07,664
charging things, bolts of lightning,
that kind of stuff.

990
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,861
Name's Reflux.

991
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:11,821
Medical condition or
superpower, you decide.

992
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:13,630
That's a little line

993
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:15,244
I say just to put
people at ease.

994
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,040
Hope I don't offend.
Oh, no, no, no.

995
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:18,321
Reflux. Love it.

996
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:22,679
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

997
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:25,533
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

998
00:52:27,098 --> 00:52:28,652
Ow!

999
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,953
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations.
Big day.

1000
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,628
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

1001
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:38,814
Good night.

1002
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,291
Must be nice for you,

1003
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:42,200
being out front
after all this time.

1004
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,377
Out front?

1005
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,533
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days

1006
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,314
and even then,
you were kind of

1007
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:49,813
in Mr. Incredible's
shadow.

1008
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,102
Nah, I beg to differ.

1009
00:52:51,189 --> 00:52:53,346
I'm not I'm not
saying you weren't big.

1010
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:55,213
No, you were,
and are, a superstar

1011
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,533
but you have the stage
to yourself now.

1012
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,166
And people have
to pay attention.

1013
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:01,953
Oh, you mean,
"It's a man's world" and all that?

1014
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,747
Well, what world
do you live in?

1015
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,063
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

1016
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:09,682
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

1017
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,789
I ask you,
which of us has the greater influence?

1018
00:53:12,876 --> 00:53:14,274
Which side of me
are you asking?

1019
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,711
The believer or the cynic?

1020
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:17,486
The cynic
Would say selling

1021
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:18,868
is more important, because

1022
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:20,849
the best sellers
have the most buyers.

1023
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:22,328
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

1024
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:24,461
It only matters
what people buy.

1025
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:25,588
This is true.

1026
00:53:25,675 --> 00:53:28,150
If I discovered the
origin of the universe

1027
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:29,524
my brother
would find a way

1028
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:32,524
to market it as a,
uh, foot massager.

1029
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:36,814
So, what would
the believer say?

1030
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,525
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

1031
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,618
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

1032
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:43,502
and impose your will
on the status quo.

1033
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,032
Sounds like my brother.
What?

1034
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,274
You sound like my brother.

1035
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:47,494
Well, he's not wrong.

1036
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:49,134
There is an art
to getting a reaction

1037
00:53:49,221 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh! I know how to get him.

1038
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:54,010
My brother?
No. Screenslaver!

1039
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,485
You're tech savvy.
I need to lock onto a signal

1040
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:57,768
and trace its origin.

1041
00:53:57,855 --> 00:53:59,268
How fast
can you slap something together

1042
00:53:59,355 --> 00:54:00,618
and meet me at the airport?
Airport?

1043
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,204
Need to go
out of town, pronto.

1044
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:04,243
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 a.m.

1045
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,144
I need to get on TV.
Chad!

1046
00:54:06,231 --> 00:54:08,094
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

1047
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:09,181
tonight on the newscast.

1048
00:54:09,268 --> 00:54:11,469
Finish our interview by phone!
Promote the hell out of it.

1049
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:13,196
Independence
from Screenslavery!

1050
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,981
Chad tonight.
Boom!

1051
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:20,724
Dicker.
Yeah, hey, Rick.

1052
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:22,433
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

1053
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,556
Tony Rydinger.

1054
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,334
Mind wipe?
Yeah, nice kid.

1055
00:54:25,421 --> 00:54:27,031
Well, you also wiped out

1056
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:29,140
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

1057
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:31,516
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

1058
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,938
Oops.
Not an exact science, Bob.

1059
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:35,703
Rick, you gotta help me here.

1060
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,843
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

1061
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,452
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

1062
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:42,847
Um

1063
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,112
Not much.

1064
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:45,829
Seems like a good kid.

1065
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,041
Popular,
plays sports, music.

1066
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:50,016
Parents own The Happy Platter,

1067
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:51,923
kid works there part time.

1068
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:54,442
Happy Platter?

1069
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:59,125
Why did we drive
all the way across town

1070
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,135
for The Happy Platter?

1071
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:02,883
We'd like a booth over there,

1072
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,525
near the philodendron.

1073
00:55:04,755 --> 00:55:06,984
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

1074
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:12,164
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

1075
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:14,017
It looks bored.

1076
00:55:14,104 --> 00:55:16,299
Ha-ha!
The Bored Platter!

1077
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:18,704
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

1078
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:21,751
from drive in food.
I like drive in food.

1079
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,431
Does this mean vegetables?

1080
00:55:23,518 --> 00:55:25,907
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

1081
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:27,442
Get used to it.

1082
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,063
Good evening, everyone.

1083
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,379
Oh, no!

1084
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,064
Is she all right?
Violet, are you okay?

1085
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:34,350
Nothing to see here.

1086
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:36,033
Yeah, more napkins would be good.
I'm fine,

1087
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,275
I'm fine.
It happens all the time here.

1088
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:39,016
Mops it right up.
Normally, she doesn't

1089
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:40,535
ever drip like this.

1090
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:43,407
Would you like water, sir?
Yes.

1091
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:46,150
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter

1092
00:55:46,237 --> 00:55:47,919
who you must know, right?
God. Stop.

1093
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:49,232
Hello.
Violet.

1094
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:50,314
Hello, Violet.

1095
00:55:51,509 --> 00:55:53,024
Hey, Vi, say hi to

1096
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:54,728
Don't push it, Dad.

1097
00:55:54,815 --> 00:55:56,274
I'm Dash,
her little brother.

1098
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:57,393
Hello.

1099
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,868
Mmm.
This is really good water.

1100
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:01,197
It's very refreshing.

1101
00:56:01,284 --> 00:56:02,407
Spring water, is it?

1102
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:05,096
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

1103
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:06,711
Well, it is very good.

1104
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:08,105
Excellent tap.

1105
00:56:08,192 --> 00:56:09,808
Excuse me.

1106
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,136
Well, nice to meet you.

1107
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:13,903
Where'd she go?
Mmm.

1108
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:15,996
To find a good place
to be angry?

1109
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,984
Tonight, we go now
to a special remote interview

1110
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:21,135
with Elasti Girl.

1111
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:22,407
How you feeling, Chad?

1112
00:56:22,494 --> 00:56:23,488
You doing all right?

1113
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:25,883
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

1114
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,970
I have no memory of the event.

1115
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:29,852
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

1116
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:31,422
to see a recording
of yourself

1117
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:33,824
the night before
and have no recollection.

1118
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,680
I don't think
anyone needs to worry.

1119
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,947
We've taken many precautions
tonight though.

1120
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:39,196
Where are you right now?

1121
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:42,322
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

1122
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:43,940
I wanna talk about you

1123
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:46,555
starting with your save
of a runaway train.

1124
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:48,752
Here's an exclusive
unedited clip

1125
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,285
from your own suit cam.

1126
00:56:50,372 --> 00:56:51,459
Roll the clip.

1127
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:53,848
This thing's really moving.

1128
00:56:54,032 --> 00:56:56,861
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

1129
00:56:56,987 --> 00:56:58,887
About 25 miles.

1130
00:56:59,737 --> 00:57:02,844
The Screenslaver
interrupts this program

1131
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:04,379
for an important announcement.

1132
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,424
I'll be damned. She knew.

1133
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:08,259
Let's see
if your gadget works.

1134
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:10,344
Don't bother
watching the rest.

1135
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:11,330
Gotcha!

1136
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:14,000
Elasti Girl doesn't
save the day.

1137
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:17,035
She only postpones
her defeat.

1138
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,282
And while she postpones
her defeat

1139
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,227
you eat chips and
watch her confront problems

1140
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,957
that you are too lazy
to deal with.

1141
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:28,086
Superheroes are
part of your brainless desire

1142
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:31,396
to replace true experience
with simulation.

1143
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:34,707
You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.

1144
00:57:34,939 --> 00:57:38,176
You don't play games,
you watch game shows.

1145
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:41,606
Travel, relationships, risk

1146
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:44,805
every meaningful experience
must be packaged

1147
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:47,832
and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.

1148
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:50,465
So that you can remain
ever sheltered

1149
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:52,090
ever passive

1150
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:54,408
ever ravenous consumers

1151
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:57,817
who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches

1152
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,551
break a sweat
and participate in life.

1153
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,575
You want superheroes
to protect you

1154
00:58:04,662 --> 00:58:08,809
and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.

1155
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:12,051
While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.

1156
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:14,386
That your interests
are being served.

1157
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,523
And your rights
are being upheld.

1158
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:20,744
So that the system can
keep stealing from you

1159
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,440
smiling at you all the while.

1160
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,935
Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.

1161
00:58:27,022 --> 00:58:29,703
Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,

1162
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,252
and see what happens.

1163
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:34,713
You are no longer in control.

1164
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,395
I am.

1165
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:19,526
Find anything?

1166
01:01:10,288 --> 01:01:11,917
Sorry!

1167
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,156
What happened?

1168
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,988
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

1169
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:50,074
What's going on?
What did I do?

1170
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:51,649
What did you guys do to me?

1171
01:01:51,736 --> 01:01:54,261
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

1172
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:57,226
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

1173
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,326
You're a genius.
Aw, shucks!

1174
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:02,004
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

1175
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:04,727
Hey, Dad.

1176
01:02:04,814 --> 01:02:08,759
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

1177
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:10,806
and I don't get 'em.
Aren't you

1178
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,149
Didn't we get all caught up?

1179
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:13,500
Yeah, we were caught up

1180
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,873
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1181
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,079
Decimals.

1182
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,656
the addition of the Incredibile,

1183
01:02:19,743 --> 01:02:20,773
the super car

1184
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,064
once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.

1185
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:26,781
It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.

1186
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,880
They said it was
beyond repair.

1187
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:30,521
Hey, it was in perfect condition.

1188
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:32,216
You used to
drive that?

1189
01:02:32,303 --> 01:02:33,824
They said it was destroyed.

1190
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:35,586
Long thought lost
or destroyed,

1191
01:02:35,673 --> 01:02:37,804
the famous car
turned up at private auction.

1192
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:39,245
They said it was

1193
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:41,235
That's my car!

1194
01:02:49,253 --> 01:02:51,635
Stupid water feature!

1195
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:54,742
This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.

1196
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:57,686
Care to demonstrate?
I'd love to, but we haven't figured out

1197
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,328
how to make them work yet.

1198
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:04,151
Wow! It works?

1199
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,663
Huh?

1200
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,503
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

1201
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,816
That's a rocket launcher!

1202
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:12,697
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

1203
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:14,325
Hey!
This is not your car!

1204
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,338
It's not your car, either!
It is so!

1205
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,461
It's the Incredibile.

1206
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,417
Why's that guy have it?
He shouldn't!

1207
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,166
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1208
01:03:21,253 --> 01:03:22,699
Launch the rockets!
I'm not

1209
01:03:22,786 --> 01:03:23,863
launching anything!
Launch the rockets!

1210
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,221
Do you think I want an angry
I wanna blow it up!

1211
01:03:25,308 --> 01:03:26,980
Rich guy coming after me
right now

1212
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:28,785
when I'm trying not to
I'm not sure

1213
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,002
what's happened here, Mark.
..distract

1214
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:31,192
But everyone here has scattered
..your

1215
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:32,346
and I'm afraid I'll need to move
..mother.

1216
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,908
At any minute.

1217
01:03:33,995 --> 01:03:36,037
Rich guy got my car.

1218
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:40,417
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

1219
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:42,002
back from the rich guy?

1220
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,400
What the heck is that?

1221
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,275
Jack-Jack has powers?

1222
01:03:58,362 --> 01:03:59,503
Well, yeah, but

1223
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,308
You knew about this?
Yeah.

1224
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:02,970
Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know.

1225
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:04,870
We're your kids.
We need to know

1226
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:06,338
these things.
Did you tell Mom?

1227
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,198
No. Your mother
Why not?

1228
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:09,705
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you? Is not talking

1229
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,019
Why would you not tell Mom?
Because I didn't wanna

1230
01:04:12,106 --> 01:04:14,127
What? Come on, man.
Because it's not the time.

1231
01:04:14,214 --> 01:04:16,142
Why?
Because So uncool!

1232
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:18,489
Because I'm formulating, okay?

1233
01:04:18,576 --> 01:04:21,253
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

1234
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,419
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend

1235
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:26,197
and keeping the baby from
turning into a flaming monster!

1236
01:04:26,284 --> 01:04:27,701
How do I do it?

1237
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:30,586
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

1238
01:04:30,673 --> 01:04:33,088
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

1239
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:34,978
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1240
01:04:35,065 --> 01:04:38,412
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre Guy.

1241
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:41,152
Mr. Incredible!

1242
01:04:42,718 --> 01:04:44,654
We should call Lucius.

1243
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:46,542
No. I can handle it.

1244
01:04:46,629 --> 01:04:48,893
There's no way I'm gonna

1245
01:04:57,949 --> 01:04:59,408
Dada.

1246
01:05:00,518 --> 01:05:02,178
I'm calling Lucius.

1247
01:05:06,165 --> 01:05:08,679
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

1248
01:05:08,766 --> 01:05:10,607
Since Helen got the job.

1249
01:05:10,694 --> 01:05:12,600
I assume she knows?
Are you kidding?

1250
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:14,102
I can't tell her
about this,

1251
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:15,742
not while she's doing
hero work!

1252
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,194
Mama!
Girls, come on.

1253
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,080
Leave the saving the world
to the men?

1254
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,807
I don't think so.
Mama!

1255
01:05:21,053 --> 01:05:22,794
I've got to succeed!

1256
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,508
So she can succeed.

1257
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:27,336
So we can succeed!
I get it, Bob!

1258
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,108
I get it.
When was the last time you slept?

1259
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,733
Who keeps track of that?

1260
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,297
Besides, he's a baby.

1261
01:05:33,384 --> 01:05:35,639
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

1262
01:05:35,726 --> 01:05:37,766
So, you good then?

1263
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:40,108
You got everything
under control? Right?

1264
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:43,664
What the?

1265
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,596
Cookie!
Cha Cha want a cookie?

1266
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:50,554
Num-num cookie?
Cha Cha wanna num-num?

1267
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:53,317
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1268
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:54,592
You're not
Cookie!

1269
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:55,871
Oh, my God!
Cookie!

1270
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,597
Dada! Dada. Dada.
Whoa.

1271
01:05:57,684 --> 01:05:59,371
Okay! Okay.

1272
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,206
So, he can still
hear you

1273
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:03,599
from the
From the other dimension, yeah.

1274
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:05,799
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like

1275
01:06:05,886 --> 01:06:08,847
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

1276
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:11,542
Full powers, totally random.

1277
01:06:11,629 --> 01:06:13,878
So now, he's what?
Is he good?

1278
01:06:13,965 --> 01:06:16,019
Yeah, you'd think so,
right?

1279
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:18,892
Obviously,
I can't keep giving him cookies!

1280
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:20,934
Uh-uh?
But if I stop

1281
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:26,745
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

1282
01:06:26,832 --> 01:06:28,106
No biting the daddy!

1283
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,655
What the?
No biting!

1284
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,717
Okay.

1285
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:41,839
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

1286
01:06:41,926 --> 01:06:43,213
Then I'll be good to go.

1287
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,668
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

1288
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,512
You need
major life realignment

1289
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,879
on a number of levels.

1290
01:06:48,966 --> 01:06:51,250
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

1291
01:06:51,337 --> 01:06:55,584
You need some solid
outside the box thinking.

1292
01:07:03,877 --> 01:07:05,486
Galbaki?

1293
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:09,626
Elasti Girl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?

1294
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,202
Explain yourself!

1295
01:07:14,442 --> 01:07:17,073
Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.

1296
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,026
It's the baby.
I brought the baby.

1297
01:07:21,895 --> 01:07:24,024
Oh, highly unusual.

1298
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:33,091
You look ghastly, Robert.

1299
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:35,045
I haven't been sleeping.

1300
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:38,871
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math

1301
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:42,298
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's

1302
01:07:42,385 --> 01:07:44,957
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

1303
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:47,143
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

1304
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,344
and now
everything's pink.

1305
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:50,817
And I think
we need eggs.

1306
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:54,611
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

1307
01:07:54,698 --> 01:07:56,090
Done properly.

1308
01:07:56,177 --> 01:07:59,199
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1309
01:07:59,286 --> 01:08:01,057
But you do not come to me

1310
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,319
for eggs and batteries,
Robert.

1311
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:04,916
I design herowear

1312
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,479
and Elasti Girl
must have a new suit.

1313
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:10,055
Actually, it's Jack-Jack.

1314
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:13,083
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

1315
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,629
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

1316
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:19,831
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

1317
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:21,837
If I could just leave him
with you

1318
01:08:21,924 --> 01:08:23,982
for a while
Leave him? Here?

1319
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:27,090
I am not a baby person,
Robert.

1320
01:08:27,177 --> 01:08:30,001
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

1321
01:08:30,088 --> 01:08:33,963
I do not involve myself
in the prosaic day-to-day to

1322
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,363
day.

1323
01:08:38,736 --> 01:08:40,799
Fascinating!

1324
01:08:42,445 --> 01:08:45,193
AA-Are you seeing this, Robert?

1325
01:08:46,275 --> 01:08:47,769
Dada.

1326
01:08:56,852 --> 01:08:59,883
Oh, my God.

1327
01:09:00,558 --> 01:09:01,807
Yes!

1328
01:09:02,152 --> 01:09:03,853
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

1329
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,815
I'm sure filling in
for Helen is challenging,

1330
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:06,799
and you are very tired

1331
01:09:06,886 --> 01:09:07,917
and the other children
need you

1332
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:09,298
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

1333
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:10,954
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything

1334
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,903
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1335
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,222
"Auntie Edna"?

1336
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:25,045
Attention. Attention.

1337
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:27,736
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight

1338
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:29,313
in support of superheroes

1339
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,525
and bringing them
back into society!

1340
01:09:32,612 --> 01:09:34,274
You all made it happen.

1341
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:35,699
The need for this
has been made

1342
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:37,228
crystal clear
in recent days

1343
01:09:37,315 --> 01:09:39,150
with bad actors
like the self proclaimed

1344
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,219
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

1345
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:42,861
His reign was short, huh?

1346
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:45,014
And thanks to this woman

1347
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:48,071
a great super. You love her.
You missed her.

1348
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,528
Welcome back, Elasti Girl.

1349
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:54,111
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1350
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:56,434
Come on. Get up here.

1351
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,059
I want you to have this.

1352
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,394
A memento.

1353
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:05,345
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1354
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:07,182
I am forever in your debt.

1355
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,828
And thanks to all of you,

1356
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:11,817
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1357
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:14,618
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time

1358
01:10:14,705 --> 01:10:17,843
which leads me
to an important announcement.

1359
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,105
Just now,
at a worldwide summit

1360
01:10:20,192 --> 01:10:21,955
leaders from
more than a hundred

1361
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:23,727
of the world's
top countries

1362
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:27,265
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1363
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:30,625
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1364
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:31,929
from all over
the planet

1365
01:10:32,016 --> 01:10:33,516
on our boat,
the Everjust

1366
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:36,996
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

1367
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:41,146
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1368
01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:46,407
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1369
01:10:46,494 --> 01:10:48,397
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

1370
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:51,571
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1371
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:54,132
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

1372
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:55,629
with the life stuff?

1373
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:58,352
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

1374
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:02,559
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

1375
01:11:02,746 --> 01:11:04,492
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

1376
01:11:04,579 --> 01:11:07,472
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

1377
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,437
Hey, Vi.
Hey.

1378
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,555
Where's Jack-Jack?

1379
01:11:33,642 --> 01:11:35,265
E's taking him
for a little bit.

1380
01:11:35,352 --> 01:11:37,491
Edna is babysitting?
Yeah.

1381
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:39,831
And you're okay with this?

1382
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:42,714
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

1383
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:47,084
I wanted to say
something to you.

1384
01:11:47,992 --> 01:11:49,808
Sorry about Tony.

1385
01:11:50,713 --> 01:11:53,384
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory

1386
01:11:53,471 --> 01:11:56,909
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice

1387
01:11:57,019 --> 01:12:00,487
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

1388
01:12:00,978 --> 01:12:03,061
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

1389
01:12:03,148 --> 01:12:04,474
by trying to

1390
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:06,230
Anyway. Anyway

1391
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:07,970
I'm sorry.

1392
01:12:08,379 --> 01:12:09,610
I'm used to knowing

1393
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:11,690
what the right thing
to do is

1394
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:14,776
but now,
I'm not sure anymore.

1395
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:17,284
I just wanna be

1396
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:20,987
a good dad.

1397
01:12:24,622 --> 01:12:26,667
You're not good.

1398
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,425
You're super.

1399
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,754
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

1400
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,843
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1401
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,735
I know
I should be up there

1402
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,508
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

1403
01:12:50,595 --> 01:12:53,480
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1404
01:12:53,797 --> 01:12:55,392
What are you getting
away from?

1405
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,797
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1406
01:12:58,884 --> 01:13:01,196
But you love him,
you two are this company.

1407
01:13:01,283 --> 01:13:02,452
Yin and yang.
Yeah,

1408
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:04,593
I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1409
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,737
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1410
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:11,025
I never know
what people want.

1411
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:12,894
What do you think
they want?

1412
01:13:13,278 --> 01:13:14,258
Ease.

1413
01:13:14,345 --> 01:13:17,491
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1414
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:20,641
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

1415
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:22,398
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

1416
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,723
What?
The Screenslaver?

1417
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,556
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

1418
01:13:25,643 --> 01:13:27,079
It was too easy.

1419
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:30,339
That was too easy?
Wow.

1420
01:13:30,426 --> 01:13:32,186
Funny.
What?

1421
01:13:32,273 --> 01:13:34,016
Look at that.

1422
01:13:34,103 --> 01:13:38,022
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1423
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,345
What?

1424
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:42,557
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1425
01:13:42,644 --> 01:13:43,766
It is.
Then

1426
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,843
how come
Screenslaver has it?

1427
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,532
Maybe he hacked it?

1428
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:50,343
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that

1429
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,758
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1430
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,785
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

1431
01:13:54,872 --> 01:13:56,380
He wanted to get caught?

1432
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:58,375
He wanted you
to win.

1433
01:13:58,462 --> 01:14:00,838
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1434
01:14:00,925 --> 01:14:02,014
If he's smart enough
to conceive

1435
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:03,664
of technology like this

1436
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:06,414
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1437
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:08,353
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1438
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,828
So? Einstein was a patent clerk.

1439
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:13,257
Look, you won.
You got the guy who

1440
01:14:13,344 --> 01:14:15,547
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

1441
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:16,943
to hypnotize someone

1442
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:19,241
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1443
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:23,276
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1444
01:14:25,483 --> 01:14:30,047
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy

1445
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:31,669
but he was controlled
by the screens

1446
01:14:31,756 --> 01:14:33,202
built into his glasses

1447
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,780
You are good.

1448
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:41,472
Look, the robot!

1449
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:42,413
It's taking off.

1450
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,573
I'm not getting a reading yet.

1451
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,167
Press "fire"?
Now!

1452
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:49,153
More power.

1453
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,499
Oh, I hope this works, Dad.

1454
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,061
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1455
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:57,790
Seventeen hours.

1456
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:59,678
How do you feel?

1457
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,349
Super.

1458
01:15:01,654 --> 01:15:04,257
You got it, Dad.
Hurray!

1459
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:06,886
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

1460
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:08,800
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

1461
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:11,871
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1462
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:13,684
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

1463
01:15:13,771 --> 01:15:15,073
My rates are far too high.

1464
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,199
Oh, uh

1465
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:18,734
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1466
01:15:18,821 --> 01:15:20,628
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1467
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:22,132
We deserve each other.

1468
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:24,723
Your child is a polymorph.

1469
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:27,410
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1470
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:29,126
It is not unknown
for supers

1471
01:15:29,213 --> 01:15:30,870
to have more than one
power when young

1472
01:15:30,957 --> 01:15:33,633
but this little one has many.

1473
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,078
Yes, you have many powers.

1474
01:15:50,256 --> 01:15:52,659
I understand
your lack of sleep

1475
01:15:52,746 --> 01:15:54,200
and coherency, Robert.

1476
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:55,472
Babies can be anything,

1477
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:57,298
and your child
is no exception.

1478
01:15:57,393 --> 01:16:00,209
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1479
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:03,191
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1480
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:05,825
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night

1481
01:16:05,912 --> 01:16:08,708
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms.

1482
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:11,090
What are you You're
putting him in the

1483
01:16:11,177 --> 01:16:12,410
In the chamber, Robert.

1484
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:14,120
He is part
of the demonstration

1485
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,341
and will be fine.

1486
01:16:15,428 --> 01:16:17,497
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1487
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:18,964
who has
multiple powers

1488
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:21,624
and no control
over them, yes?

1489
01:16:22,053 --> 01:16:23,864
Huh. That sums it up.

1490
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:25,238
I often work to music

1491
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:28,073
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1492
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,366
Specifically, Mozart.

1493
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:31,784
I blended Kevlar

1494
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,284
with carbyne for
durability under duress

1495
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:35,926
and cotton for comfort.

1496
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:39,337
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors

1497
01:16:39,424 --> 01:16:42,200
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1498
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:45,472
Oh, Lord!
What What is he doing? What is he doing?

1499
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,520
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1500
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:50,925
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker

1501
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:52,980
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1502
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,723
Oh, no. Cookies.

1503
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,878
I gotta get cookies!

1504
01:16:55,965 --> 01:16:57,581
You do not need cookies.

1505
01:16:57,668 --> 01:16:59,176
As I learned quite painfully

1506
01:16:59,254 --> 01:17:00,279
last night

1507
01:17:00,357 --> 01:17:01,792
any solution involving cookies

1508
01:17:01,879 --> 01:17:04,687
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

1509
01:17:06,684 --> 01:17:08,125
"Combustion imminent"?

1510
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:09,458
What does that mean?

1511
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:12,029
It means fire, Robert,

1512
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:14,316
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1513
01:17:14,403 --> 01:17:17,042
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1514
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:19,460
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

1515
01:17:21,259 --> 01:17:22,948
The flame retardant

1516
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:25,141
is blackberry lavender,
darling.

1517
01:17:25,228 --> 01:17:28,112
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

1518
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:31,591
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

1519
01:17:31,678 --> 01:17:34,392
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

1520
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:36,169
for a single night's work

1521
01:17:36,256 --> 01:17:37,644
the suit
and device contain

1522
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,897
a few more features
we need to discuss.

1523
01:17:39,984 --> 01:17:42,393
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

1524
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,128
How much
do I owe you for

1525
01:17:44,215 --> 01:17:47,128
Pish-posh, darling.
Your bill will be covered by my fee

1526
01:17:47,215 --> 01:17:49,222
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elasti Girl,

1527
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:51,880
and Frozone's
exclusive designer

1528
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,198
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1529
01:17:54,285 --> 01:17:56,128
But babysitting this one

1530
01:17:56,215 --> 01:17:59,562
I do for free, darling.

1531
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:19,503
I would
resist the temptation to stretch.

1532
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:22,804
The temperature around you
is well below freezing.

1533
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:25,464
Try to stretch
and you'll break.

1534
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:28,007
So, you're
the Screenslaver.

1535
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:30,429
Yes and no.

1536
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:32,926
Let's say,
I created the character

1537
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:35,012
and pre-recorded
the messages.

1538
01:18:35,099 --> 01:18:36,784
Does Winston know?

1539
01:18:36,871 --> 01:18:39,438
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

1540
01:18:39,525 --> 01:18:41,989
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

1541
01:18:42,076 --> 01:18:43,926
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

1542
01:18:44,013 --> 01:18:45,429
Worse than
what you're doing?

1543
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:47,528
Hey, I'm using
the technology

1544
01:18:47,615 --> 01:18:49,738
to destroy
people's trust in it.

1545
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,872
Like I'm using superheroes.

1546
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:53,606
Who did I put in jail?

1547
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:54,831
Pizza delivery guy.

1548
01:18:54,918 --> 01:18:56,747
Seemed the right height,
build.

1549
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:58,691
He gave you
a pretty good fight.

1550
01:18:58,778 --> 01:19:00,341
I should say I gave you

1551
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:02,324
a pretty good fight
through him.

1552
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:03,512
But it doesn't bother you

1553
01:19:03,599 --> 01:19:05,261
that an innocent man
is in jail?

1554
01:19:05,348 --> 01:19:08,544
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

1555
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:10,267
I counted on you.

1556
01:19:10,368 --> 01:19:11,769
That's why you failed.

1557
01:19:11,856 --> 01:19:12,825
What?

1558
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:16,380
Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?

1559
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:18,335
Because my brother
knows the words

1560
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:19,530
to your theme song?

1561
01:19:19,617 --> 01:19:21,158
We don't know each other.

1562
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:23,073
But you can
count on me anyway.

1563
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,809
I am supposed to,
aren't I?

1564
01:19:24,896 --> 01:19:27,058
Because you have
some strange abilities

1565
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:28,372
and a shiny costume

1566
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:30,683
the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives

1567
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,837
into your gloved hands.

1568
01:19:32,924 --> 01:19:35,288
That's what
my father believed.

1569
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:37,458
When our home was broken into,

1570
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:39,073
my mother wanted to hide.

1571
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,714
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

1572
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:45,796
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1573
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:50,749
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly

1574
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,460
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

1575
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,747
But why would you

1576
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:57,023
Your brother
Is a child!

1577
01:19:57,288 --> 01:19:58,618
He remembers the time

1578
01:19:58,705 --> 01:20:01,245
when we had parents
and superheroes.

1579
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:04,966
So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.

1580
01:20:05,053 --> 01:20:06,526
Mommy and Daddy went away

1581
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:08,763
because supers went away.

1582
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:11,106
Our sweet parents
were fools

1583
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:13,323
to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.

1584
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,687
Superheroes keep us weak.

1585
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,998
Are you gonna kill me?

1586
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,803
Nah.

1587
01:20:21,772 --> 01:20:23,242
Using you is better.

1588
01:20:23,329 --> 01:20:26,577
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal

1589
01:20:26,664 --> 01:20:28,035
forever.

1590
01:20:32,783 --> 01:20:34,968
Dada. Dada.

1591
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,616
Ready?
Laser eyes.

1592
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:39,536
Stop.

1593
01:20:39,623 --> 01:20:40,723
Wow!
Yeah!

1594
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:42,081
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, baby!

1595
01:20:42,168 --> 01:20:43,788
And that's not all.
Watch this.

1596
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,851
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1597
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:53,091
No way.
That is crazy cool.

1598
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:54,114
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

1599
01:20:54,201 --> 01:20:55,909
Let me try. I want him. Give him to me.
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1600
01:20:55,996 --> 01:20:58,964
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

1601
01:20:59,051 --> 01:21:01,544
This is potentially
dangerous

1602
01:21:01,631 --> 01:21:04,556
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1603
01:21:04,782 --> 01:21:06,746
Stop. See the screen.

1604
01:21:08,246 --> 01:21:10,456
He vanished!
That's really cool!

1605
01:21:10,543 --> 01:21:12,203
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1606
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,007
See that.

1607
01:21:13,094 --> 01:21:15,412
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

1608
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:16,963
Dimension four.
See the shape?

1609
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:19,287
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

1610
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,669
So, where is he?

1611
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,396
He's there!

1612
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,685
Okay. Come out.
Num-num cookie?

1613
01:21:27,856 --> 01:21:29,727
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1614
01:21:29,814 --> 01:21:32,021
That's really cool.

1615
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,159
Hello?
Elasti Girl's in trouble.

1616
01:21:40,246 --> 01:21:41,558
What? What happened to her?

1617
01:21:41,645 --> 01:21:43,144
Sorry to tell you
on the phone.

1618
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,702
Meet me on our ship
at DEVTECH.

1619
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:47,103
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1620
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,306
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1621
01:21:49,393 --> 01:21:50,949
Lucius? Bob.
Helen's in trouble.

1622
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,683
I need someone
to watch the kids.

1623
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,212
Suit up. It might get weird.

1624
01:21:54,299 --> 01:21:55,987
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1625
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:57,564
W here are you
going ASAP?

1626
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:59,192
You better be back ASAP!

1627
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:00,803
And leaving that suit.

1628
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,448
I gotta go.
I'll be home soon.

1629
01:22:02,535 --> 01:22:03,712
Lucius will be here sooner.

1630
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:05,872
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

1631
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:07,671
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1632
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:10,282
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

1633
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:23,826
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1634
01:22:23,913 --> 01:22:25,668
She may need it.
You never know.

1635
01:22:25,755 --> 01:22:27,192
What's going on?

1636
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:29,411
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

1637
01:22:29,498 --> 01:22:31,426
after getting a call
about Mom

1638
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:32,578
and then left.

1639
01:22:32,665 --> 01:22:34,468
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

1640
01:22:34,555 --> 01:22:37,578
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

1641
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,132
Put that on.

1642
01:22:50,088 --> 01:22:52,843
Hello there, little fella.

1643
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,106
Hello.

1644
01:22:54,193 --> 01:22:55,606
You kids aren't safe.

1645
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:56,948
The Deavors sent us
to take you

1646
01:22:57,035 --> 01:22:59,805
Well, isn't that redundant?

1647
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:03,250
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

1648
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:07,445
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1649
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:09,686
I get it,
managerial screw up.

1650
01:23:09,773 --> 01:23:11,229
Tell Winston
I handled it.

1651
01:23:11,316 --> 01:23:12,738
You understand,
Ms

1652
01:23:12,825 --> 01:23:13,899
Voyd.

1653
01:23:14,145 --> 01:23:15,746
Ms. Voyd.

1654
01:23:16,982 --> 01:23:18,077
Drive safely.

1655
01:23:27,758 --> 01:23:31,815
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

1656
01:23:31,902 --> 01:23:32,811
Hey.

1657
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:35,996
That isn't gonna
hold them long.

1658
01:23:37,002 --> 01:23:38,656
Dash, grab the baby!

1659
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:42,735
Spread out!

1660
01:23:44,775 --> 01:23:46,504
Whoa!
Oh!

1661
01:23:46,591 --> 01:23:47,921
Dash!

1662
01:23:48,184 --> 01:23:49,682
We gotta get to my car.

1663
01:23:58,853 --> 01:24:01,257
What? What's going on?

1664
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:02,755
Little fella!

1665
01:24:21,268 --> 01:24:22,557
It worked!

1666
01:24:28,136 --> 01:24:30,255
Incredibile, windows down!

1667
01:24:31,656 --> 01:24:32,657
Dive in!

1668
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,838
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

1669
01:24:41,925 --> 01:24:43,448
Loudly, say your names.

1670
01:24:43,535 --> 01:24:46,547
Violet Parr.
Dashiell Robert Parr.

1671
01:24:50,678 --> 01:24:51,843
Lucius!

1672
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:54,207
Incredibile, escape!

1673
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:03,634
Fill me in!

1674
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:05,443
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

1675
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,859
She seems physically fine

1676
01:25:06,946 --> 01:25:08,704
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver

1677
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:11,405
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

1678
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:15,914
Strange how?

1679
01:25:24,196 --> 01:25:25,625
Helen?

1680
01:25:26,173 --> 01:25:27,970
Helen, what are you

1681
01:25:36,377 --> 01:25:37,957
Helen, it's me.

1682
01:25:54,868 --> 01:25:57,033
Incredibile, pull over.

1683
01:26:01,377 --> 01:26:04,423
We can't go to E's.

1684
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:06,904
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

1685
01:26:06,991 --> 01:26:08,671
They were
wearing them, too.

1686
01:26:08,758 --> 01:26:11,459
They're all under
someone's control.

1687
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:14,145
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

1688
01:26:15,692 --> 01:26:17,881
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1689
01:26:17,968 --> 01:26:19,661
No Mom, no Dad.

1690
01:26:19,748 --> 01:26:20,862
No Lucius.

1691
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:24,796
But we have our powers,
this car

1692
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:28,853
and what?

1693
01:26:40,758 --> 01:26:43,756
Incredibile,
take us to DEVTECH.

1694
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:49,375
The kids have escaped
in a tricked out car,

1695
01:26:49,462 --> 01:26:51,021
but we got Frozone.

1696
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:53,477
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

1697
01:26:58,858 --> 01:27:01,389
Aw, we missed 'em!

1698
01:27:01,476 --> 01:27:05,938
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1699
01:27:08,329 --> 01:27:10,151
What did you do?
I don't know.

1700
01:27:10,246 --> 01:27:13,224
What did you do?
I didn't do anything!

1701
01:27:20,858 --> 01:27:24,157
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

1702
01:27:31,735 --> 01:27:33,384
We didn't plan this well.

1703
01:27:33,471 --> 01:27:34,929
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

1704
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:36,520
Yes, we're here.

1705
01:27:36,607 --> 01:27:38,999
We need to be up there.

1706
01:27:39,892 --> 01:27:41,056
Hey

1707
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:45,662
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

1708
01:27:45,749 --> 01:27:47,065
Wait, what? No.

1709
01:27:47,152 --> 01:27:48,907
Yeah, baby!
No, don't say any more

1710
01:27:48,994 --> 01:27:50,375
Max power! Launch!

1711
01:27:57,935 --> 01:27:59,334
Come on.

1712
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:03,919
Hello!
Glad you could come.

1713
01:28:04,006 --> 01:28:05,984
Welcome to the conference.
Good to see you.

1714
01:28:16,314 --> 01:28:18,153
Our stars, where are they?

1715
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,437
The event's about to start.

1716
01:28:19,524 --> 01:28:21,472
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1717
01:28:21,559 --> 01:28:23,062
They'll join for the signing.

1718
01:28:23,955 --> 01:28:26,477
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

1719
01:28:26,564 --> 01:28:30,590
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

1720
01:28:30,677 --> 01:28:32,464
So, hold onto something

1721
01:28:32,551 --> 01:28:35,128
because we're going
to open her up!

1722
01:28:53,218 --> 01:28:55,800
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

1723
01:28:55,887 --> 01:28:57,108
I'm gonna search for them.

1724
01:28:57,195 --> 01:28:59,522
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

1725
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,449
Suck it up.
I won't be long.

1726
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:04,306
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1727
01:29:04,393 --> 01:29:07,051
This is important.
They are in trouble.

1728
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:10,164
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

1729
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:13,426
Keep him amused but quiet!

1730
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:15,292
Ugh.

1731
01:29:24,767 --> 01:29:26,897
Shh! Quiet!

1732
01:29:27,851 --> 01:29:29,020
Huh?

1733
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:34,280
Jack-Jack?

1734
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:46,232
Jack-Jack?
Jack-Jack!

1735
01:30:19,404 --> 01:30:20,423
Jack-Jack!

1736
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:22,193
The mesmerized supers
know we're here

1737
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,163
but I found Mom and Dad
Where's Jack-Jack?

1738
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:28,384
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1739
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:30,176
The tracker.
Use the tracker.

1740
01:30:33,985 --> 01:30:35,099
He's going up?

1741
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,450
He's in an elevator.
Let's go!

1742
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:41,979
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

1743
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:46,569
And here they are, folks!

1744
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:49,374
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1745
01:30:49,461 --> 01:30:51,700
I told you
they'd be there in time.

1746
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:53,985
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

1747
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:56,084
Yeah. Night vision,
et cetera

1748
01:30:56,171 --> 01:30:57,194
They look good, right?

1749
01:30:57,281 --> 01:30:59,061
So simple, even he can do it.

1750
01:30:59,148 --> 01:31:03,155
And we're back live in
three, two, one

1751
01:31:03,242 --> 01:31:04,884
This is
a momentous occasion.

1752
01:31:04,971 --> 01:31:06,888
We've all managed
to accomplish

1753
01:31:06,975 --> 01:31:10,270
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

1754
01:31:10,357 --> 01:31:11,976
We agree on something.

1755
01:31:14,854 --> 01:31:18,127
We agree to undo
a bad decision.

1756
01:31:18,214 --> 01:31:21,321
To make sure a few extraordinarily
gifted members

1757
01:31:21,408 --> 01:31:23,981
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

1758
01:31:24,068 --> 01:31:27,122
To invite them once again
to use their gifts

1759
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:28,792
to benefit the world.

1760
01:31:28,879 --> 01:31:30,053
I thank all of you

1761
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:33,249
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1762
01:31:33,336 --> 01:31:35,615
With special thanks
to Ambassador Selick.

1763
01:31:35,702 --> 01:31:37,450
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

1764
01:31:37,537 --> 01:31:38,928
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1765
01:31:39,015 --> 01:31:40,137
Thank you, Ambassador,

1766
01:31:40,224 --> 01:31:42,459
for your early
and very crucial support.

1767
01:31:42,546 --> 01:31:45,224
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you

1768
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:46,567
to be the first signature

1769
01:31:46,654 --> 01:31:50,477
on the International
Superhero Accord.

1770
01:31:51,169 --> 01:31:53,367
There it is!

1771
01:32:07,111 --> 01:32:08,926
Holy cow!

1772
01:32:09,013 --> 01:32:11,477
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

1773
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:19,978
They're coming.

1774
01:32:28,936 --> 01:32:30,603
Is it okay
to give him that?

1775
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,305
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

1776
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,901
No!

1777
01:32:59,464 --> 01:33:01,104
Come on, Jack-Jack.

1778
01:33:01,191 --> 01:33:02,278
We have to go.

1779
01:33:02,365 --> 01:33:03,921
Cookie num-num?

1780
01:33:16,214 --> 01:33:19,070
Mama, Mama.
I see him. He's getting away!

1781
01:33:19,157 --> 01:33:20,446
Stand back.

1782
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:26,738
Darn it!
He's heading for Mom.

1783
01:33:28,605 --> 01:33:32,135
It is done.
The world is super again.

1784
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:40,191
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1785
01:33:40,278 --> 01:33:42,916
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

1786
01:33:43,003 --> 01:33:44,459
Everyone, smile.

1787
01:33:51,362 --> 01:33:53,051
Go on phase two.

1788
01:33:53,138 --> 01:33:55,845
Years of mandated
hiding and silence

1789
01:33:55,932 --> 01:33:57,168
have made us bitter.

1790
01:33:57,255 --> 01:33:59,036
You bring us out
into the light

1791
01:33:59,123 --> 01:34:00,594
only to clean up the messes

1792
01:34:00,681 --> 01:34:02,513
your lack
of discipline creates.

1793
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,149
Your bodies
and your character are weak.

1794
01:34:05,236 --> 01:34:08,819
Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.

1795
01:34:08,906 --> 01:34:10,688
We no longer serve you.

1796
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:12,205
We serve only us.

1797
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,400
May the fittest survive.

1798
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,652
Well, we, um

1799
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:20,587
Some very alarming
moments there

1800
01:34:20,674 --> 01:34:23,289
before the, uh,
technical difficulties.

1801
01:34:23,448 --> 01:34:24,777
Please bear with us.

1802
01:34:37,676 --> 01:34:38,919
What?

1803
01:34:39,372 --> 01:34:40,863
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

1804
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,934
Hold! Let him talk.

1805
01:34:42,021 --> 01:34:44,034
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge.

1806
01:34:44,121 --> 01:34:45,181
Repeat.
Now.

1807
01:34:56,426 --> 01:34:58,120
A little further.

1808
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,346
Little further. Stop.

1809
01:35:05,752 --> 01:35:08,305
What the A baby?

1810
01:35:08,392 --> 01:35:10,523
Mom and Dad.
Uncle Lucius?

1811
01:35:12,714 --> 01:35:14,543
My mama.
Jack-Jack, no!

1812
01:35:17,635 --> 01:35:19,565
A super baby?

1813
01:35:24,308 --> 01:35:25,656
No, no, no!

1814
01:35:25,743 --> 01:35:26,839
Put him down!

1815
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:30,127
Grab her!
No!

1816
01:35:30,214 --> 01:35:31,477
Hold Jack-Jack.

1817
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,016
No!

1818
01:35:41,454 --> 01:35:43,307
Hey, it's me!

1819
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:45,060
Yeah, that's what
I thought last time.

1820
01:35:45,147 --> 01:35:48,001
Kids, what are you Wha

1821
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,755
You came for us?

1822
01:35:51,903 --> 01:35:52,974
Don't be mad.

1823
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:56,142
Oh, sweetie,
how could I be mad?

1824
01:35:56,523 --> 01:35:57,899
I'm proud.

1825
01:35:58,905 --> 01:36:00,638
Not to break up
a tender moment,

1826
01:36:00,725 --> 01:36:02,226
but where are we?

1827
01:36:02,313 --> 01:36:03,577
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1828
01:36:03,664 --> 01:36:05,544
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver

1829
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:08,335
and until a second ago, us.

1830
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:10,553
Where's the crew?

1831
01:36:10,655 --> 01:36:12,570
Collision detected.
Correct course.

1832
01:36:12,657 --> 01:36:13,715
Uh-oh.
Did I do that?

1833
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,150
Mom, the suit?
Try this.

1834
01:36:19,765 --> 01:36:22,330
Phase Three.
Go on Phase Three!

1835
01:36:25,503 --> 01:36:27,929
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1836
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:28,882
I went to the house.

1837
01:36:28,969 --> 01:36:30,661
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

1838
01:36:30,748 --> 01:36:32,715
Hey!
We just saved you!

1839
01:36:32,802 --> 01:36:34,560
Escape? Escape from who?

1840
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:39,087
Those guys!

1841
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:44,056
What the?
Jack-Jack has powers?

1842
01:36:44,143 --> 01:36:46,372
We know.
Fight now, talk later.

1843
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:21,269
Jack-Jack.

1844
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,573
Laser eyes!

1845
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,550
Ah-ha!

1846
01:37:44,348 --> 01:37:45,549
Ugh.

1847
01:37:50,488 --> 01:37:52,273
Come with me, Winston.

1848
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:54,512
Did I faint?
You'll be safe here.

1849
01:37:54,599 --> 01:37:56,589
Safe? Safe from what?

1850
01:37:57,454 --> 01:37:59,638
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

1851
01:37:59,725 --> 01:38:00,846
Still hypnotized.

1852
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,596
What have you done?

1853
01:38:07,638 --> 01:38:09,647
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1854
01:38:09,769 --> 01:38:12,081
Well, go after her.
Finish your mission.

1855
01:38:12,168 --> 01:38:14,317
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

1856
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:16,811
Jack-Jack, who's gonna
Mom!

1857
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,343
Go. We've got this.

1858
01:38:20,618 --> 01:38:22,237
Voyd, come with me.

1859
01:38:22,324 --> 01:38:24,036
I'll go shut down
the engine.

1860
01:38:24,123 --> 01:38:25,464
I'll try to slow the
ship from the bow.

1861
01:38:25,551 --> 01:38:28,612
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1862
01:38:28,699 --> 01:38:30,489
Strap in now!

1863
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:47,506
It's for your own good.

1864
01:38:47,711 --> 01:38:49,326
No!

1865
01:38:49,413 --> 01:38:50,661
This is.

1866
01:39:01,826 --> 01:39:04,556
We're too late.
Get me up to the jet.

1867
01:39:28,419 --> 01:39:31,320
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

1868
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:33,258
You want me to un-crush?

1869
01:39:33,345 --> 01:39:35,146
What?
No one's ever asked for that?

1870
01:39:35,233 --> 01:39:38,133
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

1871
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:39,961
To get into the engine room.

1872
01:39:40,048 --> 01:39:41,420
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

1873
01:39:41,507 --> 01:39:43,554
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

1874
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:44,797
What do you do?

1875
01:39:48,251 --> 01:39:50,132
Welcome aboard, Elasti Girl.

1876
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:51,506
Although
we haven't yet reached

1877
01:39:51,593 --> 01:39:53,322
our cruising altitude

1878
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:56,913
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

1879
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,459
Or just relax

1880
01:39:58,546 --> 01:40:02,143
and let the cabin roam
about you.

1881
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:13,476
I can't get
to the engine room!

1882
01:40:13,563 --> 01:40:14,813
We gotta do something!

1883
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,482
Because trying to
slow it down ain't working.

1884
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:18,415
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

1885
01:40:18,502 --> 01:40:19,842
The steering's been destroyed!

1886
01:40:19,929 --> 01:40:22,070
Dash means from the outside!
Yeah!

1887
01:40:22,157 --> 01:40:23,521
If we break off
one of the foils

1888
01:40:23,608 --> 01:40:24,680
and turn the rudder

1889
01:40:24,767 --> 01:40:26,709
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

1890
01:40:26,796 --> 01:40:27,836
That might work.

1891
01:40:27,923 --> 01:40:29,709
I'll turn the front,
you turn the rear.

1892
01:40:29,796 --> 01:40:32,000
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

1893
01:40:32,087 --> 01:40:33,138
How am I supposed to get

1894
01:40:33,225 --> 01:40:35,040
All right.
Come on, kids.

1895
01:40:35,127 --> 01:40:38,054
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

1896
01:40:38,141 --> 01:40:40,695
But if it doesn't,
and we crash

1897
01:40:40,782 --> 01:40:44,111
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1898
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:47,986
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

1899
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:49,499
That's my girl.

1900
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:52,525
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

1901
01:40:58,988 --> 01:41:01,085
You know what's sad?

1902
01:41:04,251 --> 01:41:06,004
If it weren't
for your core beliefs

1903
01:41:06,091 --> 01:41:08,814
I think we could have
been good friends.

1904
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,784
At least

1905
01:41:12,623 --> 01:41:14,753
I have core beliefs.

1906
01:41:15,984 --> 01:41:17,377
We have breaking news

1907
01:41:17,464 --> 01:41:19,610
While there is
still no radio contact,

1908
01:41:19,697 --> 01:41:21,066
the ship
has changed direction

1909
01:41:21,153 --> 01:41:22,324
and is heading towards land

1910
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,109
at a high rate of speed.

1911
01:41:28,173 --> 01:41:29,802
So, Dash

1912
01:41:30,841 --> 01:41:32,330
I am going to the rudder.

1913
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:35,525
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1914
01:41:35,612 --> 01:41:37,601
Okay, Dad.
Now lower me down

1915
01:41:41,524 --> 01:41:44,921
The reputations of
superheroes are ruined.

1916
01:41:45,021 --> 01:41:48,600
You will never
become legal. Ever.

1917
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:49,966
Never?

1918
01:41:50,053 --> 01:41:51,713
No.

1919
01:41:51,847 --> 01:41:53,595
Ever?
No.

1920
01:41:53,682 --> 01:41:56,912
Not even a little
smidgee widgee?

1921
01:41:56,999 --> 01:41:58,515
Oh, hypoxia.

1922
01:41:58,602 --> 01:42:00,258
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

1923
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:02,701
things seem really silly.

1924
01:42:08,494 --> 01:42:10,913
Things get sillier

1925
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,761
and sillier
and then you die.

1926
01:42:12,848 --> 01:42:15,006
I don't wanna die.

1927
01:42:15,093 --> 01:42:17,623
Ah, nobody does.

1928
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:18,708
Really.

1929
01:42:18,795 --> 01:42:21,421
Not such a bad way to go.

1930
01:42:39,585 --> 01:42:42,100
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1931
01:42:42,187 --> 01:42:44,910
All supers,
protect your ambassadors!

1932
01:42:45,649 --> 01:42:47,100
Follow.

1933
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:51,986
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

1934
01:43:00,231 --> 01:43:01,800
We gotta pull him up.

1935
01:43:01,887 --> 01:43:03,747
Wait. It's too soon.

1936
01:43:17,223 --> 01:43:20,161
I'm gonna press the button!
Not yet!

1937
01:43:34,677 --> 01:43:36,966
It's turning. It's working.

1938
01:43:40,405 --> 01:43:43,255
Now!
Dash, now!

1939
01:43:45,709 --> 01:43:47,207
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1940
01:43:49,414 --> 01:43:51,469
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1941
01:43:51,556 --> 01:43:52,897
Make a chute!

1942
01:43:55,293 --> 01:43:57,317
Helen! Brace yourselves!

1943
01:44:05,363 --> 01:44:07,193
Crash positions!

1944
01:44:25,486 --> 01:44:26,527
Whoo.

1945
01:44:27,107 --> 01:44:31,204
I missed Jack-Jack's first power?

1946
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:33,703
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

1947
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:35,413
Oh!

1948
01:44:47,346 --> 01:44:51,035
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1949
01:44:51,253 --> 01:44:53,469
But it does make you alive.

1950
01:44:53,556 --> 01:44:55,261
And I'm grateful
for that.

1951
01:44:55,487 --> 01:44:58,364
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

1952
01:44:58,451 --> 01:44:59,884
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

1953
01:44:59,971 --> 01:45:02,350
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

1954
01:45:02,437 --> 01:45:05,353
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

1955
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,343
And who knows what the
future may bring

1956
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:11,943
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1957
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,411
Hmm. Good feeling.

1958
01:45:13,498 --> 01:45:15,163
Should we be worried?

1959
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,949
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

1960
01:45:18,036 --> 01:45:20,101
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1961
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:21,306
No pun intended.

1962
01:45:21,393 --> 01:45:23,070
Sorry I had to punch you.

1963
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:27,847
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1964
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:43,773
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

1965
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,083
they have demonstrated

1966
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:47,552
the legal status
of superheroes

1967
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:49,959
is hereby restored.

1968
01:45:58,646 --> 01:46:00,659
You don't know me,
do you?

1969
01:46:00,746 --> 01:46:02,060
No, I don't

1970
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:03,423
Wait.

1971
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,759
Are you the girl

1972
01:46:04,846 --> 01:46:07,206
with the water?
I'm Violet Parr.

1973
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:09,797
I'm Tony.
Okay.

1974
01:46:09,884 --> 01:46:12,542
You split up into separate
groups and stuff

1975
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,862
Tony, this is my mom.
Pleased to meet you.

1976
01:46:22,949 --> 01:46:24,923
This is my dad.
Oh, we've met.

1977
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:27,029
And this is embarrassing.

1978
01:46:27,116 --> 01:46:28,395
Charmed, I'm sure.

1979
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:30,274
My little brother, Dash.

1980
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:32,743
And the baby is Jack-Jack.

1981
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:36,042
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

1982
01:46:36,129 --> 01:46:38,538
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

1983
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,923
We'll be sitting on the
other side of the theater.

1984
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,235
Not watching you.

1985
01:46:42,322 --> 01:46:44,518
He's kidding.

1986
01:46:44,605 --> 01:46:47,612
They are only dropping
us off at the theater.

1987
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:50,440
They have
other things to do.

1988
01:46:50,527 --> 01:46:52,977
So, you guys are close,
I guess.

1989
01:46:53,064 --> 01:46:55,353
Yeah, I guess.
We can get closer.

1990
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,842
Bob.

1991
01:47:11,253 --> 01:47:12,762
Stop! Let us out!

1992
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:14,502
Here, large popcorn,
small soda.

1993
01:47:14,589 --> 01:47:16,801
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1994
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:20,403
I'll be back before
the previews are over.

1995
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:31,403
Here comes Elasti Girl

1996
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:34,719
Stretching her arms
Elasti Girl

1997
01:53:34,806 --> 01:53:39,372
No one's beyond her reach

1998
01:53:39,459 --> 01:53:43,233
Elasti Girl

1999
01:53:46,844 --> 01:53:51,804
Ah, Elasti Girl

2000
01:53:53,513 --> 01:53:56,382
Here comes Elasti Girl

2001
01:53:56,505 --> 01:53:59,784
Stretching her arms
Elasti Girl

2002
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:03,667
No one's beyond her reach

2003
01:54:03,754 --> 01:54:11,398
Ah, Elasti Girl

2004
01:54:16,674 --> 01:54:20,604
Who's the cat
who's always chill

2005
01:54:20,717 --> 01:54:25,507
When survival odds
are close to nil?

2006
01:54:25,857 --> 01:54:29,849
Frozone

2007
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:35,085
Frozone

2008
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:38,171
Always chill
Always chill

2009
01:54:39,451 --> 01:54:41,086
Frozone

2010
01:54:41,173 --> 01:54:42,899
Ah

2011
01:54:42,986 --> 01:54:45,549
Frozone

2012
01:54:45,636 --> 01:54:47,919
So chill
So chill

2013
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:49,542
Talk about Frozone

2014
01:54:49,629 --> 01:54:53,006
Frozone

2015
01:54:57,048 --> 01:54:58,711
Frozone

2016
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:10,507
Mr. Incredible

2017
01:55:10,594 --> 01:55:13,684
Incredible

2018
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:17,830
Catching the bad guys
Pow, pow, pow

2019
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:26,523
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

2020
01:55:34,085 --> 01:55:36,239
Mr. Incredible

2021
01:55:36,326 --> 01:55:39,570
Incredible

2022
01:55:39,657 --> 01:55:41,292
Punching the bad guys

2023
01:55:41,379 --> 01:55:46,116
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
