Well, unless you've got a go-cart

882
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,824
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

883
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,284

right? And I want to race.

893
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,063
So here's what I'm thinking.

894
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:11,441
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

895
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,569
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

896
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,281
You want me to help you?

897
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,741
All you got to do is
break something for me.

898
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,577
Come on. What do you say, friend?

899
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,288
We are not friends.

900
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,458
Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun.

901
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,961
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

902

Do we have a deal or not?

906

(GRUNTS) You better win.

907
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,229
Well, I'll say this much,

they don't call your friend
"Wreck-it" for nothing.

909

There's the shuttle.

910
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,239
Is he in there?

911
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,284
Nope. Lucky for him.

912
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,953
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

913

No Cy-Bug, either.

914
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,418
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

915
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,004
It came this way,

916
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,756
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

917
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,299

918

Can't get a read on it.

919
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,219
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

920
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:22,471
Why did he go AWOL?

921
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,097
I wish I knew, ma'am.

922
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,933
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

923
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,644
Going on about cake and medals...

924
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:32,689
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

925
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,024
"Go Turbo"?

926
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,943
That's right,

927
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,489
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

928
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:43,408
Turbo Time <i>was by far
the most popular game.</i>

932
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,251
<i>and stole Turbo's thunder...</i>

933
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,836
New game. All right!

934
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,838
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

935
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,343
<i>So jealous that
he abandoned his game</i>

936
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,011
<i>and tried to take over the new one.</i>

937
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,305

That looks like Turbo.

940
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,480

in this game? Aw, come on!

941

Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

Yes. Yes, that's him!

1248
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,924
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

for so long, and now...

I'm going to puke, actually.
