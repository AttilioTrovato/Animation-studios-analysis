1
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,518
Get up!

2
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,594
The winner,

3
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:18,496
by total annihilation.

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,529
Yama!

5
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,841
Who is next?

6
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,933
Who has the guts to step into the ring,

7
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,125
with Little Yama?

8
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,940
Can I try?

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,272
I have a robot.

10
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:33,874
I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,960
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,475
House rules.

13
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:44,886
You gotta pay to play.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
Is this enough?

15
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,371
What's your name, little boy?

16
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,824
Hiro.

17
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,326
Hiro Hamada.

18
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,968
Prepare your bot, Zero.

19
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,410
Two bots enter,

20
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,688
one bot leaves.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,801
Fighters ready?

22
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Fight!

23
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,141
That was my first fight.

24
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,167
I... Can I try again?

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,210
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

26
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
Go home.

27
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
I've got more money.

28
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Fighters ready?

29
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Fight!

30
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,032
Mega-bot.

31
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:51,634
Destroy.

32
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,180
What?

33
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,217
No more Little Yama.

34
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,319
But, wha...

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,290
This is not possible!

36
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,088
Hey I, I'm as surprised as you are.

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
Beginner's luck.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,049
Do you want to go again,

39
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,351
Yama?

40
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,652
No one hustles Yama!

41
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:36,623
Hey...

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,060
Teach him a lesson.

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,386
Hey, fellas.

44
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,970
Let's talk about this.

45
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,336
Hiro! Get on!

46
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,010
Tadashi!

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,441
Good timing!

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,681
Oh, mama!

49
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,447
Are you ok?
Yeah.

50
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,767
Are you hurt?
No.

51
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,544
Then what were you thinking,
knucklehead?

52
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
You graduated high school when you
were 13 and this is what you're doing?

53
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:13,884
There they are!

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
Hey!

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Hold on!

56
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,840
Yes!

57
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,171
Get back here.

58
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,320
Bot fighting is illegal.

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,324
You're going to get yourself arrested.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,288
Bot fighting is not illegal.

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,476
Betting on bot fighting, that's,
that's illegal, but...

62
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,202
so lucrative!

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,938
I'm on a roll, big brother!

64
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,484
And there is no stopping me!

65
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Oh, no.

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,801
Hi, aunt Cass.

67
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,315
Are you guys ok?

68
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,090
Tell me you're ok.

69
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,586
We're fine.
We're ok.

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Oh, good.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,849
Then what were you two
knuckleheads thinking?

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,401
For 10 years,

73
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,402
I have done the best
I could to raise you.

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,371
Have I been perfect? No.

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,409
Do I know anything about children? No.

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,540
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?

77
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Probably!

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,660
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.

79
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,202
Sorry.
We love you, aunt Cass.

80
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,540
Well, I love you, too!

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.

82
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,880
On beat poetry night.

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Stress eating.

84
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,549
Because of you.

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,860
Come on, Mochi.

86
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,364
This is really good!

87
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
You better make this up to aunt Cass
before she eats everything in the cafe.

88
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,424
For sure.

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,460
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Absolutely.

91
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

92
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,344
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.

93
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
When are you gonna
start doing something

94
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:50,684
with that big brain of yours?

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,580
What? Go to college like you?

96
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,780
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,547
Unbelievable.

98
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,883
What would Mom and Dad say?

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,121
I don't know.

100
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,380
They're gone.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,780
They died when I was three, remember?

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Hey!

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,163
I'll take you.

104
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:10,963
Really?

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
I can't stop you from going,

106
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,040
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.

107
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,184
Sweet.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,828
What are we doing at your nerd school?

109
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,460
Bot-fight's that way!

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,760
Gotta grab something.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,846
Is this gonna take long?

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,051
Relax, you big baby.

113
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:31,153
We'll be in and out.

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,871
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

115
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,839
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

116
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Heads up!

117
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Electro-mag suspension?

118
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,720
Hey!

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,660
Who are you?

120
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,379
I'm...

121
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,480
Go. Go, this is my brother. Hiro.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,620
Welcome to the nerd lab.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Yeah.

124
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,491
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,220
Zero resistance, faster bike.

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,004
But, not fast enough...

127
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
yet.

128
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,258
Do not move.

129
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,783
Behind the line, please.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,017
Hey, Wasabi.

131
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,219
This is my brother, Hiro.

132
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,818
Hello, Hiro.

133
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,220
Prepare to be amazed.

134
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Catch.

135
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,883
Laser-induced plasma?

136
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:42,799
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,034
With a little magnetic confinement for...

138
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,736
ultra-precision.

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,049
How do you find anything
in this mess?

140
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,641
I have a system.

141
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,080
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

142
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:53,729
Need this!

143
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:54,479
You can't do that!

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,498
This is anarchy!

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,619
Society has rules!

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,324
Excuse me!

147
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,620
Coming through!

148
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,606
Tadashi!

149
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,132
Oh, my gosh.

150
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,731
You must be Hiro!

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,680
I've heard so much about you!

152
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,169
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,824
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,839
400 pounds of it!

155
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
Come here, come here, come here.

156
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,605
You're going to love this.

157
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,027
A dash of perchloric acid,

158
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:22,890
a smidge of cobalt,

159
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

160
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,200
super-heated to 500 Kelvin and...

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,662
Ta-da!

162
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:34,783
It's pretty great?

163
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,639
It's so pink.

164
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
Here's the best part.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
I know, right?

166
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Chemical metal embrittlement.

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

168
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,726
Honey Lemon? Gogo? Wasabi?

169
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.

170
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,406
One time!

171
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,648
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,500
Who's Fred?

173
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,871
This guy, right here!

174
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,783
Don't be alarmed.

175
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:03,488
It is just a suit.

176
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,140
This is not my real face and body.

177
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,327
The name's Fred.

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,362
School mascot by day,

179
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:09,405
but by night...

180
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,719
I am also a school mascot.

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
So, what's your major?

182
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

183
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,764
But I am, a major science enthusiast.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

185
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,090
that can turn me into
a fire-breathing lizard at will.

186
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,527
But she says that's, not science.

187
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,999
It's really not.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,490
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

189
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,444
I asked Wasabi for isn't science either.

190
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,647
Is it?
Nope.

191
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,719
Well then, what about
invisible sandwich?

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,688
Hiro.
Imagine eating a sandwich,

193
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,239
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

194
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Just stop.

195
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,201
Laser eyes?
What?

196
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,124
Tingly fingers?
Never gonna happen.

197
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,520
Hey, what about a growth serum?

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,308
So...

199
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,610
what have you been working on?

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
I'll show you.

201
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Duct tape?

202
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,680
I hate to break it to you, bro.

203
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
Already been invented.

204
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Hey!

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,140
Dude!

206
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,920
This is what I've been working on.

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,522
Hello. I am Baymax.

208
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,960
Your personal healthcare companion.

209
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,820
I was alerted to the need for
medical attention when you said;

210
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,522
A robotic nurse.

211
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,969
On a scale of 1 to 10,

212
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,523
how would you rate your pain?

213
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Physical or emotional?

214
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,886
I will scan you now.

215
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,500
Scan complete.

216
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,722
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,441
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,084
What's in the spray, specifically?

219
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,204
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

220
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,846
That's a bummer.
I'm actually allergic to that.

221
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,100
You do have a mild allergy to...

223
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
peanuts.

224
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,210
Not bad.

225
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,886
You've done some serious
coding on this thing?

226
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,140
Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

227
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,480
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,561
Vinyl?

229
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,740
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,

230
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:32,810
huggable kind of thing.

231
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

232
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,651
No offense.
I am a robot.

233
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,380
I cannot be offended.

234
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
<i>Hyperspectral cameras?
Yep.</i>

235
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,929
<i>Titanium skeleton?
Carbon fiber.</i>

236
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,140
<i>Right. Even lighter.</i>

237
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,727
<i>Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?</i>

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,490
Machined them right here, in-house.

239
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,740
Really?
Yup.

240
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,780
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,020
Shut up.

242
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,137
You have been a good boy.

243
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,439
Have a lollipop.

244
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,740
Nice.

245
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,325
I cannot deactivate until you say,
you are satisfied with your care.

246
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,600
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

247
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,489
He's going to help a lot of people.

248
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,540
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

249
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,761
Lithium ion.

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,640
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

251
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

252
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,420
Hey, Professor.

253
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,169
Actually, I was just finishing up.

254
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,387
You must be Hiro.

255
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,031
Bot-fighter, right?

256
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,973
When my daughter was younger,

257
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:34,665
that's all she wanted to do.

258
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
May I?

259
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,800
Sure.

260
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,020
Magnetic-bearing servos.

261
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,400
Pretty sick?

262
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Wanna see how I put them together?

263
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,020
Hey, genius!

264
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
He invented them.

265
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,647
You're Robert Callaghan?

266
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,080
Like as in...

267
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,300
the Callaghan-Catmull spline,

268
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,159
and Callaghan's Laws of Robotics?

269
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,161
That's right.

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,004
Ever think about applying here?

271
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,566
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

272
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,801
I don't know.

273
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,723
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

274
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:05,447
Well, kind of serious.

275
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
I can see why.

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,968
With your bot, winning must come easy.

277
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,090
Yeah, I guess.

278
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,606
Well, if you like things easy,

279
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:15,411
then my program isn't for you.

280
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,981
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

281
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,460
My students go on to shape the future.

282
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,325
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

283
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,931
Good luck with the bot-fights.

284
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,846
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.

285
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,645
I have to go here.

286
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,330
If I don't go to this nerd school,

287
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,726
I'm gonna lose my mind.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,126
How do I get in?

289
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

290
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,804
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away,

291
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:45,804
you're in.

292
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,804
But, it's gotta be great.

293
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,940
Trust me.

294
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
It will be.

295
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,601
Nothing!

296
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,980
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

297
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,103
Washed up at 14.

298
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,427
So sad.

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,539
I got nothing!

300
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,439
I'm done. I'm never getting in.

301
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,050
Hey,

302
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,952
I'm not giving up on you.

303
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,246
What are you doing?

304
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
Shake things up.

305
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,201
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

306
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,171
What?

307
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:27,409
Look for a new angle.

308
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,600
A lot of sweet tech here today.

309
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,680
How are you feeling?

310
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,437
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

311
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,239
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

312
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,040
Yep, he's nervous.

313
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

314
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,984
He's so tense.
No, I'm not.

315
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,340
Relax, Hiro.

316
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,040
Your tech is amazing.

317
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:26,328
Tell him, Gogo.

318
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,094
Stop whining. Woman up.

319
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm fine!

320
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,788
What do you need, little man?

321
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,390
Deodorant? Breath mint?

322
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,601
Fresh pair of underpants?

323
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,780
Underpants?
You need serious help.

324
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,980
Hey, I come prepared.

325
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,020
I haven't done laundry in six months.

326
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
One pair lasts me four days.

327
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,960
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.

328
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,644
Then I go front and back.

329
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,279
That is both disgusting and awesome.

330
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,406
Don't encourage him.

331
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,140
It's called, recycling.

332
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,810
<i>Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.</i>

333
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,460
Oh, yeah. This is it.

334
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,841
I guess I'm up.

335
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Ok, ok. Photo, photo!
Everybody say, Hiro.

336
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,469
Hiro!

337
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,026
Yeah!

338
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

339
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
Don't mess it up.
Break a leg, little man.

340
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,647
Science, yeah!

341
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,844
Alright, bro.

342
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,009
This is it.

343
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging.

344
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
What's going on?

345
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,940
I really want to go here.

346
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Hey.

347
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,300
You got this.

348
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
<i>Hi.</i>

349
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
<i>My name is Hiro...</i>

350
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
<i>Sorry.</i>

351
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
<i>My name is Hiro Hamada,</i>

352
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,440
<i>and I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.</i>

353
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,540
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

354
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
<i>This, is a microbot.</i>

355
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Breathe.

356
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,119
<i>It doesn't look like much, but...</i>

357
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
<i> when it links up
with the rest of its pals...</i>

358
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,040
<i>things get a little more interesting.</i>

359
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,802
<i>The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.</i>

360
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
<i>I think what I want them to do...</i>

361
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,340
<i>They do it.</i>

362
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,720
<i>The applications for this tech
are limitless.</i>

363
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,260
<i>Construction.</i>

364
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,100
<i>What used to take teams
of people working by hand</i>

365
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,701
<i>for months or years,</i>

366
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,451
<i>can now be accomplished,
by one person.</i>

367
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>That's just the beginning.</i>

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,140
<i>How about transportation?</i>

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>Microbots can move anything anywhere,</i>

370
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,780
<i>with ease.</i>

371
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,673
<i>If you can think it,</i>

372
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,575
<i>the microbots can do it.</i>

373
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,340
<i>The only limit is your imagination.</i>

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,100
<i>Microbots!</i>

375
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,291
That's my nephew!

376
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,567
Yes!

377
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,366
My family! I love my family!

378
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,166
Nailed it!

379
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,169
You did it!
Not bad!

380
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,249
Yeah! Yeah!

381
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,599
You just blew my mind, dude!

382
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,019
They loved you.
That was amazing!

383
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Yes.

384
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,445
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.

385
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,500
Alistair Krei!

386
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,327
May I?

387
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Extraordinary.

388
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

389
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,860
Shut up.

390
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,725
Mr. Krei is right.

391
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,725
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.

392
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,530
You can continue to develop them,

393
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,205
or you can sell them to a man

394
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,402
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.

395
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,340
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

396
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,567
but it shouldn't affect...

397
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,120
This is your decision, Hiro.

398
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,561
But you should know

399
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,719
Mr. Krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science

400
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,721
to get where he is.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,001
That's just not true.

402
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,765
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech
with your microbots,

403
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,720
or anything else.

404
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,860
Hiro, I'm offering you more money
than any 14-year-old could imagine.

405
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,069
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

406
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,364
but they're not for sale.

407
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,940
I thought you were smarter than that.

408
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Robert.

409
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,931
Mr. Krei.

410
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,291
That's my brother's.

411
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
That's right.

412
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,089
I look forward to seeing you in class.

413
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,320
Unbelievable!

414
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
That's what I'm talking about.

415
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:29,242
Alright, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.

416
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,701
Back to the café!

417
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,962
Dinner is on me!

418
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,863
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,227
aunt Cass?

420
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,346
We'll... We'll catch up, ok?

421
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,620
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

422
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,750
Both... Both. Both of you.

423
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,120
Thanks, aunt Cass.

424
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,165
I know what you're going to say.

425
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,279
I should be proud of myself,

426
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,040
because I'm finally using my gift
for something important.

427
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,040
No, no. I was just gonna tell you
your fly was down for the whole show.

428
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Hilarious.

429
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
What?

430
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

431
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
Hey, I...

432
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,500
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, so...

433
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
you know,

434
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,325
thanks for not giving up on me.

435
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,007
Are you ok?

436
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,500
Yeah. I'm ok.

437
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:45,401
But. But Professor Callaghan
is still in there.

438
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,300
Tadashi, no!

439
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,020
Callaghan's in there.

440
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,920
Someone has to help.

441
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,020
<i>Tadashi!</i>

442
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,860
<i>Tadashi!</i>

443
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,680
Here. Have some tea.

444
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,124
Hey, sweetie.

445
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,561
Hey, aunt Cass.

446
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,759
Mrs. Matsuda's in the café.

447
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,840
She's wearing something super
inappropriate for an 80 year old.

448
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,285
That always cracks you up.

449
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,360
You should come down.

450
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,500
Maybe later.

451
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,925
The university called again.

452
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,164
It's been a few weeks
since classes started but...

453
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,540
They said it's not too late to register.

454
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,603
Ok. Thanks.

455
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,505
I'll think about it.

456
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,841
<i>Hey, Hiro.</i>

457
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,831
<i>We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.</i>

458
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,320
<i>We wish you were here, buddy.</i>

459
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,205
<i>Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,</i>

460
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,561
<i>it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,</i>

461
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,006
<i>and give you a big hug.</i>

462
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,449
Hello. I am Baymax,

463
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,923
your personal healthcare companion.

464
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,930
Hey, Baymax.

465
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,765
I didn't know you were still active.

466
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,860
I heard a sound of distress.

467
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,631
What seems to be the trouble?

468
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,120
I just stubbed my toe a little.

469
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,406
I'm fine.

470
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,603
On a scale of 1 to 10,

471
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,105
how would you rate your pain?

472
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,880
A zero. I'm ok, really.

473
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,163
Thanks. You can shrink now.

474
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,851
Does it hurt when I touch it?

475
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,880
That's ok. No, no touching.

476
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm fine...

477
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,921
You have fallen.

478
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
You think?

479
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,606
On a scale of 1 to...

480
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
On a scale...

481
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
On a sca...

482
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
On a scale of 1 to 10...

483
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,680
On a scale of 1 to 10,

484
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:41,182
how would you rate your pain?

485
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Zero.

486
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,322
It is alright to cry.
No. No, no, no, no.

487
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,525
Crying is a natural response to pain.

488
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I'm not crying.

489
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,140
I will scan you for injuries.
Don't scan me.

490
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Scan complete.
Unbelievable.

491
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,670
You have sustained no injuries.

492
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,659
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels

493
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,425
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings,

494
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,686
common in adolescence.

495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,902
Diagnosis.

496
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Puberty.

497
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
What?

498
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Ok.

499
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,248
Time to shrink now.

500
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,369
You should expect an increase
in body hair,

501
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,237
especially on your face,

502
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,003
chest, armpits, and...

503
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,366
Thank you! That's enough.

504
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,171
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.

505
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,093
Ok!

506
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:20,165
Let's get you back in your luggage.

507
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,325
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

508
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,006
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

509
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,180
My microbot?

510
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,943
This doesn't make any sense.

511
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,427
Puberty can often be a confusing time

512
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,640
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.

513
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,762
No.

514
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:52,377
The thing is attracted
to the other microbots but...

515
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:55,179
that's impossible.
They were destroyed in the fire.

516
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,820
Dumb thing's broken.

517
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,100
Your tiny robot is trying
to go somewhere.

518
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Oh, yeah?

519
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,720
Why don't you...

520
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:14,887
find out where it's trying to go?

521
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?

522
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,020
Absolutely.

523
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Baymax?

524
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Baymax?

525
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Baymax?

526
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
What?

527
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,914
Hiro?

528
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,363
Hey! Hey, aunt Cass!

529
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
You're up and...
Yeah.

530
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,940
I figured it was time.

531
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,769
Are you registering for school?

532
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,120
Yes.

533
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,546
I thought about what you said.

534
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:58,121
Really inspired me.

535
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,044
Oh, honey, that's so great.

536
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,660
Ok.

537
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,326
Special dinner tonight.

538
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,510
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

539
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:04,999
Yeah.

540
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,487
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.

541
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,432
Ok, sounds good.

542
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:10,231
Great!

543
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Last hug.

544
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Baymax!

545
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Baymax!

546
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,361
Watch it!

547
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Baymax!

548
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
Baymax!

549
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
Are you crazy?

550
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,190
What are you doing?

551
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,060
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.

552
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,579
I told you,

553
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,781
it's broken.
It's not trying to go...

554
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Locked.

555
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
There is a window.

556
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,960
Please exercise caution.

557
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,641
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.

558
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Oh, no.

559
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,100
Excuse me, while I let out some air.

560
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,441
Are you done?

561
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes.

562
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,320
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

563
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,100
Fine, just keep it down.

564
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,400
My microbots?

565
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,620
Someone's making more.

566
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Hiro?

567
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,608
You gave me, a heart attack!

568
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,004
My hands are equipped with defibrillators.

569
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:32,464
Clear.
Stop!

570
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,580
Stop, stop!
It's just an expression.

571
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Oh, no.

572
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,486
Run!

573
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,560
Oh, come on!

574
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,161
I am not fast.

575
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah, no kidding!

576
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,940
Go! Go! Come on.

577
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
Kick it down!

578
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,880
Then punch it!

579
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Go! Go!

580
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,860
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

581
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Move it!

582
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,646
Come on!

583
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
No, no.

584
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,205
Come on!

585
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,207
The window!

586
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,326
Suck it in!

587
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Baymax!

588
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Hiro?

589
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Come on, let's get out of here.

590
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,420
Go! Hurry!

591
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,820
Alright, let me get this straight.

592
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,279
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

593
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,708
with an army of miniature flying robots.

594
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,081
Microbots.

595
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,209
Microbots.
Yeah.

596
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,060
He was controlling them telepathically
with a neurocranial transmitter.

597
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,046
So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP,

598
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,840
to attack you and balloon man.

599
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,660
Did you file a report
when your flying robots were stolen?

600
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,968
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

601
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,290
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but Baymax was there, too.

602
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,284
Tell him.
Yes, officer.

603
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,360
He's telling the truth.

604
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,080
What the...
What's wrong with you?

605
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,500
Low battery.

606
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,330
<i>Try to keep it together.</i>

607
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,563
I'm healthcare,

608
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,446
your personal Baymax companion.

609
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,740
Kid,

610
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:38,697
how about we call your parents
and get them down here?

611
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:39,761
What?

612
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Write your name and number down
on this piece of paper and we can...

613
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,540
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.

614
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,961
Can you walk?

615
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,760
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.

616
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Healthcare.

617
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Ok.

618
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,768
If my aunt asks,
we were at school all day.

619
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,243
Got it?

620
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,721
We jumped out a window.

621
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
No! Quiet!

622
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,180
We jumped out a window.

623
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
You can't say things like that
around aunt Cass.

624
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hiro?

625
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,521
You home, sweetie?

626
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,567
That's right.

627
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,360
I thought I heard you.

628
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:41,207
Hey.

629
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,528
Hey, aunt Cass.

630
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,843
Look at my little college man.

631
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,360
I can't wait to hear all about it!

632
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,501
And wings are almost ready.

633
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:50,559
Winnn...

634
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Will you be quiet?

635
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,720
Yeah, wings!

636
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,401
Alright, get ready to have
your face melted.

637
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,540
We are gonna feel
these things tomorrow.

638
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,091
You know what I'm saying?

639
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Ok.

640
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,260
Sit down. Tell me everything.

641
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
The thing is that,

642
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,119
since I registered so late,

643
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.

644
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,420
What was that?

645
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Mochi.

646
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,500
That darn cat.

647
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
At least take a plate for the road, ok?

648
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Don't work too...
Thanks for understanding.

649
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,451
Hairy baby.

650
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:38,971
Hairy baby.

651
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,240
Alright, come on.

652
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,310
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

653
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,180
One foot in front of the other.

654
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,840
This doesn't make any sense.

655
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,640
Tadashi.

656
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
What?

657
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Tadashi.

658
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,660
Tadashi's gone.

659
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,480
When will he return?

660
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,980
He's dead, Baymax.

661
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,240
Tadashi was in excellent health.

662
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,919
With a proper diet and exercise,

663
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,821
he should have lived a long life.

664
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Yeah,

665
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:37,957
he should have.

666
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,680
But there was a fire...

667
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,280
Now, he's gone.

668
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,318
Tadashi is here.

669
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,882
No.

670
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,520
People keep saying
he's not really gone.

671
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,460
As long as we remember him.

672
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,200
It still hurts.

673
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,320
I see no evidence of physical injury.

674
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,420
It's a different kind of hurt.

675
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,740
You are my patient.

676
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,260
I would like to help.

677
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,740
You can't fix this one, buddy.

678
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,241
What are you doing?

679
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,280
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.

680
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,280
Database downloaded.

681
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,982
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.

682
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,406
I am contacting them now.

683
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,239
No, no, no! I... I...
Don't do that.

684
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Your friends have been contacted.

685
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Unbelievable.

686
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,287
Now, what are you doing?

687
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,290
Other treatments include,
compassion and physical reassurance.

688
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,720
I'm ok. Really.

689
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,463
You will be alright.

690
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,265
There, there.

691
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,720
Thanks, Baymax.

692
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,282
I am sorry about the fire.

693
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,620
It's ok. It was an accident.

694
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,620
Unless...

695
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,960
Unless it wasn't.

696
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,787
At the showcase that...

697
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,201
that guy in the mask stole
my microbots and...

698
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,540
and set the fire to cover his tracks.

699
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
He's responsible for Tadashi.

700
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,060
We gotta catch that guy.

701
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,460
<i>It's alive!</i>

702
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,387
<i>It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!</i>

703
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,720
If we're gonna catch that guy,

704
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,220
you need some upgrades.

705
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,340
Will apprehending the man in the mask
improve your emotional state?

706
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,640
Absolutely.

707
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,846
Let's work on your moves.

708
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Now, let's take care of this.

709
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,580
I have some concerns.

710
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,860
This armor may undermine
my non-threatening, huggable design.

711
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,844
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

712
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,007
You look sick.

713
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,060
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

714
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,885
It's just an expression.

715
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,860
<i>Data transfer complete.</i>

716
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,803
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.

717
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,482
<i>You want to keep me healthy, don't you?</i>

718
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,820
<i>Punch this.</i>

719
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,791
Yes!

720
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,024
Hammerfist!

721
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Side kick!

722
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Knifehand!

723
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
Back kick!

724
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,561
Gummy bears!

725
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Yes!

726
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,210
Yeah! Fist bump!

727
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,606
Fist bump?

728
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,081
Is not in my fighting database.

729
00:43:52,182 --> 00:43:54,382
No this, this isn't a fighting thing, it's...

730
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,320
what people do sometimes
when they're...

731
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,243
excited or pumped up.

732
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,200
Hey, now you're getting it.

733
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,800
I will add fist bump
to my care-giving matrix.

734
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,120
Alright.
Let's go get that guy.

735
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,900
Come on!

736
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,251
Get him, Baymax!

737
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,260
We're too late.

738
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,980
Your tiny robot is trying
to go somewhere.

739
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Come on.

740
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,720
Always wait one hour after eating
before swimming.

741
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,121
Hey!

742
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Come on!

743
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,080
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

744
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,925
Ok Baymax,

745
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,327
time to use those upgrades.

746
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,716
Hiro?

747
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:11,455
No, no, no!

748
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,039
Get out of here! Go!

749
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

750
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,220
Nothing! Just, out for a walk.

751
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,239
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

752
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,287
Is that Baymax?

753
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,020
Yeah, but you really...

754
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,920
Why is he wearing carbon
fiber underpants?

755
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,680
I also know karate.

756
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,980
You guys need to go.

757
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,976
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

758
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:32,879
We're here for you.
That's why Baymax contacted us.

759
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,359
Those who suffer a loss,

760
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,260
require support from
friends and loved ones.

761
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,039
Ok, but I...

762
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,883
Who would like
to share their feelings first?

763
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,280
I'll go. Ok.

764
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,101
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...

765
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,884
Holy mother of Megazon!

766
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,808
Am I the only one seeing this?

767
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,140
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

768
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,680
Go!

769
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,640
Go Baymax! Get him!

770
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,629
No, no, no, no, no!

771
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:07,165
What are you...
What are you doing?

772
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,406
I'm saving your life.

773
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,500
Baymax can handle that guy!

774
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,300
Oh, no.

775
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,140
Wasabi!

776
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,060
Goodbye!

777
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,916
Hiro. Explanation.

778
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:24,419
Now.

779
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,720
He stole my microbots.

780
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:26,772
He started the fire.

781
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,460
I don't know who he is!

782
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,360
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

783
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Hard left!

784
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,926
That mask,

785
00:47:53,928 --> 00:47:54,882
the black suit...

786
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,202
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!

787
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,965
I mean, how cool is that?

788
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,242
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!

789
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,805
Why are we stopped?

790
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,881
The light's red!

791
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,521
There are no red lights in a car chase!

792
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,340
Why is he trying to kill us?

793
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,000
Why are you trying to kill us?

794
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,876
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!

795
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,311
Let's not jump to conclusions.

796
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,439
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

797
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,441
Car!

798
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,820
He's trying to kill us!

799
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,380
Did you just put your blinker on?

800
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,805
You have to indicate your turn!

801
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,060
It's the law!

802
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,220
That's it.

803
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,881
Stop the car!

804
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,480
Baymax and I can take this guy!

805
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,460
Seatbelts save lives.

806
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,171
Buckle up, every time.

807
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,002
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

808
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,728
Did we lose him?
Look out!

809
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,180
Baymax, hold on!

810
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,332
We're not gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

811
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,733
No! We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

812
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,634
We're not gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

813
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,580
We made it!

814
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,181
Yes!

815
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
I told you we'd make it!

816
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,922
Your injuries require my attention.

817
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,228
And your body temperatures are low.

818
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,847
We should get out of here.

819
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,580
I know a place.

820
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,700
Where are we?

821
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
Fred.

822
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,200
Where are you going?

823
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

824
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,344
That's French for front door.

825
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,184
It's really not.

826
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,701
Listen, nitwit.

827
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,286
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

828
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,785
I'm not in the mood for any...

829
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,599
Welcome home, Master Frederick.

830
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,400
Heathcliff, my man!

831
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys.
We'll be safe in here.

832
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,007
Gimme some.

833
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Freddie,

834
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,800
this is your house?

835
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,804
I thought you lived under a bridge.

836
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,319
Well, technically, it
belongs to my parents.

837
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,429
They're on a vacay, on the family island.

838
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,000
We should totally go some time.
Frolic.

839
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,760
You gotta be kidding me.

840
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,380
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

841
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,241
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

842
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,280
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

843
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,610
Your body temperature is still low.

844
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,740
Yeah.

845
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,486
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

846
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,400
It's so nice.

847
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,164
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

848
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,220
Good robot.

849
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,968
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

850
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,961
Yes! It's a bird!

851
00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:30,965
No!

852
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,400
The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.

853
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,880
Apprehending the man in the mask,

854
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:37,959
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

855
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,360
Apprehend him?

856
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,000
We don't even know who he is.

857
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,740
I have a theory.

858
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,803
Dr. Slaughter, MD?

859
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,199
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

860
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,831
Malcolm Chazzletick.

861
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,119
The Annihilator?

862
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,153
Behind the mask,

863
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:55,107
industrialist, Reid Axworthy.

864
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,067
Baron von Destruct?

865
00:52:58,269 --> 00:52:59,269
Just get to the point!

866
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,361
Don't you guys get it?

867
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,807
The man in the mask who attacked us,

868
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,460
is none other than...

869
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
Voilà!

870
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,599
Alistair Krei.

871
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,564
What?

872
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:09,291
Think about it.

873
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,942
Krei wanted your microbots,

874
00:53:10,944 --> 00:53:11,888
and you said no.

875
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,521
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

876
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,090
There's no way.

877
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,492
The guy is too high profile.

878
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,704
Then who was that guy in the mask?

879
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,140
I don't know.

880
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,402
We don't know anything about him.

881
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,940
His blood type is AB-negative.

882
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,206
Cholesterol levels are...

883
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,830
Baymax, you scanned him?

884
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,804
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

885
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes!

886
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,179
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

887
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,880
You'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

888
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,234
That might take,

889
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:41,885
I don't know, forever.

890
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,320
No, no, no, no. I...

891
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,380
I just have to look for another angle.

892
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,407
Got it!

893
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,640
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

894
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,540
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

895
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,643
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

896
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,609
I need to upgrade all of you.

897
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,127
Upgrade who, now?

898
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,729
Those who suffer a loss,

899
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:05,664
require support from friends
and loved ones.

900
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,320
Ok, I like where this is heading!

901
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,960
We can't go against that guy!

902
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:10,807
We're nerds!

903
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,471
Hiro, we want to help but...

904
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,529
we're just, us.

905
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
No.

906
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,203
You can be, way more.

907
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,740
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

908
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,680
We're in.

909
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,500
Can you feel it?

910
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:28,679
You guys, do you feel this?

911
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,780
Our origin story begins.

912
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
We're gonna be superheroes!

913
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,720
Arms up.

914
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,323
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

915
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,760
We get the mask,

916
00:54:39,062 --> 00:54:40,762
and he can't control the bots.

917
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Game over.

918
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,200
Super Jump!

919
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,720
Super Jump!

920
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,540
I breathe fire.

921
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,080
I love it!

922
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:39,081
Not bad.

923
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,320
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

924
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Hey, guys!

925
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,940
Check this out.

926
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,260
I'd like to introduce,

927
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,540
Baymax 2.0.

928
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,740
He's glorious.

929
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,040
Hello.

930
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Hold up. Focus.

931
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,320
Show them what you got, buddy.

932
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,327
The fist, show them the fist.

933
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,420
No, not that.

934
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,720
The thing, the other thing.

935
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,723
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

936
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,200
That's just one of his new upgrades!

937
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,120
Baymax, wings.

938
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,500
No way!

939
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,400
Thrusters.

940
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,286
I fail to see how flying

941
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,393
makes me a better
healthcare companion.

942
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,749
I fail to see how you fail to see
that it's awesome!

943
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Full thrust.

944
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,601
Steady, big guy.

945
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,530
Look, let's just take this slow.

946
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,688
Up, up, up, up, up!

947
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,126
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

948
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,930
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

949
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,525
Too much thrust!

950
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,961
No, no, no, no!

951
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,207
Back on! Back on!

952
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,606
On! On! On!

953
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,280
Zoom...

954
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,290
Go up! Up, up, up!

955
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360
Up!

956
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,720
Oh, man!

957
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,662
Maybe...

958
00:58:43,864 --> 00:58:45,264
Maybe enough flying,

959
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:46,265
<i>today.</i>

960
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,060
<i>What do you say?</i>

961
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,051
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.

962
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,380
Which means what?

963
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,020
The treatment is working.

964
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,731
Oh, no!

965
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,286
No, no, no, no, no!

966
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,844
Baymax!

967
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Yes!

968
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Yeah!

969
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
Yes!

970
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
That was...

971
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,900
That was...

972
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,720
Sick.

973
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,720
It is just an expression.

974
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,160
That's. That's right, buddy.

975
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,940
I am never taking the bus again.

976
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,000
Your emotional state has improved.

977
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,321
I can deactivate if you say
you are satisfied with your care.

978
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
What?

979
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,180
No, no, I don't want you to deactivate.

980
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,620
We still have to find that guy.

981
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,930
So, fire up that super-sensor.

982
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,000
Functionality improved.

983
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,880
1000% increase in range.

984
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,480
I have found a match...

985
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,849
on that island.

986
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,448
Killer view.
Yeah. If I...

987
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,380
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

988
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,886
I'd probably love this.

989
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,460
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

990
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,698
There.

991
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,800
Baymax, take us in.

992
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,681
Awesome!

993
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,321
Our first landing together as a team.

994
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,760
Guys, come on.

995
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,367
Quarantine?

996
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,651
Do you people know
what quarantine means?

997
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,563
Quarantine. Enforced isolation

998
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,919
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,

999
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,670
or in some cases, death.

1000
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,060
There's a skull face on this one.

1001
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,281
A skull face!

1002
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,640
Be ready.

1003
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,380
He could be anywhere.

1004
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,890
Fire!

1005
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,249
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

1006
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,244
That was a bird.

1007
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,147
Well...

1008
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,249
at least we know our gear works.

I will laser-hand you in the face.

1021
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,860
Guys.

1022
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,020
Any sign of him, Baymax?

1023
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,291
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.

1024
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Perfect. The robot's broken.

1025
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,300
Guys, you might want to see this.

1026
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,480
What do you think it is, genius?

1027
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,313
I'm not sure.

1028
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:20,815
But look.

1029
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,481
Hiro.

1030
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,880
Krei.

1031
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,686
<i>That's right.</i>

1032
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,140
<i>We were asked to do the impossible.</i>

1033
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,401
<i>That's what we did.</i>

1034
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,286
<i>We've reinvented
the very concept of transportation.</i>

1035
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,020
<i>Friends, I present Project Silent Sparrow.</i>

1036
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,240
<i>General, may I?</i>

1037
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Magic hat!

1038
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,880
<i>Teleportation.</i>

1039
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,810
<i>The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.</i>

1040
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,620
<i>Not science fiction anymore.</i>

1041
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,249
<i>Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars</i>

1042
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,540
<i>to teleport hats.</i>

1043
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,620
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.</i>

1044
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,065
<i>Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?</i>

1045
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,320
<i>We've invited all these people.</i>

1046
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,300
<i>Might as well give them a show.</i>

1047
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,531
<i>T-minus, 30 seconds, to launch.</i>

1048
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,404
<i>29... 28...
This is Argo.</i>

1049
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,250
<i>Capsule's in position.
27...</i>

1050
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,121
<i>Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.</i>

1051
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,190
<i>Mr. Krei, is there a problem?</i>

1052
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,651
<i>No. No problem.</i>

1053
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
<i>It's well within the parameters.</i>

1054
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,740
<i>Let's move forward.</i>

1055
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,764
<i>3... 2... 1...</i>

1056
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,445
<i>Cabin pressure is go.</i>

1057
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,980
<i>Pod engaged.</i>

1058
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,604
<i>Field breach! Abort!</i>

1059
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
<i>We've lost all contact with the pod.</i>

1060
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,367
Oh, no.

1061
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,160
<i>It's breaking up!
The pilot is gone.</i>

1062
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,860
<i>Portal two is down.</i>

1063
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,010
<i>The magnetic containment field's down!</i>

1064
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,920
<i>Krei, shut it down, now!</i>

1065
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,539
<i>I want this island sealed off!</i>

1066
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,640
The government shut down
Krei's experiment.

1067
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,380
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

1068
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,240
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1069
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,211
Oh, no.

1070
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,660
Baymax, get us out of here.

1071
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,841
Go for the transmitter.

1072
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,080
Behind his mask.

1073
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Baymax!

1074
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,521
Alright, what's the plan?

1075
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,046
It's Fred time.

1076
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,166
Super Jump!

1077
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,847
Gravity Crush!

1078
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,369
Falling hard.

1079
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,166
Seriously, what is the plan?

1080
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,640
Get the mask.

1081
01:07:39,653 --> 01:07:40,928
Right behind you.

1082
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,060
For real, what is the plan?

1083
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,367
Hey!

1084
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,840
Hey!

1085
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,728
You... You want to dance,

1086
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:27,730
masked man?

1087
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,560
Because you'll be dancing
with these.

1088
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,730
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!

1089
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,001
And a little bit of that!

1090
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,409
Hey! I did alright.

1091
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,420
Is that all you got?

1092
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,089
You got that, too?

1093
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,241
It's back into the fire!

1094
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,760
It's over, Krei.

1095
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,208
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1096
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,960
The explosion...

1097
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,961
You died.

1098
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,746
No. I had your microbots.

1099
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,340
But, Tadashi.

1100
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,881
You just let him die.

1101
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,420
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1102
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,005
He went in there to save you!

1103
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,486
That was his mistake!

1104
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,740
Baymax, destroy.

1105
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,319
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.

1106
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,420
Not anymore.

1107
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,523
Hiro, this is not what...

1108
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,360
<i>Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!</i>

1109
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,845
No! Stop, Baymax!

1110
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,727
No, stop! He's getting away!

1111
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,569
Baymax!

1112
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,980
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.

1113
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,726
I regret any distress
I may have caused.

1114
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,360
<i>How could you do that?</i>

1115
01:11:24,423 --> 01:11:25,439
I had him!

1116
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,873
What you just did,

1117
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,351
we never signed up for.

1118
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,668
We said we'd catch the guy.

1119
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,801
That's it.

1120
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,840
I never should have let you help me!

1121
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,160
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1122
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,380
My enhanced scanner
has been damaged.

1123
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,240
Wings.

1124
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,925
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1125
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,120
Fly!

1126
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,640
Hiro!

1127
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,608
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1128
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,009
You appear to be distressed.

1129
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,340
I'm fine!

1130
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,800
<i>There. Is it working?</i>

1131
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,073
My sensor is operational.

1132
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:23,052
<i>Good.</i>

1133
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,360
Then let's get...

1134
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,126
What?

1135
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,679
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?

1136
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,480
<i>Yes. Open!</i>

1137
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,043
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.

1138
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:34,844
Baymax, open your access port.

1139
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,559
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

1140
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,060
<i>Just open!</i>

1141
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,149
Will terminating Professor Callaghan,

1142
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:45,599
improve your emotional state?

1143
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,928
Yes! No! I don't know!

1144
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,001
Open your access!

1145
01:12:49,002 --> 01:12:50,735
Is this what Tadashi wanted?

1146
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:51,682
It doesn't matter!

1147
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,399
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1148
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,100
Tadashi's gone!

1149
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,201
Tadashi's gone.

1150
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,180
Tadashi is here.

1151
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,820
No. He's not here.

1152
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,100
Tadashi is here.

1153
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,927
<i>This is Tadashi Hamada.</i>

1154
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,740
<i>And this is the first test
of my robotics project.</i>

1155
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,281
<i>Hello, I am Baymax.</i>

1156
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,090
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!</i>

1157
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,160
<i>The seventh test of my robotics project.</i>

1158
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,606
<i>Hello, I...</i>

1159
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,964
<i>What? What?</i>

1160
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,249
<i>Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...</i>

1161
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,400
<i>Tadashi Hamada again,</i>

1162
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,180
<i>and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.</i>

1163
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,800
<i>I'm not giving up on you.</i>

1164
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,731
<i>You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.</i>

1165
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,560
<i>So, let's get back to work.</i>

1166
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,891
<i>This is Tadashi Hamada,</i>

1167
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,489
<i>and this is the 84th test.</i>

1168
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,040
<i>What do you say, big guy?</i>

1169
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,921
<i>Hello, I am Baymax,</i>

1170
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,003
<i>your personal healthcare companion.</i>

1171
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,287
<i>It works.</i>

1172
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,641
<i>It works!</i>

1173
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,660
<i>This is amazing! You...</i>

1174
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:17,532
<i>You work!</i>

1175
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,928
<i>I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.</i>

1176
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,281
<i>I knew it.</i>

1177
01:14:21,283 --> 01:14:23,244
<i>Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...</i>

1178
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,640
<i>Ok. Alright, big moment, here.</i>

1179
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,780
<i>Scan me.</i>

1180
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,200
<i>Your neurotransmitter levels
are elevated.</i>

1181
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,448
<i>This indicates that you are happy.</i>

1182
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,967
<i>I am. I really am.</i>

1183
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,644
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1184
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:40,946
<i>Wait till my brother sees you.</i>

1185
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,880
<i>You're gonna help
so many people, buddy.</i>

1186
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,500
<i>So many.</i>

1187
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,913
<i>That's all for now.</i>

1188
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,315
<i>I am satisfied with my care.</i>

1189
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,340
Thank you, Baymax.

1190
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,600
I'm so sorry.

1191
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,080
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1192
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,080
Hiro.

1193
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,418
Guys, I...

1194
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,161
I...

1195
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,400
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1196
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,296
and this time,

1197
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:27,398
we'll do it right.

1198
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,089
But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1199
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,140
Oh, man.
Nah, it's cool.

1200
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,340
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.

1201
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,519
Hiro,

1202
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:41,121
we found something you should see.

1203
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,839
<i>You almost got us all killed!</i>

1204
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,040
<i>Krei! You did this!</i>

1205
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,960
<i>You knew it wasn't ready!</i>

1206
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,880
Callaghan? He was there?

1207
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,710
He was such a good man.

1208
01:15:56,012 --> 01:15:57,012
What happened?

1209
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
I don't know.

1210
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,320
But the answer's here somewhere.

1211
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,560
Wait, wait! Stop.

1212
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,640
There he is.

1213
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,340
With the pilot.

1214
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,100
Hang on.

1215
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,370
<i>We've invited all these people...</i>

1216
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,563
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1217
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,803
Callaghan blames Krei.

1218
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,240
This is a revenge story.

1219
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,980
So, what are we waiting for?

1220
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,768
<i>This beautiful new campus,</i>

1221
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,970
<i>is the culmination of a lifelong dream.</i>

1222
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,968
<i>But none of this would've been possible</i>

1223
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,040
<i>without a few bumps in the road.</i>

1224
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,129
<i>Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path</i>

1225
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,606
<i>to a bright future.</i>

1226
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,780
What is that?

1227
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,450
What?
Setback?

1228
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,327
Was my daughter a setback?

1229
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,762
Callaghan! But you...

1230
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,841
Your daughter, that...

1231
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,320
That was an accident.

1232
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,444
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1233
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,586
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.

1234
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,001
What are you doing?

1235
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,180
You took everything from me when
you sent Abigail into that machine.

1236
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,780
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1237
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,401
No!

1238
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,170
No! No! You can't!

1239
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,891
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.

1240
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,646
Then, it's your turn.

1241
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,080
Professor Callaghan!

1242
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,161
Let him go!

1243
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,200
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1244
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,044
Abigail is gone!

1245
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,994
This won't change anything.

1246
01:18:18,996 --> 01:18:21,365
Trust me, I know.

1247
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,200
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1248
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,481
Please, let me go.

1249
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,100
I'll give you anything you want!

1250
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,243
I want my daughter back!

1251
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,161
Go for the mask!

1252
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,240
Baymax!

1253
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,160
Leaping into action!

1254
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,565
Oh, no!

1255
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,404
Getting a little tight.

1256
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,802
<i>No!
He's too strong!</i>

1257
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,062
<i>There's no way out!
You can't beat him!</i>

1258
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,440
<i>Help! I can't beat him.</i>

1259
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,926
<i>Hiro!</i>

1260
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,287
<i>Hiro? Hiro?
Help!</i>

1261
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,007
That's it!
<i>Hiro.</i>

1262
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,446
I know how to beat him.
<i>Hiro.</i>

1263
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,487
Listen up!

1264
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,926
<i>Use those big brains of yours</i>

1265
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,660
<i>and think your way around the problem.</i>

1266
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,010
<i>Look for a new angle.</i>

1267
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,126
My arms! They can't go any further!

1268
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,609
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1269
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,451
Hello, sign.

1270
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,961
Care to go for a little spin?

1271
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,645
Double spin!

1272
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Behind the back spin!

1273
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,120
Yeah!

1274
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,680
Yeah!

1275
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,480
Baymax!

1276
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Hiro.

1277
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,965
I love that robot!

1278
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,801
Ok, new plan.

1279
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:28,004
Forget the mask.

1280
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,480
Take out the bots.

1281
01:21:29,482 --> 01:21:30,799
They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1282
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,319
Now that is a plan!

1283
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,488
Honey, Fred, can you give us
some cover?

1284
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,250
Like you have to ask.

1285
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,080
Let's do this, Freddie!

1286
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,300
Smokescreen!

1287
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,411
Ready...

1288
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:53,741
and...

1289
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,960
dive!

1290
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,300
The gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!

1291
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,200
Wait.

1292
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,601
Let's use this!

1293
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,480
These are green blades of fury!

1294
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,645
Woman up!

1295
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,360
Double sign-spin.

1296
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,128
Now my signs are on fire!

1297
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,447
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1298
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,513
Back kick.

1299
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:43,798
Knifehand.

1300
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,100
Roundhouse.

1301
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,280
Hammerfist.

1302
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,740
This ends, now!

1303
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,924
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1304
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:02,960
What?

1305
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,160
Baymax!

1306
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:11,980
No!

1307
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,420
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.

1308
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,880
But we'll take that.

1309
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,460
It's still on!
We have to shut it down!

1310
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,079
We can't! The containment
field is failing.

1311
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,980
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1312
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,264
We need to get out of here, now!

1313
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,801
Baymax!

1314
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,167
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1315
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,495
What?

1316
01:24:17,497 --> 01:24:19,297
Coming from there.

1317
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,080
The life signs are female.

1318
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,562
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1319
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,462
Callaghan's daughter.

1320
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:27,208
She's still alive.

1321
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,340
Abigail.

1322
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,286
Let's go get her.

1323
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,419
The portal is destabilizing.

1324
01:24:33,421 --> 01:24:34,506
You'll never make it.

1325
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,370
She's alive in there.

1326
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,060
Someone has to help.

1327
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,760
What do you say, buddy?

1328
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,011
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.

1329
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,761
Careful! There's Krei
Tech debris everywhere.

1330
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,360
Look out!

1331
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,290
I have located the patient.

1332
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,280
Hurry!

1333
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,804
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1334
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,473
I'll guide you out of here.

1335
01:26:14,475 --> 01:26:15,468
Let's go!

1336
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,931
Veer right!

1337
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,842
Ok, to the left.

1338
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,640
Hard right!

1339
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,280
Up and over.

1340
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,818
Ok, level off.

1341
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,620
Easy.

1342
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,280
Nice flying!

1343
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,940
Almost there!

1344
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,441
Baymax!

1345
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,880
Baymax!

1346
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,204
My thrusters are inoperable.

1347
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,281
Just grab hold.

1348
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,100
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.

1349
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,289
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

1350
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,714
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

1351
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:34,956
What about you?

1352
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,879
You are my patient.
Baymax.

1353
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,519
Your health is my only concern.

1354
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,045
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1355
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,765
Are you satisfied with your care?

1356
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,919
No. There's gotta be another way.

1357
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,251
I'm not gonna leave you here.

1358
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:46,811
I'll think of something.

1359
01:27:46,812 --> 01:27:47,912
There is no time.

1360
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,384
Are you satisfied with your care?

1361
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,620
Please! No...

1362
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,164
I can't lose you, too.

1363
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Hiro,

1364
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,100
I will always be with you.

1365
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,500
I'm satisfied with my care.

1366
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,680
Hiro!

1367
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,600
Yeah! They made it!

1368
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,680
Baymax?

1369
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,040
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1370
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,410
Abigail Callaghan.

1371
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,180
Ok, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1372
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,651
We're taking you to the hospital.

1373
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,880
Move it!

1374
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,401
Get in there.

1375
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,149
<i>A massive cleanup continues today,</i>

1376
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,168
<i>at the headquarters
of Krei Tech Industries.</i>

1377
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,919
<i>Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals,</i>

1378
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:12,120
<i>who prevented what could have been
a major catastrophe.</i>

1379
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,726
<i>The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking.</i>

1380
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,359
<i>Who are these heroes?
And where are they now?</i>

1381
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,691
Hey.
Hi.

1382
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,926
It's so exciting.

1383
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,040
Hey, sweetie!

1384
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,560
Ok.

1385
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,040
Last hug.

1386
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,400
Bye!

1387
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,046
And just then I was like...

1388
01:30:34,248 --> 01:30:35,444
Get out of here.

1389
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,019
I am Baymax,

1390
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:22,321
your personal healthcare companion.

1391
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,240
Hello, Hiro.

1392
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,080
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We didn't set out to be superheroes,</i></font>

1393
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,200
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.</i></font>

1394
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,120
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The good thing is, my brother

1395
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,740
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and that's what we're gonna do.</i></font>

1396
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,560
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Who are we?</i></font>

1397
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:56,661

1398
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,143
Dad.

1399
01:40:23,845 --> 01:40:26,245
I just wish I could share 
my accomplishments with you.

1400
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,329
You mean so much to me, 
and honestly,

1401
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,139
I've always felt a distance,

1402
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,040
what with you being on the family
island all the time and...

1403
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,460
I just wish you could see how...

1404
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,001
Fred.

1405
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,841
Son.

1406
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,680
Dad?

1407
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,201
I wear them front, I wear them back.

1408
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,661
I go inside out,

1409
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:13,063
then I go front and back.

1410
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,680
Dad!

1411
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,020
We have a lot to talk about.
