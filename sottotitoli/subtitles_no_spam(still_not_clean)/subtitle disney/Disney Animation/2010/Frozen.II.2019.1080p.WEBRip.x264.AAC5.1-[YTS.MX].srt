2
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,209
Anna, Elsa.

3
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:01,329
Bed time's soon!

4
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,189
Ah oh, The princess is trapped in the
snow goblin's evil spell!

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,190
Quick Elsa, make a prince,
a fancy one!

6
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,311
Oh no, the prince is trapped too!

7
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:12,951
Who cares about
danger when there's love

8
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:15,181
Uh, Anna, blurgh...

9
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,532
Kissing won't save the forest.

10
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:20,522
The lost fairies cry out!

11
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:24,543
What sound does a giraffe make? - I dunno.
Nevermind. They wake the Fairy Queen.

12
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,983
Who breaks the spell and saves everyone.

13
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,593
And they all get married!

14
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:32,144
-What are you playing?
-Enchanted forest.

15
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:36,635
- The prince and the princess - whoosh!
That's like no Enchanted Forest I've ever seen.

16
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:39,925
You've seen an Enchanted Forest?
- Wait, what?

17
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:42,255
I have, once.

18
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,846
And you never told us this before?

19
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:47,486
Well, I could tell you now.
If you.. ah...

20
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,006
Okay, tell us now.

21
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,737
Are you sure about this?

22
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,077
It's time they know.

23
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:57,327
- Let's make a big snowman later.
- If they can settle and listen.

24
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,538
Far away,

25
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,748
As North as we can go.

26
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,819
Stood a very old and very
Enchanted Forest.

27
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,980
But it's magic wasn't that of
goblin's spells and lost fairies.

28
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,930
It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all.

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,031
Those of Air, Fire

30
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,541
of Water

31
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,011
And Earth.

32
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:32,223
But it was also home to the
mysterious Northuldra people.

33
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:35,143
Were the Northuldra magical, like me?

34
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,683
No Elsa, they were not magical.

35
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:40,524
They just took advantage
of the forest gifts.

36
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,644
Their ways were so
different from ours.

37
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:45,894
But still,

38
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:48,065
they promised us friendship.

39
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,605
In honor of that,

40
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:51,715
your grandfather, King Runeard,

41
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:55,016
built them a mighty Dam to
strengthen their waters.

42
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:58,466
It was a gift of peace
- That's a big gift of peace

43
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:02,727
And I was so honored to get to go to the
forest to celebrate it.

44
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:07,538
-Stand tall, Agnarr.
I wasn't at all prepared for what the day would bring.

45
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:14,079
We let down our guard.

46
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,369
We were charmed.

47
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,629
It felt so...

48
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,310
Magical.

49
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,612
But something went wrong.

50
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,813
They were attacking us.

51
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:43,837
Get behind me!

52
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:48,143
It was a brutal battle.

53
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,404
Your grandfather ...  - Father!
was lost.

54
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,124
The fighting enraged the spirits.

55
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:56,424
Look out!

56
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,475
They turned their magic against us all.

57
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,223
There was this... voice.

58
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,047
And someone saved me.

59
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:24,862
I'm told, the spirits then vanished,

60
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,300
and a powerful mist covered the forest,

61
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:31,016
locking everyone out.

62
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,442
And that night, I came home

63
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,297
King of Arendelle.

64
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:46,551
Woah, Papa, that was epic.

65
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,355
Whoever saved you,

66
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:52,563
I love them.
- I wish I knew who it was.

67
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:54,759
What happened to the spirits?

68
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,966
What's in the forest now?
- I don't know.

69
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,271
The mist still stands.

70
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,135
No one can get in.

71
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,955
And no one has since come out.
- So we're safe?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,864
Yes, but the forest could wake again.

73
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,878
And we must be prepared for what
ever danger it may bring.

74
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,815
And on that note, how about we say
good night to your father?

75
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,363
Oh, but I still have so many questions!

76
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,338
Save them for another night Anna.

77
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,484
Ah, you know I don't have
that kind of patience.

78
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:28,273
Why did the Northuldra
attack us anyway?

79
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,048
Who attacks people who
give them gifts?

80
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,093
Do you think the forest will wake again?

81
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,347
Only Ahtohallan knows.
- Ahtoho-, what?

82
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:43,737
When I was little,

83
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:48,006
my mother would sing a song about
a special river, called Ahtohallan,

84
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:51,234
that was said to hold all the answers
about the past

85
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,198
about what we are a part of.

86
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:56,636
Wow, will you sing it for us? Please?

87
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,145
Okay, cuddle close.

88
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:03,531

00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:57,833
Hehe, excuse me.

107
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,078
I'm coming.

Do you hear that?
- What?

109
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:08,918
Nevermind.

110
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,988
Enjoying your new permafrost, Olaf?

111
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,293
I'm just living the dream Anna.

112
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:38,623
Oh, how I wish this could last forever.
- Mmmmm.

113
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:41,158
And yet change mocks us
with her beauty.

114
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,797
- What's that?
- Forgive me, maturity is making me poetic.

115
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:47,513
Tell me, you're older and
thus all-knowing.

116
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,357

117
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,321
nothing is permanent?

00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,837

120
00:08:57,034 --> 00:09:00,000
like you, so I don't have to
worry about important things.

121
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,395
That's not what I mean.

122

Lion. Grizzly bear.

184
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,630
Monster. Ug Bear!
Angry face! Ag Bear!

185
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,297
Hunt!

186
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:52,153
Unreedemable monster!
-Greatest mistake of your life!

187
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:54,699
Who didn't even kiss you.

188
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,004
Villain.
-Ooh...

189
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,506
We all kind of got it.

190
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,442
Okay, Olaf, you're up.
- Okay.

191
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,618
So much easier now
that I can read.

192
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:04,741
Lightning round.

193
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:08,349
Boys against girls.
Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready, Go!

194
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:12,888
Unicorn. Ice cream. Castle.

195
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:15,314
Oaken. Tea pot. Mouse.

196
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:18,701
Ooh, Elsa!

197
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,158
I don't think Olaf should
get to rearrange.

198
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:25,637
Doesn't matter. This is gonna be a cinch.
Two sisters, one mind.

199
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,303
- Thank you.
- Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:32,552
You got this Elsa.
Anytime.

201
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:36,030
Just do it with
your body. Nothing. Air.

202
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,415
Trees, people, treeple.

203
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,261
Oh that's not a word...
shovel boy, teeth?

204
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,318
Oh, doing the dishes.
Polar Bear. Hey. Sorry.

205
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:47,034
You gotta give me something.

206
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,474
Uhm, Alarmed?, Distracted?

207
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,009
Worried? Panicking?

208
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,538
Disturbed, oh, come on. You
definitely look disturbed, oh.

209
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,782
We won. - Rematch?

210
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:04,263
Oh, you know what, I think I'll turn in.
- Are you OK?

211
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,247
Just.. just tired.

212
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:07,489
Good night.

213
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:11,488
Yeah, I'm tired too, and Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story.

214
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:14,044
Didn't you Sven.
- Did I?

215
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:18,454
Oh you do the best voices  like
when you pretend to be Kristoff and

216
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,819
you're like 'I'll just need to
go talk to some rocks

217
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,159
about my childhood and stuff.'
- How about you guys start without me?

218
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,148
Does Elsa seem weird to you?

219
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:36,353
She... seemed like Elsa.

220
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:40,673
That last word, really seemed
to throw her, what was it?

221
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:43,859
I don't know, um,
I don't know, but ... - Ah

222
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,353
Ice.

223
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:49,282
Oh come on, she couldn't act out ice?

224
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:52,890
I better go check on her.
Thanks honey, love you.

225
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,600
Love you, too.

226
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,475
It's fine.

227
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,365
Come in.

228
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:09,316
Yup, something's wrong.
- With you? - No, with you.

229
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,069
You're wearing mother's scarf.

230
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:13,025
You do that when something's wrong.

231
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:15,309
Huh, did we hurt your feelings?

232
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:18,626
I'm sorry, if we did. You know, very
few people are actually good at

233
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,792
family games, that's just a fact.

234
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,954
No that's not it.

235
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,249
Then what is it.

236
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:27,977
There's this...

237
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,570
I just don't want to mess things up.

238
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,777
What things? You're doing great!

239
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:41,988
Oh Elsa, when are you going to see
yourself the way I see you?

240
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,237
What would I do without you?

241
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,232
You'll always have me.

242
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:52,000
I know what you need. Come on.

243
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,063
Come here. - What?
- Mama's words, cuddle close.

244
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:56,965

The earth is next.

284
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,115
We have to get out.

285
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,545
It'll be okay, evacuate to the cliffs.

286
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,723
Oh no, I'm gonna blow!
- I got you.

287
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,153
Yes, everyone's out and safe.

288
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,485
Here, take one of these.

289
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,888
You okay there, Olaf?
- Oh yeah.

290
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:24,402
We're calling this, controlling what
you can when things feel out of control.

291
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,813
Okay, I don't understand.

292
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:29,306
You've been hearing a voice
and you didn't think to tell me?

293
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:30,718
I don't want to worry you.

294
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,751
We made a promise not to
shut each other out.

295
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:37,194
Just tell me what's going on.

296
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:41,048
I woke the magical spirits at
the Enchanted Forest.

297
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:44,310
Okay, that's definitely not what
I thought you were gonna say.

298
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,702
Wait, the Enchanted Forest?

299
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,845
The one father warned us about?

300
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:53,358
Yes. Why would you do that?
- Because of the voice.

301
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,861
I know it sounds crazy,

302
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:59,424
but I believe whoever is
calling me, is good.

303
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,376
How can you say that?

304
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:05,550
Look at our kingdom. - I know, it's
just that my magic can feel it.

305
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,634
I can feel it.

306
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,335
Okay.

307
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,748
Oh no, what now.

308
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:15,530
The Trolls?

309
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,332
Kristoff, we missed you.

310
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:23,297
Pabbie. - Well, never a
dull moment with you two.

311
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:26,540
I hope you're prepared for
what you have done, Elsa.

312
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,394
Angry magical spirits are
not for the faint of heart.

313
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:34,487
Why are they still angry? What does
all of this have to do with Arendelle?

314
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,170
Let me see what I can see.

315
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:42,785
The past is not what it seems.

316
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:45,878
A wrong demands to be righted.

317
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:48,850
Arendelle is not safe.

318
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:52,604
The truth must be found.

319
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,006
Without it

320
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,669
I see no future.

321
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,781
No future?

322
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:01,883
When one can see no future,

323
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:06,047
all one can do is the next right thing.

324
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:07,768
The next right thing?

325
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,252
Is for me to go to the Enchanted
forest and find that voice.

326
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,375
Kristoff can I borrow your wagon,
and Sven?

327
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,217
- I'm not very comfortable with the idea of that.
- You are not going alone.

328
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:20,771
Anna, No, I have my powers
to protect me, you don't.

329
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:24,794
Excuse me, I climbed to the north mountain, survived
a frozen heart, and saved you from my ex-boyfriend,

330
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:27,497
and I did it all without powers,
so you know, I'm coming.

331
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:30,219
Me too, I'll drive.
- I'll bring the snacks.

332
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,652
I will look after your people.

333
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:35,424
Please make sure they stay out of
the kingdom until we return.

334
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,448
Of course.
- Let's let them know.

335
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:42,911
Anna, I'm worried for her,
we have always feared

336
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,533
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

337
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,534
Now,

338
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:49,327
we must pray they are enough.

339
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,590
I won't let anything happen to her.

340
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,929
Who's into trivia? I am, ok.

341
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,701
Did you know that water has memory?

342
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,734
True fact, it's disputed by
many, but it's true.

343
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:10,137
Did you know men are six times more
likely to be struck by lightning?

344
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,189
Did you know gorillas burp
when they're happy?

345
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,782
Did you know we blink
4 million times a day?

346
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:16,806
Did you know wombats poop squares?

347
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,856
Did you know sleeping quietly
on long journeys prevents insanity?

348
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:24,680
Yeah, that's not true. - It is.
- It is defenitely true. - It's the truth.

349
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,532
Hmm, well that was unanimous.

350
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,425
<i>But I will look it up
when we get home.</i>

351
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:32,948
They're both asleep.

352
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:36,292
So... what do you wanna do?

353
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,135
Sven, keep us steady, will you?

354
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:48,153
Anna. Hm. Anna, remember our
first  trip like this when

355
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,757
I said you'd have to be crazy to want to marry
a man you just met. - Wait, what?

356
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,341
Crazy? You didn't say I was
crazy, you think I'm crazy?

357
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:59,083
No, I did, you were...

358
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,995
not crazy, clearly.

359
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:06,780
Just naive, not naive,
just ah.. just new to love.

360
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,651
Like I was, and...

361
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:12,225
when you're new, you're
bound to get it.. wrong.

362
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,777
So you're saying, I'm wrong for you.

363
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:19,782
What? No, no, I'm not saying you're wrong,
or crazy, I'm sayi-... - Kristoff, stop, please.

364
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:24,487
- Good idea. - I hear it.
I hear the voice. - You do?

365
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,269
Olaf, wake up.

366
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,484
- Whoa.
- Wow.

367
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:29,047
Promise me, we do this together, okay?

368
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,868
I promise.

369
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:41,149
It's okay.

370
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:45,322
Did you know that an Enchanted Forest
is a place of transformation?

371
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:47,214
I have no idea what that means.

372
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:52,218
But I can't wait to see what it's
gonna do to each one of us.

373
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,953
What is this?

374
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:01,818
What was that?

375
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,580
No, no, no.

376
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,133
And we're locked in.

377
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:10,316
I probably should've seen
that one coming.

378
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:13,859
This forest is beautiful.

379
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:42,516
The Dam... It still stands.

380
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:47,340
It was in Grand Pabbie's visions, but why?

381
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,183
I don't know, but it's still in
good shape, thank goodness.

382
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,183
What do you mean?

383
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,857
Well if that Dam broke, it would
send a tidal wave so big, it would

384
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:57,030
wash away everything on this fjord.

385
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,961
Everything? But..

386
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,703
Arendelle's on this fjord.

387
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:04,186
Nothings gonna happen to Arendelle
Anna, it's gonna be fine.

388
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:05,728
Come here.

389
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:15,076
You know, under different
circumstances, this would be

390
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:18,190
a... pretty romantic place.

391
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,181
- Don't you think?
- Different circumstances?

392
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:24,125
You mean like with someone
else? What? No, no, I'm saying...

393
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,097
Hm, just in case we don't
make it out of here.

394
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:28,128
You don't think we're gonna
make out of here?

395
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:31,462
No, no, I mean, no, we
will make it out of here

396
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:34,194
Well, technically the odds are kinda
complicated, but my point is..

397
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:35,806
In case we die

398
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:39,700
You think we're gonna die? No! no!
No, we will die at some point...

399
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,961
- I swore that I wouldn't leave her side.
- Not even any reason time will we die but...

400
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,715
- Elsa?
- Way far in the future, we will die.

401
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:50,109
Don't patronize me.

402
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:02,160
Elsa, there you are.

403
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,234
- You okay? - I'm fine.
- Okay, good.

404
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:07,235
Where's Olaf?

405
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,898
Umm, Anna?

406
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:12,741
Elsa?

407
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:13,742
Sven?

408
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:18,085
Samantha?

409
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:21,549
I don't even know a Samantha!

410
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:33,811
That's normal.

411
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,954
What was that?

412
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:50,926

Olaf!

439
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:35,094
Hey guys, meet the wind spirit.

440
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,357
Coming through.

441
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,928
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

442
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,881
I'd hold your hair back, but
I can't find my arms.

443
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:53,221
Hey! Stop!

444
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:06,854
Elsa!

445
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:10,016
Let her go.

446
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:18,154
Anna, be careful!
- That's my sister.

447
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:24,630
Prince Agnarr.

448
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,645
For Arendelle.

449
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,261
Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

450
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,285
What are these?

451
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:53,917
They look like moments in time.

452
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,961
What's that thing you say Olaf?

453
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:02,186
Oh, my theory about advancing technology's
is both our savior and our doom?

454
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:05,648
No, not that one, the one
about... - The one about cucumbers?

455
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:06,629
No. The thing about water.

456
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,942
Water has memory.

457
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:12,925
The water that makes up you and me
has passed through at least 4 humans

458
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,737
and or animals before us.

459
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,732
And remembers everything.

460
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:21,933
The wind's back!

461
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:28,069
Delicious! I think
I'll name you Gale.

462
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,443
Get out there.

463
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:34,115
Oh, hi, aren't you curious!

464
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:38,469
You in a better mood now?

465
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:49,649
Father.

466
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,702
That's father.

467
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:54,304
This girl...

468
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:56,216
She's saving him.

469
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:58,318
She's Northuldra.

470
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,981
What is that?

471
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,864
Olaf get behind me.

472
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:09,318
- Why are you gonna do with that?
- I have no idea.

473
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,623
Lower your weapon!

474
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:29,147
- And you lower yours!
- Arendellian Soldiers?

475
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:34,152
- Threatening my people Lieutenant?
- Invading my Dam space, Yelena?

476
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,904
Why does that soldier looks so familiar?

477
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:39,737
Lieutenant, get the sword!

478
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:48,075
That was magic.

479
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:51,197
- Did you see that?
- Of course I saw it.

480
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:53,590
Well, you chose a nice cold greeting.

481
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,143
- They've been trapped in here this whole time?
- Yeah. - What do we do now?

482
00:34:57,143 --> 00:35:00,877
I got this, hi I'm Olaf.

483
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:05,220
Oh sorry, yeah, I just find
clothes restricting.

484
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,823
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

485
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,174
It's really quite simple.

486
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,636
It began with two sisters.

487
00:35:11,636 --> 00:35:13,269
One born with magical powers.

488
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:15,861
One born powerless,
their love of snowmen?

489
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:16,762
Infinite!

490
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,082
Anna, No! Too high.

491
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,083
Blast!

492
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,086
Ooww, Mama, Papa, Help!

493
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:22,387
Slam!

494
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,569
Doors shutting everywhere,
Sisters torn apart.

495
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,512
Well at least they have
their parents.

496
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,536
Their parents are dead.

497
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,826
Oh, hi I'm Anna, I'll marry
a man I just met.

498
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,870
Elsa's gonna blow, snow,
snow, ah run!

499
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,392
Magic pulses through my snowflakes.

500
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,086
I live, ice palace for one,
ice palace for one.

501
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:46,189
- Get out Anna.
- My heart.

502
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:47,210
- Oh my goodness.

503
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:49,211
Only an act of true love
can save you.

504
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:51,334
- Here's a true love's kiss.

505
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:55,118
You're not worth it. Guess what.
I'm the bad guy.

506
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,019
What?

507
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:59,902
And Anna freezes to death, forever.

508
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:00,903
Oh, Anna!

509
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:04,867
Then she unfreezes.. oh and
then Elsa woke up the magical spirits.

510
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,037
And we were forced out
from our kingdom,

511
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:07,769
Now our only hope is
find the truth about the past,

512
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,121
but we don't have a clue
how to do that,

513
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,943
Excepts Elsa's hearing voices,
so we got that going for us.

514
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,544
Any questions?

515
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:19,040
I think they got it.

516
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,462
Are you really queen of Arendelle?

517
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:25,576
I am. Why would nature reward
a person of Arendelle with magic?

518
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,848
Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people.

519
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:31,642
My people are innocent, we
would have never attacked first.

520
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:34,154
May the truth be found.

521
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:37,978
- Hi, I'm sor-, uh, what's happening?
- That's it!

522
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:40,970
Lieutenant Mattias, library,
second portrait on the left,

523
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,863
You were our father's official guard.

524
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:44,864
Agnar.

525
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:48,387
What did happened to your parents?

526
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:52,251
Our parents' ship went down
in the Southern Sea 6 years ago.

527
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:58,187
I see him.

528
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,509
I see him in your faces.
- Really?

529
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,510
Soldiers.

530
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,051
We maybe getting on in years

531
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,534
but we're still strong

532
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,236
and proud to serve Arendelle.

533
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:10,468
Wait, please.

534
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:12,950
Someone has called me here.

535
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,082
If I can just find them.

536
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,156
I believe they have the answers
that may help us free this forest.

537
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:21,518
Trust me, I just want to help.

538
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:23,980
We only trust nature.

539
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,382
When nature speaks...

540
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:29,866
...we listen.

541
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:32,979
This will all make sense
when I'm older.

542
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,251
Fire spirit.

543
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:39,716
Get back everyone! Go to the river!

544
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:52,547
No, no, no no - the reindeer...
that's a dead end.

545
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,620
Come on Sven, we'll get them.

546
00:37:57,782 --> 00:38:00,545
Elsa, get out of there.

547
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:01,546
No, no, no.

548
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,352
Elsa.

549
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:22,295
Come on buddy, we can do this.

550
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,882
Anna.

551
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:37,950
- Get her out of here!
- No! Elsa!

552
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,931
They're all looking at us, aren't they?

553
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:58,436
Got any advice?

554
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:02,059
Nothing? Hmm.

555
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,740
Should I know what that means?

556
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,954
You hear it too.

557
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:12,169
Somebody's calling us, who is it?

558
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:13,500
What do we do?

559
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,929
Okay, keep going north.

560
00:40:26,392 --> 00:40:27,723
Elsa!

561
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:31,246
Oh thank goodness. Anna. Are you okay?
-What were you doing?

562
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:34,489
You could have been killed, you
can't just follow me into fire.

563
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:39,163
You don't want me to follow you into
fire, then don't run into fire.

564
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:43,167
You're not being careful Elsa.

565
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:47,542
I'm sorry, are you okay?

566
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,063
I've been better.

567
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:53,306
I know what you need.

568
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,841
Where did you get that scarf?

569
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:00,504
That's a Northuldra's scarf.

570
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:04,127
- What?
- This is from one of our oldest families.

571
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:06,128
It was our mother's.

572
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:16,639
Elsa.

573
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,141
I see it, it's mother.

574
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,604
Mother saved father's life that day.

575
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,911
Our mother was Northuldra.

576
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,719
We are called Northuldra.

577
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,313
We are the people of the sun.

578
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:39,687
I promise you.

579
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:43,840
I will free this forest,
and restore Arendelle.

580
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,973
That's a pretty big promise Elsa.

581
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:50,236
Free the forest.

582
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:51,377
Wow.

583
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:53,139
Im sorry, It's just ... ah.

584
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:56,212
Some of us were born in here, we've never
even seen the clear sky.

585
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:57,213
I get it.

586
00:42:57,222 --> 00:42:59,435
- Name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

587
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:00,926
I heard the voice again.

588
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:05,140
We need to go north. - But the earth
giants now roam the north at night.

589
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,102
You can leave in the morning.

590
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:10,875
- I'm Honeymaren.
- Honeymaren, we'll do all we can.

591
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,361
Hey, let me ask you,
how do you guys

592
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,626
cope with the ever increasing complexity
of thought that comes with maturity?

593
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,318
Brilliant.

594
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:27,351
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

595
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:29,853
Our future's in bright hands
Oh no, no, no..

596
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,275
Don't chew that, you don't
know what I've stepped in.

597
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,088
I can't seem to
get her attention.

598
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,030
- Or even say the right thing.
- Well, you're in luck.

599
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,282
I know nothing about women.

600
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:42,695
But I do know that we have the
most amazing way of proposing.

601
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:45,558
If we start now, we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

602
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,359
Best part?

603
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:49,642
It involves a lot of reindeer.

604
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:53,715
Hey, back at home, Halimah's
still over at Hudson's hearth?

605
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,879
She is. - Really?
She married? - Mm-mm.

606
00:43:57,049 --> 00:44:02,414
- Oh wow, why doesn't that make me feel better?
- What else do you miss?

607
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:04,596
My father.

608
00:44:04,596 --> 00:44:06,958
He passed long before all this.

609
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,941
He was a great man.

610
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:14,946
Built us a good life in Arendelle, but taught me
to never take the good for granted.

611
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:17,828
He'd say, be prepared!

612
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:21,611
Just when you think you found your way,
life will throw you onto a new path.

613
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:24,485
What do you do when it does?

614
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,026
Don't give up.

615
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:27,927
Take it one step at a time.

616
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:29,710
And...

617
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,312
Just do the next right thing.

618
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:35,394
Yeah, you got it.

619
00:44:38,298 --> 00:44:39,539
I wanna show you something.

620
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:41,990
May I?

621
00:44:44,123 --> 00:44:46,885
You know, air, fire, water and earth.

622
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,286
- Yes.
- But look.

623
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,049
There's a fifth spirit.

624
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:53,402
Said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature.

625
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:55,964
- A fifth spirit?
- Some say...

626
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:58,587
they heard it call out the
day the forest fell.

627
00:44:58,587 --> 00:45:02,370
My father heard it.
Do you think that's who's calling me?

628
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,022
Maybe.

629
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:07,164
Alas, only Ahtohallan knows.

630
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:08,736
Ahtohallan.

631
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:14,501
♪ Dive down deep into her sound ♪

632
00:45:14,872 --> 00:45:19,096
♪ But not too far, or you'll be drowned ♪

633
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:22,819
Why do lullabies always have to
have some terrible warning in them?

634
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:26,173
I wonder that all the time.

635
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:29,395
Earth giants.

636
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:31,358
What are they doing down here?

637
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:35,159
Hide!

638
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,059
They're coming!

639
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:58,162
This is why we
don't play with fire.

640
00:45:58,162 --> 00:46:01,626
Ah, I can't stay mad
at you, you're so cute.

641
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,392
Please tell me, you are not
about to follow them.

642
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:33,846
What if I can settle them like
I did the wind and fire.

643
00:46:33,846 --> 00:46:37,229
Or what if they can crush you
before you even get the chance.

644
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,661
Remember, the goal

645
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:43,475
is to find the voice,
find the truth and get us home.

646
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:47,388
- Hey guys, that was close.
- I know.

647
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,150
The giant sensed me.

648
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,513
They may come back here, I don't
want to put anyone at risk again.

649
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:55,817
And you're right Anna,
we've got to find the voice.

650
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:59,530
- We're going now.
- Okay, we're going, let me just...

651
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,785
Wait, where are Kristoff and Sven?

652
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:08,669
Oh yeah, I think they took off with
that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer.

653
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,340
They left?

654
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,751
Just left without saying anything?

655
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:14,338
Who knows the ways of men.

656
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:23,462
Am I supposed to feel this ridiculous?

657
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:25,724
Oh yeah, definitely.

658
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:29,308
- Everyone ready?
- Ready. Ah, I could use a rehearsal

659
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:32,521
- I love love..
- Wait, you talk for them too?

660
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:35,533
- I do.. - It's like you can
actually hear what they're thinking.

661
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,906
Yeah and then you.. you just say it.

662
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:40,678
And then you just say it.

663
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,732
Okay, here she comes.

664
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:47,715
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

665
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:52,079
My fiesty, fearless,
ginger sweet love.

666
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,202
Will you marry me?

667
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:58,415
Um, no.

668
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:00,387
The princess left with the queen.

669
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:02,308
What queen? What?
Wait. What?!

670
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:05,532
I wouldn't try to follow,
they're long gone.

671
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:07,153
Long gone?

672
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:09,425
So yeah.

673
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:14,980
Um, we're heading west, to the Lycan
Meadows, you can come with us if you want.

674
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:21,547
Hey, um.

675
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:25,100
- I'm really sorry ...
- No, it's fine.. - Yeah, yup.

676
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:28,183
Hm, okay, I'd better go pack.

677
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,827
- You coming with?
- I'll just ah, dah I'll meet you there.

678
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:32,827
Ahh, you know where you're going.

679
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,828
Yah.

680
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,127

720
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:28,368
Hey Olaf, umm.

721
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:30,379
Maybe just one of you
should do it.

722
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:33,962
I agree, she's a little pitchy.

723
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:35,605
Hey, Gale's back.

724
00:52:41,406 --> 00:52:42,606
What?

725
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:54,672
- How can it be?
- What is it?

726
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,785
Mother and father's ship.

727
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:59,457
But this isn't the Southern Sea.

728
00:52:59,457 --> 00:53:03,071
No, it isn't.

729
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:17,164
Why is their ship here?

730
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,246
How is it here?

731
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:23,700
It must have been washed
in from the Dark Sea.

732
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,113
What were they doing in
the Dark Sea?

733
00:53:27,113 --> 00:53:29,365
I don't know.

734
00:53:29,365 --> 00:53:32,228
How did the ship get through the mist?

735
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:35,681
I thought nobody could but us,
unless...

736
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,973
Nobody was on it.

737
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:41,066
There's gotta be something here.

738
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:43,438
Wait, wait, look around.

739
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:47,342
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment, waterproof.

740
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:50,114
That's very clever.

741
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:54,088
Although it does make me wonder why they
don't just make the whole ship waterproof.

742
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:02,015
Here!

743
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:09,471
What language is this?

744
00:54:09,472 --> 00:54:13,276
I don't know, but look,
this is mother's handwriting.

745
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:17,220
The end of the ice age,
the river found but lost.

746
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,811
Magic's source.

747
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:22,004
Elsa's source?

748
00:54:23,736 --> 00:54:25,167
It's a map.

749
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,671
They traveled north.

750
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:32,163
Planned to cross the Dark Sea to...

751
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:34,156
Ahtohallan.

752
00:54:34,826 --> 00:54:37,469
- It's real?
- Ahtoho- what?

753
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,770
Ahtohallan.

754
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,725
It's a magical river said to hold
all the answers about the past.

755
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:47,208
Reinforcing my water
has memory theory.

756
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,230
Water has memory.

757
00:54:55,276 --> 00:54:57,628
Elsa?

758
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,280
I wanna know what
happened to them.

759
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:11,200
- Ahtohallan has to be the source of her magic.
- We keep going.

760
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,473
But Elsa ...
The waves are too high..

761
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:20,018
Elsa!

762
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:30,589
Hey, hey hey, what are you doing?

763
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,762
This is my fault, they were
looking for answers about me.

764
00:55:34,762 --> 00:55:38,106
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

765
00:55:38,106 --> 00:55:40,167
No, just their deaths.

766
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:42,219
Stop. No.

767
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:47,734
Yelana asked why would the spirits reward
Arendelle with the magical queen?

768
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:50,698
Because our mother saved our father.

769
00:55:50,698 --> 00:55:53,310
She saved her enemy.

770
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,772
Her good deed was rewarded.

771
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:57,464
With you.

772
00:55:57,464 --> 00:56:00,606
- You are a gift.
- For what?

773
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:02,758
If anyone can resolve the past,

774
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:07,213
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest, it's you.

775
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:09,595
I believe in you Elsa.

776
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:12,168
More than anyone or anything.

777
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:21,056
Honeymaren said there
was a fifth spirit

778
00:56:21,056 --> 00:56:24,680
A bridge between the magic
of nature and us.

779
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,592
- A fifth spirit.
- That what's been calling me.

780
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,183
From Ahtohallan.

781
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,857
The answers about the past
are all there.

782
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:35,099
So we go to Ahtohallan.

783
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,200
Not we.

784
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,972
Me.
What?

785
00:56:39,653 --> 00:56:42,175
The Dark Sea is too dangerous
for us both.

786
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:44,447
No, no - we do this together.

787
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:48,131
Remember the song, go too
far and you'll be drowned.

788
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:50,593
Who will stop you
from going too far?

789
00:56:50,593 --> 00:56:53,366
You said you believed in me,
that this is what I was born to do.

790
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,979
And I don't want to
stop you from that.

791
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:01,394
I don't want to stop you from being
whatever you need to be, I just-

792
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:03,305
don't want you dying.

793
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:07,069
Trying to be everything
for everyone else too.

794
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:08,570
Don't do this alone.

795
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,192
Let me help you, please.

796
00:57:11,192 --> 00:57:13,435
I can't lose you Elsa.

797
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:18,819
I can't lose you either, Anna.

798
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:22,103
Come on.

799
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:27,508
Wait, what? What are you doing? Elsa!

800
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:34,185
No, no ...
Olaf, help me stop.

801
00:57:34,185 --> 00:57:36,506
Give me a hand!

802
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:39,279
Hang on!

803
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:42,542
Oh no.

804
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,623
Come on!

805
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:46,676
Anna, this might
sound crazy, but I'm

806
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:51,200
- sensing some rising anger.
- Ah, Now I am angry, Olaf.

807
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,204
- She promised me we'd do
this together. - Yeah, but ...

808
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:59,027
What I mean is I'm sensing
rising anger in me.

809
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:03,642
- Wait, you're angry?
- I think so.

810
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:06,054
Elsa pushed me away too and

811
00:58:06,054 --> 00:58:10,018
didn't even say goodbye.
- And you have every right to

812
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,729
to be very, very mad at her.

813
00:58:11,729 --> 00:58:15,644
And you've said some things
never change, but since then,

814
00:58:15,644 --> 00:58:20,647
everything's done nothing
but change. - I know.

815
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:21,939
But look.

816
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,311
I'm still here holding your hand.

817
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:27,624
Yeah, that's.. that's a good point Anna.

818
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:30,247
I feel better,
you're such a good listener...

819
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:33,780
Shh, shh, shh!
Don't shh me..

820
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:34,781
No, no!

821
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:48,103
Oh the Giants, they're huge.

822
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,452
Hang on Olaf.

823
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,218
Try not to scream.

824
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,471
Found it.

825
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:32,816
Thank you.
Where are we?

826
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:35,588
In a pit, with no way out.

827
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:39,142
But with this spooky
pitch black way in.

828
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:47,649
Come on, it'll be fun,

829
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:49,321
assuming we don't get
stuck here forever

830
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:50,542
and no one ever finds us

831
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,133
and you start and I give up.

832
00:59:52,434 --> 00:59:53,705
But bright side...

833
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:58,259
Elsa's gotta be doing a whole
lot better than we are.

834
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:36,767
Ok.

835
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:41,342
Of course.

836
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,244
Glaciers are rivers of ice.

837
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,898
Ahtohallan is frozen.

838
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:56,246

was going, but I'm great.

898
01:07:29,611 --> 01:07:32,356
Actually ... Prince
Hans of the Southern Isle.

899
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:36,574
I love you. I need to
tell you about my past.

900
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:38,949
- And where I'm from.
- I'm listening.

901
01:07:40,272 --> 01:07:41,384
Iduna!

902
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:44,961
- What are you reading, your Majesty?
- Some new Danish author.

903
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:54,429
King Runard, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

904
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:55,430
Grandfather!

905
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:57,596
We bring Arendelle's full guard.

906
01:07:57,596 --> 01:08:00,762
But they have given us no
reason not to trust them.

907
01:08:01,484 --> 01:08:03,488
The Northuldra follow magic,

908
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:05,351
which means we can never trust them.

909
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:06,352
Grandfather?

910
01:08:06,353 --> 01:08:08,407
Magic makes people
feel too powerful,

911
01:08:08,407 --> 01:08:10,972
too entitled, it
makes them think

912
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:14,068
they can defy the
will of a king.

913
01:08:14,148 --> 01:08:15,862
That is not what magic does.

914
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:17,535
That's just your fear.

915
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,930
Fear is what
can't be trusted.

916
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:31,353
You see, the Dam will weaken their lands,
so they will have to turn to me.

917
01:08:31,463 --> 01:08:36,873
♪ ..for you, dive down deep into her sound ♪

918
01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:41,573
♪ But not too far or you'll be drowned ♪

919
01:08:41,573 --> 01:08:45,250
They will come in celebration,
and then

920
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,887
we will know their
size and strength.

921
01:08:49,318 --> 01:08:51,823
As you have welcomed us,

922
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:53,005
we welcome you,

923
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:56,552
our neighbors, our friends.

924
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:18,095
King Runeard, the Dam isn't strengthening
our waters, it's hurting the forest.

925
01:09:18,095 --> 01:09:21,932
It's cutting off the North...
- Let's not discuss this here.

926
01:09:21,932 --> 01:09:26,942
Let's meet on the fjord, have tea,
find a solution.

927
01:09:37,703 --> 01:09:38,635
No!

928
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:46,636
Anna!

929
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:58,655
Which lucky tunnel do we choose?

930
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:02,703
You see, the Dam will weaken
their lands,

931
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:04,265
so they will have to turn to me.

932
01:10:04,265 --> 01:10:08,063
King Runeard, the Dam is hurting the forest!

933
01:10:12,432 --> 01:10:14,075
Elsa's found it.

934
01:10:14,075 --> 01:10:17,482
- What is it?
- The truth about the past.

935
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,417
That's my grandfather,

936
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:24,195
attacking the Northuldra leader

937
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:26,890
who wields no weapon.

938
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:32,080
The Dam wasn't a gift of peace.

939
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:34,947
It was a trick.

940
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:38,072
But that goes against
everything Arendalle stands for.

941
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,277
It does, doesn't it?

942
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:47,260
I know how to free the forest,
I know what we have to do,

943
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,405
To set things right.

944
01:10:49,885 --> 01:10:51,679
Why do you say that so sadly?

945
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,505
We have to break the Dam.

946
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:57,030
But Arendelle will be flooded.

947
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,645
That's why everyone was forced out,

948
01:10:59,645 --> 01:11:03,232
to protect them from
what has to be done.

949
01:11:03,232 --> 01:11:05,557
Oh! Oh.

950
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:09,875
Are you okay?

951
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:12,691
I could really use a bright side, Olaf.

952
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:15,276
Bright side? Umm...

953
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:17,460
Turtles can breathe through their butts?

954
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,261
Huh?

955
01:11:18,312 --> 01:11:21,287
And I see a way out.

956
01:11:22,781 --> 01:11:25,155
I knew I could count on you.

957
01:11:29,304 --> 01:11:30,586
Come on, Olaf.

958
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:34,494
Elsa's probably on her way back
right now, we can meet her and-

959
01:11:35,926 --> 01:11:37,509
Olaf?

960
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:42,519
What's this? - Are you okay?
- I'm flurrying?

961
01:11:43,331 --> 01:11:47,299
Wait, no, that's.. that's not it.

962
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:50,896
I'm flurrying, away...

963
01:11:51,317 --> 01:11:54,854
The magic in me is fading.

964
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:57,259
What?

965
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:00,716
I don't think Elsa's okay.

966
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,461
I think...

967
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:06,116
she may have gone too far.

968
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:10,434
No, no.
- Anna.

969
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:12,499
I'm sorry.

970
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,996
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

971
01:12:16,306 --> 01:12:19,442
Okay?
-Wait, come here.

972
01:12:19,442 --> 01:12:21,877
I've got you.

973
01:12:22,308 --> 01:12:24,292
That's good.

974
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:27,448
Hey Anna.

975
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:31,856
I just thought of one thing that's permanent.
-What's that?

976
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:34,301
Love.

977
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:37,198
Warm hugs?

978
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:43,831
I like warm hugs.

979
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,289
I love you.

980
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,676
Olaf, Elsa.

981
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,063

Wake up!

01:17:42,008 --> 01:17:44,453
Wake up!!!

1032
01:18:04,122 --> 01:18:05,755
That's it!

1033
01:18:05,755 --> 01:18:08,180
Come and get me! Come on!

1034
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:15,104
Over here!

1035
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:19,262
Okay, that's right!

1036
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,915
Keep coming!

1037
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,213
That'll work.

1038
01:18:30,214 --> 01:18:31,614
This way guys!

1039
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:48,189
No, no-no, she's leading
them to the Dam.

1040
01:18:56,867 --> 01:18:58,890
- Kristoff!
- I'm here.

1041
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,894
- What do you need?
- To get to the Dam.

1042
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:02,918
You got it.
- Thank you.

1043
01:19:20,182 --> 01:19:22,717
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

1044
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:29,029
- Lieutenant Mathias.
- Your Highness.

1045
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:31,725
- What are you doing?
- The Dam must fall.

1046
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,450
It's the only way to break the
the mist, and free the forest.

1047
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,246
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

1048
01:19:37,246 --> 01:19:40,512
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1049
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:42,987
King Runard betrayed everyone.

1050
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:45,252
How do you know that?

1051
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:48,679
My sister gave her
life, for the truth.

1052
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:51,814
Please.

1053
01:19:51,814 --> 01:19:53,979
Before we lose anyone else.

1054
01:20:16,303 --> 01:20:18,303
Look out!

1055
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:26,844
Destroy the Dam, come on!

1056
01:20:26,844 --> 01:20:28,797
Throw your boulders!

1057
01:20:33,647 --> 01:20:35,401
That's it.

1058
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:53,426
I've got her.

1059
01:20:53,427 --> 01:20:54,327
Anna!

1060
01:20:54,368 --> 01:20:56,462
Hang on.

1061
01:23:15,025 --> 01:23:17,340
I'm sorry I left you behind.

1062
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,607
I was just so deperate
to protect her.

1063
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,360
I know, I know, it's okay.

1064
01:23:23,672 --> 01:23:27,139
My love is not fragile.

1065
01:23:29,273 --> 01:23:31,658
Look at the sky.

1066
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:35,445
I just didn't realize there
was so much of it.

1067
01:23:35,445 --> 01:23:38,040
34 years.

1068
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,554
5 months.

1069
01:23:39,554 --> 01:23:42,279
And 23 days.

1070
01:24:52,778 --> 01:24:54,481
Is it really you?

1071
01:24:54,842 --> 01:24:56,616
Anna.

1072
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,186
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Lost me?

1073
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:03,819
You saved me.

1074
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:06,906
Again. - I did?
And Anna.

1075
01:25:06,906 --> 01:25:10,393
Arendelle did not fall.

1076
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:12,487
It didn't?

1077
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:14,411
The spirits all agree.

1078
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:19,100
Arendelle deserves to stand with you.

1079
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,101
Me?

1080
01:25:19,801 --> 01:25:23,619
You did what was right,
for everyone.

1081
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,983
Did you find the fifth spirit?

1082
01:25:28,088 --> 01:25:30,613
<i>You are the fifth spirit.</i>

1083
01:25:30,613 --> 01:25:34,460
- You are the bridge.
- Well, actually, a bridge has two sides.

1084
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:36,975
And mother had two daughters.

1085
01:25:38,018 --> 01:25:40,091
We did this together,

1086
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:44,069
and we'll continue
to do this together.

1087
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,270
Together.

1088
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:47,626
Elsa! You're okay!

1089
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:52,005
You look different.

1090
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:54,410
Did you cut your hair or something?

1091
01:25:54,434 --> 01:25:55,510
Or something.

1092
01:25:55,511 --> 01:25:58,418
Oh.

1093
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:02,496
Anna, I need to ask you a question.

1094
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,429
Okay.

1095
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,934
Do you wanna build a snowman?

1096
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:08,588
What?

1097
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,238
Thank goodness, water has memory.

1098
01:26:37,355 --> 01:26:39,950
Anna, Elsa.

1099
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:43,276
Kristoff and Sven.

1100
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:46,923
You all came back!

1101
01:26:46,923 --> 01:26:49,067
I love happy endings.

1102
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:51,462
I mean I presume we're done,

1103
01:26:51,462 --> 01:26:55,380
or is this putting us in mortal danger
situation gonna be, a regular thing?

1104
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,676
No, we're done.
- Actually...

1105
01:26:58,676 --> 01:27:01,883
There is one more thing, Anna..

1106
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:05,690
You are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

1107
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:08,786
I love you with all I am.

1108
01:27:08,786 --> 01:27:11,622
Will you marry me?

1109
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:13,495
Yes!

1110
01:27:39,377 --> 01:27:41,490
Arendelle's okay.
- What?

1111
01:27:42,964 --> 01:27:45,569
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1112
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:49,697
Hello.
- You know,

1113
01:27:50,067 --> 01:27:52,162
you belong up here.

1114
01:27:52,162 --> 01:27:55,819
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

1115
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,933
Luckily,

1116
01:27:57,933 --> 01:28:00,007
I know just what that is.

1117
01:28:00,007 --> 01:28:02,983
I still don't know what
transformation means.

1118
01:28:02,983 --> 01:28:06,981
I feel like this forest,
has really changed us all.

1119
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:14,275
Presenting, her Majesty,

1120
01:28:14,275 --> 01:28:17,452
Queen Anna of Arendelle.

1121
01:28:22,953 --> 01:28:24,153
Oh! Oh!

1122
01:28:24,954 --> 01:28:25,954
Hi!

1123
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:30,307
Sven, don't you look nice.

1124
01:28:30,307 --> 01:28:32,331
Oh my goodness! Olaf!

1125
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:35,187
Charmed?, I'm sure.

1126
01:28:35,187 --> 01:28:37,972
- Charming.
- Your Majesty.

1127
01:28:39,535 --> 01:28:41,399
Kristoff.

1128
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,374
Oh, did you boys get all dressed
up for me?

1129
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:46,329
It was Sven's idea.

1130
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:49,324
One hour, you get
this for one hour.

1131
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:53,362
That's okay, I prefer
you in leather anyway.

1132
01:28:56,449 --> 01:28:59,364
I'm shocked you can last
an hour, that was brutal.

1133
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:02,391
Hm, the things we do for love.

1134
01:29:02,391 --> 01:29:04,424
What is this crazy magic called again?

1135
01:29:04,494 --> 01:29:06,749
A photograph.
- Photograph... hm.

1136
01:29:06,749 --> 01:29:08,823
Really good.

1137
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:11,188
Halima, General Mathias.

1138
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:15,456
Ah Your Majesty. I'll be right back, you
can look at our photograph while I'm gone.

1139
01:29:16,318 --> 01:29:20,466
I'm just kidding,
How'm I doing? - Fantastic.

1140
01:29:28,431 --> 01:29:31,127
Our lands and people,

1141
01:29:31,127 --> 01:29:33,742
now connected by love.

1142
01:29:39,153 --> 01:29:41,798
Hi Gale, you like it?

1143
01:29:41,798 --> 01:29:43,261
Oh, do you mind?

1144
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:45,646
I've got a message for my sister.

1145
01:30:05,244 --> 01:30:06,778
Thank you.

1146
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:11,216
Charade's Friday night, don't be late.

1147
01:30:11,216 --> 01:30:13,641
And don't worry,
Arandalle is doing just fine.

1148
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,845
Keep looking after the forest.

1149
01:30:15,845 --> 01:30:17,739
I love you.

1150
01:30:17,739 --> 01:30:19,753
I love you too, Sis.

1151
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:23,180
Hey Gale, we're going for a ride,
wanna come?

1152
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,251
Are you ready?

1153
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:03,251
Ahhheeeooo...

1154
01:42:03,252 --> 01:42:05,552
Show yourself!
Right now!

1155
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:09,153
Elsa, be who you are.
Oh, I will mama, I will.

1156
01:42:09,354 --> 01:42:11,554
Elsa's dead. Olaf's dead.

1157
01:42:11,555 --> 01:42:13,055
Anna cries.

1158
01:42:13,456 --> 01:42:15,556
And then, a bunch of important
things happen,

1159
01:42:15,557 --> 01:42:16,657
that I forgot, but all that matters

1160
01:42:16,658 --> 01:42:17,858
is I was right, and water has memory,

1161
01:42:17,859 --> 01:42:20,359
and thus... I live.

1162
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,260
And so do you.

1163
01:42:23,161 --> 01:42:26,561
Ohhhh... we live!

1164
01:42:26,862 --> 01:42:28,662
We Live!!

1165
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:32,163
Ahhh..oho...
Good story!
