1
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,326
This could be
the room of any small boy.

2
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,954
But, in fact, it's not.

3
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,459
It is the room of one young boy
in particular named Christopher Robin.

4
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,713
Now, Christopher Robin
has a very active imagination,

5
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:30,425
not to mention the uncanny ability
to collect things.

6
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,053
Big things. Small things. Sticky things.

7
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,974
But his favourite things
are his stuffed animals.

8
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,602
Ah! There they are now.

9
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:44,939
A charming and eccentric
cast of characters.

10
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:50,069
And his best friend among them
is a bear named Winnie the Pooh.

11
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,739
Or Pooh for short.

12
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,701
Together they had many
unusual adventures,

13
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,080
that all happened right here
in the Hundred Acre Wood.

in which Winnie the Pooh
has a very important thing to do.

32
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,573
As the sun rose over
the Hundred Acre Wood,

33
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:21,077
Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted
the day with much enthusiasm.

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,745
Ooh...

35
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,333
- Honey.
- Uh, Pooh?

36
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,628
More honey, please.

37
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,007
I say, Pooh?

38
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,468
Pooh?

39
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,930
Oh, do wake up.

40
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,725
- Pooh!
- Oh!

41
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:52,150
Oh, bother. I was having
the most wonderful dream.

42
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,569
Yes, but it's time to wake up.

43
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:58,656
You have a very important thing
to do today.

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,202
- Like what?
- Well, if I told you that,

45
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,746
I'd ruin the rest of the story,
wouldn't I?

46
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,167
Of course.

47
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,880
What could be more important
than a little something to eat?

48
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:18,968
Or perhaps a little larger something.

49
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:23,556

I know that sigh.

70
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,169
Good morning, Eeyore.

71
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,337
Lovely day, isn't it?

72
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,924
Wish I could say yes, but I can't.

73
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,259
Oh my, Eeyore.

74
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,180
You wouldn't happen to have any honey
lying about, would you?

75
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:49,184
You see, I seem to have run out.

76
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,644
Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy.

77
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,689
Perhaps I should look in back.

78
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,611
Bother. No honey in here, either.

79
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,154
What?

80
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,866
Eeyore, what has happened to your tail?

81
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,076
- What has happened to it?
- Well...

82
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,663
...it isn't there.

83
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,502
That accounts for a good deal.
That explains everything.

84
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,420
No wonder.

85
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,134
Oh! There it is.
I'd recognize it anywhere.

86
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,136
The very tree where I was hatched.

87
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,388
I remember the day
Mother made these marks,

88
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:31,935
her giant meaty claw carving furrows
in the crumbly bark.

89
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,896
Chapter one, the birth of a genius.

90
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,940
Pardon me, Owl. What are you doing?

91
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,567
Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore.

92
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,987
Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs.

93
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,448
Yes. Now, where was I?

94
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,784
Oh, yes, of course. With steely nerve...

95
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,538
Perhaps you could take a short break
from your important work

96
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,541
and help us find Eeyore's tail?

97
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,085
...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail!

98
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,962
Eeyore's tail?

99
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,421
What's wrong with Eeyore's tail?

100
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,340
Well, it isn't there.

101
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,384
Yes. So I see.

102
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,094
Won't you help us, Owl?

103
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:10,640
You have such a talent for speaking
and telling us what to do.

104
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,644
Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I?
I didn't think anyone noticed.

105
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,146
All right, take this.
Write this down carefully.

106
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:21,109
Now, the customary procedure
in such cases is as follows.

107
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,610
Excuse me, Owl,

108
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:27,615
but what does
"Crustimoney Proseedcake" mean?

109
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:32,745
For I am a bear of very little brain
and long words bother me.

110
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,206
It means "the thing to do."

111
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,668
Oh. Well, as long as it means that,
I don't mind.

112
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:44,841
All right. Yes, well,
the thing to do is as follows:

113
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,426
First, issue a reward to the...

114
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,720
- Gesundheit.
- I beg your pardon?

115
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,598
Well, you sneezed
just as you were going to tell me

116
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,225
what the first thing to do was.

117
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,935
I didn't sneeze.

118
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,522
No, you did, Owl.

119
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,609
No, I didn't. You can't sneeze
without knowing it.

120
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:06,821
Well, you can't know it without
something having been sneezed.

121
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,116
As I was saying,

122
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,286
- first, issue a reward.
- He's doing it again.

123
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,538
You must be catching a cold.

124
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,957
I'll probably catch it, too.

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,961
No, no, no! I'm not catching a cold.

126
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:25,215
The word is "issue," not "achoo",

127
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,008
and "achoo" isn't even a word.

128
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,219
It's just a sort of sneezy sound
like achoo!

129
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:31,095
Perhaps you should lie down, Owl?

130
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,265
- Oh!
- My throat feels a little scratchy.

131
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,726
Open wide, please.

132
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,020
Ahh.

133
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,813
Just as I suspected.

134
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:44,108
Owl, we need honey.

135
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,861
Enough of this infernal folderol!

136
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:50,615
Look, the thing to do is,
we write a notice

137
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,243
promising a large something

138
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:57,830
to anyone who finds
a replacement tail for Eeyore!

139
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,165
Is that clear?

140
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,127
That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl.

141
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,340
Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher
Robin to write out the notices,

142
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,176
and we'll put them up
all over the forest.

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,310

Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail.

Consider yourself pounced.

165
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:21,080

Oh, no, you don't. Come here. Whoo!

00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,472
Well, I must have scared him off.

This isn't working out the way
I was hoping. Make him go away.

178
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,824
Oh, dear.

179
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,618
Get him off of me!

180
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,122
Is he still there?

181
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:05,667
Oh, yes. He's still here.

182
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,419
And I think he wants to stick with you.

183
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:09,587
What?

184
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,216
I never thought of having
a sidekick before.

185
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:18,805
I got to admit, he is a handsome devil.
Look at the chin on this kid.

186
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:22,559
No, no. I can't do it, I tell you.
It's too risky.

187
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,436
Why, if something were to happen
to this little guy,

188
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,606
I just couldn't live with myself.

189
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,736
It's a dangerous path I bounce.
But I bounce it alone.

190
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,198
Because the Hundred Acre Wood
needs a hero, Pooh Bear,

a member of our community.

I present to you: Exhibit A.

Eeyore, will you turn around, please?

00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,193
Oops, sorry.

204
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:17,197
Our dear friend Eeyore
has lost his tail.

205
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,323
Oh, dear.

206
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,410
We mustn't leave him in this condition.

207
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:27,207
So, we will have a contest
to find a new tail for Eeyore.

208
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,835
I do say, Christopher
Robin, the winners of such contest

209
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,131
are traditionally awarded
some form of remuneration.

Moonyour... A renew...

What are we renumbering?

212
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:45,517
I don't know, Pooh,
but it sounds like a good thing.

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,769
Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet.

214
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,647
It's a prize. But what shall it be?

215
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,483
How about something great,
like a firecracker!

216
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,235
Oh, gracious, no.

217
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,779
How about something nice,
like a warm hug?

218
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,864
Pruning shears. I need pruning shears.

219
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:04,202
I'd say thistles,
but nobody listens to me, anyway.

220
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:10,542
Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping
for something a bit... sweeter?

221
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,046
Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea.

222
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,467
The prize for a new tail shall be...
a pot of honey.

223
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:20,969
Hooray!

224
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,806
As the others
searched for a tail,

225
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,853
Pooh realized that a pine cone
would not win him the honey.

226
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:30,937
Why not?

227
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,940
Because it would have to be
something special.

228
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:38,444
Oh. Special, you say. Special.

229
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,446

In fact, he was so distracted
by his rumbly tummy,

298
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,224
- I did?
- Certainly.

299
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,767
Just there, at your feet.

300
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,311
- Oh...
- Uh, to your left.

301
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:44,566
Uh, no, Pooh, your other left.
A little bit more.

302
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,694

- There you are.

305

Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.

306
00:17:56,828 --> 00:18:01,416
Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.

307
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,793
And even more than that.

308
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:07,589
So, Pooh decided to go directly
to Owl's house,

309
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,508

321
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,006
But, Pooh, you can't read most words.

322
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,718
Yes, but especially not
the strange ones.

323

Of course I can! It says...

333
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,372
"Gone out. Busy. Backson.

In fact, we're going to skip right ahead
to advanced Tigger training.

00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,439
Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson
is pleased with all of our items.

543
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:16,609
I'm sure he will be. Oh.

544
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:19,153
I wish I had some honey.

545
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:27,370
Piglet, um, could you come here, please?

546
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,707
Pooh, are you sure
this is going to work?

547
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,250
Well, of course, Piglet.

548
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:37,005
Once I get you up in the tree,
just hand me the beehive.

549
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:41,092
And then tummy and I will
take care of the rest, won't we?

550
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:44,053
OK, Pooh.
I guess you've thought this through.

551
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:46,681
Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have.

552
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:53,771
Oh, bother. I don't remember
thinking that through.

553
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,858
Um, I'm sorry
I messed up the plan, Pooh.

554
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:58,902
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.

555
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:03,656
I shall get you out,
and we'll try again.

556
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,660
It's no use.
Think, think, think.

557
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:10,288
Ah! I know.

558
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:13,333
I'll have you down
in just a moment, Piglet.

559
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,085
No hurry, Pooh.
The bees are quite gentle.

560
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,463
As long as there's no sudden movement.

561
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,465
Ah! Oh, my!

562
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,926
Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea?

563
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,969
Oh, yes, Piglet.

564
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:27,013
- Ah!
- I'm quite sure.

565
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:29,182
Well, you know best, Pooh.

566
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:33,019
- Ah! Oh.
- Oh. There we are.

567
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:36,648
Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run!

568
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,233
OK.

569
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,572
Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh?

570
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:47,742
I suppose you could run a little faster.

571
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:48,910
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

572
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:53,081
And this can go here. All done.

573
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:55,250
It takes a smart rabbit
to trap a Back...

574
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:59,379
Oh! What are you two doing?

575
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:02,340
Beehives are not on my list
of Backson-friendly items!

576
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,384
- But, Rabbit, the...
- Move along, move along.

577
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,219
Well, I was moving.

578
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:10,265
Oh, that Backson is sure
to pick up this trail,

579
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:12,308
and we don't want to be around
when he does.

580
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:13,768
Come, come! Go, go, go!

581
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:16,813
Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch?

582
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,233
Pooh, we cannot rest until
Christopher Robin is rescued.

583
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,861
Try thinking of him instead of honey.

584
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,865
Very well. Christopher Robin.

585
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:31,077
Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin!

586
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:35,456
Ooh. It worked. Much better.

587
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,303
Does anybody see that?

588
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:49,554
See what, honey?

589
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,015
Honey? Ooh!

590
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:54,642
I can't wait to see the honey
on that Backson's honey

591
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,228
when he falls into our honey. Eh, Owl?

592
00:32:57,353 --> 00:33:00,857
That cheeky honey will honey twice
before honeying our honey again.

593
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,110
After we honey the honey,
can I honey a honey?

But you can't possibly think
that that's long enough.

690
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:55,461
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once,

691
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:58,882
and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.

692
00:38:58,965 --> 00:38:59,966
Oh.

693
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:03,469
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.

694
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:06,973
Of all things, why didn't we think
to bring a rope?

695
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,601
Well, there is this rope.

696
00:39:11,477 --> 00:39:15,732
Spot-on, Piglet. Do be a helpful
little swine and get us out of here.

697
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:17,066
All of you?

698
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,694
Yes, Piglet, all of us.

699
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:24,157
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.

700
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,874
And six.

701
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:35,335
There! Now you can all get out!

702
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,588
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.

703
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:41,633
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.

704
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,551
Can you tie a knot?

705
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:44,719
I cannot.

706
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:46,262
So, you can knot.

707
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:48,264
No, I cannot knot.

708
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:50,517
- Not knot?
- Who's there?

709
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,684
- Pooh!
- Pooh who?

710
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,353
No! Pooh, it's...

711
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:56,105
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.

712
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,357
Not possible.

713
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,818
Ah! So, it is possible
to knot those pieces.

714
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:01,986
Not these pieces.

715
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:04,155
Yes, knot those pieces.

716
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,866
- Why not?
- Because it's all for naught.

717
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,703
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.

718
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:12,747
But there is something I can do.

719
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:17,627
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.

720
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,838
I can tie a bow.

721
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:21,714
See?

722
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:24,843
For crying out loud! Piglet!

723
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,262
I know! Christopher Robin
has a jump rope.

724
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,596
Ahh!

725
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:32,100
Wait a minute. My gracious, that's it!

726
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:35,353
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.

727
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:36,688
Oh, I see.

728
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,732
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.

729
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,276
Yes, bring some honey...

730
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,070
The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.

731
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,614
With a little honey on the side.

732
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,576
You mean, all by myself?

733
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:54,914
Through there?

734
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:56,541
Yes, Piglet.

735
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:00,587
Through a dark wood fraught with peril,

736
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,589
on a mission of life or death.

737
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,508
It is a task of great complexity,

738
00:41:05,592 --> 00:41:09,888
but I have full confidence
that you shall return victorious,

739
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,849
and rescue us from the abyss.

740
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,894
Go forth, Piglet,
and we shall await your return.

741
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:18,438
For weeks, if necessary.

742
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,276
Owl!

743
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:27,697
What?

744
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,368
I can't believe how wonderful
that speech was.

745
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:33,786
I can't, either.

746
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,955
Moved me to tears.

747
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:41,002
So Piglet bravely ventured
forth towards Christopher Robin's house.

748
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:46,090
But the further he went,
the more frightened he became.

749
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:49,219
Oh, dear.

750
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,096
I mustn't fear.

751
00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:57,310
There's a very important thing to...

752
00:41:57,393 --> 00:42:01,231
Do...

753
00:42:08,238 --> 00:42:13,117
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.

754
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:16,329
Oh, dear. I am the help.

755
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,209
How did you ever get stuck up there?

756
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:24,379
It wasn't the Backson, was it?

757
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:27,340
Oh, good.

758
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:29,592
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.

759
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:46,776
Backson!

760
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,862
Huh?! Backson?

761
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:52,782
Piglet, help!

762
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,119
Whew.

763
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:10,800
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak

764
00:43:10,884 --> 00:43:12,635
- in a keyhole.
- Shh-shh-shh!

765
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,180
Do you hear something?

766
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,433
- Help! Help me!
- Piglet!

767
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:20,602
He knows my name!

768
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,609
Yeah!

769
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:30,320
Whoa! Oh!

770
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:39,829
Ah!

771
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:57,722
Backson!

772
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:01,100
Whew! It's only Tigger.

773
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:04,354
Oh! Hi, fellas!

774
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:08,358
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.

775
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:10,401
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here,

776
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:14,030
we're gonna show that Backson
what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?

777
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:16,991
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.

778
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:20,078
What? But what about all the pouncing
and the trouncing?

779
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:22,914
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.

780
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:25,625
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers,

781
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,670
is you're the only one.

782
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:32,674
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.

783
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,008
Excuse me.

784
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,804
- I can't breathe!
- Oh.

785
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,561
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.

786
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:46,980
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!

787
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:50,441
You're the only one
who can get us out of here!

788
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:53,403
We're all gonna die.

789
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:56,614
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.

790
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:59,617
Which leaves plenty of time for me
to continue my memoirs.

791
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,160
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...

792
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:02,704
♪ Honey ♪

793
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:04,539
...exacerbated
by my aunt's predilection

794
00:45:04,622 --> 00:45:06,916
- for only the finest parchment...
- Hmm.

795
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,627
...woven so tightly
the ink took weeks to fully dry.

796
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:12,755
Their nest was littered with quills
that were never used,

797
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,383
papers that were never cut,
and letters that never dried.

798
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:19,345
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in
letters that she couldn't write to me.

799
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,307
It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty,

800
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,018
which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.

801
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:28,396
Now, when my uncle had committed
an exceedingly rousing point...

802
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:29,647
Empty.

803
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:33,651
...and let me tell you,
it packed quite a wallop.

804
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,320
Huh?

805
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:36,654
Look! Look, the letters!

806
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:39,115
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!

807
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,284
I mean the letters... We can get out!

808
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:46,080
And so they all used the
letter ladder to climb out of the pit.

809
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:50,293
But little did they know that
coming through the bushes was...

810
00:45:50,376 --> 00:45:52,629
Backson!

811
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:54,172
Back to the pit!

812
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:56,549
Wait, everyone.

813
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:59,135
It's only me.

814
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:01,513
Christopher Robin!

815
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:05,016
You found them, B'loon. Well done.

816
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,894
It's Christopher Robin!

817
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:10,146
How did you escape from the Backson?

818
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,149
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?

819
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:14,484
He wakes up babies!

820
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:15,944
He swipes your stripes!

821
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:17,570
He puts out the lights!

822
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:21,199
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.

823
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:24,911
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?

824
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:26,621
Your note.

825
00:46:27,956 --> 00:46:32,669
Christopher Robin explained
that it had all been a misunderstanding.

826
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:35,630
And now that it was autumn,
the school year had begun.

827
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:40,844
His note was simply to say he had
gone out and would be back soon.

828
00:46:42,178 --> 00:46:44,430
Oh!

829
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:48,309
Ooh. Um...

830
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:53,189
OK.

831
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:55,650
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.

832
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:56,943
Just a moment, everyone.

833
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:57,569
Just a moment, everyone.

834
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,445
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.

835
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:01,614
We owe a very special someone...

836
00:47:01,698 --> 00:47:04,951
...a token of our appreciation.

837
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,202
Ohh!

838
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:10,331
This reward goes to a good friend
and a loyal companion.

839
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:12,792
Someone who not only helped us
out of this pit,

840
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:15,211
but also found Christopher Robin.

841
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:19,215
And he just so happens
to be wearing red today.

842
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,427
So it is with great, great honour
and a humble heart,

843
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,764
that I bestow this pot of honey
upon our dear friend...

844
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:28,099
...B'loon.

845
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:29,642
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.

846
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:32,187
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!

847
00:47:32,812 --> 00:47:36,274
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!

848
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:40,486
Pooh watched as B'loon took
the honey pot higher and higher,

849
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:45,366
until it was completely out of sight.

850
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,203
Oh, bother.

851
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,586
Sorry, Pooh.

852
00:47:56,669 --> 00:48:01,508
Ever have one of those days
where you just can't win, Eeyore?

853
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:05,220
Yep. I know how you feel.

854
00:48:09,474 --> 00:48:11,684
Oh, yes.

855
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:14,062
I simply must find some honey.

856
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:17,315
As Pooh continued searching,
he got hungrier...

857
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,818
- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...

858
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:24,697
- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...

859
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,699
Ohh...

860
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:30,370
...until he found himself
at Owl's house.

861
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:50,849
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.

862
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:53,226
Hello, Owl.

863
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:56,396
Well, congratulate me.

864
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:59,148
- For what?
- I have achieved completion

865
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:02,235
of my autobiographical treatise!

866
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:04,070
Oh! Was it painful?

867
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:07,323
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.

868
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:08,658
Oh.

869
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,954
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep
staring at that bell rope?

870
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:17,834
Because it reminds me of something.

871
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:20,670
And that reminds me
of another something.

872
00:49:20,753 --> 00:49:22,755
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?

873
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,676
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?

874
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:28,428
A small lick, I should think.

875
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,514
My boy, I shall do better than that.

876
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,600
Not only will I beckon you to my table,

877
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:37,604
but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt

878
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:40,064
from chapter 127,

879
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:44,527
which tells the gripping tale of how
only a few days ago,

880
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:47,780
I found that very handsome bell rope
that you were admiring

881
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:51,242
just hanging over a thistle bush.

882
00:49:51,326 --> 00:49:52,660
Thistle bush?

883
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:54,537
Or was it a gorse bush?

884
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,832
No. No. It was definitely
a thistle bush.

885
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:59,167
Pardon me, Owl.

886
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,920
At first I thought someone lived there,
so I rang it.

887
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:03,254
No one answered.

888
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:06,216
And then the thing just fell off
in my hand.

889
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:10,303
What sort of place
was this particular thistle bush in?

890
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:12,680
Certainly not a very cheery place.

891
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:14,933
One might say it was rather...

892
00:50:15,016 --> 00:50:16,476
Gloomy?

893
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,103
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?

894
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh, dear.

895
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:23,233
Nobody seemed to want it,
so I brought it home.

896
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,027
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.

897
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,529
Really? Who?

898
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:30,657
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.

899
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,742
He was fond of it, you see.

900
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,495
- Fond of it?
- Attached to it.

901
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:37,205
Attached?

902
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,165
Ohh!

903
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,251
Yes. Well, yes.

904
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:45,255
And I was just keeping it safe for him.

905
00:50:45,338 --> 00:50:48,550
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.

906
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:51,719
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.

907
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:54,806
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?

908
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,148
Some other time, perhaps?

909
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,820
Ignoring his tummy's
desperate pleas,

910
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:11,114
Pooh went directly
to Christopher Robin's.

911
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:12,198
Tail.

912
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:14,909
Nail.

913
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:16,160
Hammer.

914
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,250
So what do you think, Eeyore?

915
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,502
I'll test it out.

916
00:51:26,129 --> 00:51:28,464
Seems about the right length.

917
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:31,176
Pink bow's a nice touch.

918
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:35,638
Swishes real good, too.

919
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:37,932
So, are you happy, Eeyore?

920
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:40,185
- No.
- Ooh.

921
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:43,688
But I sure do like this new tail.

922
00:51:45,648 --> 00:51:47,192
Thank you, Pooh.

923
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,987
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.

924
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,615
I do like surprises.

925
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,117
OK. Open your eyes.

926
00:51:56,201 --> 00:51:58,161
They're open, Christopher.

927
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:01,664
No, silly.
Put your arms down.

928
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:07,670

00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,939
- I did?
- Well, yes.

945
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:11,401
Instead of thinking of your tummy,
you thought of your friend.

946
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:13,194
Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin.

947
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:16,823
And now I don't think
I shall be hungry again

948
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:19,951
for a good long while.

949
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,495
Oh, bother.

950
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,372
Silly old bear.

951
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,464
Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

952
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,404
Wow! It's amazing
what you can find in the woods.

953
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:19,657
A marble! And a boot!

954
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:23,578
And oh, my,
that's a scary-lookin' fella.

955
01:02:23,703 --> 01:02:26,789
Gosh! Maybe these are his things.

956
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:29,584
You know, I better pick 'em up
so they won't get broken.

957
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,336
That's the last thing I would want.

958
01:02:31,419 --> 01:02:32,795
Whoa!

959
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:36,257
Oh, my gosh!

960
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:39,594
Is this a pit? I think I'm in a pit!

961
01:02:39,677 --> 01:02:42,931
Hello? Anybody up there?

962
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:47,393
Oh, well. I sure hope that fella
will be back soon.
