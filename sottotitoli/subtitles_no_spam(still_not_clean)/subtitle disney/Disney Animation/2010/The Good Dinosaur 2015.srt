1
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,729
Henry, it's time.

2
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,406
Which one did you say moved?

3
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,481
The one on the left.

4
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,130
- Aw.
- Aw.

5
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
You're a Poppa.

6
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,726
You're a momma.

7
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,726
Hmm?

8
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,088
You little sneak.

9
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,241
Hello, Libby.

10
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,442
Libby.

11
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,481
Hmm?

12
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,847
Hello, Buck.

13
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,489
He's got your eyes.

14
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,927
Get out of there, you little prickle bush.

15
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,566
All right, this is gonna be a big one.

16
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,567
Hmm?

17
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,403
Hello, Arlo.

18
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,565
Come on out.

19
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,962
Look at you.

20
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,046
Buck!

21
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,401
Whoa!

22
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,651
That's Clawtooth Mountain. And this is our farm.

23
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,766
And we're all gonna take care of it together.

24
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,441
- What?
- Gotcha!

25
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,045
Libby!

26
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,041
Ha-ha!

27
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,811
Ooh!

28
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,969
Ha-ha. Gotcha back!

29
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,964
Momma, I'm done watering.

30
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,930
Good job, Libby. Buck, get back to your chores.

31
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,123
- What?
- Thanks, Buck.

32
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,691
But I... I...

33
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,171
You're all set.

34
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,810
Can't I do something else, Momma?

35
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,245
- Get going.
- Okay.

36
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,121
Who is that?

37
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,571
Oh!

38
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,766
Hey, Eustice.

39
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,281
Aw, you stuck, little guy?

40
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,484
Let me get that for you. You're free.

41
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,449
Hello, move. Go find your poppa and your...

42
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Momma!

43
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Whoa. The river's not something

44
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,409
to mess around with there, Arlo.

45
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,240
Be careful. What's the problem?

46
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,444
Poppa, Henrietta is the worst one in the coop!

47
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,121
Yesterday you said Footless Fran was the worst.

48
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,284
She's only got one foot.

49
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,206
You don't have to like 'em, Arlo.

50
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,930
You just have to feed 'em.

51
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,291
That should do it.

52
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,842
Now, this will keep them rotten critters from stealing our food

53
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,129
because I made this silo 100% critter-proof.

54
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,045
Put your mark on there, Henry. You earned it.

55
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,964
- Yeah, Poppa, do it! Come on!
- Yeah!

56
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,802
Only if your momma does it first.

57
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,804
If anyone's earned a mark around here, it's her.

58
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,081
Did you just put your mark higher than mine?

59
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,126
What? No. It's just the angle you're looking at it.

60
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,521
The "angle," huh?

61
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,245
- Ooh, ooh. Me too!
- Me, me, me! My turn!

62
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,845
My turn!

63
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,691
Now hold on. It's not that easy.

64
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,885
You've got to earn your mark by doing something big.

65
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,010
For something bigger than yourself.

66
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,400
Someday you'll all make your mark and I can't wait to see it.

67
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,570
That is how you clear a field. Attaboy, Buck.

68
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,446
He'll figure it out. Be just fine.

69
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,528
Go on, Buck. You earned it.

70
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,045
Good job, son.

71
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,084
You've got it, Libby! Just a little bit more.

72
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,121
- Beautiful.
- You earned your mark, sweetheart.

73
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,802
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

74
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,041
Arlo!

75
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,885
He'll get there.

76
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,481
All right, you cluckers, you're about to get fed.

77
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,765
- Arlo.
- Huh?

78
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,441
- Come here.
- Buck! What happened?

79
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,730
I came to help you with your chores.

80
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,406
And then they attacked.

81
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,446
- You're gonna be okay.
- Tell Momma I love her.

82
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,330
I see a light.

83
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,761
I'll go get help!

84
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,048
Oh, you should see your face!

85
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,327
I should've known!

86
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,007
- Always got to mess me up.
- Me?

87
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,844
You mess up your chores and everyone else's.

88
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,930
- You're such a coward.
- Buck!

89
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,009
I ain't a coward. And I'm gonna make my mark.

90
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,961
Just like you, and Libby, and everyone!

91
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,851
You will, darling. You just need a little more time.

92
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,328
Forget it. I didn't even want that dumb mark anyway.

93
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,645
I got an idea.

94
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,006
Arlo. Arlo. Wake up.

95
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,321
Huh?

96
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,848
Come with me.

97
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,681
Uh...

98
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,320
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

99
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, now take a walk out there.

100
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,526
- By myself?
- Go on.

101
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,281
Poppa. Poppa.

102
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,721
Calm down. Breathe.

103
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,288
Oh.

104
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,364
Sometimes you got to get through your fear

105
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,000
to see the beauty on the other side.

106
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,081
Wow.

107
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,488
I got a new job for you tomorrow.

108
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,761
That is if you still want to make your mark.

109
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,003
The dang wilderness critter's coming over the fence, eating our food,

110
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,282
and I've had it up to my snout.

111
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,249
If this keeps up, we won't have enough food to survive the winter.

112
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,887
That's why you are gonna catch that critter.

113
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,164
Then along comes a critter...

114
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
And this is how you're gonna finish the job.

115
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,808
When that critter's taken care of,

116
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,324
you'll put your mark on the silo right next to mine.

117
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,526
I'll take care of the critter, Poppa. It won't stand a chance.

118
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,523
What are you doing, you bug?

119
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,531
Get out of here.

120
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,042
Huh! Move along, leaf. Move along.

121
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,485
You're dead, critter.

122
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,889
Okay. You're free.

123
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,924
What are you doing? Just leave! Flee!

124
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,048
Stay back! Go! Whoa.

125
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,330
Arlo!

126
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,011
Why'd you let it go?

127
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,607
It was biting, and coming at me, and screeching, and...

128
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,888
You had a job to do.

129
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,331
You got to get over your fear, Arlo, or you won't survive out here.

130
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,281
Come on.

131
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,210
We're gonna finish your job right now.

132
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,242
- Out there?
- Get over.

133
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,642
But, Poppa, what if we get lost?

134
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,521
As long as you can find the river, you can find your way home.

135
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,845
What do you see?

136
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,210
Uh, tracks?

137
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,648
And they're washing out, we got to move!

138
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,005
We're losing it!

139
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,284
Arlo, keep moving!

140
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,681
Poppa, wait.

141
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,684
Arlo, what did I say about keeping...

142
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,282
It's okay.

143
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,246
It's okay, Arlo. I'm sorry.

144
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,208
I just wanted you to get through your fear.

145
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,084
I know you have it in you.

146
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,050
But I'm not like you.

147
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,289
You're me and more.

148
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,763
I think we went far enough today.

149
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,765
Storm's getting worse. Let's get you home.

150
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,166
Arlo, move!

151
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,921
Run, Arlo!

152
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,486
Poppa!

153
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,282
Poppa! Poppa! Poppa!

154
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,766
Momma!

155
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,091
If we don't get this harvest in before the first snow,

156
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,684
we won't have enough food for winter.

157
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,128
I know it's hard without Poppa, but I need you to do more, Arlo.

158
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,883
Don't worry, Momma. I won't let us starve.

159
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,890
You're a good son.

160
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,721
Huh?

161
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,691
- You!
- Huh?

162
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,088
You've got some nerve coming here.

163
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,560
It's all your fault!

164
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,170
My poppa would still be alive if it weren't for you!

165
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,407
Help!

166
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,009
Momma! Momma!

167
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,481
Momma!

168
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,285
Momma?

169
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,002
Momma!

170
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,921
You!

171
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,888
I should've killed you the first time.

172
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,204
This is all your fault.

173
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,487
Get over here. Get over here.

174
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,011
Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away!

175
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,922
That's right. You better run!

176
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,847
Where am I? Where's home?

177
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,361
Oh.

178
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,123
As long as you can find the river, you can find your way home.

179
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,281
You again?

180
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,445
Get out of here.

181
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,806
Ugh!

182
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,010
I told you to stay away from me.

183
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,448
I am still gonna squeeze the life out of you.

184
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,686
But before I do, can you find me some more?

185
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,920
Uh, here, more of these. You know...

186
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,082
No. Stop. What are you doing?

187
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,802
Hey, wait. Can you take me to the berries?

188
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,761
Where are you going?

189
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,889
I knew it. I'm gonna die out here. Because of you.

190
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,966
Hey. Hey. What are you doing? No, no, no. Stop!

191
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,648
Hey. Hey. No. Stop!

192
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,405
Ooh.

193
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,966
Ow. Ow.

194
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,725
Why you little... Come back here!

195
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,201
Berries!

196
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,641
Oh!

197
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,450
What's with you?

198
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,410
They're right here. Crazy critter.

199
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,720
Hello.

200
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,486
Hello?

201
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,690
We've been watching you.

202
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,169
We thought you were going to die, but then you didn't.

203
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,887
That creature protected you.

204
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,560
- Why?
- I don't know.

205
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,204
I'm going home. Do you know how far Clawtooth Mountain is?

206
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,931
Good idea. We want him.

207
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,611
Why?

208
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,002
Because it's terrifying out here.

209
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,329
He can protect me like my friends.

210
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,690
This is Fury.

211
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,287
He protects me from the creatures that crawl in the night.

212
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,921
This is Destructor.

213
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,606
She protects me from mosquitoes.

214
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,968
This is Dream Crusher.

215
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,442
He protects me from having unrealistic goals.

216
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,607
And this is Debbie.

217
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,205
Yes, we need him.

218
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,811
What is his name?

219
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,122
A name? I don't know.

220
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,323
Hmm. Then I will meditate on this.

221
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,770
Hmm...

222
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,562
I name him, I keep him. Hmm...

223
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,401
Killer.

224
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,162
Hmm... Beast.

225
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,282
Hmm... Murderer.

226
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,970
- Hmm...
- Uh... Grubby!

227
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,162
- Funeral Planner?
- Uh, Cootie!

228
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,369
- Hmm... Hemorrhoid.
- Uh, Squirt!

229
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,523
- Uh, Frank!
- Stinky!

230
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,881
- Maniac!
- Funky!

231
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,121
- Violet.
- Spike!

232
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,890
- Lunatic.
- Spot!

233
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,763
Spot! Come here, Spot. Come here.

234
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,763
He is named. You clearly are connected.

235
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,610
Good for you.

236
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,209
On your path to Clawtooth Mountain that creature will keep you safe.

237
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,601
Don't ever lose him.

238
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,684
No. No. You can't have him, Debbie.

239
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,366
No, no, no. Debbie!

240
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,530
Debbie! Stop! You're better than this.

241
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,846
No, no, no! Come back! Debbie!

242
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,760
Where are you going? I need to get home.

243
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,490
Ow!

244
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,606
Huh?

245
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,491
Ugh...

246
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,561
Spot, watch this.

247
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,240
Oh.

248
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,771
Huh? Huh?

249
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,970
I miss...

250
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,884
I miss my family.

251
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,485
Family.

252
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,126
That's me.

253
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,090
There's Libby.

254
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,240
And Buck.

255
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,645
And Momma.

256
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,011
And...

257
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,165
And Poppa.

258
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,081
Family.

259
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,001
Huh?

260
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,522
You don't understand. That's okay.

261
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,051
Yes. That's your family.

262
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,445
I miss him.

263
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,687
Oh...

264
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,486
We should stop.

265
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,606
Stop!

266
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,251
Arlo, move.

267
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,087
Run, Arlo!

268
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,481
Where's the river?

269
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,920
I've lost the river.

270
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,569
I'm never getting home.

271
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,771
I'm never getting home.

272
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,567
Help! Help! Help!

273
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,889
Aw, say, friend, are you wounded?

274
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,730
No. I'm not hurt.

275
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,208
Oh, good. Thank goodness for that.

276
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,887
Uh, Coldfront, Downpour, keep looking for wounded folk.

277
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,531
Wait. I'm lost. I need to get home. Clawtooth Mountain.

278
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,763
Uh... Clawtooth Mount...

279
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,491
Oh, you mean the mountain range with the three points.

280
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,245
- Yes!
- Yeah!

281
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,006
Oh, yeah. I've been there. Uh, but you know, kid... Mmm.

282
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,687
You're not even close. Still, I know the way.

283
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,841
My name's Arlo.

284
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,408
I'm sorry. I just... I used to have a name like that once.

285
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,246
That was before I started following the storm!

286
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,841
The storm?

287
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,527
The storm swept me out. I was afraid for my life,

288
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,809
but the storm gave me a relevation.

289
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,723
And I wasn't scared anymore.

290
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,525
You mean a revelation?

291
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,646
No! A relevation. Okay?

292
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,371
I was at a real low point. You know?

293
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,251
And the storm swept me up to a real high point,

294
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,324
and then left me at a higher relevation.

295
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,401
Wow.

296
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,641
Yeah, wow.

297
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,122
That's when the storm gave me my new name because... What do we say?

298
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,043
The storm provides.

299
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,329
The storm provides. You can call me Thunderclap.

300
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,365
Thunderclap. Can you help me get home?

301
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,803
Uh, yeah, well... Uh, maybe. Oh!

302
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,281
But first, we just need to check the area.

303
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,807
There's plenty of folks in a bad way after a storm like this, don't you know?

304
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,201
Uh, Thunderclap, I found someone! Over here!

305
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,966
You know, we could use your help, friend.

306
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,201
Uh...

307
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,810
Whoa! Yeah! That is great.

308
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,041
It's a critter.

309
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,931
Ah! A freed critter. Thanks to you.

310
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,330
You know, I just want to take a moment and thank the storm for this meal.

311
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,968
Don't think you can mess with me.

312
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,408
I've seen the eye of the storm!

313
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,449
And I forgot what fear is!

314
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,087
I'm not afraid of anything.

315
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,209
No, I didn't say you were.

316
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,004
Hey, where are you going, friend?

317
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,402
I'm... I need to get home.

318
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,765
And I said we would get you home.

319
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,928
Friend, you have a critter of your own.

320
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,486
Oh, I smell it. One of the juicy ones.

321
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,841
Where is it?

322
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,203
He's hiding. Over there. By that big rock.

323
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,528
- The storm provides.
- No!

324
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,248
- Spot!
- Get him!

325
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,046
Hey, slow down. There's no place to hide, yellow belly.

326
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,440
Come back with that critter!

327
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,970
Help! Help!

328
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,725
Help!

329
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,322
- Hey, you okay, kid?
- Yes.

330
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,200
I hate those kind. Lying sons of crawdads picking on a kid.

331
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,444
Well, ain't you just the cutest thing.

332
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,847
He likes you.

333
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,410
Imagine that, Ramsey. Even with your stinky face.

334
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,611
Nash! Boundaries. This is my personal bubble.

335
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,524
Nah, that ain't your bubble. This is your bubble.

336
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,602
Nash, get out of your sister's bubble.

337
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,562
You got no business being out here.

338
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,447
Yes, sir. I don't. I'm trying to get home, but I lost the river.

339
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,648
Please, my momma needs me.

340
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,326
- Take it easy, kid.
- Do you know where the river is?

341
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,489
What river? There's tons of rivers around these parts.

342
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,564
By Clawtooth Mountain. It has three points.

343
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,766
Don't know that one.

344
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,888
We're heading south to a watering hole.

345
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,361
Come with us. Someone there might help you.

346
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,602
We ain't got time for baby-sitting,

347
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,603
we got longhorns to round up.

348
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,841
My genius brother lost our whole herd in one day.

349
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,447
I did not lose them, Ramsey.

350
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,609
How many times I got to tell you this? They just wandered off.

351
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,685
We still got to find them. We can't help you, kid.

352
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,002
Wait! But what if we could help you?

353
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,531
Spot can sniff out anything. I've seen him do it.

354
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,125
He can find your longhorns.

355
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,247
Hey!

356
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,647
Come on, Spot. Sniff it out, boy.

357
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,560
Good boy, Spot.

358
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,006
He's got something.

359
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,969
Aw, dang.

360
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,284
Hey, kid, if you're pulling my leg, I'm gonna eat yours.

361
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,642
- He found the herd.
- Whoo-whee! We got 'em.

362
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,127
Wait, do longhorns have feathers?

363
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,406
Rustlers.

364
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,881
Rustlers?

365
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,446
We got to move.

366
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,921
Yah!

367
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,248
I don't see any rustlers.

368
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,890
They're out there.

369
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,400
So, how far did you say that watering hole was?

370
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,251
- I got a job for you.
- I'm not really good at jobs.

371
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,364
I need you to keep on the dodge and sidle up the loblolly,

372
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,046
past them hornheads just hooting and a hollering,

373
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,565
and score off them rustlers.

374
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,369
We'll cut dirt and get the bulge on them.

375
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,201
What?

376
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,760
He just wants you to get on that rock and scream.

377
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,405
Uh, but who's out there?

378
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,723
They'll come right at you. You hold your ground. Don't move.

379
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,486
Don't move? What if they have claws and big teeth?

380
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,086
Don't overthink it.

381
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,281
Howdy.

382
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,166
- What are you up to, boy?
- Nothing.

383
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,403
Nothing? Oh! What's your name?

384
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,205
Uh, Arlo.

385
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,006
Well, Arlo,

386
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,401
you don't look like you're doing nothing.

387
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,006
What's he look like he's doing to you, Lurleane?

388
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,323
Oh, come on, Bubbha. Ask me. Ask me what I think they're doing.

389
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,767
Pervis, shut your mouth!

390
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,282
Ah, looks like he's trespassing.

391
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,560
And what do we do with trespassers? Tell them, Earl.

392
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,088
We kill them!

393
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,851
I got you!

394
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,403
Nash, the herd! Yah! Yah!

395
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,205
Yah! Giddy up. Come on now. Giddy up! Yah!

396
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,284
Watch out!

397
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,369
Nobody steals our longhorns.

398
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,130
Finders keepers.

399
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,288
Yee-ha!

400
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,331
Come on now. Momma wants to play with you.

401
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,531
I know you're there. I can smell you.

402
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,761
Oh.

403
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,083
Oh, shoot! That's my favorite tooth!

404
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,130
I'm gonna love ending you!

405
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,361
Come on, we got to drive this herd out of here.

406
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,887
Yah! Come on now.

407
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,003
Aren't you the cutest?

408
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,131
You and that critter showed real grit today.

409
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,569
We could use that critter. How about we trade?

410
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,250
I'll give you my harmonica for him.

411
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,290
Thanks, but Spot ain't for trading.

412
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,647
Come here, Spot. Come here.

413
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,450
Your loss.

414
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,922
That's a good one. Gonna scar up real good.

415
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,168
That's nothing. Look at this! I run into 15 outlaw stegos.

416
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,648
They're all bigger than me and meaner than me.

417
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,721
What happened?

418
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,406
Fought 'em off, of course. Was winning, too.

419
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,202
Then one gets his dang spikey tail stuck in my foot and pulls!

420
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,124
- Whoa.
- Still can't feel my toes.

421
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,960
Which comes in handy

422
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,440
when you're kicking piles of bull...

423
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,130
She's jealous.

424
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,441
Jealous? Ha!

425
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,963
Once a stampede of longhorns was coming right at me,

426
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,124
but my tail was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

427
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,525
I was dead for sure. So I chewed the dang thing off!

428
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,401
Who does that?

429
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,482
Nobody does that!

430
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,561
You're crazy!

431
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,690
I'm surprised you don't have one right across your face.

432
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,761
Butch, how'd you get your scar?

433
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,361
I don't know if you're ready for that story.

434
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,687
I can take it.

435
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,287
- Oh, yeah. You got to tell him, Pa!
- That's a good one!

436
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,125
It was 100 degrees in the shade.

437
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,329
I walked for five days with no water.

438
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,881
Then I saw it. A pretty pond.

439
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,162
I bent down to take a drink,

440
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,568
when these crocs launched out of the water.

441
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,404
One croc bit me on the face.

442
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,884
Ain't no way I wasn't its supper except for one thing,

443
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,850
I wasn't ready for dying that day.

444
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,051
I bit one croc in half, tail-whipped the other,

445
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,526
and the last one...

446
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:55,049
Well, I drowned that croc in my own blood.

447
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,562
- Whoa.
- Dang!

448
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,042
Ooh! Look, look, gives me little goosies every time.

449
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,770
I love that story!

450
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,120
Show him your souvenir.

451
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,284
Ain't that just too good?

452
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,931
- Can I touch it this time?
- No.

453
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,610
Huh. You guys would have liked my poppa.

454
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,603
He wasn't scared of anything.

455
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,488
I'm done being scared.

456
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,210
Who said I'm not scared?

457
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,681
But you took on a croc!

458
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,888
And I was scared doing it.

459
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,691
If you ain't scared of a croc biting you on the face,

460
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,889
you ain't alive. Listen, kid,

461
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,449
you can't get rid of fear. It's like Mother Nature,

462
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,124
you can't beat her or outrun her, but you can get through it.

463
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,242
You can find out what you're made of.

464
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,646
The first snow.

465
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,565
It's early this year.

466
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,725
And I got to get home to Momma.

467
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,520
We'll get you to that watering hole.

468
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,127
A deal's a deal. At first light, we ride.

469
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,485
- Let's go!
- Yah!

470
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,441
Hey, kid, head 'em off before those longhorns split.

471
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,765
Yah!

472
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,285
There it is!

473
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,411
Clawtooth Mountain! There's home!

474
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,130
Whoo-whee!

475
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,248
We've got to drive this herd down south.

476
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,006
You hurry on back to your momma. And don't stop for nothing!

477
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,369
Thanks! I sure appreciate you looking out for me!

478
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,446
You'll be all right. You're one tough kid.

479
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,686
Oh!

480
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,161
Whoa!

481
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,362
Whoo-hoo!

482
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,521
Whoo!

483
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,561
Whoa.

484
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,761
Wow.

485
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,209
It's so close. We're almost there, Spot!

486
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,651
We need to get home.

487
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,403
You're gonna love it, Spot.

488
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,564
You'll have a warm place to sleep. Right next to me.

489
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,370
And all the corn you can eat.

490
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,087
There's lots of space to run around.

491
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,888
It'll be your farm, too.

492
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,088
We'll all look after it together.

493
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,765
I can't.

494
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,490
No!

495
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,491
Spot!

496
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,686
Spot!

497
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,320
Spot!

498
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,487
No! Spot!

499
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,041
Poppa?

500
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,727
Poppa?

501
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,921
You're alive?

502
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,208
I can't believe it. It's you.

503
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,763
My friend! Spot!

504
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,242
He helped me and now he's in trouble.

505
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,361
We have to go back.

506
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,607
Poppa, stop.

507
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,241
Stop!

508
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,887
Poppa?

509
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,526
You're not here.

510
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,365
I'm scared.

511
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,443
But Spot needs me.

512
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,526
I blamed him for what happened to you, but it wasn't his fault.

513
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,889
So I got to go help him.

514
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,488
Because I love him.

515
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,130
I knew you had it in you.

516
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,207
You're me and more.

517
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,247
Now go take care of that critter.

518
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,249
Back off!

519
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,085
Well, look who got relevated.

520
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,048
Go get him.

521
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,241
Spot.

522
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,720
Spot!

523
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,484
The storm provides.

524
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,326
Spot!

525
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,971
Spot!

526
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,004
Spot!

527
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,522
We're home, Spot.

528
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,887
Henry?

529
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,286
Arlo.

530
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,042
Arlo!
