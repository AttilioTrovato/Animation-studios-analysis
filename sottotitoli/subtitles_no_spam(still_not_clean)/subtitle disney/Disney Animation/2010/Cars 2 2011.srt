1
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,717
<i>This is Agent Leland Turbo.</i>

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,802
<i>I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.</i>

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,807
<i>Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.</i>

4
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,561
<i>You won't believe
what I found out here.</i>

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:05,357
<i>This is bigger than anything we've ever seen,
and no one even knows it exists.</i>

6
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:09,278
<i>Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry,
it could blow the operation.</i>

7
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,864
<i>- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
- Let's go.</i>

8
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,408
<i>Transmitting my grids now.
Good luck.</i>

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,152
All right, buddy, we're here.

10
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,446
Right where you paid me to bring you.

11
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,448
Question is, why?

12
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,951
I'm looking for a car.

13
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,577
A car? Ha!

14
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,206
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.

15
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,916
Exactly where I want to be.

16
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,878
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

17
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,757
What are you doing out here?

18
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,134
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

19
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:18,389
Well, turn around and go back
where you came from.

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,266
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

21
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:24,311
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

22
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,358
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

23
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,235
Buddy?

24
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,967
<i>Incoming.
All workers report to the loading dock.</i>

25
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,931
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

26
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,309
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

27
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,187
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

28
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,193
Come on, guys.
These crates aren't gonna unload themselves.

29
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:58,155
<i>Too many cars here.
Out of my way.</i>

30
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,658
Professor Zündapp?

31
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,243
Here it is, Professor.
You wanted to see this before we load it?

32
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,579
Yes. Very carefully.

33
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,957
A TV camera.

34
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,502
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.

35
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,545
What are you up to now, Professor?

36
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:30,187
This is valuable equipment.
Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.

37
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,189
<i>- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!</i>

38
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,775
This is one of those British spies
we told you about.

39
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,862
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

40
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,198
Agent Leland Turbo.

41
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,998
It's Finn McMissile!

42
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,127
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

43
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!</i>

44
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,086
What?

45
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,602
Get to the boats!

46
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,129
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!

47
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,625
<i>He's dead, Professor.</i>

48
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

49
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,298
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

50
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:49,469
Mater, Tow Mater, that's who,
is here to help you.

51
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,016
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

52
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,895
I... Gosh. I'm so sorry.

53
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,480
I thought I could make it this time, but...

54
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,861
Smooth like pudding, huh?

55
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,323
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.

56
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,826
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.

57
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,202
Hey, but look on the bright side.

58
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,873
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

59
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,501
You're the only one that's nice
to lemons like me, Mater.

60
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,838
Don't sweat it.
Shoot, these things happen to everybody.

61
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,258
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

62
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,803
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

63
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,514
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

64
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,766
Not yet.

65
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,519
He must be crazy excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.

66
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,896
Four! Wow!

67
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,650
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

68
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:48,028
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

69
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,446
Just me and...

70
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,990
McQueen!

71
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,368
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!

72
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,996
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

73
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,957
McQueen's back!

74
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,002
McQueen's back! McQueen's back!

75
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,712
McQueen's back!

76
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,548
Lightning! Welcome home!

77
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,386
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.

78
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,553
Welcome home, soldier.

79
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,014
The place wasn't the same
without you, son.

80
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,558
What? Did he go somewhere?

81
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,145
It's good to be home, everybody.

82
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,814
- Mater!
- McQueen!

83
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,273
- Mater!
- McQueen!

84
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,657
Hey, how far did you
make it this time, Otis?

85
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,703
- Halfway to the county line.
- Not bad, man!

86
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,413
I know! I can't believe it either!

87
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,333
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.

88
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,668
You too, buddy.

89
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,296
Man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

90
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,299
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

91
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,179
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

92
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,598
Wow.

93
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,101
I can't believe they
renamed the Piston Cup

94
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,229
after our very own Doc Hudson.

95
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,773
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

96
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,861
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

97
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,076
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

98
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,374
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

99
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,669
- What you got planned?
- You sure you can handle it?

100
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,173
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

101
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,300
I can handle anything.

102
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,093
Mater?

103
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,430
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

104
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,474
- Mater?
- Relax.

105
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,101
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

106
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,439
Faster, faster. Come on.
Here we go!

107
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,024
Faster!

108
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,446
Wow.

109
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,991
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

110
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,118
This is going to be good!

111
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,214
Did you see that?

112
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,759
This ain't going to be good.

113
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,515
Boy, this was the best day ever!

114
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,101
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

115
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,688
- Boy, Mater, today was...
- Shoot, that was nothing.

116
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,857
Wait till you see what
I got planned for tonight!

117
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:35,445
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

118
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,865
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

119
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,369
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!

120
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,747
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.

121
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,124
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

122
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,462
You know, just for tonight.

123
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,632
We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

124
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,634
Okay.

125
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,679
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,224
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.

127
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,476
See you soon, amigo.

128
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,651
This is so nice.

129
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,529
I can't tell you how good
it is to be here alone,

130
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,447
just the two of us, finally.

131
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,534
- You and me.
- Good evening.

132
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,910
My name is Mater,

133
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,871
and I'll be your waiter.

134
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,373
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

135
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,500
Mater? You work here?

136
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,210
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

137
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,254
I snuck in here when nobody was lookin'

138
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,965
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

139
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,844
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

140
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,597
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

141
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,393
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.

142
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,898
Right. Your usual.

143
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,532
- Thanks, man.
- <i>Grazie</i>, Guido.

144
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,159
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

145
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,619
How should I know?

146
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,705
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My programme's on.

147
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,957
<i>Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...</i>

148
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,876
<i>His story gripped the world.</i>

149
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,128
<i>Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,</i>

150
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,257
<i>in an attempt to become the first car
to circumnavigate the globe without GPS,</i>

151
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,677
<i>ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.</i>

152
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,597
<i>Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later,</i>

153
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,392
<i>running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!</i>

154
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,436
<i>Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,</i>

155
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,814
<i>converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car</i>

156
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,817
<i>and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.</i>

157
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,278
<i>Now he claims to have
done it with his allinol.</i>

158
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,906
<i>And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do</i>

159
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,116
<i>he's created a racing competition
like no other,</i>

160
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,327
<i>inviting the greatest champions</i>

161
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,496
<i>to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.</i>

162
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,581
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

163
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,751
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

164
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,921
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

165
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,425
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

166
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,219
And we all know
what happened to them.

167
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,347
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

168
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,433
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

169
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,312
<i>nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.</i>

170
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,022
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

171
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,191
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

172
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,528
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

173
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,031
It is an honor, <i>Signore</i> Dorado, for you.

174
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,866
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

175
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,493
<i>Of course we invited him,</i>

176
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,995
but apparently after his
very long racing season

177
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,039
he is taking time off to rest.

178
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,626
The Lightning McQueen would not have
a chance against Francesco.

179
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,879
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

180
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:44,843
In miles, that is like...
Way faster than McQueen.

181
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,971
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

182
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,223
- <i>Am I on? Hello?</i>
- You're on. Go ahead.

183
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,975
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Go ahead.

184
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,395
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

185
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,148
<i>That Italian feller you got on there</i>

186
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,774
<i>can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.</i>

187
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,445
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

188
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,239
<i>If he is, how you say,</i>

189
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,200
"The bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

190
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,743
<i>'Cause he knows what's important.</i>

191
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,372
<i>Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.</i>

192
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,667
You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

193
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,502
This is not news to Francesco.

194
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,921
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

195
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>After two laps, I am out cold.</i>

196
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,050
That ain't what I meant.

197
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,304
What's going on over there?

198
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>He is afraid of Francesco.</i>

199
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,434
That's that Italian formula car.

200
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,562
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

201
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,023
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

202
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,109
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not 10.

203
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,779
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

204
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,032
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

205
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,327
- <i>Let me tell you something else.</i>
- Mater?

206
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,121
<i>McQueen could drive circles around you.</i>

207
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,373
Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?

208
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,458
<i>No.</i>

209
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,753
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

210
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,505
Any time, any track.

211
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,340
Mel, can we move on?

212
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,467
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

213
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,720
<i>a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.</i>

214
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,098
That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

215
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,392
Hey! Whoa!

216
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,728
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

217
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,647
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

218
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.</i>

219
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,819
McQueen, that was your best friend?

220
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,113
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

221
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,366
Francesco knows how good he is.

222
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,744
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

223
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,831
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

224
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,919
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

225
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,420
Not so fast, McQueen!

226
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,714
"Not so fast."
Is that your new motto?

227
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,760
Motto?

228
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,722
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

229
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,935
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

230
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,272
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

231
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,358
Pit stop.

232
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,777
You know what? They just got back.

233
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,445
Deal me in, baby.

234
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,114
Ka-chow! Yeah.

235
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,537
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

236
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,164
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

237
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,292
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

238
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,168
You're bringing Mater, right?

239
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,629
You never bring him
to any of your races.

240
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,638
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

241
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,890
Come on, it will be the thrill
of a lifetime for him.

242
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,226
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.

243
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,686
I didn't taste it!

244
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,730
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

245
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,400
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.

246
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,444
- You're coming along.
- All right!

247
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,872
Ka-chow!

248
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,740
Hey!

249
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,917
Excuse me!

250
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,044
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

251
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,926
Yeah!

252
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,955
Guido, look. Ferraris and tyres.

253
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,041
- Let's go!
- Look at this.

254
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,211
Okay, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

255
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,964
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!

256
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,215
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

257
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,301
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.

258
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,011
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.

259
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,846
Can you believe this party?

260
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,269
Hey.

261
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,689
You done good.
You got all the leaves.

262
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,318
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

263
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,654
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

264
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,115
Good job!

265
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,577
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

266
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,913
You're just realizing that?

267
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,457
That jet lag really done
a number on you.

268
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,335
Mater, things are different over here.

269
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,297
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.

270
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,342
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.

271
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,094
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

272
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,013
That's what a tow truck does.

273
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,765
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.

274
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,184
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

275
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,145
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.

276
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,940
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

277
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,234
Lightning McQueen! <i>Buona sera.</i>

278
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,195
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.

279
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,156
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

280
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,075
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

281
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,910
Anything for McQueen's friend.

282
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,372
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

283
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,750
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

284
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,585
She's a big fan of yours.

285
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,629
Hey, she has-a good taste.

286
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,966
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

287
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,426
You're right. She's a huge fan!

288
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,471
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

289
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,933
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

290
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,520
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

291
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,730
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

292
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,107
Yeah...

293
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,817
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.

294
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,112
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

295
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,154
Sorry.

296
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,491
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

297
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,910
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

298
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,372
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

299
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,833
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

300
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,670
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

301
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,424
I should probably go keep an eye on him.
See you at the race.

302
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:25,678
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

303
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,348
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

304
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,850
That's cute.

305
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,060
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

306
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,603
No.

307
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,105
Okay.

308
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,567
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!

309
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,322
<i>Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.</i>

310
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:48,075
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

311
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,163
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

312
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,291
From Brazil, Number 8...

313
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

314
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,399
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

315
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,193
That's because it's air-cooled.

316
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,946
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

317
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,990
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.

318
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,242
Try the canapés on the mezzanine.

319
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,499
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?

320
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,750
What did they learn about the camera?

321
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,960
It appears to be a standard
television camera.

322
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,297
They said if you could get closer photos
next time that would be great.

323
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,799
This was London's message?

324
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,468
No. No, sir.

325
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,886
The oil platforms you were on,

326
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,931
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

327
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,140
How did we miss that?

328
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,017
They've scrambled everyone's satellites.

329
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,561
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

330
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,481
They placed an agent on that
platform under deep cover.

331
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,818
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

332
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,027
Great.

333
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,446
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

334
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,948
Nope, not yet.

335
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,784
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

336
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,411
He'll signal you when he's ready.

337
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,037
Good, good.

338
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,206
Oh, no.

339
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,876
- What is it?
- Change of plan.

340
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,962
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?

341
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,256
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

342
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,174
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

343
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,596
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

344
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,722
You are now.

345
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,687
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

346
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,356
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

347
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,655
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

348
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,825
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.

349
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,744
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

350
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,918
Little more, please. It is free, right?

351
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,087
Keep it coming. A little more.

352
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,797
Come on, let's go. It's free.

353
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,674
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.

354
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,510
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

355
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,513
My condolences.

356
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,766
And now our last competitor.

357
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,353
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

358
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,563
Ka-chow!

359
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,274
Thank you so much
for having us, Sir Axlerod.

360
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,986
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

361
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,488
The pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

362
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,658
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

363
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,243
to this competition.

364
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,874
Somebody get me water!

365
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,460
Sweet relief. Sweet relief.

366
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:57,973
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

367
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,476
It has turned.

368
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,728
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

369
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,356
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.

370
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,234
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

371
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,028
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.

372
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,571
This trip's been amazin'.

373
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,324
He's a little excited, isn't he?

374
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,702
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Shoot.

375
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,080
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?

376
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,707
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

377
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:28,254
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!

378
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,302
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

379
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,180
I gotta go.

380
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,311
Sorry, ladies.

381
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:47,189
I'm leakin'.
I never leak. I never leak.

382
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,025
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

383
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,610
I never leak.

384
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,989
I never leak, I never leak, never...

385
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,241
Wow-wee!

386
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,581
What in the...

387
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,302
Hey, that tickles!

388
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,610
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

389
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,743
Okay, so, the American
has activated his tracking beacon.

390
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,411
Roger that. Move in.

391
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,218
Stop! Hey!

392
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,198
- You've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?

393
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,699
- He's in the loo.
- <i>So, go in!</i>

394
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,744
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- <i>Time is of the essence.</i>

395
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,829
All right.

396
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:37,257
Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

397
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,345
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

398
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,097
No offense to your makes and models,

399
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,724
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

400
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,726
after she got left at the altar!

401
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,354
What the... Whoa. Are you okay?

402
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,356
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!

403
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,943
We'd like to get to our private business here,
if you don't mind.

404
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,486
Yeah, sorry.

405
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,322
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

406
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,909
A little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

407
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,911
you best press that green button.

408
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,205
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.

409
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,833
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

410
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,334
Get out of here!

411
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,505
All right, then. And when she starts gigglin',
prepare to be squirted.

412
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,258
'Scuse me, ma'am.

413
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,343
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

414
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,763
- This cannot be him.
- <i>Is he American?</i>

415
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,516
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.

416
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,852
- Extremely.
- <i>Then it's him.</i>

417
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,895
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

418
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,606
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

419
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,276
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

420
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,362
Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station.

421
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,073
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

422
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,994
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

423
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,371
- Yeah, okay. I get it.
- And before both of them

424
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,165
there's the Type 2 buses.

425
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,792
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!

426
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,210
We should find somewhere more private.

427
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,005
Gee, don't you think that's a little...

428
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,133
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

429
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,469
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.

430
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,387
Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.

431
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,472
Got it.

432
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,973
We'll rendezvous then.

433
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,685
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?

434
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,729
- It's like a date.
- A date?

435
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,230
Mater, what's going on?

436
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,317
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

437
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,152
Guido don't believe you.

438
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,322
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

439
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,492
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

440
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,410
See you tomorrow!

441
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,746
Guido still don't believe you.

442
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,501
I got to admit,
you tricked us real good.

443
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,919
And we don't like being tricked.

444
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,837
What's so funny?

445
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:43,050
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

446
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,097
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.

447
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,849
So you think.

448
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,560
Allinol by itself is good for you.

449
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,858
But after microscopic examination

450
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,778
I have found that it has
one small weakness.

451
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,697
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse,

452
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,408
it becomes extremely dangerous.

453
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,619
Smile for the camera.

454
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,788
Is that all you want?
I got a whole act.

455
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,833
You were very interested
in this camera on the oil platform.

456
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,504
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

457
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,091
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.

458
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,385
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.

459
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:30,055
No, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

460
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,932
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

461
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,268
Go 50% power.

462
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,982
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

463
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,234
What about her?
Did you give it to her?

464
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,779
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

465
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:50,534
dramatically expanding, causing
the engine block to crack under the stress,

466
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,161
forcing oil into the combustion chamber.

467
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,122
How about him? Did you talk to him?

468
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,792
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

469
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,212
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse,

470
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,841
unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.

471
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,095
How about him? Does he have it?

472
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,267
That's him. He's the one.

473
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,185
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!

474
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,312
Yes, sir.

475
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:22,316
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

476
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,944
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

477
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,697
The project is still on schedule.

478
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,409
You will find the second agent and kill him.

479
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,797
<i>Japan, land of the rising sun,</i>

480
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,634
<i>where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.</i>

481
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,471
<i>Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.</i>

482
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,806
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

483
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,975
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

484
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,436
There's never been
a competition like this before.

485
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,980
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

486
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,150
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

487
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,027
Second, the course itself.

488
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,237
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

489
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,990
<i>David, how exactly
does this competition work?</i>

490
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:16,161
<i>All three of these street courses
are classic round-the-house racetracks.</i>

491
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,205
<i>This means that the LMP
and formula cars</i>

492
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,832
<i>should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.</i>

493
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,919
<i>Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.</i>

494
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,922
<i>And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,</i>

495
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,508
<i>like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground</i>

496
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,593
<i>but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco</i>

497
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,179
from absolutely running away with it.

498
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,098
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

499
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,016
You forget the most important factor,

500
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,018
that early dirt track section
of the course.

501
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,355
<i>The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.</i>

502
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,357
<i>French rally car Raoul ÇaRoule</i>

503
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,401
<i>is counting on
a big boost through there.</i>

504
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,486
<i>And don't forget Lightning McQueen.</i>

505
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,238
<i>His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,</i>

506
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,949
<i>was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.</i>

507
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,869
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

508
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,122
Really, Darrell,
you need to clean your windshield.

509
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,042
You're clearly not seeing this for what it is:
Francesco's race to lose.

510
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,921
<i>It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid.</i>

511
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:18,432
Speed. I am speed.

512
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,226
Really? You are speed?

513
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,229
Then Francesco is triple speed.

514
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,984
Francesco is triple speed.

515
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,861
Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

516
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,780
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

517
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,908
He is so getting beat today.

518
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,441
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tyre pressure is excellent!

519
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,360
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

520
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,163
Why is he in the pits?
He's so exposed.

521
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,414
It's his cover.

522
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,626
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

523
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,085
It must have cost him a fortune.

524
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,297
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.

525
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,299
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.

526
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,636
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.

527
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,140
<i>As they head into the palace hairpin,
Francesco builds an early lead.</i>

528
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,726
<i>Hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt.</i>

529
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,394
<i>Slipping and sliding, baby.</i>

530
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,730
McQueen, it's time to make your move!

531
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,650
Get on the outside and show 'im
what Doc taught you.

532
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,152
10-4, Mater.

533
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,281
<i>Oh, boy!
Francesco's brought to a screeching halt!</i>

534
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,409
<i>Lightning McQueen is the first
to take advantage.</i>

535
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,247
<i>And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.</i>

536
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,584
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up.

537
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,839
<i>McQueen looks happier than
a roll bar at a demolition derby!</i>

538
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,469
<i>Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.</i>

539
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,472
<i>Francesco lost a lot of
momentum in the dirt.</i>

540
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,523
<i>He's got serious work ahead of him
if he wants to get back in this race.</i>

541
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,694
<i>The racers hit the Rainbow Bridge,
with its 360-degree loop.</i>

542
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,625
- <i>It is time.</i>
- Roger that.

543
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,552
<i>Miguel Camino has blown an engine!</i>

544
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,180
<i>Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year.</i>

545
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,100
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

546
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,728
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

547
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,938
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

548
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,316
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!

549
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,151
Not for long.

550
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,697
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

551
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,990
The Pacer from the party last night.

552
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,744
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

553
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,454
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

554
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,831
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

555
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,668
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

556
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,380
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

557
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,924
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

558
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,593
<i>Get him out of the pits. Now!</i>

559
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,554
Some of them fellers is really loud!

560
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,015
- <i>Can you hear me? Over.</i>
- What?

561
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,768
<i>Get out of the pit now!
Do you hear me?</i>

562
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,355
Hey. I know you!
You're that girl from the party last night.

563
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,190
You wanna do our date now?

564
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,234
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

565
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,278
<i>Smoke from number 10, Clutchgoneski!</i>

566
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,699
<i>There's no time for messing about!
Get out of the pits!</i>

567
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,203
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

568
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,498
- <i>You're running out of time!</i>
- They're coming. Get him out of there!

569
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,917
I'm trying. Get out now.

570
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:18,171
I usually like to have a proper detailin' done
before I meet a lady friend.

571
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,473
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.

572
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,612
Miss Shiftwell?

573
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,989
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

574
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,450
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.

575
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,828
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

576
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,832
Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers?

577
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:54,916
What?

578
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,419
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.

579
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,796
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?

580
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,924
<i>Whoa! McQueen suddenly
moves to the outside.</i>

581
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,095
<i>I cannot believe what I saw.</i>

582
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,889
<i>That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!</i>

583
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,975
<i>That might have cost
McQueen the victory!</i>

584
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,955
This time, I'm going
to make sure you stay dead!

585
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,292
<i>You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused.</i>

586
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,878
What's that?
You want me to head toward that ruckus?

587
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,422
<i>No! Don't go down that street.</i>

588
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,352
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

589
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,730
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

590
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,739
<i>And here they come, the two leaders.</i>

591
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,158
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

592
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,374
- <i>It's close!
- Francesco's the winner!</i>

593
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,418
<i>McQueen's number two.</i>

594
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,507
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

595
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,972
Where did he go?

596
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,351
<i>Our rendezvous has been jeopardized.
Keep the device safe.</i>

597
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,104
- <i>We'll be in touch.</i>
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?

598
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,903
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.

599
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,530
What was your strategy today?

600
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,241
<i>Strategia?</i>
Francesco needs-a no strategy.

601
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,325
It's-a very simple.

602
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,538
You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen
to choke, pass him, then win.

603
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,207
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

604
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,334
You were in trouble for a while.

605
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,336
That dirt track section had you crawling.

606
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:08,841
To truly crush one's dream,
you must first raise their hopes very high.

607
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,096
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?

608
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,973
Is the race over? You won, right?

609
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,600
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

610
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,479
Yelling? You thought...
That's funny right there.

611
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,982
No, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers

612
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,067
doing some karate street performance.

613
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,820
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.

614
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,114
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

615
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,242
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.

616
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,326
Your date?

617
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,621
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.

618
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,040
- What?
- Wait a minute.

619
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,961
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!

620
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,505
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

621
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,508
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

622
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,012
This is exactly why I don't
bring you along to these things.

623
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,222
Maybe if I, I don't know,

624
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:59,183
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

625
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,354
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

626
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,982
Hey, there he is!

627
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,486
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?

628
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,530
I made a mistake.

629
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,950
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

630
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:22,290
<i>Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.</i>

631
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,170
<i>Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap
to Francesco Bernoulli</i>

632
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
<i>in the first race of the World Grand Prix.</i>

633
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,508
<i>And three, count 'em,
three cars flamed out</i>

634
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,304
<i>leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.</i>

635
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,974
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

636
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,519
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

637
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:47,106
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

638
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,441
but one thing's for sure,

639
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,235
<i>Lightning McQueen blew this race.</i>

640
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,696
<i>Team McQueen can't be happy right now.</i>

641
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,209
<i>Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.</i>

642
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,688
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.

643
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,441
- Right this way.
- Doggone it.

644
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,402
This is about my hook, ain't it?

645
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,613
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

646
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,116
Look. It's attached to me.

647
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,577
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

648
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,871
I never properly introduced myself.

649
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,457
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

650
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,460
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

651
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,130
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

652
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,049
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

653
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,468
I know some karate.

654
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,222
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.

655
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,058
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.

656
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,145
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

657
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,064
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

658
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,235
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once."

659
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,322
There he is!

660
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,579
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

661
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,998
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!

662
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,749
Hang on!

663
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,255
This is first-class service.

664
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,966
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

665
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,553
Your karate partners is back there.

666
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,139
They look like they tryin' to catch up!

667
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,766
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

668
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,605
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

669
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,374
Is everything okay back there?

670
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,502
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

671
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,295
<i>Roger that.</i>

672
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,425
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?

673
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,015
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

674
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,433
Thanks, old boy.

675
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,228
- You got it, mate.
- Hey, doggonit!

676
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,522
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

677
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,148
Come on! Get in here!

678
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,944
I tell you what, you really do want
this first date, don't ya?

679
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,821
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

680
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,281
What the...

681
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,494
Hold on, Sid.

682
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,430
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

683
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770
Hold on!

684
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:19,068
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be safely on an aeroplane flying home.</i>

685
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,445
<i>I'm so sorry for what I did.</i>

686
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,573
"I don't want to be the cause
of you losing any more races.

687
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,244
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.

688
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,539
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.

689
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,125
"Your best friend, Mater."

690
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,168
I didn't really want him to leave.

691
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,504
Wait, there's more here.

692
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,549
"PS. Please tell the hotel

693
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,010
"I didn't mean to order that movie.

694
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:48,597
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it.

695
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,976
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

696
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,687
There are a few more
pages of PS's here.

697
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,357
Well, at least I know if he's at home,
he'll be safe.

698
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,194
That's how I like to start the day.

699
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,947
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

700
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,074
Yeah. I hope that device didn't fall off.

701
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,701
Whoa!

702
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,537
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.

703
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,664
That was...

704
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:16,667
- Still in one piece? Great.
- I've got to go to a doctor.

705
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,253
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

706
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:22,506
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.

707
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,467
This here is Finn McSomethin' or other.

708
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,595
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

709
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,931
And, Finn, this here is my date.

710
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,641
I never did get your name.

711
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,561
Yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

712
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,105
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

713
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,068
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

714
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,819
What is this?

715
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,906
That's one of the worst
engines ever made.

716
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:51,660
It's an old aluminium V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

717
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:55,164
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts
is a pain, tell you what.

718
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,916
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

719
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,752
Yes, okay, but whose engine is this?

720
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,338
It's kinda hard to tell
from this picture, ain't it?

721
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,090
- But you took it.
- Holley.

722
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,883
Right! Yes, of course.

723
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,053
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

724
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,515
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

725
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:17,019
<i>Like a good neighbour, Mater is there!</i>

726
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:20,189
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

727
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,359
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

728
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,904
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

729
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,699
At least 35,000 cars
were made with this engine.

730
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,910
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.

731
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,080
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.

732
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,791
This seems like a dead end.

733
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,960
If there was something in the photo

734
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,295
that could narrow this down,
I'd be happier.

735
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,173
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

736
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,634
See how he's had most
of his parts replaced?

737
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,344
And see all them boxes over there?

738
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,681
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

739
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,308
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

740
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,018
Exactly.

741
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,272
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

742
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,817
I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris,
a treacherous lowlife,

743
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,779
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

744
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,450
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

745
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,742
Wait. What?

746
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,953
You obviously have
experience in the field.

747
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,789
Yeah, I live right next to one.

748
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,291
I don't know.

749
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,377
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

750
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,588
You're helping me. Please, Mater.

751
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,631
Well... Okay.

752
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,050
But you know I'm just
a tow truck, right?

753
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,637
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

754
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,181
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?

755
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,807
Paris.<i> Tout de suite.</i>

756
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,602
Yeah, two of them sweets
for me, too, Sid.

757
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,520
I always wanted to be a spy.

758
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,230
Really? Me, too.

759
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,317
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?

760
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,807
Once we're inside, stay close.

761
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,394
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

762
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,687
Got it.

763
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,689
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

764
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,901
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

765
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,694
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

766
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,447
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?

767
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,742
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?

768
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,452
Why would I...

769
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,287
Dad-gum.

770
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,332
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- <i>Monsieur,</i> part for sale.

771
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,376
They got everything here. No!

772
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,003
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

773
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,630
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

774
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,304
Do what?

775
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,058
Excuse me. What are you selling?

776
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,851
Headlights, <i>monsieur,</i> headlights?

777
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,687
- What in the...
- Two for one.

778
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,397
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!

779
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,446
- There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.

780
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,323
- Mater, get back!
- <i>Imbécile!</i>

781
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,165
Hey, wait for me!

782
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,192
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...

783
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,861
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.

784
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,945
Sure thing.

785
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,034
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

786
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,336
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

787
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:14,256
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

788
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,800
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?

789
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,469
I never liked new car smell.

790
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,139
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

791
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,100
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.

792
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,896
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage, aren't you?

793
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,107
All right, we get it.
You both know each other, you're both old.

794
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:35,235
So, here you go, informant. Inform us.

795
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,572
That is the worst motor ever made.

796
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,701
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

797
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,037
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

798
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,747
They should. I sold them.

799
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,374
- To whom?
- No idea.

800
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:52,086
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

801
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,672
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

802
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,007
Now I know.

803
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,593
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.

804
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,763
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

805
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,099
Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter.

806
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,060
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

807
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,520
and the race and the airport.

808
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,772
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

809
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,191
I want to know what other
type of cars were out there.

810
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:18,237
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

811
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,364
Are these cars considered lemons?

812
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,949
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

813
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,953
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

814
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,123
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

815
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,126
- This explains it.
- What, Tomber?

816
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,796
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov
never get together,

817
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,382
but they are having
a secret meeting in two days.

818
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,635
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.

819
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,345
That's where the next race is!

820
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,223
There's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there, too.

821
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,016
Your chances are more than good.

822
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,979
I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday.
To Porto Corsa.

823
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,607
Contact Stevenson and have him
meet us at Gare de Lyon.

824
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,025
Good work.

825
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,742
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.

826
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:09,955
You never see this many
lemons in one town.

827
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,748
'Less there's a swap meet.

828
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,542
How'd you get all them pictures?

829
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,754
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

830
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,593
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car I ever met,
but you're the smartest, too.

831
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,636
Thank you... I think.

832
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,140
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo bein' towed.

833
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,975
But he looks absolutely perfect!

834
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,228
Of course! They must be
the heads of the lemon families.

835
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,106
Makes sense.
If I was rich and broke down every day,

836
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,734
I'd hire me to tow me around
all the time, too!

837
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,738
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

838
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,324
Hang on a minute. Hold still.

839
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,707
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

840
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,000
Thank you, Finn.

841
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,711
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

842
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,677
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.

843
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:09,264
We are in Italy. We are home.

844
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,267
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

845
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:16,480
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

846
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:20,400
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino!

847
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,237
Luigi! Guido!

848
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,040
How do they do it?

849
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,669
These are the same ingredients as back home,
but it tastes so good.

850
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,922
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.

851
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,677
Hey, race car.

852
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,512
You look so down, so low.

853
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,430
Is like you have flat tyres.

854
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,895
She said you look like you are starving,

855
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,856
that she's gonna make you
a big meal and fatten you up.

856
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,233
No.

857
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,361
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

858
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,280
Capisco. I understand.

859
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,116
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

860
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,576
How did you know that?

861
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:13,912
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

862
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,498
That, and Luigi told me.

863
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,627
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

864
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,547
I brought my friend Mater
along on the trip

865
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,549
and I told him he needed
to act different,

866
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,175
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

867
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,386
This Mater is a close friend?

868
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,346
He's my best friend.

869
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,890
Then why would you ask him
to be someone else?

870
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,272
What did I do?

871
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,357
I said some things during our fight.

872
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:45,527
You know, back when Guido
and Luigi used to work for me,

873
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,822
they would fight over everything.

874
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,242
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

875
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,412
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

876
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,956
There were even some non-Ferrari fights.

877
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,168
So I tell them, <i>"Va bene,</i>
it's okay to fight.

878
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,714
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.

879
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,258
"But you got to make up fast.

880
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,345
"No fight more important than friendship."

881
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,940
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

882
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,652
Now, mangia. Eat!

883
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,165
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

884
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,541
Thank you, Stevenson.

885
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,378
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.

886
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:47,130
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

887
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,092
But everything's
voice-activated these days.

888
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,136
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.

889
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,848
<i>Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated.</i>

890
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:57,974
Cool!

891
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,768
Computer, make me a German truck.

892
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,021
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.

893
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,189
Make me a monster truck!

894
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,566
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>
- What the...

895
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,860
I vant to siphon your gas!

896
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,280
- Now make me a taco truck!
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

897
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,493
- A funny car!
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

898
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,790
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

899
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,334
So I just go in,
pretend to be this truck.

900
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,003
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.

901
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,256
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

902
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,428
That's no good.

903
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,266
Hey. What are you doin'?

904
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:43,729
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

905
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,773
For a second there,
I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.

906
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,276
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.

907
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,113
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

908
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,700
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?

909
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,787
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

910
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:04,499
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.

911
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:09,921
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

912
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,799
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

913
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,218
But my line of work is towin' and salvage.

914
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,388
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

915
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,684
- No, I meant for real.
- It's okay. I'll work around the dent.

916
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,394
In the meantime,

917
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,356
you look a little light on weapons.

918
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,659
<i>You are looking live at beautiful</i>

919
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,370
<i>Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.</i>

920
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:47,375
<i>What a magnificent setting
for the second race of the World Grand Prix!</i>

921
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,212
<i>Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"</i>

922
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,005
<i>and it's easy to see why.</i>

923
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,716
<i>With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,</i>

924
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,136
<i>Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.</i>

925
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,555
<i>And everyone who's anyone
is here today,</i>

926
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,682
<i>from the ultra-rich and super-famous</i>

927
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,352
<i>to world leaders and
important dignitaries.</i>

928
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,561
<i>You aren't kidding, David.</i>

929
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:10,649
<i>You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.</i>

930
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,151
Welcome, everyone,
to the second race of the World Grand Prix,

931
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:17,155
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

932
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,908
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke
to the press earlier today

933
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,952
to answer questions about its safety.

934
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,454
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

935
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,207
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

936
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,542
Safe. There it is.

937
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,043
So the race will go on, folks.

938
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,128
But the question everyone is asking:

939
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,839
<i>will the real Lightning McQueen
show up today?</i>

940
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,676
<i>He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage.</i>

941
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,762
<i>Francesco Bernoulli grew up
racing on this course.</i>

942
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:46,434
Signore e signori, <i>in the pole position,</i>
Numero Uno, <i>Francesco!</i>

943
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,437
<i>Bellissima!</i>
Thank you for your support!

944
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,273
And your big mistake, McQueen!

945
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,067
<i>In </i>secondo<i> position,</i>

946
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:59,072
numero 95, <i>Lightning-a McQueen-a!</i>

947
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,283
McQueen-a, is-a everything okay?

948
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:05,370
If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't.
It's perfectly safe.

949
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,540
No, guys, I just really wish
Mater were here.

950
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,792
Francesco understands, McQueen.

951
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,836
Great, here it comes.

952
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,504
What do you got, Francesco?

953
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,341
For famous race cars
like Francesco and, well, you,

954
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,261
to be far away from home is not easy.

955
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,514
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

956
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,016
Is-a no insult.

957
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,227
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

958
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,022
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.

959
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,400
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

960
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:39,988
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.

961
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,823
Mama!

962
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,993
Don't worry, Mama, McQueen is very sad.

963
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,121
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

964
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,125
And there's the insult we were missing.

965
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,644
<i>Darrell, the racers are
settling in as they head</i>

966
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,395
<i>to the Italian countryside.</i>

967
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,898
<i>Boy!</i>

968
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,525
<i>This is going to be a great race.</i>

969
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,082
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.

970
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,334
Look like someone stole their trunks.

971
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,758
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

972
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,428
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

973
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,390
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

974
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,892
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.

975
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,061
Don't-a fight over me.

976
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,897
<i>Signore</i> Tow Truck, <i>per favore.</i>

977
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,900
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

978
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:03,571
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?

979
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:04,614
<i>Impossible.</i>

980
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,616
<i>Just apply the same level of dedication</i>

981
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,911
<i>you've been using to play the idiot tow truck,
and you'll be fine.</i>

982
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:14,791
It's just that them guys look purty tough and...
Wait, did you say "idiot"?

983
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,794
- Is that how you see me?
- <i>That's how everyone sees you.</i>

984
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,462
<i>Isn't that the idea?</i>

985
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,673
<i>I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

986
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,466
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

987
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,261
<i>because they're too busy
laughing at the fool.</i>

988
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,887
<i>Brilliant!</i>

989
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,976
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I...

990
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,396
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- Okay. Okay.

991
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,190
- Computer, disguise!
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

992
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,365
It's the boss. He's coming.

993
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,581
Ivan.

994
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:01,671
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

995
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,264
He's in.

996
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,935
<i>The racers are now making
their way around the hairpin</i>

997
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,272
<i>and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.</i>

998
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,332
No more bets, please.

999
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,875
Come on, fuzzy dice!

1000
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,668
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!

1001
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,880
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

1002
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,048
Spark-a plugs.

1003
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,884
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

1004
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,387
<i>That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say.</i>

1005
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,889
Why is that?

1006
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,557
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

1007
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,060
You want me to stop
talkin' to ya right now?

1008
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,437
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

1009
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,774
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

1010
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,402
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex."

1011
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,404
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

1012
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:12,408
But that makes sense,
seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany...

1013
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,035
Mater, stop it!

1014
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,371
Okay, okay, keep your voice down!

1015
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,081
You gonna make me arrested!

1016
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,959
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

1017
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,502
He's so good!

1018
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,505
Victor!

1019
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,174
Hey, Victor!

1020
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,926
- There you are!
- Come in!

1021
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:34,138
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

1022
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,516
It's good to see you.

1023
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,268
Is the big boss here yet?

1024
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:41,521
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.

1025
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,401
Here we go.

1026
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,114
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

1027
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,116
It's just the professor.

1028
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,867
Zündapp! When is he coming?

1029
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,869
He's already here.

1030
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,082
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

1031
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,544
<i>I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,</i>

1032
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,796
<i>but my clutch assembly broke.</i>

1033
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,257
- <i>You know how it is.</i>
- Forget about it.

1034
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,675
We know how you feel.

1035
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,844
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.

1036
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,138
It's too sophisticated.

1037
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,515
<i>We are here to celebrate.</i>

1038
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,643
<i>Today, all your hard work pays off.</i>

1039
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,605
<i>The world turned their backs
on cars like us.</i>

1040
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,066
<i>They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.</i>

1041
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:32,071
<i>The only thing they haven't
stopped doing is laughing at us.</i>

1042
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:36,909
<i>They've called us terrible names:
jalopy, rust bucket, heap,</i>

1043
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:41,247
<i>clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap,</i>

1044
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,166
<i>lemon.</i>

1045
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,711
<i>But their insults just give us strength.</i>

1046
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:52,759
<i>Because today, my friends,
that all ends!</i>

1047
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,553
<i>There's smoke on the casino bridge!</i>

1048
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:56,679
Oh, no!

1049
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,389
It's Carla Veloso,
the Brazilian race car!

1050
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,271
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.

1051
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,069
<i>They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.</i>

1052
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:16,991
<i>Another crash!
It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.</i>

1053
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,826
<i>Embrace your inner lemon.</i>

1054
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,536
<i>Let it drive you.</i>

1055
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,499
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

1056
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,837
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?

1057
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,798
On the tower!

1058
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,221
<i>This was meant to be alternative fuel's
greatest moment.</i>

1059
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:42,141
<i>But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.</i>

1060
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:46,145
<i>And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve</i>

1061
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,899
<i>will become the most
powerful cars in the world!</i>

1062
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,567
Get out of the way!

1063
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,771
<i>They will come to us,
and they will have no choice,</i>

1064
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,815
<i>because they will need us.</i>

1065
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,535
We figured you might stop by!

1066
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,707
<i>And they will finally respect us!</i>

1067
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,500
<i>So hold your hoods high!</i>

1068
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:53,171
<i>After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!</i>

1069
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:55,631
No!

1070
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,176
<i>Long live lemons!</i>

1071
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,679
<i>Number 7 is loose! Shu Todoroki!</i>

1072
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,913
Finn?

1073
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,333
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

1074
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,793
<i>McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!</i>

1075
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,545
<i>They have no idea
what happened behind them.</i>

1076
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,464
This is impossible!

1077
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,674
That's what I'm talking about!
Ka-chow!

1078
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,259
What happened?

1079
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:43,054
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?

1080
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,139
Oh, no!

1081
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:55,358
<i>Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?</i>

1082
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,985
<i>I suppose that...</i>

1083
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,112
<i>The show must go on, as they say.</i>

1084
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,240
I can't believe this is really happening!

1085
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,366
Quiet!

1086
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,536
<i>Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?</i>

1087
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:11,874
<i>I cannot, in good conscience,
continue to risk the lives of any more race cars.</i>

1088
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,461
<i>The final race will not
be run on allinol.</i>

1089
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,839
<i>There you have it,
a clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod</i>

1090
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:23,052
<i>announcing that he will not require the cars
to use allinol for the final race.</i>

1091
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,303
A toast!

1092
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:28,307
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

1093
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:31,394
Mater, abort the mission.

1094
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,647
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

1095
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,149
How is your grandfather?

1096
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,402
Long live lemons!

1097
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,654
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?

1098
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,531
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

1099
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,658
You are not leaving, are you?

1100
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,743
Of course I ain't leaving.

1101
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,578
- <i>I'm just in shock...</i>
- McQueen?

1102
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,581
<i>Crashes are a part of racing, I know,</i>

1103
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,126
<i>but something like that
should never happen.</i>

1104
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,213
<i>You can choose your fuel for the final race.
What it'll be?</i>

1105
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,798
<i>Allinol.</i>

1106
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,258
<i>After today?</i>

1107
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,303
<i>My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.</i>

1108
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,930
<i>I didn't standby
a friend of mine recently.</i>

1109
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,099
<i>I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.</i>

1110
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,852
<i>So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.</i>

1111
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,772
<i>He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.</i>

1112
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,900
- <i>...till Lightning McQueen is dead.</i>
- Of course.

1113
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:24,238
Allinol must be finished for good.

1114
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,450
McQueen cannot win the last race.

1115
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,910
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

1116
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,203
No!

1117
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,171
It's the American spy!

1118
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,757
Dad-gum!

1119
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,925
<i>Gatling gun. Request acknowledged.</i>

1120
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,969
Down! Everybody, down!

1121
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,180
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

1122
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,445
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!

1123
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,572
<i>Correction acknowledged.
Deploying chute.</i>

1124
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,407
Whoa!

1125
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,246
McQueen!

1126
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,835
Whoa! What's this?

1127
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,420
Whoa!

1128
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,343
McQueen! McQueen!

1129
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,559
Let me through! Let me through!

1130
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,521
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

1131
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,439
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

1132
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,024
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

1133
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,736
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

1134
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,697
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

1135
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,700
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!

1136
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,869
- You are the champion!
- This way, signore.

1137
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,579
- McQueen!
- Mater?

1138
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:58,541
- McQueen.
- Give us a pose!

1139
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,043
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!

1140
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:02,711
Where you going?

1141
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,130
Stop!

1142
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,133
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...

1143
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:08,801
Mater!

1144
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,052
- Mater?
- <i>Signore?</i>

1145
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,304
McQueen! They're gonna kill you!

1146
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,597
Mater!

1147
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,516
Excuse me.

1148
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,393
No, where are you going?

1149
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,769
Scusi. Mater!

1150
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,479
- McQueen!
- Scusi.

1151
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,898
Mater! Mater!

1152
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,525
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

1153
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:28,154
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.

1154
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,822
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

1155
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:34,034
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best."

1156
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,829
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.

1157
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,373
I really thought I heard my friend.

1158
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:44,545
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

1159
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,923
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.

1160
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,091
Come-a with me, please.

1161
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,555
Let me go!

1162
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,183
You actually care about that race car.

1163
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,685
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

1164
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,944
<i>"Idiot"? Is that how you see me?</i>

1165
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,156
<i>That's how everyone sees you.
I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

1166
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,158
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

1167
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:17,036
<i>because they're too busy
laughing at the fool.</i>

1168
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,121
<i>At the fool...</i>

1169
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,248
Excuse me!

1170
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,375
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

1171
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:24,960
Yeah!

1172
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,006
You done good.
You got all the leaves.

1173
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,634
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.

1174
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,595
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1175
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,806
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

1176
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,024
Somebody get me water! Sweet relief.

1177
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,567
Mater!

1178
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,199
But I never leak oil. Never.

1179
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,743
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1180
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,496
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw ya up, did I?

1181
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,582
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talk to somebody...

1182
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,876
I don't need your help!

1183
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,586
I don't want your help.

1184
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,672
Your help...

1185
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,216
Bang the gong. Get it on!

1186
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,468
<i>Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.</i>

1187
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:18,180
This is exactly why I don't
bring you along to these things!

1188
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,360
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

1189
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,863
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

1190
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,215
This... This is all my fault.

1191
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:54,508
Don't be a fool, Mater.

1192
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:57,553
But I am, remember? You said so.

1193
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,221
When did I...

1194
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:02,975
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

1195
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,977
I'm not a spy!

1196
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,566
I've been trying to tell
you that the whole time.

1197
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,818
I really am just a tow truck.

1198
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,737
Finn, he's not joking.

1199
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:18,741
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

1200
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,745
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.

1201
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,913
This is all my fault.

1202
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,753
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.

1203
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,422
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

1204
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,674
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

1205
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:39,303
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.

1206
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:55,027
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.

1207
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,987
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

1208
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,072
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

1209
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,159
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

1210
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:04,036
You just need to focus on the race.

1211
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,331
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

1212
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:10,292
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

1213
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:14,129
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.

1214
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:18,592
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

1215
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:19,676
Listen...

1216
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,846
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

1217
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,516
You show the world that
they've been wrong about allinol.

1218
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:29,269
Mater would want you to race.

1219
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,397
All right. For Mater.

1220
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,141
Here he comes.

1221
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,412
- <i>What happened?</i>
- I don't know, Professor.

1222
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,706
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

1223
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,834
I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

1224
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,377
- You broke it!
- Quiet!

1225
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,921
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?

1226
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,049
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?

1227
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,427
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

1228
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,055
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"

1229
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,308
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

1230
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:53,103
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

1231
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:55,689
Wait, you could have!

1232
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,775
- Dad-gum lemons!
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

1233
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,445
What? You didn't think
we'd take your bullets?

1234
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,742
That's right! You got nothing!

1235
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,329
Who's the lemon now, huh?

1236
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,291
Nice try, Mater.

1237
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,295
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- <i>Request... Request... Request...</i>

1238
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,340
Mater!

1239
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,596
I got to get y'all out of there.

1240
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,182
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

1241
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,392
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

1242
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:35,103
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

1243
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,606
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?

1244
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:41,193
- We'll be okay.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.

1245
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,204
So, we'll be okay? Really?

1246
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,498
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

1247
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,043
Being killed by a clock.

1248
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,671
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come."

1249
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,048
Time? That's it!

1250
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:13,433
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.

1251
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:20,148
If I can just reverse the polarity.

1252
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,570
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

1253
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,789
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

1254
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,334
No!

1255
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,795
Drive! Burn rubber!

1256
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,429
We've got to get to the course.

1257
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,931
Calculate the fastest way to...

1258
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,559
Done.

1259
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,436
Miss Shiftwell.

1260
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,314
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.

1261
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,693
No, that's Mater's.

1262
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,611
I knew his escape was too easy.

1263
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:19,124
Come back here! Stop!

1264
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,421
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

1265
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,258
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

1266
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:30,969
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything okay?

1267
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,889
No, everything's not okay.
There's a bomb in here.

1268
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,892
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?

1269
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,852
- Mater.
- Finn! You're okay.

1270
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:43,398
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1271
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,902
<i>When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.</i>

1272
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,907
Mater! There you are!

1273
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,576
- Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.

1274
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,620
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you okay?

1275
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,372
No, I'm not okay!
Stay away from me!

1276
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,916
No, wait! Wait!

1277
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:05,462
<i>A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!</i>

1278
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:07,422
Mater, wait!

1279
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,592
Normally an emergency vehicle on the track
means there's been an accident.

1280
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:13,678
- <i>Lightning McQueen is chasing him!</i>
- Mater, wait!

1281
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:17,474
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

1282
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,102
I know I made you feel that way before,
but none of that matters!

1283
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,063
We're best friends!

1284
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,441
<i>And McQueen seems to be having</i>

1285
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,401
<i>a conversation with the tow truck.</i>

1286
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,279
<i>I don't know who that truck is, Brent,
but tell you what,</i>

1287
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,865
<i>he's got to be the world's
best backwards driver.</i>

1288
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,786
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

1289
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:41,873
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

1290
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:45,043
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

1291
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,921
- Stay away!
- No! Never!

1292
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,466
Almost there.

1293
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,595
I'm not letting you get away again!

1294
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,307
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
- <i>Request acknowledged.</i>

1295
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,559
Oh, my gosh.

1296
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,241
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

1297
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,328
<i>And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,</i>

1298
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,831
<i>hooked to the now
rocket-propelled tow truck.</i>

1299
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,138
The Professor's on the run!

1300
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:41,016
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!

1301
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,562
- Holley, I'll get Zündapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!

1302
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,775
What is happening?

1303
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,249
Hurry, Professor.

1304
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,805
You really think I'm going
to let you float away, Professor?

1305
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,210
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!

1306
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:55,131
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!

1307
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,140
Give it up, McMissile.

1308
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:24,536
- Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.

1309
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,376
Oh, no.

1310
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,149
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

1311
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,400
Bomb?

1312
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,611
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

1313
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,197
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1314
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,076
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

1315
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,202
Death ray?

1316
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,662
Turn off the bomb, Zündapp!

1317
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,665
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

1318
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,751
Everything is voice-activated these days.

1319
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,502
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1320
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,546
<i>Voice denied.</i>

1321
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:22,552
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

1322
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,387
by the one who activated it?

1323
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,765
- Say it.
- Deactivate.

1324
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:29,017
<i>Voice denied.</i>

1325
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:35,732
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

1326
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,902
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.

1327
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:42,572
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.

1328
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:46,576
I'm going out on a limb here.
These are the guys that want me dead, correct?

1329
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,786
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.

1330
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:53,833
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

1331
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:57,420
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

1332
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,297
ain't gonna make you feel better.

1333
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,134
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

1334
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,645
Pit stop.

1335
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,651
Not today, boys.

1336
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:30,328
Retreat!

1337
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,124
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

1338
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:38,169
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

1339
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:45,426
What's he saying? What's wrong?

1340
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:48,346
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

1341
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:52,016
I get it. I get it!

1342
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,435
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!

1343
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,896
What? No. I can't do it.

1344
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,023
Nobody takes me seriously.

1345
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,943
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

1346
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,695
Yes, it is.

1347
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,614
Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs.

1348
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,408
Be yourself here.

1349
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,577
And if people aren't
taking you seriously,

1350
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,371
then they need to change, not you.

1351
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,873
I know that because I was wrong before.

1352
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,918
Now, you can do this.
You're the bomb.

1353
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,044
Thanks, buddy.

1354
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,630
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

1355
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,966
Right. Hang on!

1356
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,553
Where's he going?

1357
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:31,764
- Computer!
- <i>Yes, Agent Mater?</i>

1358
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,976
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

1359
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:36,269
<i>Request acknowledged.</i>

1360
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,025
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!

1361
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,152
The second kind, not the first!

1362
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,903
<i>Deploying chute.</i>

1363
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:11,262
Who's winning the race?

1364
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:18,019
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!

1365
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,855
No, it's okay!
Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

1366
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:21,981
Okay.

1367
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,358
Somebody's been sabotaging

1368
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,943
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.

1369
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,862
Wait. Your Majesty.

1370
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,406
Bomb! It's a bomb!

1371
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,284
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!

1372
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:37,413
Get off the stage! Move it!

1373
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,375
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1374
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,711
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

1375
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,130
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

1376
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,675
Mater, just cut to the chase.

1377
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,301
Okay. It's him.

1378
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,930
What? Me?
You've got to be crazy.

1379
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:55,932
I figured it out when I realized

1380
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:59,185
y'all attached this ticking
time bomb with Whitworth bolts,

1381
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,813
the same bolts that hold together
that old British engine

1382
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,189
from the photograph.

1383
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,900
- Holley! Show that picture.
- Okay.

1384
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:08,611
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

1385
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:11,322
if there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

1386
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,157
What is he talking about?

1387
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,910
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

1388
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,620
You just blamed it on me.

1389
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,415
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1390
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:24,043
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

1391
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:27,797
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

1392
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,008
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1393
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:33,553
Stay away!

1394
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:37,515
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1395
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:41,060
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

1396
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,938
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

1397
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:47,900
Disguised voice? What are you talking about?
You're nuts, you are!

1398
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,611
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

1399
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,281
One moment,
I'd like to see where this is going.

1400
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,992
Mater, he created allinol.

1401
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:58,202
But what if he found
that huge oil field

1402
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,747
just as the world was trying
to find something else?

1403
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:04,709
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1404
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,670
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

1405
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,797
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

1406
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:13,092
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

1407
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,011
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

1408
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:18,347
- Mater!
- Someone do something!

1409
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,060
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1410
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:29,734
<i>Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.</i>

1411
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,911
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.

1412
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,205
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1413
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:46,083
It's official. You're coming
to all my races from now on.

1414
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,669
Now you're talkin'!

1415
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:58,804
Mater, let's go. You're on.

1416
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,520
Your Majesty, may I present

1417
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:09,440
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm,

1418
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:13,110
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

1419
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,613
Go get 'em, buddy.

1420
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:27,416
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

1421
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:32,380
Sir? Shoot, you can just
call me Mater, Your Majesty.

1422
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,715
I don't wanna hear none
of this "sir" business.

1423
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,634
By the way, have y'all met each other?

1424
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,553
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

1425
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,639
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile, McQueen.
Queen, McMissile.

1426
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:49,730
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

1427
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,524
McQueen hanging on for dear life

1428
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:55,653
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

1429
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,446
We was goners.

1430
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:00,741
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

1431
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:02,868
swoops in from the sky to save us!

1432
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,746
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

1433
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,915
Minny, please. Come on!

1434
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,794
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

1435
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:15,631
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

1436
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,550
Holley! What are you doin' here?

1437
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:20,553
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

1438
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:21,596
Finn!

1439
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,806
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiqué.

1440
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,683
So you got-a my email.

1441
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,685
Y'all is going to have a great time!

1442
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,939
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

1443
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,357
Don't tell nobody.

1444
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,443
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

1445
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,528
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.

1446
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,530
It's so nice to meet you all.

1447
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:41,782
Guido believe you now.

1448
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:44,493
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

1449
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,370
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in

1450
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,122
and you saved them in London?

1451
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:50,207
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!

1452
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:55,004
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

1453
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:58,382
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo.
Let me go get my tools.

1454
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,218
No. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

1455
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:06,265
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

1456
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:08,601
Those two are perfect for each other.

1457
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,978
There's one thing I still don't get.

1458
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:14,023
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

1459
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:17,818
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?

1460
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,862
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

1461
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:23,032
Our investigation proved that allinol
was actually gasoline

1462
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,619
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

1463
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:30,998
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

1464
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:38,422
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

1465
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:42,343
with my all-natural,
sustainable, organic biofuel

1466
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:47,515
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

1467
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,809
It was him!

1468
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:54,146
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

1469
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,523
Tree-hugger.

1470
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,860
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

1471
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:03,614
All spectators, clear the starting line.

1472
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:07,702
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!

1473
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:09,370
We should do this every year.

1474
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:12,581
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

1475
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,418
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

1476
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,838
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.

1477
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:22,633
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- <i>Signorina</i> Sally.

1478
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:23,843
It is official.

1479
01:35:23,926 --> 01:35:26,595
Lightning McQueen is
the luckiest car in the world.

1480
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,681
Why, thank you.

1481
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:32,017
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

1482
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:35,354
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

1483
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,982
Just something I had
made up for the occasion.

1484
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,151
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

1485
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:43,112
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.

1486
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,407
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

1487
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,325
Try it. You'll like it.

1488
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,745
So, he's not so good-looking.

1489
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:53,164
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!

1490
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,332
That's why I love you, Sally.

1491
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,335
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!

1492
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:02,089
That Francesco is fine-looking!

1493
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,591
And those open wheels.

1494
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:06,886
I'm gonna have to go get
myself some coolant.

1495
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,523
Go, Lightning!

1496
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,627
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!

1497
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,504
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!

1498
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:44,965
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen!

1499
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:47,468
Finn? Time to go.

1500
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,304
Siddeley's gassed,
geared and ready to fly.

1501
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:53,933
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.

1502
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:57,102
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

1503
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:01,315
Somethin' tells me you're not talkin'
about souvenir bumper stickers.

1504
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:03,818
Her Majesty asked
for you personally, Mater.

1505
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:07,196
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.

1506
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,991
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

1507
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:14,411
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.

1508
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,623
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...

1509
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,334
This is home.

1510
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:23,337
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

1511
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,297
You still owe me that first date.

1512
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,425
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

1513
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:31,929
Well, I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1514
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:35,099
Actually, there is one thing.

1515
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:39,770
I'll be doggone!

1516
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1517
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,447
Thanks, Mater!

1518
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,627
Impossible!

1519
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,462
Mater!

1520
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,132
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

1521
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:10,301
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

1522
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,386
Not if I see you first!

1523
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:14,471
Yippee!
