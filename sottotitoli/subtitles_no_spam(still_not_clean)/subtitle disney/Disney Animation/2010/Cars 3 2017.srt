1048

They were just trying to protect me.

1060
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:20,130
But I was the fastest kid in town

1061
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:22,507
and I was gonna prove them wrong.

1062
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:25,885
What happened?

1063
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,849
When I got to my first race,
I figured it out.

What?

1065
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:37,598
That I didn't belong.

1066

1067
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:47,441
They were bigger and stronger
and so... confident.

1068
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:54,031
And when they started their engines,
that was it...

to the training center.
