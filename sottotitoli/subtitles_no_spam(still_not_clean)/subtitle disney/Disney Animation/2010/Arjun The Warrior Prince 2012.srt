1
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,082
Yuvraj (prince)!

2
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,622
It's time for bed

3
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,419
Come on...

4
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,423
Now!

5
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,482
It's time to sleep, Yuvraj

6
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,985
Come now, shut your eyes

7
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:26,350
There

8
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,013
my eyes are shut

9
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,554
But... my ears are open

10
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:32,792
A story?

11
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,854
Aren't you a little
too old for fairy tales?

12
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,057
Yuck!

13
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,857
Tell me a story about a warrior

14
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,368
No, no...

15
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:43,768
It's late, go to sleep

16
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,828
There must be someone...

17
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:45,804
someone like me...

18
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,603
brave, heroic...

19
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,937
Well, there was someone...

20
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,678
just like you...

21
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:54,009
Who was he?

22
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,008
Arjun

23
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,377
his name was Arjun

24
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:00,819
Was he a soldier?

25
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,913
Or a warrior?

26
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,952
A warrior?

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,354
Well he thought he was one

28
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,589
What does that mean?

29
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,892
Who was he?

30
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:15,266
He was the son of Lord Indra

31
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:18,773
And he never interrupted
the telling of a story

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,398
Okay, no more questions

33
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,534
But I want the whole story

34
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:23,703
Don't leave anything out

35
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,679
The fights, the treks, the battles...

36
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,045
There was a vast kingdom
in Northern India

37
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:34,585
Hastinapur

38
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,951
Ruled by the great King Pandu

39
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,488
One day, he gave up his throne

40
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,759
to his younger brother Dhritarashtra

41
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,858
and went to the live
in the forest as a hermit

42
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,372
There he was blessed
with five children

43
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,875
and they lived happily together

44
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:56,338
But one day...

45
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,379
Pandu passed away...

46
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,904
and his family had
to return to Hastinapur...

47
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,385
Acharya Drona...

48
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:41,550
Peace be with you

49
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,754
And with you Vidur

50
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,058
Cattle herders?

51
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,296
You here to herd cattle?

52
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,526
Herd cattle?

53
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,697
More like live with the cattle!

54
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,368
Just look at size of that bull!

55
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,370
Watch what you say, moron!

56
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,770
We're not herders

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,000
we're princes!

58
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:02,333
These are your cousins, Duryodhan.

59
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,345
They're here to live with you

60
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:10,411
If 100 Kauravas weren't enough
to handle, here's five more!

61
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,917
Ashwatthama...

62
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,655
fetch bows for the new boys

63
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,460
Yudhishtir, what do you see?

64
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:35,305
I see ten mango trees, three
peepal trees and one cluster fig

65
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,781
There's a bird perched
on the third branch from the top...

66
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,976
That's enough!

67
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,648
Bheem...

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
I see only a bird...

69
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:49,789
Really?

70
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:50,790
Yes

71
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,328
...sitting there smelling fruit...

72
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,694
...while I'm dying of hunger!

73
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:57,958
Move aside...

74
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:00,365
Nakul?

75
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,629
Sahdev!

76
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:03,762
Whoever you are. What do you see?

77
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:04,668
Everything.

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,467
Me too.

79
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,768
Move aside, both of you!

80
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,710
Arjun?

81
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,745
I see an eye

82
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:12,642
and...

83
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,976
Nothing else

84
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:17,809
Don't you see what your brothers see?

85
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:21,879
The bird, trees, branches, fruit...

86
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,945
Are you blind boy?

87
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:26,790
All I see is an eye

88
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,664
Well then...

89
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,257
shoot!

90
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,685
Years passed
and the Kauravas and Pandavas grew up

91
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,990
As did their differences

92
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,698
The Kuru dynasty was splitting in two

93
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,893
at stake was the throne of Hastinapur

94
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,862
Hey, where did you get your donkey?

95
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,424
You're not ready
to play with the big boys, kid!

96
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:26,790
As ready as you are big guy!

97
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:02,493
What's this? A bull riding a horse?

98
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,438
This bull's going
to gore you Duryodhan!

99
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,346
Hey Bheem, see you later!

100
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,650
I told you I'd win!

101
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,830
You call this winning brother
Yudhishtir? I slowed down...

102
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,561
Oh come on!

103
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,364
Guruji, what do you have to say?

104
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,029
Oh let it go... hey!

105
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:12,930
Bheem's horses?

106
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,867
Duryodhan, where's Bheem?

107
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,276
How... how would I know?
I was ahead of him

108
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,041
What?

109
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,440
Go, look for him

110
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,355
Bheem, what happened?

111
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,872
I have no idea...

112
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:32,410
All rise for King Dhritharashtra

113
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,956
Long live King Dhritharashtra!

114
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,185
Long live the King!!

115
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,675
So many hurdles on
the way to the throne...

116
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:01,073
Uncle Shakuni!

117
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,977
Tell me something nephew...

118
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:12,489
Was Bheem plain lucky
or did you not try hard enough?

119
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,722
You dare doubt me?

120
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:18,788
Drona is the one with the doubts

121
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,665
I'm convinced.

122
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,500
Tell me something...

123
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,867
do you think my father
will make me king?

124
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:32,037
Of course!

125
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:36,842
But if the council
nominates Yudhishtir...

126
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:42,914
he won't be able to stand up to them.

127
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,685
I understand...

128
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:51,891
...come with me.

129
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,752
Where are we going?

130
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:22,523
We haven't brought
any food or drink...

131
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:27,530
We haven't crossed the border yet...

132
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:31,402
It's almost sundown, let's head back

133
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,635
Relax uncle,
meet some friends of mine...

134
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,576
Susharman! Susharman!

135
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:46,852
Hey look, what a plump catch!

136
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,949
Get him!

137
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,494
Nephew!

138
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:04,770
Susharman, this is Shakuni, my uncle.

139
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,937
Great! We'll rob your uncle!

140
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,709
All of Hastinapur dances to his tune.

141
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,810
There are no kings here uncle...

142
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:26,623
...only us, the Trigarthas

143
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:33,265
...and we bow to no one!

144
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,928
And you never will, Susharman

145
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:40,872
If you feed my uncle
a meal under the stars

146
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:50,906
Uncle, how would you like your meat?

147
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,418
Rare?

148
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:54,882
Well done?

149
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:59,483
Or on the hoof?

150
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,822
Well done.

151
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,439
You have strange friends nephew.

152
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:17,501
They won't bow to me but...

153
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,309
they'll behead anyone I ask them to.

154
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:22,940
Careful...

155
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:27,954
they might turn into more
than you can handle...

156
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:31,788
don't let them become
a reason to worry.

157
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,419
If you want to break the Pandavas...

158
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:38,364
...get rid of Arjun first

159
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,023
Arjun?

160
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,702
The wisdom of Yudhishtir,
the strength of Bheem...

161
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,568
...he has both...

162
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:50,603
He will be the greatest of them all.

163
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:59,376
Duryodhan was looking
for an opportunity to strike again...

164
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:06,258
He found it at a tournament
Drona had organised for his students.

165
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:41,553
Arjun!

166
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,804
Who are you?

167
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,499
Why are you here?

168
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:57,670
They call me Karna

169
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,313
I am an archer

170
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,750
This is a tournament
for Dronacharya's students

171
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,645
Did he not teach you that...

172
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,746
...weapons were for warfare...

173
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,349
...not for fun and games

174
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:13,620
Come...

175
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,893
Fight me

176
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,295
...and show everyone...

177
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,927
what you've learned.

178
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,598
Hey!

179
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,303
Who are you?

180
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,840
And why are you
frightening my brother?

181
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,842
He's just a little boy...

182
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,434
...aren't you Arjun?

183
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,845
You're not ready for all of this...

184
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,283
Watch your mouth!

185
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,352
...and pick on
someone your own size!

186
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,913
Hold it, Bheem...

187
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,390
Karna...

188
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,327
step forward

189
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,790
Drop your weapon Arjun!

190
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:58,533
Arjun, I order you
to lower your weapon!

191
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,542
Karna don't you know that...

192
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:08,709
...true battles are fought between
equals, you're picking on a child!

193
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:10,272
I'm not a child!

194
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,649
I'm a trained warrior!

195
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,450
I can take care of myself!

196
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,452
There's a difference between training
and being able to fight!

197
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:21,927
You have a lot to learn.

198
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:24,988
I won't allow this nonsense
to continue...

199
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,997
...please call the tournament off,
your Highness!

200
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,979
Dhritarashtra realised that
the enmity between the brothers...

201
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:52,423
...was out in the open

202
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,521
Dronacharya had averted
bloodshed this time...

203
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:01,894
but...

204
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:37,065
My weapons and I are restless...

205
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,898
...haven't seen a battlefield in ages

206
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,503
It's better that way...

207
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,809
I fear war

208
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:52,747
Fear? When you're so close to it?

209
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,720
What are you trying to tell me?

210
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:58,952
The Kauravs and Pandavas
are headed for war...

211
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,755
Don't say that Pitama...

212
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:06,425
Your Highness,
both Yudhishtir and Duryodhan...

213
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,459
have equal right to the throne

214
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:15,967
and there's only one throne...

215
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,409
What alternative is there but war?

216
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,743
I won't let that happen...

217
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,375
I will the send the Pandavas away...

218
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,546
Where to, Dhritarashtra?

219
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:32,756
There's no place far enough
from the flames of jealousy

220
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:33,884
There is...

221
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,325
The palace of Varnavat.

222
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,967
That's nice of you Bheem...

223
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:54,344
taking food along for the family

224
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,575
Family?

225
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,550
You'd better not eye my food...

226
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,849
...I'll protect it no matter what!

227
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:06,315
Mother!

228
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:10,897
It so nice
we'll be living together...

229
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,330
Where's Arjun?

230
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,032
I'm leaving, Guruji,
please give me your blessings

231
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,398
Arjun...

232
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:23,640
what I did the other day...

233
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,703
was for you and your safety

234
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:31,941
Consider it a teacher's love
for his student and forgive me...

235
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,953
Who am I to forgive you?

236
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,452
Just give me your blessings

237
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:39,458
My blessings will
always be with you...

238
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:41,960
...but how about
my gurudakshina (fee)?

239
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,895
Fight!

240
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,930
How can I fight you?

241
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:58,304
Get up, fight!

242
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:03,477
Attack!

243
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:07,782
Look at you...

244
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:12,451
You hold a weapon but can't use it

245
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,556
You're trained in warfare...

246
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:18,496
but you're terrified

247
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:21,659
You call yourself a warrior?

248
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:28,603
Arjun, you may not understand this

249
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,940
but a day will come...

250
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:36,745
when we will fight each other

251
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,051
Just promise me, that on that day...

252
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,721
you will fight me like a true warrior

253
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:48,328
That will be my gurudakshina.

254
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,397
Promise me this, Arjun

255
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,367
Go now...

256
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,640
...my blessings are with you.

257
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,827
The Pandavas were
sent to Varnavat...

258
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:32,996
Dronacharya's words
continued to haunt Arjun

259
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:40,038
But the brothers were glad...

260
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:44,842
...to be away from
the Kauravas' politics.

261
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,991
It's so beautiful here

262
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:33,298
Arjun! Catch!

263
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,562
Arjun, here...

264
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,901
throw it to me!

265
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:46,012
Give it to me...

266
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:38,488
Run!

267
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,397
Arjun!

268
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:43,593
Arjun...

269
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,896
Follow me...

270
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:07,452
Come on! Arjun!

271
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:08,860
Arjun!

272
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:09,896
Arjun!

273
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:43,561
We're lucky I found this passage
or we'd all be dead

274
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:49,966
Go on ahead, Arjun...

275
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:58,703
Duryodhan is behind all this...

276
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,748
...I should break his head in two!

277
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:05,273
And here you are,
with your head hanging low

278
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,650
Very impressive, Prince Yudhishtir!

279
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:08,654
Bheem!

280
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:09,950
Let me say it mother...

281
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,889
...because you cannot
stand up for what's yours...

282
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,522
...we're scurrying about like rats!

283
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:20,463
What should we do then?

284
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,895
We have no men, no weapons...

285
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,766
How do you propose we fight?

286
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:37,672
Shhhh

287
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,535
The jackals will feast tonight...

288
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,902
...dinner is served!

289
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,042
Arjun had never seen
bloodshed like this before...

290
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:16,283
...he realised now...

291
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:23,860
...that all the training,
all the weapons...

292
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:30,635
...meant nothing at all

293
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,849
Mother...

294
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:58,624
I thought I was brave...

295
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,560
...but what Bheem did today...

296
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,364
I could never do...

297
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:05,395
...I was scared.

298
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,933
Scared? Of what?

299
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,908
Dronacharya was right...

300
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,638
I don't have what
it takes to be a warrior

301
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,775
I have a lot to learn

302
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:20,620
Time is the greatest teacher,
Arjun...

303
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:25,424
...and a time will come
when your bravery...

304
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,460
...will be displayed
for the world to see...

305
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:29,051
I believe in you.

306
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:39,627
Ridiculous!

307
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,473
This brahmin outfit is ridiculous!

308
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:45,033
At least Duryodhan
won't recognise you

309
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:46,940
And why is that?

310
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,378
Because of this!

311
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,916
Friends, where are you headed?

312
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:56,447
Friend...

313
00:31:56,823 --> 00:32:01,624
Our lives are about
prayer and food...

314
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:06,025
...we're praying now,
and headed towards food!

315
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,029
Food? Where?

316
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,526
Kampilya

317
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:15,706
There's a huge archery
competition there...

318
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:18,939
...by which the Princess of Panchal
will choose a husband

319
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:22,674
Don't tempt me anymore, sir,
Let's go!

320
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:23,977
Certainly!

321
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:28,477
You look like you truly enjoy food!

322
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,017
Come along then!

323
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:34,919
No!

324
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,519
Sir...

325
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,325
...please be on your way...

326
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,832
...and you, this way!

327
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,497
I could almost taste the food...

328
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,438
...and you led me away!

329
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,702
Let's go to Kampilya...

330
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:50,572
To eat?

331
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:51,668
Why not?

332
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:53,770
Aren't you hungry?

333
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,781
Actually,
we should go to Kampilya...

334
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,407
What do you mean?

335
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,816
If we win the princess' hand...

336
00:32:59,886 --> 00:33:02,878
the King of Panchal...

337
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:05,550
...his kingdom and his army...

338
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,525
...will be with us

339
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:11,487
and then we can challenge Duryodhan!

340
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:17,025
...but who'll win
the archery contest?

341
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:17,895
I will

342
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:18,869
Arjun!

343
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,874
Yes brother,
I will win the Swayamvar!

344
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:39,014
The bravest warriors...

345
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:50,702
...the greatest marksmen...

346
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:53,568
...the biggest wrestlers...

347
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:56,567
and the strongest kings...

348
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:16,758
Raise your weapons
and rattle your jewellery...

349
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:25,568
for the mighty prince Meghasandhi!

350
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,968
You know the rules

351
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:32,443
Use your arrow to shoot the goldfish

352
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:36,915
succeed and you win
the maiden's hand

353
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:48,520
Apologies!

354
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:51,856
Shame! Shame!

355
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,932
Is there no one brave enough?

356
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:04,500
Will the goldfish live on?

357
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:09,844
Will the beautiful
Draupadi's garland...

358
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,580
...dry and wither away?

359
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,644
Is there no archer
in this august assembly...

360
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,656
who can accept this challenge?

361
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,351
Anyone out there?

362
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,927
Any archer?

363
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:24,026
Anyone at all?

364
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:30,689
Will you just stand there
staring into each other's eyes?

365
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:49,925
Duryodhan!

366
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,335
The Pandavas are alive!

367
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:54,273
What?

368
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,812
The Pandava family
has entered the royal court

369
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,384
Greetings, Your Highness!

370
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:08,545
Welcome!

371
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:15,656
I'm overjoyed to learn
that you are alive and well.

372
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:19,524
Come closer

373
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:24,299
Kunti, who is that with you?

374
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,270
My daughter in law, your highness

375
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:26,998
Daughter in law?

376
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,639
Come closer, my dear.

377
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:36,244
She is very beautiful, Kunti.

378
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:39,647
What is your name?

379
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,711
Krishna Draupadi,
daughter of the King of Panchal.

380
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:44,354
A princess?

381
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,392
The daughter of King Drupada...

382
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:50,759
Brave warrior,
general of a great army.

383
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:58,595
Draupadi...

384
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:02,706
You've been a Princess thus far...

385
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:06,573
...but you will soon be
called Queen!

386
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,514
Council...

387
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:12,517
...it is time for
the sons of Pandu...

388
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,018
...to be given their birthright!

389
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,311
Father!

390
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:18,516
If anyone has a right
to the kingdom...

391
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:20,320
It is I, your son!

392
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:23,294
You are the King of Hastinapur,
and I am your son...

393
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:25,296
This is the truth,
and that is the law!

394
00:40:25,364 --> 00:40:28,424
Duryodhan!
The rules also state that...

395
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,969
...no one is allowed
to interrupt the King!

396
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:35,334
From now on the Throne
of Hastinapur...

397
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:39,042
...belongs to Prince Duryodhan,
and...

398
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:44,011
Prince Yudhishtir will be...

399
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:48,577
the King of Khandavprastha!

400
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:57,553
May peace prevail
between both kingdoms!

401
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,827
Long live, Prince Duryodhan!

402
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,301
Long live, Prince Yudhishtir!

403
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:09,739
Long live, Prince Duryodhan!

404
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,436
I don't want charity!

405
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,672
This kingdom is mine!

406
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:16,544
And no part of it,
no matter how small...

407
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,345
belongs to those Pandavas!

408
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:21,978
The King's orders must be followed

409
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:23,749
I won't have it!

410
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:28,851
I won't give them an inch!

411
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,946
This is what they give us,
this swamp?!

412
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:23,709
Arjun, how are we going to live here?

413
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,550
Hey, don't go criticising
the kingdom of King Yudhishtir!

414
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,547
Look how peacefully
it's citizens are living!

415
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:36,925
Snakes, scorpions,
crocodiles... owls!

416
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:43,026
If they're happy we can be too,
isn't that so King Yudhishtir?

417
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:51,642
Your Highness!

418
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:56,512
The frogs want an audience with you!

419
00:42:56,582 --> 00:42:57,708
That's enough, Bheem!

420
00:42:58,718 --> 00:43:00,845
Who is it?

421
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:03,547
Show yourself!

422
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:14,560
Come out! Don't be afraid!

423
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:17,425
We are your Kings!

424
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,584
Pardon us, your Highness...

425
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:41,855
How were we to know...
this place is crawling with bandits

426
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:43,657
We thought it was them.

427
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:46,562
Is there no one here
for your protection?

428
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,829
No your highness,
no soldiers, no army, no one!

429
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:52,632
We'll take care of it now...

430
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:53,933
There's word out...

431
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,668
...that bandits
may attack tonight...

432
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,677
...be careful, Your Highness.

433
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,507
It's sundown your Highness...

434
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:06,710
...probably the cows coming home!

435
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:09,880
Those aren't cows, it's a horse...

436
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:10,888
Hold on...

437
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,989
...I know him

438
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,727
Yes Arjun, we have met before.

439
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:18,855
I am Krishna Vasudev

440
00:44:24,737 --> 00:44:28,332
Duryodhan is behind all this...

441
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:29,396
him and his father!

442
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:31,375
We must take revenge!

443
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,605
Why settle for such
a small goal Bheem?

444
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,374
That's a small goal?

445
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:37,814
Birds and animals
fight for survival...

446
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,852
...but greatness lies
in the greater good.

447
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,387
What do you mean?

448
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:44,719
Hastinapur is headed for ruin...

449
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,382
...it's not just the king...

450
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:49,053
...the whole kingdom
is obsessed with greed.

451
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:51,960
And the problem doesn't
end with Hastinapur...

452
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,329
...it's the entire country.

453
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,733
Crime, terrorism, wars,
have taken over...

454
00:44:57,803 --> 00:45:00,397
...and the innocent are suffering.

455
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:04,302
That is what you
have to deal with...

456
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,405
...you have to instill peace
across the land.

457
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:10,312
You are right.

458
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,517
We are with you.

459
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,246
Good! Great!

460
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:17,884
We have to save our necks
before we can save the world!

461
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,720
We're surrounded by bandits!

462
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:20,986
Bheem!

463
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,956
Tell us, how will we win this battle?

464
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,330
With courage, with belief...
with determination!

465
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,235
Here...

466
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:11,835
Here?

467
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:13,936
But we're not safe here.

468
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,748
What if someone attacks?

469
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,647
That's what I want.

470
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:19,809
What?

471
00:46:20,886 --> 00:46:22,717
I don't understand.

472
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,016
What are you doing?

473
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,380
Waiting.

474
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:33,260
Aren't you scared?

475
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,424
Arjun...

476
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:40,431
We know nothing of the future...

477
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,468
...so why be concerned
with what hasn't happened?

478
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:49,973
So much self confidence?

479
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:54,508
Just do what you have to Arjun,
forget the consequences.

480
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:59,688
Focus on your task,
and the fear will take care of itself.

481
00:47:03,262 --> 00:47:04,490
Listen

482
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:45,664
The emblem of Hastinapur?

483
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:56,500
Who are you?

484
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:59,934
I'm the Trigartha King.

485
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,711
Let him live

486
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:08,952
He'll be more useful to us
than he was to Duryodhan.

487
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,829
You were right...

488
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:23,300
...it's not just a city...

489
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:26,429
...but a great Kingdom
that we need to build...

490
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,474
we will built it over these ashes...

491
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:32,874
Lord Indra's home on Earth.

492
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:29,695
Who are you fighting son?

493
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:30,632
Duryodhan!

494
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:31,601
Duryodhan?

495
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,500
Yes, father.

496
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,869
Look at his moustache!

497
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,306
Of course... let's go...

498
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:39,367
...there's a war about to break out!

499
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,643
Wait... wait!

500
00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:49,944
I know...

501
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,557
the story isn't over yet.

502
00:50:55,461 --> 00:51:00,091
The Pandavas built a kingdom
just like they said...

503
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:02,960
Indraprastha, the city of gold.

504
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:06,630
It was time for
Yudhishtir's coronation...

505
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:09,503
...and Kings from all
over the land attended...

506
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,903
...including all the Kauravas.

507
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:27,824
So this is Indraprastha.

508
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,567
Long live King Yudhishtir!

509
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,545
May his reign be forever!

510
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:52,311
May his reign be prosperous!

511
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:55,579
According to tradition...

512
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,818
...all subjects
of the King will now...

513
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:02,691
...offer their respect.

514
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:12,329
Every member of the Kuru clan
is present here today...

515
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:15,363
...I confer the honour
of receiving salutations...

516
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:21,744
...to the greatest of them all...
King Duryodhan!

517
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:27,715
He will accept the offerings
on my behalf

518
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:44,764
I promise to serve and...

519
00:52:44,837 --> 00:52:49,797
...protect King Yudhishtir.

520
00:52:56,682 --> 00:52:57,740
An insult...

521
00:52:58,317 --> 00:52:59,375
A grave insult!

522
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,410
I promised Susharman...

523
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:06,681
...that he would bow to no King...

524
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:09,689
...and today he bowed.

525
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:13,924
Yudhishtir has insulted me.

526
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:15,694
Humiliated me!

527
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,600
Allow me to command your army and...

528
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,867
...watch how I lay
the Pandavas heads...

529
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,635
at your feet.

530
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:25,370
No, Karna

531
00:53:25,644 --> 00:53:27,475
The time for war is over...

532
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,847
The Pandavas are too powerful

533
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:33,312
We don't stand a chance.

534
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:35,819
Actually, you do, nephew!

535
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:37,583
What if I told you...

536
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:41,888
...that Yudhishtir would
hand his kingdom over...

537
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:45,019
with his own hands...

538
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:46,423
wouldn't that be nice?

539
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:47,590
Uncle!

540
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,401
Here I am burning from the insult...

541
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,028
...and you're adding
fuel to the fire!

542
00:53:53,305 --> 00:53:55,296
Not fuel my dear nephew...

543
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:59,538
...this is what I'm adding!

544
00:53:59,578 --> 00:54:03,844
Shakuni had found a way
to destroy the Pandavas...

545
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:07,314
He knew that on Coronation Day...

546
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:10,719
...no King could refuse a challenge.

547
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,686
So on Shakuni's advice...

548
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,991
Duryodhan challenged
Yudhishtir to a game of dice.

549
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:19,823
I'll play...

550
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,927
but I shall choose the dice.

551
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,764
Of course!

552
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:35,036
Uncle Shakuni will play on my behalf

553
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,838
I hope you don't mind?

554
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:39,281
After all, we're all family here!

555
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:42,752
Should I explain the
rules of the game, son?

556
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,288
I know them well...

557
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,490
You can withdraw from
the game only after 20 moves.

558
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,788
Let us begin.

559
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:52,295
This is my wager.

560
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,525
Are you serious?

561
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:02,773
I bet all my jewellery!

562
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:08,609
We win!

563
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:14,647
I bet all the gold in the treasury.

564
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,846
Me too.

565
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:18,754
We win!

566
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,985
My horse carriages. - Me too!

567
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,696
My elephants... My horses.

568
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:29,256
We win!

569
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:31,669
My Soldiers! My army!

570
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,466
We win!

571
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,301
Servants... Maids...

572
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:41,310
All my wealth and property. - Me too!

573
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:47,941
I...

574
00:55:48,587 --> 00:55:51,988
...bet my Kingdom.

575
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,590
Think carefully...

576
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:01,899
...your Highness...

577
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,996
...you are doing this
of your own free will.

578
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:14,374
If you wish, we can let
you retire from the game...

579
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:15,805
Isn't that so, Uncle?

580
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:17,610
Absolutely, nephew...

581
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,811
Today is his first day as King...

582
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:25,821
...it's the least we can do!

583
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:34,659
I bet my entire Kingdom!

584
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:36,633
Whatever you say!

585
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,337
Uncle, roll the dice!

586
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,769
We win!

587
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,781
Quiet!

588
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:08,790
No one questions
the rules of the game!

589
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:12,395
And the game isn't over yet!

590
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:16,765
Tell me, Your Highness...

591
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:19,808
...you have no kingdom, no land...

592
00:57:20,612 --> 00:57:23,638
...no wealth and no belongings...

593
00:57:24,716 --> 00:57:26,775
...what will you wager now?

594
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,721
I... bet my brother...

595
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:39,487
Arjun

596
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,737
Arjun was silent

597
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:52,842
As one after another...

598
00:57:54,946 --> 00:57:56,038
Bheem...

599
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,681
Nakul, Sahdev...

600
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:03,248
and finally...

601
00:58:03,455 --> 00:58:05,320
Yudhishtir himself...

602
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,282
...were lost to Shakuni's plan.

603
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:10,421
Arjun was silent.

604
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:14,561
And he stayed silent...

605
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:19,468
...at the last throw of the dice...

606
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,571
We win!

607
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:28,877
Move it!

608
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:30,005
Help!

609
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,974
Arjun, save me!

610
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:33,406
Arjun!

611
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,879
Arjun, save me!

612
00:58:35,954 --> 00:58:37,546
Save me!

613
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:38,749
Arjun!

614
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:39,984
Save me!

615
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:59,402
Draupadi was dragged out
in front of the court.

616
00:59:02,314 --> 00:59:05,306
Humiliated in public.

617
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,318
And Arjun...

618
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:14,553
stayed silent.

619
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:16,594
He stayed silent?!

620
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:18,288
He did nothing at all?

621
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:19,591
Coward.

622
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:23,994
I would have cut off
Duryodhan's head.

623
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:26,603
It wasn't that simple

624
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:28,832
Yudhishtir was his King

625
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,375
How could he act against his command?

626
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,809
Was the command more important
than Draupadi's honour?!

627
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:36,245
That's what he couldn't understand.

628
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:39,442
Why don't you say
he wasn't really a warrior...

629
00:59:39,517 --> 00:59:41,781
...like he thought he was?

630
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:43,514
Go now...

631
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:45,647
...your father must be
looking for you.

632
00:59:49,027 --> 00:59:50,688
Tell me one thing...

633
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,831
...who told you this story?

634
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,028
No one.

635
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:28,593
Come on Yuvraj...

636
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,601
...it's time to finish the story.

637
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,062
I don't want to listen anymore...

638
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,469
...so much sorrow...

639
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,442
What did Arjun have left?

640
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,842
Nothing at all.

641
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:43,807
Why tell me such a story?

642
01:00:43,882 --> 01:00:48,410
So you know what it really takes...

643
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,754
...to be a warrior.

644
01:00:53,591 --> 01:00:57,027
When Draupadi was dragged
in front of the court...

645
01:00:58,396 --> 01:01:01,923
Dhritarashtra realised the situation
had gone out of hand...

646
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,903
He commanded the last
move be played again...

647
01:01:06,972 --> 01:01:11,466
with banishment from
the Kingdom being the wager

648
01:01:11,843 --> 01:01:14,573
Banishment for twelve years...

649
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:17,513
And one year in total exile.

650
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:21,518
If in the 13th year,
the Pandavas were seen anywhere...

651
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:25,352
the banishment would
continue for another 12 years.

652
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:27,356
We win!

653
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:34,362
The result was the same

654
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,458
Tell me something Nephew...

655
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,731
This land...

656
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,963
...this kingdom,
is now all yours...

657
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:15,300
What will you do with it?

658
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,004
Burn it to the ground

659
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:23,404
All of it.

660
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,432
Arjun...

661
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:52,970
You too?

662
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,413
Is this my fate?

663
01:02:57,048 --> 01:02:58,777
First the Kauravas...

664
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,010
and now you?

665
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,686
Speak to me Arjun!

666
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,386
What can I say?

667
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:09,360
I'm ashamed.

668
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:10,621
Your shame won't wipe out...

669
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:12,322
...my humiliation.

670
01:03:12,797 --> 01:03:16,597
I'm more guilty in
this than Dushashan...

671
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:19,427
I did not protect you.

672
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,699
Don't say that, Arjun

673
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:24,904
I know what you're going through...

674
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:29,408
But we can't live 13 years
in silence...

675
01:03:31,049 --> 01:03:33,882
How long will we
suffer our humiliation?

676
01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:35,442
What can we do?

677
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:40,353
Promise me something

678
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:43,883
I have nothing left but my word...

679
01:03:46,965 --> 01:03:48,489
Promise me...

680
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:54,669
...that you will
avenge my humiliation...

681
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,932
You will have one purpose...

682
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:02,711
...the annihilation of the Kauravas.

683
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:08,415
You will have one goal...

684
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,311
To completely destroy Duryodhan.

685
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:21,387
And you will live 13 years
waiting for that day.

686
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:24,491
Promise me this.

687
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:03,903
Arjun, let's go!

688
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:06,603
We have to leave now!

689
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,441
I'm not coming with you.

690
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,480
Why not?

691
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:11,777
I'm heading to the
Northern Mountains.

692
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:13,339
To Uttarkuru.

693
01:05:13,418 --> 01:05:14,715
Uttarkuru...

694
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:17,411
the home of the Gods?

695
01:05:17,488 --> 01:05:18,648
Yes, brother...

696
01:05:18,723 --> 01:05:20,623
...give me your blessings.

697
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,023
Go, Arjun...

698
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:24,893
...may you find what you seek.

699
01:05:27,932 --> 01:05:30,833
Arjun travelled
to the land of the gods...

700
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:33,496
...to prepare for war.

701
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:45,426
What have you done?

702
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:55,873
My boar! You killed my boar...

703
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:02,612
You killed my boar!

704
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,813
Forgive me...

705
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,314
I thought it was attacking me

706
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,818
And what if it did?

707
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:14,988
You would have lost your life,
that's all!

708
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:22,601
Who are you?

709
01:08:22,673 --> 01:08:24,504
I am Arjun, son of Kunti

710
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:26,543
I'm here on a penance

711
01:08:30,581 --> 01:08:35,018
A penance?! With a bow and arrow?!

712
01:08:35,253 --> 01:08:36,413
Liar!

713
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,614
You're going to regret this!

714
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,816
I won't spare you!

715
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:43,717
Drop your weapons!

716
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:45,888
Drop them now!

717
01:08:47,298 --> 01:08:48,322
Impossible!

718
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,957
Who are you?

719
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,730
Don't you recognise me?

720
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:00,840
Who was this hunter?

721
01:09:01,712 --> 01:09:03,373
A guardian of heaven?

722
01:09:04,248 --> 01:09:05,806
Or a God himself...

723
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:10,912
...who was testing Arjun's will?

724
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,398
What was it?

725
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:11,793
Arjun's reward for his penance

726
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:16,432
The bow of the Gods

727
01:12:16,507 --> 01:12:21,706
Lord Shiva came disguised
as a hunter to test Arjun

728
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:25,977
he told Arjun to believe in himself,
in the truth

729
01:12:26,517 --> 01:12:28,508
When Arjun understood this...

730
01:12:28,586 --> 01:12:32,283
the Gods were pleased
and they blessed him

731
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:36,353
So did Arjun return
and kill Duryodhan?

732
01:12:36,427 --> 01:12:38,725
No. Don't you remember...

733
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,957
...after the 12 years
of banishment...

734
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:45,067
...they had to live
in exile for one year?

735
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:45,961
Of course!

736
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:48,665
So where did they go for their exile?

737
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:53,000
No one knows where they are.

738
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,738
What do you mean?

739
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,013
Are they are still in hiding?

740
01:12:58,649 --> 01:12:59,673
Must be...

741
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:00,982
I wouldn't know.

742
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:03,282
I know where they are!

743
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:04,252
What?!

744
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:05,811
At the bottom of the ocean...

745
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,619
...in the belly of a whale!

746
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:08,625
What whale?

747
01:13:08,693 --> 01:13:09,717
A huge one!

748
01:13:09,794 --> 01:13:11,762
When their exile is through...

749
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:14,559
they'll tear open it's stomach
and leap out!

750
01:13:14,632 --> 01:13:18,295
Don't worry your little head
with such lofty matters!

751
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,929
It'll burst!

752
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:22,597
Now go to sleep...

753
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:25,641
...we'll finish the story tomorrow.

754
01:13:58,576 --> 01:13:59,508
Who is it?

755
01:13:59,677 --> 01:14:00,541
Arjun?

756
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,904
It's me... Bheem!

757
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,576
How many times have I told you
not to use my name?!

758
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:09,680
What should I call you then?

759
01:14:10,287 --> 01:14:11,515
Brihannala?

760
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:13,322
Or Sister?

761
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:15,989
You should've been a clown,
not a cook, Ballav!

762
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,249
Let's go!

763
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:26,959
Kanka...

764
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:29,000
Tantipala...

765
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,700
Granthik...

766
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,773
I'm so pleased to meet you!

767
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:37,342
Brihannala, what's with him?

768
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,415
He used my name again

769
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:43,283
Ballav, how many times
must we remind you...

770
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:44,749
There's just one day to go...

771
01:14:44,822 --> 01:14:47,052
tomorrow we can be ourselves again!

772
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,555
One silly mistake will have us
banished for another 12 years!

773
01:14:51,629 --> 01:14:52,789
I get it, calm down

774
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:54,925
I'll be careful

775
01:14:54,999 --> 01:14:56,523
Anyone hungry?

776
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:06,573
With food like this
I'd happily live 100 years in exile!

777
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,575
I heard something...

778
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:32,893
Krishna?

779
01:15:36,373 --> 01:15:37,670
What brings you here?

780
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,436
I'm here to warn you

781
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,035
As the end of your exile draws closer

782
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:43,844
Duryodhan is getting more anxious...

783
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,348
and he's getting closer to you

784
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,816
How does he know where we are?

785
01:15:47,952 --> 01:15:51,649
He has spies everywhere
looking for you

786
01:15:51,722 --> 01:15:53,553
You must be very careful

787
01:15:53,624 --> 01:15:54,989
So he was a spy?

788
01:15:55,059 --> 01:15:56,356
He was...

789
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,987
...and there could be many more

790
01:16:08,873 --> 01:16:09,931
What?

791
01:16:11,575 --> 01:16:13,440
Krishna?

792
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:15,603
He killed my companion

793
01:16:17,848 --> 01:16:20,442
So that's where they're hiding!

794
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:21,779
Prepare the army!

795
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,776
We attack tonight!

796
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:25,845
As you command!

797
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:17,640
We've been attacked!

798
01:17:21,612 --> 01:17:24,775
Kanka, what's happening?

799
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:26,375
It's the Trigarthas...

800
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,584
...stealing our cattle!

801
01:17:28,652 --> 01:17:31,314
Uttar, go inside! Now!

802
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:34,356
Everybody head North!

803
01:17:35,426 --> 01:17:36,552
Move!

804
01:17:38,662 --> 01:17:44,601
After days of stirring food a chance
to use my weapons!

805
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,435
The Trigarthas have done
exactly as commanded!

806
01:17:54,511 --> 01:17:57,708
The Virat army is headed north

807
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:02,343
So there's no one
to protect the city...

808
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:04,987
We'll attack from the west

809
01:18:05,255 --> 01:18:08,816
Come sundown and Virat
will be in our hands...

810
01:18:09,827 --> 01:18:15,595
...and the Pandavas... at our feet!

811
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:19,864
What do you think?
They'll sit there waiting?

812
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:24,704
They'll defend Virat first,
then bother about their exile

813
01:18:24,975 --> 01:18:27,375
It won't be easy to defeat them

814
01:18:27,444 --> 01:18:30,311
We don't need to defeat them!

815
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:32,606
All we have to do is find them!

816
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,317
The rules of the game
will take care of the rest!

817
01:18:36,353 --> 01:18:40,414
The rules were unfair...

818
01:18:40,858 --> 01:18:43,258
...and this war is unjust.

819
01:18:43,327 --> 01:18:45,591
Do you think it would be fair...

820
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:50,361
...if I replaced you
as General right now?!

821
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,733
Towards Virat!

822
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,668
Sound the alarm!

823
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:04,896
The Kuru army is attacking
from the west!

824
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:14,045
How many men are still in the palace?

825
01:20:14,318 --> 01:20:16,752
Three, Your Highness.

826
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:21,714
So there's no option
but to close the gates...

827
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:23,589
...and wait for the end.

828
01:20:24,795 --> 01:20:27,958
Take those men
and guard the entrance!

829
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,365
Your Highness...

830
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:36,668
...I'm the youngest of the three!

831
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,740
I'll protect you!

832
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,550
I will guard the western entrance.

833
01:20:55,526 --> 01:20:57,357
An unusual calm

834
01:21:00,964 --> 01:21:03,797
An omen of a great war

835
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:06,893
The peace before the coming of death

836
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,699
Enough!!

837
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,670
Leave if you fear death!

838
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:13,505
Go sing hymns!

839
01:21:14,511 --> 01:21:16,536
I will fight on my own

840
01:21:16,613 --> 01:21:18,581
No matter who comes
through that door!

841
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,731
Great war!

842
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,699
Death!

843
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:48,668
Those two? A child...

844
01:21:49,513 --> 01:21:50,878
...and...

845
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:53,943
a... lady?!

846
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,719
Such a massive army!

847
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,817
Of course it's massive,
it's from Hastinapur!

848
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,928
Turn back...

849
01:22:08,999 --> 01:22:10,398
Yuvraj?

850
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,493
I... I... don't want to fight.

851
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,333
How can I fight them on my own?

852
01:22:15,405 --> 01:22:17,032
You are not alone, Yuvraj

853
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,638
I'm here with you.

854
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:20,734
Then we'll die together!

855
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,041
Do what you have to Yuvraj...

856
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,442
...forget the consequences

857
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:30,043
Focus on your task,
and the fear will take care of itself.

858
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,618
That's what Krishna said to Arjun!

859
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:33,917
I'm not Arjun!

860
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,323
You are no less than Arjun.

861
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,055
That was just a story, Brihannala!

862
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,523
I'm not Arjun,
I'm the Prince of Virat...

863
01:22:40,597 --> 01:22:43,498
...and I order you to turn back!

864
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:44,659
Now!

865
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:47,963
Well...

866
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,405
...that's the end of the war...

867
01:22:55,646 --> 01:22:57,841
...we scared the child away!

868
01:22:58,448 --> 01:22:59,710
Where are you taking me?

869
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,781
Take me to the palace!

870
01:23:06,923 --> 01:23:08,788
Where have you brought me?

871
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:11,657
Climb that tree!

872
01:23:11,728 --> 01:23:12,558
Why?

873
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:14,256
Don't waste time, climb!

874
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:33,443
These weapons?

875
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,650
How did you know they were here?

876
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,919
Who... are you?

877
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:57,969
Arjun!

878
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:02,437
Form the Chakravyuh!

879
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,715
Duryodhan, you will stay
in the middle of the Chakravyuh

880
01:24:05,782 --> 01:24:08,979
The sound of a bow
and you think it's Arjun?!

881
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:12,688
And even if it is,
who should be scared, tell me?

882
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,348
Arjun?

883
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,492
Or you, with such a large army?

884
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:19,927
Back to your positions!

885
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:23,455
Back to your positions everyone!

886
01:24:23,533 --> 01:24:25,694
You may be King of your kingdom

887
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,964
But I command this army!

888
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:31,701
And unfortunately
I have to protect you

889
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:36,609
Don't ever countermand my orders!

890
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,710
Form the Chakravyuh!

891
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:22,583
Arjun

892
01:25:25,762 --> 01:25:29,289
Prepare for battle!

893
01:25:29,366 --> 01:25:32,392
It's Arjun!

894
01:25:32,803 --> 01:25:34,430
He's out in the open!

895
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:37,432
Twelve years of
banishment once again!

896
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,441
Look up at the sky, Duryodhan...

897
01:25:41,945 --> 01:25:44,573
13 years are over!

898
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,709
Hold on tight!

899
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:35,898
Take him prisoner!

900
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,762
I want Arjun!

901
01:26:57,888 --> 01:26:59,321
Acharya...

902
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:02,655
Raise your weapon Arjun

903
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,254
Remember your promise?

904
01:27:05,328 --> 01:27:07,694
My Gurudakshina?

905
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:09,493
Of course, I do

906
01:27:10,534 --> 01:27:11,796
I remember everything

907
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:17,000
But my war is with Duryodhan, not you

908
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,571
Let me pass...

909
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:21,605
You've learned nothing Arjun

910
01:27:21,678 --> 01:27:23,839
Duryodhan is my King

911
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:26,780
It's my duty to protect him

912
01:27:28,018 --> 01:27:32,387
Okay, I'll fight you

913
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:35,583
But you have the
right to strike first

914
01:27:36,026 --> 01:27:37,357
Alright

915
01:27:37,394 --> 01:27:39,328
Let's see what you've learnt

916
01:28:11,595 --> 01:28:14,530
Finish him!

917
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:16,566
No one gets in the way!

918
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,932
He's down, he's down!

919
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:34,704
What are you doing, fool?

920
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,798
I fought this battle to protect Virat

921
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:05,266
not to destroy you

922
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:09,004
and the mission is over

923
01:31:10,273 --> 01:31:11,535
Now go

924
01:31:11,975 --> 01:31:14,443
far away from Virat

925
01:31:16,613 --> 01:31:23,041
Just remember, our fight isn't over

926
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,356
Now tell your men to retreat

927
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:31,053
