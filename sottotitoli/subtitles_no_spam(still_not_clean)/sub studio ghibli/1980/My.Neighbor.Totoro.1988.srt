1
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,013
Dad, do you want some candy?

2
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,916
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

3
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:36,714
All right

4
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,153
We're almost there

5
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,827
Mei, hide

6
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,266
It wasn't a policeman

7
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,275
Hello

8
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,768
Are your parents around?

9
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,238
Thanks

10
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,043
I'm Kusakabe

11
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,052
We've just arrived

12
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,488
A pleasure to meet you

13
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,594
Welcome

14
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,491
Thank you

15
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,847
Here we are

16
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,549
Wait

17
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,095
Mei, there's a bridge

18
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,323
A bridge?

19
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
See that flash?
Fish too

20
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,433
So, you like it here?

21
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,442
Dad, it's terrific

22
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,139
Look, a tunnel of trees

23
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,881
Is that our house?

24
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,951
Come on

25
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,399
It's a wreck

26
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,871
Wreck

27
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,670
Looks like a haunted house

28
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,937
Haunted?

29
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,717
And it's all rotten

30
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,756
It's gonna fall down

31
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,425
Fall down

32
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,112
Look, Mei

33
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,010
See?

34
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,552
It's huge

35
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,969
Dad, there's a huge tree

36
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,630
It's a camphor tree

37
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,699
Camphor tree

38
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:27,977
Oops

39
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,917
An acorn

40
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,557
Show me

41
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,257
Another one

42
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,765
It's mine

43
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,171
Out of the way

44
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,541
I can't open the screens

45
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,806
Acorns

46
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,246
There's acorns in the house

47
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,113
They dropped from up there

48
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,655
Maybe there are
squirrels in here

49
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,887
Squirrels, really?

50
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,497
Or rats; they like acorns too

51
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,196
I'd rather have squirrels

52
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,359
Where shall I put this?

53
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,165
Here
I'll get the door for you

54
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,068
Satsuki, open up the kitchen

55
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,071
Okay

56
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,608
It's just round the back

57
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,475
Mei, come on

58
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,147
Wait for me

59
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,150
Hurry

60
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,720
Ready?

61
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,231
Bathtubs

62
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,811
There's nothing here

63
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,113
That's the bathroom

64
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,980
Dad, there's something in here

65
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,949
A squirrel?

66
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,076
I don't know

67
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,884
A bunch of black things
but not roaches or mice

68
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,356
Really?

69
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,567
Can you see 'em?

70
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,700
I think they were dust bunnies

71
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,241
Dust bunnies?

72
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,470
Like in my picture book?

73
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,169
That's right

74
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,907
Ghosts don't come out
on days like this

75
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,217
When you walk into
a dark room from outside

76
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,121
your eyes dim and so
the dust bunnies come out

77
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,818
Oh, I see

78
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,554
Come here, dust bunnies

79
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:29,794
Come out, come out
wherever you are

80
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,299
Let's get to work

81
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,911
See if you can find
how to get upstairs

82
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,383
Get up there and
open all the windows

83
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,484
Sure

84
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,176
I'm coming, too

85
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,086
Toilet

86
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,721
Not here

87
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,465
Nothing here

88
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,763
Nothing

89
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,107
Nothing here

90
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,334
Nothing

91
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,275
Nothing

92
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,979
Nothing Nothing

93
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,125
Mei, it's here

94
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,662
It's pitch black

95
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,468
Dust bunnies

96
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,011
Another acorn

97
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,156
Come out, dust bunnies

98
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,761
Are you there, Mr. Dust bunny?

99
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,404
Nothing

100
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,089
Dad

101
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,598
There's definitely
something here

102
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,727
That's exciting

103
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,930
I've always wanted to live
in a haunted house

104
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,066
I'm coming

105
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,782
I got it, Satsuki

106
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,707
Mei

107
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,309
You're full of energy

108
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,479
This is Nanny

109
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,591
She's come to
look after the house

110
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,659
I'm Satsuki and
this is my sister, Mei

111
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,022
Nice to meet you

112
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,756
Nice to meet you both

113
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,423
I'd have cleaned up

114
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,231
If I'd known
you'd be this quick

115
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,007
No, you've done plenty

116
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,972
Lately I've been so busy
in the rice paddies

117
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,374
I only did a bit of dusting

118
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,581
Mei, what have you done
to your hands?

119
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,708
The dust bunny got away

120
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,844
Your feet, too

121
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,224
Mine are black, too

122
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,300
That must be
the soot spreaders

123
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,803
Those little

124
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,673
black, fuzzy things that fly?

125
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,143
That's right

126
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,306
They breed in
empty old houses

127
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,284
and cover them
with soot and dust

128
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,281
I could see them
when I was little

129
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,486
Now you can too, huh?

130
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,597
Are they like goblins
or something?

131
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,792
Naah, nothing so scare

132
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:08,874
If you keep smiling
they'll soon leave the house

133
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:14,071
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now

134
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,843
Mei, they're going away

135
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:22,885
That's no fun

136
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,786
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

137
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,415
I wouldn't be scared

138
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,116
Okay then

139
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,388
I won't walk you to
the bathroom at night

140
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay, cleaning time

141
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,535
Could you get some water
from the stream?

142
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,636
From the stream?

143
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,103
I'm coming, too

144
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:45,937
Mei, wait there

145
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,479
Did you get a fish?

146
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,733
Nanny, it's coming out

147
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,929
Good

148
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,574
keep pumping
'til the water gets cold

149
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,970
Okay

150
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,280
May I help you?

151
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,416
Huh, my Mom for Granny

152
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,356
Yes?

153
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,093
Wait, what is it?

154
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,072
Is that you, Kanta?

155
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,002
You live in a haunted house

156
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,080
Kanta, stop it

157
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,594
I did the same kind of thing
when I was his age

158
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,093
I hate boys

159
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,392
But, I really love
Nanny's rice cakes

160
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,201
Eat as much as you want

161
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,197
Thank you

162
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,272
Thank you very much
for your help

163
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,441
Good bye

164
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,355
Dad, the house
is going to fall down

165
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,557
I hope not
we've only just moved in

166
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,893
Come on, let's laugh to
keep the bogeymen away

167
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,759
I'm not scared

168
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,931
I mean it. I'm not scared

169
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,214
One-two, one-two...

170
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,756
Come on
keep up the good work

171
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,621
Okay, Washing finished

172
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,270
Here we go

173
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,656
Nanny

174
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,498
Hello

175
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,294
Hard at work?

176
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,302
Where're you all heading?

177
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,304
To visit Mommy
in the hospital

178
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,205
That's nice

179
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,608
Give her my regards

180
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,940
Okay

181
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,925
This way...

182
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,224
Hello

183
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,828
Hello, there

184
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,353
Mommy

185
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,932
So glad you came, my dear

186
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,433
Daddy took the wrong road

187
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,968
Really?

188
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,196
Hello, Satsuki

189
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,500
It's a school holiday, today

190
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,573
How nice

191
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,303
Daddy is talking
to the doctor

192
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,811
It's so good to see you all

193
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,781
Have you settled into
the new house?

194
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,123
A haunted house?

195
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,158
Mom, do you like ghosts?

196
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,261
Of course, I do

197
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,523
I can't wait to see them

198
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,926
See, I told you, Mei

199
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,763
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts

200
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,029
What about you two?

201
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:27,899
I love them

202
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,768
I'm not scared of them

203
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,904
Are you fixing
Mei's hair, Satsuki?

204
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,945
It's really
good Lucky girl, Mei

205
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,143
But she always
gets mad at me

206
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,084
That's 'cuz
you won't stay still

207
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,213
Come here, Satsuki

208
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,555
Isn't yours too short?

209
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,217
No, I like it like this

210
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,852
Do mine, Mommy Mine, too

211
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,430
Wait your turn

212
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,795
Wavy hair, just like mine

213
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,334
when I was your age

214
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,701
Will it be like yours
when I grow up?

215
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,833
Probably
You take after your Mom

216
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,193
Mom looked really well

217
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,320
You're right

218
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,663
The doctor says
she'll be home soon

219
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,633
Soon?
Like tomorrow?

220
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,795
You always say this

221
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,339
Tomorrow is a little too soon

222
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,502
Mom said she'll sleep
with me in my bed

223
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,840
Weren't you saying

224
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,949
you're big enough
to sleep alone?

225
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,983
Mom is special

226
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,764
Dad

227
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,299
Time to get up

228
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,112
Wake up

229
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,212
Sorry, I overslept again

230
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,018
I've got to bring
a box lunch today

231
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,058
I totally forgot about it

232
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:30,991
It's all right

233
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,721
I've made something
for all of us

234
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,558
It's burning

235
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,960
Let me do it

236
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,567
Here, this is yours, Mei

237
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,632
It's for me

238
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,174
Mei, sit down and eat

239
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,104
Here

240
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,110
Wrap yours

241
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,413
Satsuki

242
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,011
I'm coming

243
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,022
You made a friend already?

244
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,253
She's calling you

245
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,091
Yup, that's Michiko

246
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,693
Gotta go

247
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,594
See ya

248
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,032
See you later

249
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,603
Morning

250
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,767
Hi, let's go

251
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,687
Daddy

252
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,755
Do I look all grown up?

253
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,657
Yes, dear

254
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,058
And where might you be going?

255
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,892
I'm just going out

256
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,183
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

257
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,655
Already?

258
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,232
You be the flower shop, Daddy

259
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,957
Pole tads

260
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,976
Got no bottom

261
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,016
Gotcha

262
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,625
Who are you?
A big Dust bunny?

263
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,726
To-to-ro?
You're Totoro

264
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,737
I bet you're Totoro

265
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,734
Totoro

266
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:46,566
See you

267
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,177
Okay, catch you later

268
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,176
I'm home

269
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,612
Hey there

270
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,944
Is it that late already?

271
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,110
Where's Mei?
I'm off to Michiko's

272
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,687
We haven't eaten yet

273
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,414
Is Mei in the garden?

274
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,751
Mei

275
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,223
Mei

276
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:05,863
Mei

277
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,259
Mei

278
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:20,210
Dad, I found her hat

279
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,726
Mei...

280
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,337
Wake up, Mei

281
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,897
You shouldn't sleep here

282
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,170
Where's Totoro?

283
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,609
Totoro?

284
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,907
Where?

285
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,179
Were you dreaming?

286
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,083
Totoro was here

287
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,316
You mean that troll
in your picture book?

288
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,288
Yeah

289
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:14,422
He was all hairy with
a big mouth like this

290
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,057
There's a tiny one
and a little one

291
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,501
and a huge one like this

292
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,003
There you are

293
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,807
This is a great hiding place

294
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,247
Dad, Mei said
she saw a Totoro here

295
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,283
A Totoro?

296
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,213
It's this way

297
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,426
Hey, wait for me

298
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,029
Is it here?

299
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,604
No

300
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,004
It went to a big tree

301
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,110
But there wasn't
any other path

302
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,211
Come back, Mei

303
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,916
Mei, back

304
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,954
But it's true Totoro was here

305
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,429
I'm not lying

306
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,936
I know, Mei

307
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,603
I didn't lie

308
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:42,342
Neither of us think
you're lying

309
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,853
You probably met
the king of this forest

310
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,083
You were very lucky

311
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,523
He doesn't come out very often

312
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,588
We should go to the shrine
to pay our respects

313
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,427
Pay our respects?

314
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,125
To this forest

315
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,777
Mei, you're getting heavy

316
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,822
Daddy, look
That camphor tree

317
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,258
What a big tree

318
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,595
It's here

319
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,037
Is that the tree?

320
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,799
Dad, hurry up

321
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,781
The hole has gone

322
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,285
Are you sure it was here?

323
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,923
The hole disappeared

324
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,587
I told you he doesn't
come to see us often

325
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,922
But, will he come again?

326
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,894
I want to meet him, too

327
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,966
If you're lucky, sure

328
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,065
What a beautiful tree

329
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:12,733
This tree must have stood
here for years and years

330
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,939
Trees and people
used to be good friends

331
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,615
I saw that tree and
decided to buy the house

332
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,314
Hope Mom likes it too

333
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,118
Okay, let's pay our respects

334
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,590
then get home for lunch

335
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,557
Oh yeah

336
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,321
I promised
to go see Michiko

337
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,021
I want to go, too

338
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,655
Attention

339
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,294
Thank you for
looking after Mei

340
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,439
Thank you very much

341
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,908
Last one home's
a rotten egg

342
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,667
That's not fair, Dad

343
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,571
Wait

344
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,912
Hurry up

345
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,281
Wait for me

346
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,549
Dear Mother

347
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,918
Something amazing
happened today

348
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,049
Mei met a giant Totoro

349
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,559
And I'm hoping to see
him myself soon, too

350
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,994
Kanta, hurry up
You'll be late

351
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,159
Coming

352
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,736
Mei?

353
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,504
Excuse me

354
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,981
Yes, Satsuki?

355
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,515
It's my sister

356
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,525
What happened, Nanny?

357
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,028
I'm sorry

358
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,463
She insisted that
she be with you

359
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:55,038
It's Dad's day
at the university

360
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,403
You promised to be
a good girl at Nanny's

361
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,238
I still have two more classes

362
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,610
and Nanny's too busy for this

363
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:10,015
She was good up 'til now
weren't you?

364
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,563
I'll go talk to my teacher

365
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:30,931
Since Satsuki's mother
is in the hospital

366
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,338
I want you all
to be nice to her

367
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,842
Yes

368
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,174
What's that?

369
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,547
It's Totoro

370
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,118
Mei, you should keep quiet

371
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,224
Okay

372
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,670
Bye bye, Mei

373
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,706
I can't stay after class today

374
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,274
We'll let teacher know

375
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,377
See you

376
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,239
Hurry up, it's going to rain

377
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,439
Okay

378
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,714
Here it comes

379
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:33,731
Here

380
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,207
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

381
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,973
It's getting worse

382
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,485
Dear Guardian Spirit

383
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,712
Let us stay
until the rain stops

384
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,725
But...

385
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,949
That was lucky

386
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,291
It's got holes in it

387
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,500
Daddy forgot his umbrella

388
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,139
I'm going, too

389
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,542
I said I forgot it

390
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,342
What idiot forgets his
umbrella on a rainy day?

391
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,007
Ouch

392
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,313
You broke it playing, I bet

393
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,546
I did not

394
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,335
Excuse me

395
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,897
Hello, Satsuki, Mei

396
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,405
Grandma

397
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,411
I'm sorry about Mei today

398
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,672
Not at all
Sorry we couldn't do more

399
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,943
Kanta lent us this umbrella

400
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,184
He did?

401
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,981
A broken old thing like that

402
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,386
Mei was with me, so I was glad

403
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,583
But I'm so sorry
that Kanta got wet

404
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,250
Thank you very much

405
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,327
Not at all

406
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:16,523
It probably
cleaned him up a little

407
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,066
Are you off to
meet your father?

408
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,693
Yes
What good girls you are

409
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,304
Bye bye, Mei

410
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,633
Bye bye

411
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,612
Who was that?

412
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,912
I don't know

413
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,786
Just in time

414
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,434
Getting on?

415
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,500
All right, drive on

416
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,078
Daddy wasn't on it

417
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,189
He'll be on the next one

418
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,120
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

419
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:52,893
Are you okay?

420
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,493
Mei, sleepy?

421
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,227
I told you
Wanna go to Nanny's?

422
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,637
It won't be much longer

423
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,898
Hang in there

424
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,948
It's late

425
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,114
Come on

426
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:18,930
Are you Totoro?

427
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,575
Wait a minute

428
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,620
You can use this

429
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,463
Take it, Mei's slipping off

430
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,261
Hold it like this

431
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,409
Here's the bus

432
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,317
He took Daddy's umbrella

433
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,259
I'm sorry

434
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,903
All right, drive on

435
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,772
The train was late

436
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,533
and I missed the bus

437
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,633
Were you worried?

438
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,508
We met him, Dad
He was here

439
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,672
And the cat bus

440
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,043
What?

441
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,775
It was huge

442
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,783
With big eyes like these

443
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,478
We met him

444
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:58,385
We met Totoro

445
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,189
How wonderful

446
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,935
Come on, Daddy

447
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:21,981
Dear Mother

448
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,814
I can't tell you
how excited I was today

449
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,922
It was the scariest
funniest day

450
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,888
I've ever had

451
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,324
Totoro gave us
a lovely present

452
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:36,489
wrapped in bamboo leaves and
tied with dragon whiskers

453
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,332
When we opened it

454
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,165
it was full of magic nuts
and seeds

455
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,405
We decided to plant them
in the garden

456
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,912
to make a lovely forest

457
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,676
But they haven't sprouted yet

458
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:59,187
Mei sits there all day
waiting for them

459
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,251
She looks like a little crab

460
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,162
It's nearly summer vacation

461
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,702
Dearest, dear Mom
get well soon

462
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,168
Love, Satsuki

463
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,440
Come on. Bed time

464
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:25,776
Lights off

465
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,212
Wait, Dad

466
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,876
Daddy, do you think
they will come out tomorrow?

467
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,751
Well, I'm sure
Totoro would know

468
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,290
Good night

469
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,400
Wake up, Mei

470
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,722
That's where
we planted the seeds

471
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,185
Wow, we did it

472
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,600
We're the wind

473
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,286
There are no trees

474
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,031
Yes

475
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:56,074
It was a dream...
But it wasn't a dream...

476
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,545
We did it

477
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,559
Mr. Kusakabe. Telegram

478
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,299
Mr. Kusakabe

479
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,996
Telegram

480
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,540
Anyone home?

481
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,250
Nanny

482
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,315
I'm here

483
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,925
This one is ripe

484
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,838
What about this one?

485
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,201
That's good, too

486
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,581
Your garden's a treasure house

487
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,986
Let's take a little break

488
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,894
These should be cold now

489
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,587
Looks delicious

490
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,502
So good

491
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,634
The sun blessed these

492
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,713
So they're
really good for you

493
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,679
Would they help my Mom, too?

494
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,148
Of course

495
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,982
If she eats my vegetables
she'll get better right away

496
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,784
She's supposed to
be back next Saturday

497
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,519
She'll sleep in my bed

498
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,719
At last

499
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,422
That's wonderful

500
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,362
But it's only
for a couple of days

501
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,468
To get used to the new house

502
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,867
I see

503
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,530
We'll feed her
lots of vegetables, then

504
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:09,200
I'll give her this corn
I picked

505
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,539
I'm sure
she'll be very pleased

506
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,046
I know

507
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:22,951
There was a telegram for you

508
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,252
For us?

509
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,825
Dad won't be back till late
what shall I do?

510
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,629
Open it
it might be important

511
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,476
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPlTAL

512
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,805
It's from Mom's hospital

513
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,674
Something's happened to her

514
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:50,980
Nanny, What shall I do?

515
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,883
Calm down

516
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,149
Do you know
where your Dad is?

517
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,122
I know his office number

518
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,488
But we don't have a telephone

519
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,926
Kanta
take her to use the phone

520
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,724
in the main house

521
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:10,503
Mei, stay here with me

522
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:22,243
Stay with Nanny, Mei

523
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,247
Hello

524
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,380
I'd like to make a
long distance call, please

525
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:06,958
It's Tokyo 31-1382

526
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:07,858
Yes

527
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,596
A cute girl, Kanta

528
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,064
Hello?

529
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,364
Yes

530
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:24,140
Hello, may I speak to
Dader. Mr. Kusakabe?

531
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,907
It's his daughter, Satsuki

532
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,413
Yes

533
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,313
Daddy?
It's me, Satsuki

534
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,649
Hello, what's up?

535
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,160
From the hospital?

536
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:41,024
Okay
I'll call them right away

537
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,030
Is there anything wrong
with Mom?

538
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,224
Don't worry

539
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:50,396
I'll check up and
call you right back

540
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,336
I'm hanging up now
stay there

541
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:00,011
May I stay here
until he calls back?

542
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,683
Stay as long as you like

543
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,553
Satsuki

544
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:21,727
No

545
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,031
This corn is for my Mommy

546
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,274
No, it's my Mom's

547
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:48,093
Listen, Mei
Mom's not well

548
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,222
So she's not coming home
this time

549
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,595
No

550
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:54,963
There's nothing we can do

551
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,537
You don't want her
to get worse, do you?

552
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,004
No

553
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,806
It's just for
a few more days

554
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,105
No

555
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,081
So you don't care
if she dies, do you?

556
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,276
No

557
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,649
Stop being silly. I'm going

558
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,228
Let's go, Mei

559
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,865
I hate you, Satsuki

560
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,062
We should bring the washing in

561
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,799
Don't worry too much, Satsuki

562
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,638
Nanny's here to help
so cheer up

563
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,545
Your Dad said
he'll stop by the hospital

564
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,550
to check on her

565
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,713
Besides, it's just a cold

566
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,554
she'll be back next week

567
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:34,495
They said it was just a cold

568
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,662
when she went into hospital

569
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,831
But what if she dies

570
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,239
Don't be silly, Satsuki

571
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,312
Maybe Mom will

572
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,015
Stop it

573
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:55,283
Nobody would leave two
pretty little girls like you

574
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:59,788
There, there
Don't cry

575
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,729
I'll be here until
Daddy comes back, okay?

576
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,371
Mei

577
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,679
Mei

578
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,353
Mei

579
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,088
Did she come back?

580
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,320
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

581
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,625
That's strange

582
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,427
Where has she gone?

583
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,468
I was nasty to her

584
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,434
'cause she was being silly

585
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,096
Maybe she's heading
for the hospital

586
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,540
The hospital?

587
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,146
It would take
a grown up three hours

588
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,475
I'll go look

589
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,374
Kanta, hurry

590
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,111
Tell your dad

591
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:34,950
that Mei is missing

592
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,290
Stupid Mei
Always getting lost

593
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,278
Mei

594
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,378
Excuse me

595
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,986
Have you seen
a little girl pass by?

596
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,752
She's my sister

597
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,556
No, I don't think so

598
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,927
I'm sure I would've noticed

599
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,825
Maybe she wasn't here

600
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,346
Are you sure
she came this way?

601
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,787
I don't know

602
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,763
Mei

603
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,753
Please, stop

604
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:20,588
Jerk. What are you doing?

605
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,991
I'm looking for my sister

606
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,996
Have you seen a little girl?

607
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,759
Your little sister?

608
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,596
She's four

609
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,931
I think she's heading
to the hospital

610
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,367
Did you see anyone?

611
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,169
No. We just came from there

612
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,335
but we didn't see anyone

613
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,308
Thanks anyway

614
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,745
Where have you come from?

615
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:43,874
From Matsugo

616
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,577
Really?

617
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,450
Good luck

618
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,049
See you

619
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,334
Satsuki

620
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,367
Kanta

621
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,068
Find her?
No

622
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,541
And you?

623
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,274
Dad and the others
are looking for her

624
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,406
I'll go to the hospital

625
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,280
you go back home

626
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,909
I guess she got lost

627
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,682
on the way to the hospital

628
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,793
They found
a sandal by the pond

629
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,300
We're not sure
if it's hers or not

630
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,319
Did you find her?

631
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:29,253
Dear Lord
please protect her and...

632
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,224
It's too deep here
better search further away

633
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,556
Hey, are there any poles left?

634
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,163
Grandma, Satsuki's here

635
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,539
Nanny

636
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,443
Look, is it hers?

637
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,254
No, it isn't

638
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,634
Thank heavens

639
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:21,264
I was sure it was hers

640
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,071
Hey, Nanny was jumping
to conclusions

641
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,907
It's not hers

642
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:27,811
Where's she gone then?

643
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,383
Let's start from scratch

644
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,179
We better hurry
it'll be dark soon

645
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,518
I really appreciate
your help, everyone

646
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:08,088
Please, help me Totoro

647
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,590
Mei is lost
It'll be dark soon

648
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,025
I'm sure
she's scared somewhere

649
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,119
Totoro

650
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,463
Totoro, Mei is lost

651
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,328
and we can't find her

652
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:55,061
She must be scared

653
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:58,195
please help me find her

654
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,468
I don't know what to do

655
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,298
They can't see the bus

656
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,049
"FOREST-SWAMP"

657
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,712
"CEMETERY-SHRlNE"

658
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,053
"MEl"

659
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,943
Mei...

660
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,381
The trees are
moving out of the way

661
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,544
Mei

662
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:10,488
Satsuki...

663
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,065
Mei

664
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,003
Mei Satsuki

665
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:28,313
You silly girl

666
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,940
I'm sorry

667
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:35,715
You wanted to
take the corn to Mom?

668
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:46,190
"HOSPlTAL"

669
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,798
Will you take us
to the hospital?

670
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,871
Thank you so much

671
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:04,177
I'm sorry

672
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,016
They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold

673
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,647
The girls must be worried

674
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,623
I'm sorry to upset them

675
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,389
They'll be fine

676
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,656
As long as you're okay

677
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,629
We've all learned to cope

678
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,792
This'll just postpone
the enjoyment

679
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:25,671
They've put up with it so well

680
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,604
I'm especially sorry
for Satsuki

681
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,710
she's so sensitive

682
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,675
You're right

683
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,179
I 'm going to spoil them
for a while

684
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:36,113
when I come home

685
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,479
Oh no

686
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,051
She's laughing

687
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,162
Looks like she's fine

688
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:59,430
I can't wait to
get back on my feet

689
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,507
Look

690
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,949
Where did that come from?

691
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,453
What?

692
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,215
I could swear
I just saw Satsuki

693
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,518
and Mei laughing up
in that tree

694
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,957
Maybe they were too

695
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:26,295
Look
"For Mother"
