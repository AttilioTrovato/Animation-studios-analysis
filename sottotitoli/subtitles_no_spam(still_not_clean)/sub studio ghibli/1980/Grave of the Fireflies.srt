<i>September 21, 1945. That was the night I died.</i>

2
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,112
Damn tramps.

3
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,137
Watch it!

4
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,546
- Disgusting!
- Is he dead?

5
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:05,781
<i>The Americans'll be arriving any day now.</i>

6
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:08,822
<i>These bums are disgrace!</i>

7
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,001
<i>Mama...!</i>

8
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:25,927
<i>Tell me, what day is it?</i>

9
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,850
<i>Setsuko...</i>

10
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,794
Another one.

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,315
- What is this stuff?
- Never mind that. Just dump it!

12
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,525
This one's a goner, too.

13
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:27,100
You can see it in their eyes.

Air raid! Get to the shelters! Quickly.

<i>We're in for a big one this time!</i>

25

<i>The shelter behind the
firehouse should be safest!</i>

26
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:12,894
- It's hot!
- Be a good girl. Try to be patient.

27
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,502
Well, I'd better get over to the shelter.

28
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:23,606
So, be careful, Seita, and get
over there as soon as you can.

29
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:27,109
Setsuko, be a good girl
and listen to your brother.

30
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,411
Mom, never mind us! Get to the shelter!

31
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,810
Yes, yes.

32
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,283
Do you have your medicine with you?

33
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,756
I have it right here. Don't worry.

34
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,425
I hate the shelter!

35
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,162
Well, you'll be sorry if you
get blown up by a bomb!

36
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,857
Now get on.

37
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,243
My doll!

38
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,447
My doll!

39
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,785
<i>Air raid!</i>

40
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,359
Seita!

41
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,907
Get down!

42
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,338
Seita! Seita! Seita!

43
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:44,982
Seita!

44
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,725
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

45
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:17,948
<i>Get away people!</i> Get inside.

46
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,448
Take what ever you can carried.

47
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:46,295
Long live the Emperor!

48
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:09,496
We're safe here. Don't worry, okay?

49
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,661
But, where's Mama?

50
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,735
Right, she's in the shelter.

51
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:22,302
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250-kilo bomb easy.

52
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,098
Don't worry about her.

53
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:37,052
She'll probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us.

54
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,421
We'll go and meet her there.

55
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,728
Let's just rest a bit.

56
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:53,507
- Are you okay, Setsuko?
- I lost one of my shoes.

57
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,011
I'll buy you even better ones.

58
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,777
I have money.

59
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,553
Open this.

60
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,031
Wow, Setsuko, you're rich.

61
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:35,475
Black rain, from the bombing.

62
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,855
Look, it's all gone!

63
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:23,560
That was the civic hall.
We ate lunch there, once.

64
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,597
- Seita, is our house gone too?
- Probably.

65
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:32,569
What'll we do?

66
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,670
Dad'll make them pay for this!

67
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:53,526
Mother, mother!

68
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:06,834
Well, it's not like I was the
only one who lost his house.

69
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,070
<i>We're all in the same boat.</i>

70
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:12,549
<i>Well, at least we're still alive.</i>

71
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,250
There were two direct hits. The
fires are impossible to put out!

72
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,187
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

73
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,953
It's not her. She's not down here!

74
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,901
- Seita, I have to pee.
- Okay.

75
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:51,278
Attention, all residents of
Ichirizuka and Kaminishi!.

76
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,684
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

77
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:57,752
What's wrong?

78
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,861
- My eye hurts.
- Don't rub it.

79
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,626
We'll get it washed out at the school.

80
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,028
Where's Mama?

81
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,330
- She'll be there.
- At school?

82
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:12,130
Yes. Let's go.

83
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,224
Seita! Come.

84
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,822
Have you seen your mother yet?

85
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:38,226
She's been injured. Go to her.

86
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,361
I'll watch your sister.

87
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:44,068
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?

88
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,234
Seita has to go somewhere.
We'll wait for him together?

89
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:59,547
Seita. I'm glad you're here. Are you okay?

90
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:02,253
- My mom...?
- This way.

91
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:13,932
This is your mother's, isn't it?

92
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:18,537
In here.

93
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:32,343
She's finally falling asleep.

94
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:40,248
She really should be in a proper
hospital. We can't do much

95
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:45,056
<i>I don't think they've did hit the
Kaisei hospital in Nishinomiya.</i>

96
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:50,798
My mother, my mother has heart
trouble. Can she get her medicine?

97
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,565
I'll find out.

98
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:59,537
I'll be around if you need me.

99
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,384
Mom...

100
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,636
- You saw her?
- Yes.

101
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,239
I'm so sorry.

102
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,109
I'm thirsty.

103
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,186
If there's anything I can do, just ask.

104
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,587
Did you get your ration?

105
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,661
I'll get it for you!

106
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,704
Keep this ring in your
purse. Don't lose it. Okay?

107
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:08,440
Mom's been hurt, Setsuko.
But, she'll get better soon.

108
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,711
But, where is she?

109
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:13,785
In the hospital. In Nishinomiya.

110
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,722
<i>We'll stay here at the school tonight.</i>

111
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:24,395
Then tomorrow we'll go to stay in
our aunt's house near the hospital.

112
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:27,500
Is that okay?

113
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:43,949
We'll all staying on the second
floor. Why don't you stop by later?

114
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,749
Thanks for all your kindness. We will.

115
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,057
See you later then, bye bye now.

116
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,824
Want some?

117
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,194
I want to see Mama.

118
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,264
Maybe tomorrow. It's too late now.

119
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,925
Watch me, I'm good at this!

120
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:27,681
<i>We haven't unbandaged her. Believe
me, you don't want to see the body.</i>

121
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,479
<i>With this heat we're having, she'll
have to go on the truck today.</i>

122
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,737
<i>Where's your sister?</i>

123
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:54,374
<i>In Nishinomiya. We have a distant aunt there.</i>

124
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,110
<i>I think she'll take care of us.</i>

125
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,779
<i>I see. Lucky for you.</i>

126
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,788
<i>I'd better get back to work. Good luck to you.</i>

127
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:32,473
Mama!

128
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,142
Where is she?

129
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,779
Is she still sick, Seita?

130
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,721
- Yeah. Yeah, she still sick.
- Welcome back.

131
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:49,553
- How was your mother? Is she at Kaisei?
- Huh? Yeah.

132
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:52,126
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

133
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:56,363
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

134
00:21:56,364 --> 00:22:00,000
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

135
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,005
Thank you.

136
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,519
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

137
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:17,815
Did she give it to me?

138
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,524
Just be careful you don't lose it.

139
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,105
Setsuko...

140
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:39,437
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

141
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:43,377
Time for bed. Okay?

142
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:43,564
Bonito, herring, dried potato, pickled plums.

143
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:48,235
And I do believe this is butter!

144
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:53,007
All these things are so hard
to come by nowadays.

145
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:59,916
But, soldiers family always get the best.
Anyway, did you stop by the hospital today?

146
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,718
I'd glad to tell your mother
what's been happening.

147
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:07,693
And I could take Setsuko along to visit her.

148
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,791
How bad?

149
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,128
My mom died while she was still at the school.

150
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,067
<i>What? She's dead!</i>

151
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:24,605
Then, why didn't you tell me? Why
were you hiding it? Answer me. child

152
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,937
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

153
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:37,923
So, she's dead... how awful! Well, you'd
best write your father and tell him!

154
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,192
Seita!

155
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,926
Look! She bought me new shoes!

156
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,066
Good for you, Setsuko.

157
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,435
Hello there!

158
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,255
<i>Don't be too long.</i>

159
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:17,129
<i>We won't be.</i>

160
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:22,196
What's that noise?

161
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:25,899
Huh? Bullfrogs. There's nothing to be scared of.

162
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,902
Firefly!

163
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:38,282
Ready? Catch it.

164
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,585
Ah... you squashed it.

165
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,488
Ew! It smells!

166
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,187
Don't squeezed so hard.

167
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:27,720
There're millions of them!

168
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:37,771
- Hey, Setsuko, close your eyes and say "Ah."
- Why say that?

169
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:40,806
Come on, just do it. "Ah."

170
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:54,318
Fruit drop!

171
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:57,654
Fruit drop! Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

172
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:12,408
I almost swallowed it.

173
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:31,354
- We're home.
- Where were you, two?

174
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:37,725
- Did you thank the lady?
- Yes, ma'am.

175
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,800
That food looked good.

176
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,535
Seita. Shouldn't you be going to school?

177
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:15,969
or something?

178
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,607
Yeah, but the steelworks they
had me working in was bombed.

179
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:25,278
and my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

180
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,181
Well, I hope you've written to your father.

181
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:31,752
- I did that. I sent it to the Naval Office.
- When?

182
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:35,959
Just after we came here. Umm...
I guess is about 10 days ago?

183
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,459
That's seems strange.

184
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,959
There should have been a reply by now.

185
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:47,730
Return the scissors when you've
finished with them, Setsuko.

186
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,211
Any news on the war?

187
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,014
Begining to look hopeless.

188
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:05,084
It seems that the more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

189
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:08,357
<i>The war affort is eating up all of us, why is?</i>

190
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:14,758
You're right. That's why
food's getting so hard to find.

191
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:20,197
Our soldiers aren't the
only ones who are suffering.

192
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:24,938
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

193
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:28,507
You eat up and work as hard as you can!

194
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,317
Not again.

195
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,920
So you've taken in a couple
of homeless children?

196
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:44,396
<i>Poor things, losing their
mother when they're so young.</i>

197
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:52,265
- What's wrong? You got an itch?
- It's hot. I hate shelters!

198
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:56,038
Just hang on. We'll be out
of here as soon enough.

199
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:08,448
Hey, you wanna go to the beach?

200
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,150
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go!

201
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:30,066
It's all vegetable fields now.

202
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,224
Come on.

203
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:31,498
- What're they doing?
- They making sea salt.

204
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:35,505
It's all the salt and soy sauce is rationed.

205
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,166
Alright, hurry up, Setsuko!

206
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,635
It might be a little cold.

207
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:12,705
It's cold!

208
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:16,108
Feels good, right? You won't itch now.

209
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:26,186
It's a big bath!

210
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:28,220
Hey!

211
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:33,364
Come back here! Come back here!

212
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm a bear! I'm gonna eat you!

213
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:13,934
Snipy... snipy... snipy... cut.
snipy... snipy... snipy...

214
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:18,103
What's wrong? Is he sleeping?

215
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,586
Don't look at that.

216
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:34,584
When it gets a little warmer,
I'll teach you how to swim.

217
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:39,798
Lets swim, then eat.

218
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:46,933
<i>We'll swim, and that'll make us hungry.</i>

219
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:57,109
<i>Seita!</i>

220
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,507
<i>Setsuko!</i>

221
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:12,052
You're hungry, aren't you?
There's food for you here.

222
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:47,327
Mother! How are you? Were you waiting long?

223
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,166
- Are you alright my daughter?
- I'm fine. Really! They're very nice here.

224
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,506
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

225
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,340
Let's get home before we're
caught in next the raid.

226
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:04,477
I'm tired. Carry me.

227
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,182
<i>Air raid!</i>

228
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:22,762
Your mother will not be needing
her kimonos anymore, Seita.

229
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,631
Why don't you, trade them for some rice.

230
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:30,873
I've been trading off my
things bit by bit for food.

231
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,907
<i>You can probably get a full toh of rice for them.</i>

232
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:37,477
- That much?
- You need your nourishment.

233
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,947
You can't be a soldier if
you don't grow up healthy.

234
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,849
A whole toh of rice?

235
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,786
Your mother would be glad you
didn't let them just go to waste.

236
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,656
Why don't I take them for you?

237
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,558
No!

238
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,693
- No!
- Setsuko. You're awake.

239
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:59,968
No! No! They're Mama's! No! They're
Mama's! Don't take them! No!...

240
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:04,972
Setsuko. Let them go!

241
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:11,475
Setsuko. Setsuko. No! Setsuko.

242
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:54,787
- Fine rice, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

243
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:59,152
We'll have a proper rice
dinner tonight, Setsuko.

244
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:04,295
Here, this is yours.

245
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:14,604
White rice, Setsuko!

246
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,754
<i>Here you go.</i>

247
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:30,957
<i>With my daughter and our
lodger working so hard...</i>

248
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:35,561
<i>I've felt just terrible not
having rice to give them.</i>

249
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,966
It's great, huh? Real white rice!

250
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,203
More, please!

251
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,504
Surely.

252
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,444
You're just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you, Setsuko?

253
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,915
Uhum... it's very good!

254
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:03,623
- What's wrong?
- I don't want rice porridge!

255
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:06,325
Don't we have any more those pickled plums?

256
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:09,859
Uhm... we finished those off ages ago.

257
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,431
- Hi.
- Here's your lunch.

258
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,972
Thanks. I'd better get going.

259
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,872
- Bye, Mom.
- Take care.

260
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:23,009
We'll have rice balls for
lunch. Just hold on 'til then.

261
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,174
You stop that! You'll have
porridge for lunch too!

262
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:30,556
Do you think a lazy slug like
you deserves the same...

263
00:39:30,557 --> 00:39:35,191
as people who work so hard for our nation?

264
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:42,362
Really, Seita, you're old enough to know
now that everyone has got to cooperate.

265
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:47,165
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you do anything to earn it?

266
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,971
No, you absolutely do not!

267
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:02,916
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

268
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:09,222
- But it's our rice from rice toh.
- Oh, so now I'm cheating you, am I?

269
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:14,132
How dare you say that! After
I take you two in to my home!

270
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:17,197
Fine!

271
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:22,502
Here's a new rull, from now on,
we'll just make our own dinners!

272
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:27,006
Tell me Seita, you have other
relatives in Tokyo, don't you?

273
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,843
On your mother's side of the family?

274
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:33,549
Why not write to them? We
could be bombed any day!

275
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,753
I don't know where to find them.

276
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,728
Let's go home, Mommy.

277
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:52,165
Uh-huh. Daddy's waiting for us.

278
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:58,174
<i># Frogs are singing, it's time to go home #</i>

279
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:04,243
Sorry you had to wait so long.

280
00:41:07,181 --> 00:04:10,031
- What's wrong?
- I'm hungry.

281
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:14,454
- I'm thirsty too.
- Okay.

282
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:20,697
<i>Here, have a fruit drop.</i>

283
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,831
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

284
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:30,906
7000. That's more than enough for us
to live on, so you don't worry, okay?

285
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,542
I'm telling Dad to write back soon, because
you're waiting. Here right in here.

286
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,923
<i>You're in luck.</i>

287
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:55,662
You can't buy a stove like this easily
nowadays. You know what I mean?

288
00:41:55,663 --> 00:42:00,907
<i>It's almost impossible to
find any hardware to sell.</i>

289
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:08,241
I'll take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

290
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:11,511
An umbrella... oh, yes!

291
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:16,315
<i># It's raining, it's raining
it's raining, it's raining #</i>

292
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:20,587
<i># Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me #</i>

293
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:28,823
<i># Drip-drop, plip-plop, down the rain comes!
Drip-drop, plip-plop, down the rain comes! #</i>

294
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:39,906
That's should do it!

295
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:43,976
- You be careful with that fire.
- Right.

296
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:48,414
<i>What are they up to?</i>

297
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:55,221
- <i>They're doing their own cooking, now.
- Good for them! It's about time. More, please.</i>

298
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:58,491
<i>Mom, did you scold them again?</i>

299
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,994
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

300
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,832
And that boy even bought
a stove. Just to spite me!

301
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,540
Finished!

302
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,436
That's bad manners, Seita.

303
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:20,809
We can sit any way we want. Doesn't matter.

304
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:31,124
There. Rice for two.

305
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,725
- That's it?
- Yup!

306
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,567
Next ration will be in July.

307
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,793
Let me!

308
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:25,312
Ready?

309
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:36,055
Here.

310
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:41,224
Do you like it?

311
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:50,063
It's all different tastes!

312
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:56,338
Grape, strawberry, mint and melon. It's
all in there. Now drink it all up, okay.

313
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:08,851
It's all gone.

314
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:15,941
Great. They left the dishes for me to do.

315
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:17,277
So selfish.

316
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:22,452
Honestly! Those little brats
are two of the worst!

317
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:24,416
Not again!

318
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,188
Seita, please, that man and my daughter
work for our nation on day long!

319
00:46:30,189 --> 00:46:33,258
<i>We can't have her crying keeping them awake.</i>

320
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:39,097
We've enough trouble getting any
sleep with all these air raids!

321
00:47:05,758 --> 00:47:11,562
<i>Attention, attention. Report
from Central Military Division.</i>

322
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:14,733
<i>Several waves of enemy
bombers are approaching.</i>

323
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:17,336
<i>Going to the shelter again, Seita?</i>

324
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:22,675
<i>You're old enough to help fight the fires,
aren't you? aren't you? aren't you?</i>

325
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:39,524
I want to go home. I hate living with her!

326
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,266
We don't have a house to go back to.

327
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:56,842
<i># With a great big streamer
shape like a carp in the wind, go#</i>

328
00:47:56,843 --> 00:48:04,583
<i># With a great big streamer
shaped like a carp in the wind #</i>

329
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:11,156
<i># That big one's the Papa and
that little ones the kids #</i>

330
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:12,924
- <i>Stop it!
- # We... #</i>

331
00:48:12,925 --> 00:48:16,294
Don't you realize that there's a war going on?

332
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:19,527
You two are nothing but trouble for me!

333
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:24,034
A couple of pests, that's what are you!

334
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,971
You're no help at all during the raids.

335
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:31,037
You could just go and Live in
that shelter for all I care!

336
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,085
That's it.

337
00:48:36,182 --> 00:48:39,119
We can live here.

338
00:48:40,486 --> 00:48:45,890
No one using it. It's seems sturdy enough.
And we can just live like we want to!

339
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:49,259
Can we really live here?

340
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:15,955
We've bothered you long enough.
We're should be leaving now.

341
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,824
You're leaving...? For where?

342
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:22,126
Haven't really decided yet.

343
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:27,869
Well, then you two. Bye-bye,
take care of yourselves.

344
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:50,754
This'll be the kitchen!

345
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:55,731
And this'll be the front door!

346
00:49:55,732 --> 00:49:59,630
But where's the bathroom, Seita?

347
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:04,999
That can be anywhere. You
wanna go somewhere with me?

348
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,447
Thanks a lot. Where you
want leave the wagon?

349
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:18,351
Just leave it right there.

350
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:25,157
Do you think, maybe, you can sell my sister
and I some food and maybe some straw?

351
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:28,896
I guess. Not much left, though.

352
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:26,413
- My mouth's watering!
- Let's eat.

353
00:51:52,745 --> 00:51:55,647
Well, I guess, we can always eat frogs.

354
00:51:55,648 --> 00:51:59,987
- Frogs?
- Yeah. They're great.

355
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:05,393
You'd better get under the mosquito net.

356
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,268
What's wrong?

357
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,437
I forgot my toothbrush.

358
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:22,012
One night without it won't matter.

359
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,447
It's getting pretty buggy at here.
You'd better go, get under the net.

360
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:32,022
It's dark in there. I'm scared.

361
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:39,020
I have to pee, Setsuko. How about you?

362
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,098
Look, kamikaze.

363
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:51,174
- It looks like a firefly.
- Yeah.

364
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:53,973
Let's catch some.

365
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,614
Okay, get in.

366
00:53:04,132 --> 00:53:05,953
Ready?

367
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:12,791
I can see you!

368
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,489
<i>I can see you, too.</i>

369
00:53:18,097 --> 00:53:20,294
A hair clip.

370
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:28,272
Hey, let's get as many as we can!

371
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:25,564
I went to see a naval review one
time, just before you were born.

372
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:27,599
Naval review...?

373
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,661
Yeah. Dad's cruiser, the "Maya", was in
formation with the fleet in the harbour.

374
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:14,146
<i># Mighty fortresses floating on the seas #</i>

375
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:18,416
<i># Defending our homeland
from invaders near and far #</i>

376
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,790
Enemy plane!

377
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:35,396
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.

378
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:06,965
Get off me, Seita!

379
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,537
What you doing?

380
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:50,978
Making a grave. Mama's in a grave too.

381
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:58,750
Auntie told me.

382
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:04,555
She said Mama died, and she's in a grave now.

383
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:36,521
We'll going and visit her grave sometime.

384
00:57:36,522 --> 00:57:41,860
Do you remember the graveyard,
the pretty one, out near Nunobiki?

385
00:57:42,361 --> 00:57:47,499
That's where she is now.
Under a big camphor tree.

386
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,235
Why do fireflies have to die so soon?

387
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:32,510
Hey, it looks like somebody's living here.

388
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:37,149
- Probably lost their house.
- Maybe it's some crazy hermit.

389
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:42,655
- It's a swing.
- Hey, a kid lives here. What's this?

390
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,788
Rest in Peace! Rest in Peace!

391
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:50,489
I wish it was real food.

392
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,700
- It says "Setsuko".
- Look! Dried out frogs!

393
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:57,702
Who'd wanna eat that?

394
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,368
<i>Nobody I know would ever eat this stuff!</i>

395
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:05,810
<i>Ground soybeans!</i>

396
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:08,546
And I thought the food I got was bad!

397
00:59:08,547 --> 00:59:10,950
A ghost, a ghost!

398
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:25,764
I've traded everything for
rice. Even my mom's kimono.

399
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:27,766
There's nothing left to trade.

400
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:31,158
Please, I can pay you good money for the rice.

401
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:35,707
Sorry. I can't trade or sell anything to you.

402
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:40,647
I'm a farmer, but even I
don't have any rice to share.

403
00:59:47,153 --> 00:59:51,589
- Don't you have other relatives?
- I don't know how to contact them.

404
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,827
Then take my advice and go
back to that woman, son.

405
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:59,230
<i>Everything's rationed now.</i>

406
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:02,469
<i>You can't survive outside of the system.</i>

407
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:06,109
Just swallow your pride and apologize.

408
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:15,615
Thanks, anyway. I'll just
go and ask someone else.

409
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:20,889
You're a son of navy man,
right? So, try to be brave.

410
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:54,790
Is it okay?

411
01:01:33,459 --> 01:01:36,032
Oh, No!

412
01:02:35,688 --> 01:02:38,791
It doesn't matter if you like
it or not. You have to eat!

413
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:42,393
You need to, so you can grow up strong!

414
01:02:42,394 --> 01:02:44,261
Seita...

415
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,435
I feel... I feel funny.

416
01:02:50,436 --> 01:02:52,870
Are you cold

417
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:56,912
I've been having diarrhea.

418
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:02,941
<i>Hey you...!</i>

419
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:06,149
I'm sorry!

420
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:09,821
Sir, forgive me! I didn't mean to.

421
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:13,658
My sister's sick. I just
wanted to get her some sugar!

422
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:19,224
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

423
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:23,262
You god damned...! Come back here!

424
01:03:35,513 --> 01:03:38,282
What the hell...? Potatoes too?

425
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:41,752
So you're the one who's
been stealing my crops!

426
01:03:41,753 --> 01:03:43,387
Seita!

427
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:47,758
- I'm sorry! I'll never do it again, I swear!
- Seita.

428
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:51,729
- Tell it to the cops! I'll take you there myself!
- Seita.

429
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,265
- Now walk! I hope they lock you up!
- No, please.

430
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:58,103
- Seita! Seita!
- Please, she's sick! She needs me!

431
01:03:58,104 --> 01:04:01,737
- Move.
- Seita!

432
01:04:02,874 --> 01:04:04,571
Seita!

433
01:04:05,944 --> 01:04:09,584
Seita... Seita...

434
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:18,056
Base on what you both told me, the
nature of the crime is very clear.

435
01:04:18,057 --> 01:04:22,226
So I thank you, for information, so I'll
take care of this. You may go now.

436
01:04:22,227 --> 01:04:28,660
- What, officer...
- You've knocked this poor kid around enough.

437
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:31,702
I'm even tempted to call it...

438
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:36,337
- Assault!
- I... er... thank you, sir!

439
01:04:39,678 --> 01:04:43,211
They hit Fukui tonight, you know.

440
01:04:45,317 --> 01:04:48,652
Would you like a glass of water or something?

441
01:04:58,197 --> 01:05:00,269
Setsuko.

442
01:05:07,939 --> 01:05:09,511
Seita!

443
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:27,690
Seita.

444
01:05:33,732 --> 01:05:40,173
Should I get a doctor, Seita? Where does it hurt?

445
01:05:45,377 --> 01:05:47,449
Setsuko!

446
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,694
I have to go to the bathroom.

447
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,463
Can it wait a little bit?

448
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,303
Hop on.

449
01:06:14,273 --> 01:06:21,117
<i># Brother's gone to the mountain
to bring back some firewood... #</i>

450
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,992
Hurry, come on.

451
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:12,201
<i>Setsuko. Dinner.</i>

452
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:20,137
This pumpkin's great. Tastes
just like sweet bean jelly.

453
01:07:20,138 --> 01:07:22,973
I don't like that stuff.

454
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:26,379
Look, if you don't eat, Dad'll blame me for it.

455
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:32,544
Come on, ready? I'll even help you, okay?
Now come on, cheer up and eat!

456
01:07:33,652 --> 01:07:39,051
Once you get better, I'll take you
to the beach again, Setsuko.

457
01:09:14,386 --> 01:09:17,653
Now I'll really get you
something good to eat, Setsuko!

458
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:29,303
S... Seita...

459
01:09:35,473 --> 01:09:37,545
Seita...

460
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:41,845
These were your mother's?
Don't make me laugh!

461
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:46,150
Try to pawn off your garbage on me? Here.

462
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,126
Setsuko... Setsuko.

463
01:10:25,724 --> 01:10:27,921
Setsuko!

464
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:39,066
Seita... water...

465
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:50,781
<i>Breathe in.</i>

466
01:10:50,782 --> 01:10:52,579
And out.

467
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,956
She's been having diarrhea for a while now.

468
01:10:58,957 --> 01:11:05,228
Prickly heat, rashes are all over her, and
salt water seems be hurting her skin.

469
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:12,469
Weakening from malnutrition. due to the diarrhea.

470
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,437
Next patient?

471
01:11:13,438 --> 01:11:15,439
Can you give her medicine or a shot?

472
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:21,474
- Don't wanna shot.
- Please, doctor, help her!

473
01:11:21,475 --> 01:11:27,451
Give her medicine? All this
child needs is... some food.

474
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:31,022
- She needs food...
- How can I help you?

475
01:11:31,023 --> 01:11:34,228
Where I suppose to get food?

476
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:32,349
- I'm so hungry. What do you want to eat?
- Tempura, sashimi, jelly...

477
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,851
Anything else?

478
01:12:33,852 --> 01:12:40,858
Ice cream. And also... I want fruit drops.

479
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:44,297
Fruit drops? Okay!

480
01:12:47,765 --> 01:12:51,801
I'll withdraw the money and
buy you all the food you need.

481
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:56,240
Don't want anything. You can have it.

482
01:12:57,041 --> 01:13:02,546
Don't go! Stay with me! Don't leave me alone!

483
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:05,749
And don't you worry, Setsuko.

484
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:10,454
I'm going to buy you some good,
and nourishing food, okay.

485
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:15,895
And I'll never... I never ever
leave you again. Never, ever.

486
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:20,035
I promise.

487
01:13:40,852 --> 01:13:44,221
- <i>3000 yen.</i>
- There's a typhoon coming?

488
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:49,860
That's great, we get our "Divine
wind" after we surrender. Figures...

489
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:53,330
Surrender...? You mean, we've lost the war?

490
01:13:53,331 --> 01:13:56,234
Haven't you heard, young man?

491
01:13:58,803 --> 01:14:02,673
You telling me Japan's lost the war?
The Great Japanese Empire?

492
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:05,948
Yeah. Surrendered unconditionally.

493
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:09,613
- But what about the fleet? Are they...?
- All gone.

494
01:14:09,614 --> 01:14:13,917
The all fleet been sent to the bottom
of the sea. Not one left afloat.

495
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:14,885
What?

496
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:19,423
Was my Dad's ship sunken, too? Please
tell me. Is that why he hasn't written?

497
01:14:19,424 --> 01:14:21,992
How the hell should I know?

498
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:24,389
Crazy kid.

499
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,334
Damn him!

500
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,080
I'm so hungry.

501
01:14:53,424 --> 01:14:55,187
Daddy.

502
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:08,940
Now Dad's gone too. He's dead too. Dad...

503
01:15:53,685 --> 01:15:59,091
I'm sorry I'm so late, Setsuko. I'll go
ahead and start making up some rice.

504
01:15:59,624 --> 01:16:02,397
Up they go.

505
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:06,098
And down again.

506
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:10,734
Firefly's stopped.

507
01:16:11,335 --> 01:16:14,909
I bought us some chicken, some eggs.

508
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,113
And I also have...

509
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,430
Setsuko, what's in your mouth?

510
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:28,923
Setsuko, what are you eating?

511
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,796
This is a marble. It isn't a drop!

512
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:42,793
I brought you something special,
and I know that you gonna like it.

513
01:16:45,136 --> 01:16:49,242
Seita, have one.

514
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,610
Setsuko, what...?

515
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:57,481
Rice balls.

516
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:02,150
I made them for you.

517
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:07,090
Here. Have one.

518
01:17:10,728 --> 01:17:15,199
- You don't want them...?
- Setsuko!

519
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:27,905
Look, it's a watermelon.
and I didn't have to steal it.

520
01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:43,129
<i>Here, eat it.</i>

521
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:52,774
It's good...

522
01:17:55,773 --> 01:17:59,908
Hold on of this, and I'll go make
some rice gruel with eggs.

523
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:10,589
I'll leave the melon here for you.

524
01:18:11,222 --> 01:18:12,924
Okay?

525
01:18:13,257 --> 01:18:15,826
Seita.

526
01:18:15,827 --> 01:18:19,333
Thank you.

527
01:18:43,253 --> 01:18:46,489
<i>She never woke up.</i>

528
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:41,678
There you go. Charcoal for the cremation.

529
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,544
Now, since it's a child, make
sure you do it at a temple.

530
01:19:45,983 --> 01:19:50,687
The body should be lightly dressed,
and use beanstalks for a good fire.

531
01:19:51,188 --> 01:19:54,262
Spite of it all. Lovely day.

532
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,895
It's so good to be home! It hasn't changed a bit.

533
01:20:07,504 --> 01:20:10,503
<i>The old phonograph.</i>

534
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:15,512
I've missed this view.

535
01:21:02,827 --> 01:21:05,393
<i>Come back soon!</i>

536
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,316
<i>The next morning, I put some
of Setsuko's ashes into...</i>

537
01:24:46,317 --> 01:24:49,652
<i>the candy tin, and then climbed down the hill.</i>

538
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,927
<i>I never went back to the shelter.</i>

539
01:24:59,396 --> 01:25:01,531
<i>Seita...</i>

540
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:05,769
Seita.

541
01:25:18,082 --> 01:25:20,655
Time for bed. Okay?
