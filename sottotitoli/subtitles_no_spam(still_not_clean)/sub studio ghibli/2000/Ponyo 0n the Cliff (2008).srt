1
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,310
I really like this thing.

2
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,840
All right then.
Why don't we have some tea?

3
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,680
Ponyo, will you
hold the light for me?

4
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,490
- Coming!
- Let's see if the water is working.

5
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,620
- It's working!
- It's working!

6
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,830
- It worked!
- It worked!

7
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,730
It's because we have
our own water tank up on the hill.

8
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,040
And who thinks the stove will light?
And light! All right.

9
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,140
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

10
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,980
- Please have a seat at the table.
- OK!

11
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,580
Ponyo, over here.

12
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,290
This is what you do.

13
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,020
Now, put your stuff down.

14
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,000
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

15
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,240
Look at that!

16
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,370
What is it?

17
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,010
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

18
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,100
Here you go.

19
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:35,880
Here.

20
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,280
Thank you for the tea!

21
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,290
Ah, that was delicious.

22
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,470
So, what shall we do next?

23
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,600
- Ponyo wants ham!
- All she thinks about is ham, Lisa.

24
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,380
I better make some dinner then.

25
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,580
But, first,
we should start the generator.

26
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,940
We generate power
to talk to Koichi on the radio.

27
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,780
Koichi is my dad.

28
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,790
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.

29
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,520
He's the captain of the ship
called <i>Koganei Maru.

30
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,600
What about your dad, Ponyo?

31
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,960
His name is Fujimoto.
He keeps me in a bubble!

32
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,970
- What?
- So I ran away.

33
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,270
What about your mom, then?

34
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,830
I love my mom very much!

35
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,180
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

36
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,640
Ponyo, over here, please.

37
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,960
I wonder if the fuel has gone bad.

38
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,090
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

39
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,000
It's clogged over there.
