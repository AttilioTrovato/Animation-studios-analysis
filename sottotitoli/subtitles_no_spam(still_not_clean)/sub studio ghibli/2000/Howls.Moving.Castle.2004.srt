1
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,820
Miss Sophie,

2
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,330
I've closed up the shop.

3
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,910
You should come too, Sophie.

4
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,080
I'll just finish this.
Go have some fun.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,210
All right, then, I'm off.

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm going.
Hey, wait...

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,550
Look, it's Howl's castle.

8
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,170
What? Howl? Where, where?

9
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,260
Look how close it is.

10
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,260
Oh, no.

11
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,390
I wonder if Howl's in town...

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
It took off.

13
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,270
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers.

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,990
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

15
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,530
They say Howl tore her heart out.

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,450
How scary...

17
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,120
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours.

18
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,200
Hurry up!

19
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,540
Really?

20
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,170
Oh, cut it out...

21
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,250
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

22
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Oh, no... I'm fine.

23
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,960
Then how about a cup of tea?

24
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,300
Care to join me?

25
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,010
No thank you, I'm busy.

26
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,800
She sure is a cute little mouse.

27
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,180
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

28
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,060
Let me pass!

29
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,480
See, it's those whiskers of yours!

30
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,850
She's even cuter when she's mad.

31
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,560
Hey, there, I'm sorry.

32
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,940
Where've you been?

33
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,280
Who are you?

34
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm with her.

35
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,860
Why don't you two take
a little walk?

36
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,620
What the?!
Hey, wha...

37
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,870
Don't hold it against them.

38
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,120
They're harmless.

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,540
Where to? I'll be your escort.

40
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,130
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari's.

41
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,760
Act normal.
I'm being followed.

42
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,130
Just walk.

43
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,280
Sorry I got you involved.

44
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,200
This way.

45
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,800
Hold on.

46
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,300
Drop your legs and keep walking.

47
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,020
That's right, don't be frightened.

48
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,000
Very nice.

49
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,720
I'll draw them off.

50
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,640
Wait here until the coast is clear.

51
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,220
Yes.

52
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,390
That's my girl.

53
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,320
Any Letties chocolate?

54
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,990
Look this way, Lettie.

55
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,990
Hey, make room.

56
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,200
Let's go for a walk, Lettie.

57
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,290
My sister?

58
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,750
Come back soon, Lettie.

59
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,630
Onee-chan?

60
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,130
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

61
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,680
Have you become an angel?

62
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,850
It feels like I'm in a dream...

63
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,140
Lettie, why not use the office?

64
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,680
Thanks, but I should really
be working.

65
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,480
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

66
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,520
He was so kind...

67
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,530
He rescued me...

68
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,410
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart.

69
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,120
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up!

70
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,120
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties.

71
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,920
There you go again.

72
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,250
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times.

73
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,340
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl.

74
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,430
Onee-chan?

75
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,140
Oh, you...

76
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,850
Lettie, the madeleines are done.

77
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,100
Okay, be right there.

78
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,560
All right.

79
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm going home.

80
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,280
It's a relief to know
you're doing well.

81
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,280
Hello, Lettie.

82
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,610
Nice to see you.

83
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,580
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

84
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,620
It meant so much to Papa.
Besides, I'm the eldest.

85
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,830
That's not what I meant...
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

86
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,290
Well, I...

87
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,670
Bye, Lettie.

88
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,130
Come by the shop next time.

89
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,170
Sure.

90
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,340
I'll be on my way.

91
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,300
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself.

92
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,540
Sorry, the shop's closed.

93
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,210
I thought I'd locked the door...

94
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,220
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats.

95
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,350
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself.

96
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,310
This is just a simple hat shop.

97
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,570
I think you had better leave.

98
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,070
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste.

99
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
The Witch of the Waste?

100
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,130
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell.

101
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,670
My regards to Howl.

102
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,130
Is this really me?!

103
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,430
I've got to stay calm.

104
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,700
I've got to calm down.

105
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,700
It's no use panicking, Sophie.

106
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,870
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

107
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,790
I've got to calm down.

108
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,640
I'm back!

109
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,180
Welcome home, Ma'am!

110
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,850
How do you like it?

111
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,810
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

112
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,100
Amazing!

113
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,150
It suits you.

114
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,440
Don't you think it's wonderful?

115
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,530
Sophie!

116
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,320
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet.

117
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I wonder what's the matter?

118
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,740
Sophie!

119
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Don't come in.

120
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,300
I've got an awful cold.

121
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,170
I don't want you to catch it.

122
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,890
You sound just awful...

123
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,970
Like some 90 year-old woman.

124
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,850
I'll stay in bed today.

125
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,680
You sure? All right, then.

126
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,980
Here we go...

127
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,910
You'll be fine, old lady.

128
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,210
You're still healthy, and these clothes
finally suit you.

129
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,040
But I can't stay here.

130
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,760
Ouch, ouch.

131
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,980
It's not easy being old.

132
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,700
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

133
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,630
Like a hand, granny?

134
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,670
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage.

135
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,390
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

136
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,100
Just a bit farther than where
you're going.

137
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,810
I don't recommend it, granny.

138
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,560
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead.

139
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,570
Thank you.

140
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,490
Going to the Folding Valley
at this hour?

141
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,110
She says her youngest sister's there.

142
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,170
I've hardly made any progress at all.

143
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,340
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth.

144
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,770
That'll make a good cane.

145
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,860
Up we go.

146
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,450
Might be a bit too thick.

147
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,620
Ouch, ouch.

148
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,000
What a stubborn branch.

149
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,840
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie.

150
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,670
Heave!

151
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,690
A scarecrow, eh? I thought you were
working for the Witch.

152
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,030
But how do you stand by yourself?

153
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,610
Your head's a turnip.

154
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,370
I've always hated turnips.

155
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,080
At least you're not
upside down anymore.

156
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,910
So long.

157
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,880
It's so cold.

158
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,680
The town's still so close.

159
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,810
Don't follow me.
You don't owe me a thing.

160
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,150
You must be a magical whatever-you-are.

161
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,150
I've had enough of witches and spells!

162
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,570
Just go stand wherever you like!

163
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,010
This is a perfect cane.
Thank you kindly.

164
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,430
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

165
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,280
Seems you get more cunning with age.

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,040
What a huge battleship!

167
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,880
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old.

168
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,610
I smell smoke,
maybe there's a cabin.

169
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,970
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

170
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,140
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

171
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,530
What is this?

172
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,150
You call this a castle?

173
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,470
Is that the way in?

174
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,300
Just wait up there.

175
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,140
Hey, there!

176
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,190
Are you going to let me on, or not!

177
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,530
My cloak!

178
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,290
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip.
I'm going in.

179
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,540
Thank you.

180
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,630
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine.

181
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,090
This time, it's really goodbye.

182
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,100
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip.

183
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,220
May you find happiness.

184
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,730
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

185
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore.

186
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,840
That's some spell you're under.

187
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,800
It won't be easy to break.

188
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,850
The fire talked.

189
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,430
And you can't even
tell anyone about it.

190
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
You're Howl?

191
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,110
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

192
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,860
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

193
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,530
Easy.

194
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,160
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

195
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,830
I'll break your spell in a flash.

196
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,370
In other words, bargain with a demon.

197
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,960
You sure you can keep that promise?

198
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,630
Demons don't make promises.

199
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,720
I suggest you look elsewhere.

200
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,090
But I'm an exploited demon.

201
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death.

202
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,850
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving.

203
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,560
My, you've got it rough.

204
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,110
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break.

205
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,110
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too.

206
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,660
All right.
A bargain, eh?

207
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,330
Granny.

208
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,830
Granny.

209
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,550
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her.

210
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,390
Hey, who's this?

211
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,150
Porthaven!

212
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,520
When did she get in?

213
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,990
Stand by.

214
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,910
Why, Mayor, sir.

215
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,040
The sun is already high.
Is Master Jenkins at home?

216
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,250
The Master is out.

217
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,050
I answer in his stead.

218
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,420
An invitation from His Majesty.

219
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,880
It has come to war.

220
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,720
His Majesty desires every wizard,

221
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,770
magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland.

222
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,230
His presence is imperative.
That is all.

223
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
War, how awful.

224
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,400
And who might you be?

225
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,700
Calcifer let me in.

226
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,160
Don't look at me.
She wandered in from the Wastes.

227
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,620
The Wastes?

228
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,040
That's strange...
You're not a witch, are you?

229
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,960
A witch could never get in.

230
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,380
Porthaven, again.

231
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,670
A customer?

232
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,210
Stand by.

233
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,590
State your purpose.

234
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,430
Mama sent me.

235
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,560
The usual spell?

236
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,020
Behave yourself, now.

237
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,410
It's not the Wastes.

238
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,370
Granny, are you a witch, too?

239
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,170
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land.

240
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,260
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it.

241
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,550
Sure.

242
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,470
Many thanks.

243
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,770
I can't have you making up things.

244
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,770
You should give up that disguise.

245
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,810
It's not a disguise, it's magic.

246
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,400
The Kingsbury door.

247
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,070
Stand by.

248
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,290
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

249
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,540
It is, indeed.

250
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,830
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty.

251
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,460
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace.

252
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,340
Our thanks to you.

253
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,570
A city fit for a king.

254
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,440
Get back in or you'll lose your nose.

255
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,830
Stop wandering around.

256
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,990
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad.

257
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,990
This is a magic house, isn't it?

258
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,040
Oh, boy!

259
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,200
Where does the black one lead?

260
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,750
Only Master Howl knows.

261
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,750
I'm having my breakfast.

262
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,390
But you've got bacon and eggs.

263
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,470
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away.

264
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,900
I'll cook for you.

265
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,360
But you can't.

266
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,860
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

267
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,650
That's right, I won't cook for you.

268
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,660
Oh, here's my hat.

269
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,790
All right, Calcifer
Be a good fire, now.

270
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,330
Forget it, I'm a demon.

271
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,130
I answer to no one.

272
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,670
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you!

273
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,760
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

274
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,970
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in.

275
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,100
So, what'll it be?

276
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,560
That's right, there's a good fire.

277
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,490
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon.

278
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,990
Calcifer's doing what she says.

279
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,820
I'd like some tea, too.
Have you got a kettle?

280
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,160
Sure.

281
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,460
Welcome home, Master Howl.

282
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,670
You have letters from the king.

283
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,550
To Jenkins and to Pendragon.

284
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,150
Calcifer, you're so obedient.

285
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,150
She bullied me.

286
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,440
Not an easy thing to do.

287
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,400
Who exactly are you?

288
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,490
I'm Grandma Sophie.

289
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,410
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady.

290
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,080
Give me that.

291
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,210
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs.

292
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,730
Yummy!

293
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,030
Yummy!

294
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,160
And who hired you to clean?

295
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,450
Why, I hired myself.

296
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,040
I've never seen such a filthy house.

297
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,790
Hmm...

298
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,840
Markl, plates.

299
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,800
You're all ganging up on me.

300
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,680
Please join us, Sophie.

301
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,810
Sit over here.

302
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,620
Pick one.

303
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,120
Everything else is dirty.

304
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,120
I've got my work cut out for me.

305
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,380
Markl?

306
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,500
Yes?

307
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,210
Sophie.

308
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,760
Thank you.

309
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,760
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread.

310
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,890
Our daily bread.

311
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,520
Haven't had a real breakfast
in a long while.

312
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,190
So many manners to teach...

313
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,030
So, what's that in your pocket?

314
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,320
What?

315
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,790
I wonder what it is...

316
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,330
Let me.

317
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,180
It's scorched into the table.
Master Howl, this is...

318
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,640
Ancient sorcery.

319
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,180
And powerful, too.

320
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,020
The Witch of the Waste?

321
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,770
"He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless man."

322
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,190
"Your heart shall be mine..."

323
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,770
Well, so much for the table.

324
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,420
Wow, it's gone!

325
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,040
The scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell.

326
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,250
Brethren, continue your meal.

327
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,550
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers...

328
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,020
And send hot water to the bath.

329
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,310
Not that, too!

330
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,230
Do you work for the
Witch of the Waste?

331
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,530
Don't be stupid! The witch...

332
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,990
Actually...
the witch... I...

333
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,080
Confound it!

334
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,080
Damn that Witch of the Waste.
Wait till I get my hands on her!

335
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,250
Let me finish eating this.

336
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,930
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out.

337
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,470
Every last one of you, mocking me.

338
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,400
There's a spell I need.

339
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,610
Later.

340
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,860
A witch rages within.

341
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,910
Sophie.

342
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,080
Sophie, I'm going out.

343
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,210
I'll die without some fresh wood.

344
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,670
What, what are you doing?

345
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,340
I'll fall, I'll fall.
I'm in peril.

346
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,550
I'm sweeping the ashes.

347
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,680
Won't be a minute.

348
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,720
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

349
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm in danger.

350
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm in danger...

351
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,690
I'll go out.

352
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,730
Oh, no.
I'm slipping...

353
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,990
Hurry, Sophie.

354
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,180
Try not to torment my friend.

355
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,730
Master Howl, are you going out?

356
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,700
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away.

357
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,370
What'd you do, Sophie?

358
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,870
She abused me.

359
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,170
If I die, Howl goes with me.

360
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,750
I'm the cleaning lady.

361
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,170
It's my job to clean.

362
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,180
No, not the 2nd floor!

363
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,680
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry.

364
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,730
Save my room for later.

365
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,070
My little outburst gave me back
my strength.

366
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,950
What a strange house.

367
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,070
Amazing!

368
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,400
Calcifer, Calcifer!

369
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,660
Are you moving the castle?

370
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,280
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am!

371
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,950
You're incredible, Calcifer!

372
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,500
Your magic's first class.
I misjudged you completely.

373
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,630
You think so?

374
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,840
You really think so!

375
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,220
Oh, no, not yet!

376
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,960
How beautiful.

377
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,260
It's called Star Lake.

378
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,140
Something's stuck in there.

379
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,680
Oh, dear.
Lend me a hand, Markl.

380
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,930
Sure.

381
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,230
And up!

382
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,860
A scarecrow.

383
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,990
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head.

384
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,030
You sure like being upside down

385
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,330
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me.

386
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,340
He followed me here.

387
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,710
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

388
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,510
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land.

389
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,620
Turnip, don't pull it so tight.

390
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,260
Seems like he likes doing the wash.

391
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,720
They'll dry in no time.

392
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,480
Turnip must belong to the demons.

393
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,270
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him.

394
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,400
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead.

395
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,190
But he led me
to this wonderful place.

396
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,320
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie.

397
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,950
Why, thank you.
We'd better be getting back.

398
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,040
How mysterious.

399
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,620
I've never felt such peace.

400
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,490
Stinks.

401
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,370
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

402
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,100
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back.

403
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,190
Isn't it great! Sophie did this for me.

404
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
The fighting is fierce.

405
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,990
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border.

406
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,750
I hate the fire in gunpowder.

407
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,580
They have no manners.

408
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,170
My own kind attacked me.

409
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,750
The Witch of the Waste?

410
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,340
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters.

411
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,890
They'll cry plenty later on,

412
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,180
when they can't regain human form.

413
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,810
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry.

414
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,600
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

415
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,020
Yes, well...

416
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,690
Hot water for my bath.

417
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,650
Oh, no, not again.

418
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,890
Is that Howl?

419
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,310
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

420
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,530
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

421
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,650
No matter.

422
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,410
Morning.

423
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,450
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

424
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,450
I've never seen the ocean.

425
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,170
Such beautiful, sparkling water.

426
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,290
Same as it always is.

427
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,510
I myself hate potatoes.

428
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,720
Pay up.

429
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,270
Thank you.

430
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,470
Thanks.

431
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,850
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

432
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,190
That one's tasty.

433
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,770
I myself hate fish.

434
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,110
The fleet's come home.

435
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,190
Is that the smoke?

436
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,160
There's been another battle.

437
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,240
Really? Sorry, lady, later.

438
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,030
That ship's on fire!

439
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,310
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

440
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,520
No, I've no stomach for such things.
Let's go home.

441
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,900
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this.

442
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,820
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

443
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,530
Don't move.

444
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,870
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

445
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,920
They're gone.

446
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,420
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

447
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,010
Look! Up there!

448
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,970
That's what dropped those bombs!

449
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,060
An enemy airship, Sophie.

450
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,860
Sophie, flyers.

451
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,190
Ignore the flyers
They're enemy propaganda!

452
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,450
Are you okay, Sophie?

453
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,710
A glass of water, please.

454
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,920
Sure.

455
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,560
Sophie, What did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

456
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,600
My hair's turned this weird color!

457
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,570
What... what beautiful hair.

458
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,770
Take a good look!

459
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,400
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells.

460
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,160
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up.

461
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,120
Cleaning, always cleaning.

462
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,870
I told you not to get
too carried away.

463
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,410
It's hopeless.

464
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,040
How humiliating.

465
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,300
It's not so very bad.

466
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,100
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way.

467
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,100
I'm done for. What's the point
in living, if you aren't beautiful...

468
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,530
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

469
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,870
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness.

470
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,040
He did this last time
a girl ditched him.

471
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,460
Please, Howl, that's enough.

472
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,380
You can just dye your hair again.

473
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,270
I've had enough of you, Howl!

474
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,400
I've never once been beautiful!

475
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,990
I've had enough of this place!

476
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,070
Thank you, Turnip.
You're a kind scarecrow.

477
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,120
Please come back, Sophie.
Howl's in trouble!

478
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,700
Cut it out, Howl.
I'm going out.

479
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,120
Sophie!

480
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,580
Get over here.

481
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,000
My, he's dramatic.

482
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,300
Is he dead?

483
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,590
Don't worry.
A tantrum never killed anyone.

484
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,430
Help me, Markl.

485
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,930
Get that hot water running, Markl.

486
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,060
C'mon, you can still walk.

487
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,360
You look after him now, Markl.

488
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,620
Sure.

489
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,200
I'll have to clean all over again.

490
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,980
I'm coming in.

491
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,990
Here's some hot milk.
Drink up.

492
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,950
I'll leave it here.
Drink it while it's hot.

493
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,460
Don't leave me, Sophie.

494
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,140
Try a little milk?

495
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,320
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house.

496
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,070
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port.

497
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,280
The truth is, I'm a coward.

498
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,990
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away.

499
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,830
I'm scared to death.

500
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,830
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

501
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,710
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her.

502
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:38,340
But she terrified me
and I ran away.

503
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,520
Now the king's ordered
me to report to him.

504
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,140
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

505
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,730
How many names do you use, Howl?

506
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,270
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

507
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,860
Can't you refuse the king?

508
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,190
See that...

509
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,910
The oath I took at
the sorcery Academy.

510
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,790
Say, Howl,
why not visit the king?

511
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,500
What!

512
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,710
Just say it to his face.

513
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,670
"Stop this foolish war.
I refuse to help you."

514
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,550
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like.

515
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:25,180
But he's the king, right? A king thinks
only of what's best for his people.

516
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,060
I know!

517
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,440
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

518
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,070
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

519
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,490
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing.

520
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,490
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me.

521
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,870
Madam Suliman?

522
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,000
You're wearing that hat?

523
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,540
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

524
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,620
off I go.

525
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,920
Sure.

526
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,090
See you later!

527
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,720
This charm
assures your safe return.

528
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:10,600
Don't worry, I'll follow you in disguise.

529
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,390
There,
off you go!

530
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,200
I'm sure this will never work.

531
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:35,380
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow.

532
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,590
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise.

533
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,230
Not that...

534
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,620
The Palace is so far away.

535
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,490
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl.

536
00:53:55,290 --> 00:54:00,250
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things.

537
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,670
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

538
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,050
How nice to see you.
The little hatter, right?

539
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,010
The Witch of the Waste!

540
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,180
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl.

541
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,650
How's Howl doing?

542
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,730
Quite terrified.

543
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,110
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady.

544
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,990
My how delightful.

545
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,200
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

546
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,790
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

547
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,000
And yourself?

548
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,290
The king invited me.

549
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:44,000
It seems that idiot, Suliman,
finally needs my power.

550
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,630
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me.

551
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,590
That's impossible.

552
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,720
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them.

553
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,350
See you later, then.

554
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,190
Hey, wait a minute.
Just wait!

555
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,070
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane.

556
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,380
What's wrong with you?

557
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,050
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

558
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,760
Please continue on foot.

559
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,680
That Suliman.

560
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,760
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs.

561
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,150
We'll catch up.
Pay her no mind.

562
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,350
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

563
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,150
You... Hey... Wait

564
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,820
What is it?

565
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,120
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

566
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,950
I told you...

567
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,160
I don't know how.

568
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,290
Then, start studying up.

569
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,130
I don't get it.

570
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,430
Where does she get all that energy?

571
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,560
I have to put you down.

572
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:13,700
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it.

573
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:19,200
It's been 50 years now,
since they drove me out of here...

574
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,330
I've been longing for this day...
Ever since.

575
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,250
Good luck to you, then.

576
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,590
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out.

577
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,760
Come, Howl.

578
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,930
You heartless wench.

579
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,720
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too.

580
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,740
Hurry up!

581
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,790
Madam, follow me.

582
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:07,080
First, you should help her.

583
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,210
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

584
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,510
But the king himself invited her.

585
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,050
Hang in there!

586
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,590
Just a little farther.

587
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,810
And you call yourself a witch?

588
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,890
Who asked you?

589
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,400
You suddenly look older.

590
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,730
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

591
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,740
Pull yourself together.

592
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,280
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

593
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,790
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

594
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:50,040
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar.

595
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,750
Of course it does
That was the name of my hat shop.

596
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,960
It was?

597
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,300
Please wait here.

598
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,890
A chair!

599
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,890
It's mine!

600
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,740
Howl, get back here.

601
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,540
Madam, this way please.

602
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,020
I understand you're Howl's mother.

603
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,020
Yes.
My name is Pendragon.

604
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,030
I'm sure you're weary
Please have a seat.

605
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,690
Yes.

606
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:54,000
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch.

607
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,550
Um, that dog is...

608
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,720
Ah, you mean Heen?

609
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,390
He does my errands.
I asked him to escort you.

610
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,890
Howl won't join us, then?

611
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,440
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses.

612
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,400
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty.

613
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,160
What a shame.

614
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,490
He was my last apprentice...

615
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,660
A student of such marvelous gifts.

616
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,830
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir.

617
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,340
But then, a demon stole his heart,

618
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,630
and he abandoned me.

619
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:49,010
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses.

620
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,680
Pendragon,

621
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,890
That boy is dangerous.

622
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,190
His power is too great
for one with no heart.

623
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:04,610
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste.

624
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,400
Bring her.

625
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,660
What happened?

626
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,750
I just restored her to her real age.

627
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,590
All her powers are gone.

628
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,090
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch.

629
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,300
She made a bargain with a demon

630
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,720
who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago.

631
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:35,680
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

632
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,850
to disreputable wizards and witches.

633
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:41,310
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

634
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,360
I will teach him how to break
with the demon.

635
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,610
If not, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers.

636
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,820
Now just a minute.

637
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,450
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here.

638
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,460
Something's not right.

639
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,880
Forcing your aged guests to climb
stairs, dragging them into strange rooms.

640
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,340
It's like a trap.

641
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,670
You call Howl heartless!

642
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:10,090
Yes, he's selfish, cowardly
and unpredictable.

643
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,390
But he's straight as an arrow,
he only wants to be free.

644
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,560
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

645
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,440
He'll battle the demon on his own.

646
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,400
I believe in him.

647
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,690
Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl.

648
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,570
Howl...
Howl's coming?

649
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,950
I want Howl's heart, I want it.

650
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,700
That's enough from you.
Howl's not coming.

651
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,330
Howl will most certainly come.

652
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,880
Now, I've found his weakness.

653
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,680
Your Majesty.

654
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,390
As you are.

655
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,010
How are you feeling?

656
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,430
Thank you for asking.

657
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:58,930
Meetings bore me.
I flew out for a breather.

658
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,810
How lovely.

659
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,520
These are?

660
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,150
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

661
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,650
I see.

662
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,080
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic.

663
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:20,250
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs.

664
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,920
But they just fall on neighboring towns.

665
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,630
That's how magic works.
Right, Suliman?

666
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,920
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

667
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,630
Suliman!

668
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,560
This is the final battle.
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp!

669
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:43,690
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news.

670
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,110
Thank you kindly.

671
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,650
Have my generals assembled?

672
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,450
It's been awhile, Howl.

673
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,740
Delighted to see you doing so well.

674
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,990
I saw right through you.

675
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:00,950
I've kept my oath.

676
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,830
I've no wish to fight you.

677
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,500
I'll take my mother.

678
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,460
I won't let you go.

679
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,070
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged below.

680
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,530
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are.

681
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,590
Howl, don't! It's a trap!

682
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,930
Hold tight.

683
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:55,440
Sophie, sit up front.

684
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:01,120
Oh, no, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along.

685
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,740
Nice doggie.

686
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,410
You're just Suliman's spy.

687
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,250
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

688
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,880
Sophie, you steer.

689
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,420
What! I can't possibly!

690
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,050
They're after us.

691
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:24,350
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes.

692
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,270
What! That's impossible!

693
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:29,480
Don't worry, the ring will guide you.

694
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,860
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

695
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,520
Summon Calcifer?

696
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,990
It's glowing.

697
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,370
Follow the light.
You'll be there by nightfall.

698
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:45,990
Why send me to Suliman,
if you were coming yourself?

699
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:48,540
Your presence gave me
the courage for it.

700
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,120
She's too terrible to
face on my own.

701
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,710
You've saved me.
I was in grave danger back there.

702
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,260
Don't let go!

703
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,560
You're good.
Stop joking!

704
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,730
We've got a lead now.

705
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,900
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
now's your chance.

706
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,900
Howl!

707
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,000
No, thank you.

708
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,920
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages.

709
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:41,340
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

710
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,430
His mother's awfully young.

711
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,560
We're not far.
That's my hometown.

712
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:44,400
Don't look so friendly.
I don't trust you.

713
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,430
The castle.
They've come to meet us.

714
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,400
Sophie!

715
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,400
Markl, help!

716
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,440
I don't know how to stop this thing!

717
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,290
Sophie!

718
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,710
Doggie.

719
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,710
Markl.

720
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm home.

721
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,260
Sophie, are you hurt?

722
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,340
You're home!

723
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:50,390
Thank you for coming to meet us.

724
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:23,540
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

725
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,230
I wonder if Howl's back.

726
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,910
Howl?

727
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,140
Howl? Is it you?

728
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,520
Are you hurt? In pain?

729
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,530
Stay away!

730
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,740
I want to help you.

731
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,860
I want to break the spell you're under.

732
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,370
You can't even break your own spell.

733
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,870
But I love you!

734
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,080
Too late.

735
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,500
Howl!

736
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,270
Howl must be back.

737
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:30,900
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick.

738
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:33,480
We're both running out of time.

739
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:36,400
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

740
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,120
I can't tell you that.
I'm a demon.

741
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,200
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

742
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,330
Howl has given you
something very precious.

743
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,330
What is it?
Where is it?

744
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,250
That's confidential information.

745
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,920
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

746
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,760
How dare you!
Howl will die with me.

747
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:19,160
Good morning, Turnip.

748
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,410
We've got to be brave.

749
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:26,660
Ready, Sophie!

750
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,170
Okay! Open wider, Calcifer.

751
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,380
Here goes! Push!

752
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,130
Heave!

753
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:48,730
I... said... move!

754
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,310
Come on!

755
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,050
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap.

756
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,630
It's time to eat!

757
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,600
Here, old girl.

758
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:32,650
But, Sophie,
she's the Witch of the Waste.

759
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,270
No need to worry.

760
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,520
Why's she staring at me?

761
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,110
Such a pretty fire.

762
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,950
Howl.

763
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,160
Hello, everyone.

764
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,280
Welcome home.

765
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,580
Master Howl,
can we keep this puppy?

766
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:51,120
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog.

767
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,580
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

768
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,840
Don't look at me!
They blew in with Sophie.

769
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,510
Sophie, always dramatic...

770
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,470
So you're Turnip.

771
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,020
You're under quite a spell, too.

772
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,100
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

773
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,440
He's so handsome.

774
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,110
This is a busy day.
We're moving.

775
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,280
Moving?

776
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,610
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere.

777
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,490
Madam Suliman can track us down
here in no time.

778
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,870
But you'll have to stay behind.
The magic in your spell's too risky.

779
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,550
All right, That's done.

780
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,380
Take it away, Calcifer.

781
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:58,980
Excellent.

782
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,690
Stay right where you are.

783
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,070
Be gentle...

784
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:10,740
Here goes.

785
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
We've moved.
You can get up now.

786
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,460
Amazing, Master.
It's so grand.

787
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,670
What a pretty fire.

788
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,190
This is...

789
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,820
I added a bathroom
For our growing family.

790
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,610
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

791
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,490
I added a bedroom, too.
Go in.

792
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,710
This is... why?

793
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,130
I thought it would suit you.
Do you like it?

794
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,930
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper.

795
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,020
I got you new clothes, too.
Open them later.

796
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,600
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

797
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,900
A courtyard!

798
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,520
There's a shop, too.

799
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,860
Let's go, Heen!

800
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,740
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit.

801
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,870
My gift to you, Sophie.
Step outside.

802
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,190
It's my secret garden.

803
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,360
Beautiful.

804
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,950
Did you make it with your magic?

805
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,160
Only a little, to help the flowers.

806
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,790
Thank you, Howl!

807
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,420
It's like I'm dreaming.

808
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,610
Sophie.

809
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:38,530
How mysterious.
I feel I've been here before.

810
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,620
I could cry with happiness.

811
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,080
Come.

812
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,510
Look.

813
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,470
A sweet little house.

814
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,510
My favorite hideaway.

815
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,810
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone.

816
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,810
Alone?

817
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:12,110
My Uncle, the Wizard,
left it to me in secret.

818
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,900
Make yourself at home there, Sophie.

819
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,780
What's wrong?

820
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,490
I'm scared.

821
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,660
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside.

822
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,630
Howl, tell me the truth.

823
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,670
I don't mind if you're a monster.

824
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,930
I want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably.

825
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,440
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

826
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,060
You'd be good at it, Sophie.

827
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,400
And then, you'd go away?

828
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:56,280
I want to help you, Howl.

829
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:00,450
I'm not beautiful.
and I'm only good at cleaning...

830
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:03,490
Sophie, you are beautiful.

831
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:11,250
The good thing about being old
is that you've got so little to lose...

832
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,730
Why's that flying here?

833
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:27,690
A battleship?

834
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:29,350
On its way to burn cities and people.

835
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:30,980
The enemy's? Ours?

836
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,110
What difference does it make?

837
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,910
Murderers!

838
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:57,210
Look at all those bombs!

839
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,480
It stopped.

840
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,150
Did you do that?

841
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,900
I'm just tinkering.
It won't crash.

842
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,280
Howl!

843
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,040
Oops, looks like they're onto us.

844
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,760
Madam Suliman's deputies.
Let's go back.

845
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,130
Run! Move those legs.

846
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,520
Hurry on in!

847
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,530
No! Don't let go!

848
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,580
What happened, Sophie?

849
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,500
I've had it with this place!

850
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,220
Good night, Sophie.

851
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,640
Good night.

852
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:32,180
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end.

853
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:34,650
Thank you, Markl.

854
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,940
Need the toilet?

855
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,400
I'm fine.

856
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,230
Good night.

857
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:40,780
You're in love.

858
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:47,030
Sighing away like that.

859
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,500
I thought so.

860
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:03,050
Were you ever in love?

861
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:06,090
Of course I was.
I'm still in love.

862
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:07,260
What?

863
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:10,890
Men, why ever should we want them...

864
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:13,270
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

865
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,270
Unbelievable.

866
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,270
And so adorable, too.

867
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,110
What is that?

868
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,570
Air raid siren.

869
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,490
Air raid?

870
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,990
It's not for here.
But best not go out tonight.

871
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:38,080
Suliman's creatures are searching
high and low for our house.

872
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:45,090
What a good fire,
hiding us so well.

873
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,790
Sophie, a stranger got in!

874
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,390
Mother.

875
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,810
Sophie!

876
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:39,100
Where have you been!
I searched for you everywhere!

877
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,110
But, oh, look how you've aged!

878
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,730
It's all my fault.

879
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,110
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

880
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,240
Mother...

881
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:55,990
I barely recognize the house.

882
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:57,870
Who is that?

883
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:00,040
Oh, your landlady.

884
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,380
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

885
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,460
He's such a wonderful man.
And he's rich, too!

886
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:08,220
We can all live together again.

887
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,970
You'll never have to clean again.

888
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:14,680
But I'm happy here...

889
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,310
Really?

890
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,470
Oops, I forgot.

891
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:20,350
My car's waiting.
I've got to run.

892
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:28,110
I'm so glad I found you again.

893
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:30,280
We'll really catch up next time.

894
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,660
In the meantime, you take care.

895
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,370
A peeping-bug, eh?
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

896
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:44,080
All yours, Cal.

897
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,930
May you find happiness, Mother.

898
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:58,720
Thank you.
You too, Sophie.

899
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,900
I've done what I was told.
Take me back to my husband.

900
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,980
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased.

901
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:12,990
Forgive me, Sophie...

902
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,450
Look at all these people.

903
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:22,370
They're all running away.
The town will be empty.

904
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:24,750
Do you wish to run, too?

905
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:27,960
That's what that lady spoke of...

906
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:31,720
So, she did.
I'm glad we made up.

907
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,970
Don't go, Sophie!

908
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,260
I love you, Sophie.
Please stay.

909
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:42,520
I love you, too, Markl.
Don't worry, I won't go.

910
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,980
Really!

911
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,480
Are we a family?

912
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,480
Yes, we're family.

913
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:50,440
Oh, good!

914
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:01,330
I'll never let Suliman
get a hold of Howl.

915
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,430
But the paper says we won.

916
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:23,390
Only fools swallow such lies.

917
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:28,060
How strange,
I can't get Calcifer going.

918
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,520
Grandma, will you stop that?

919
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,230
Such an awful stink.

920
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:35,360
Why deny an old lady her pleasures.

921
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,860
Open the window, Markl.

922
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:44,040
I wouldn't open that now...

923
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:50,340
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly keep them out.

924
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,460
Markl!

925
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,560
Close it quick!

926
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,690
Look after Grandma, Markl.
I'll check on the shop.

927
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:37,670
How dare you? If you've
energy to spare, put out the fires.

928
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,950
Howl!

929
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,130
Dramatic as usual...

930
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,310
Howl!

931
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,860
I'm sorry.
I had too many enemies tonight.

932
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:40,530
Howl, oh, Howl.

933
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,550
Master Howl!
Sophie!

934
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:05,260
Calcifer, be strong.

935
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:14,230
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

936
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,650
That granny fed me something nasty.

937
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,650
Why, if it isn't Howl.

938
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:24,910
I feel we need a nice long chat.

939
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:29,290
Likewise, Madam.
But we've no time now.

940
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:34,040
How unlike you.
You're not running away.

941
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,830
Until later, then.

942
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:39,840
Stay here, Sophie.
Calcifer will protect you.

943
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
I'll see to things outside.

944
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,800
Wait, Howl!

945
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,550
Don't go! Please stay.

946
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:51,430
Another round of bombs is coming.
Even Calcifer can't stop those.

947
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,770
Let's run away.
Don't fight.

948
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,770
I'm through running away.

949
01:33:57,230 --> 01:34:00,530
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

950
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:01,820
You.

951
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:07,620
Howl!

952
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,660
That's our town.

953
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,420
There's Howl.

954
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,880
Howl!

955
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,730
Sophie!
Turnip...

956
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,280
Markl, come inside!

957
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,490
Move? You're nuts.
There's nothing there.

958
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:13,990
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting.

959
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,990
He's better off a coward.

960
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:17,700
Grandma, get up.

961
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,370
Going for a stroll?

962
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,750
Suliman will find us right away.

963
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:25,380
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive.

964
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,800
Sophie!

965
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,260
The castle's falling apart.

966
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,510
That's all right
Markl, take Grandma.

967
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:31,630
Sure.

968
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,390
You, too, hop up now.

969
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,390
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace.

970
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,400
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you.

971
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,310
Watch it!

972
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,730
Cut it out! Cut it out!

973
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:49,900
If I leave, the house will collapse.

974
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:50,900
Fine!

975
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,160
We're out.

976
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,410
I'd better go last.

977
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:02,750
Even I don't know what'll happen...

978
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,780
I told you, it would collapse.

979
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,240
Rain!

980
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,410
Is that heading for town?

981
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:41,120
Look after Grandma, Markl.

982
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,160
Turnip, find us a way in.

983
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,580
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll take care of you.

984
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,710
Markl, we can get in here.

985
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:04,100
The roof's leaking.
I'll go out.

986
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,900
Wait here.

987
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,360
It's wet, here...

988
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,410
Hurry.

989
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:19,200
Too damp.

990
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,620
Bring Grandma here, Markl

991
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:26,790
The castle's empty.

992
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,670
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

993
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:35,510
Calcifer, please.
You're my last hope.

994
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:38,890
I want to go to Howl.
Move the castle.

995
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:43,600
I know you can do it.
You're so strong.

996
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:47,310
But there's no chimney here...

997
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,980
And the wood's damp...

998
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:53,940
As the saying goes, "The best
blaze brightest in adversity."

999
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,820
I've heard that, but...

1000
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:58,110
You really think so?

1001
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:00,160
You're so pretty, Cal.

1002
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,530
Sit here, Grandma.

1003
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,660
Then, give me something of yours,
Sophie.

1004
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,790
Of mine?

1005
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:08,420
I can't do it alone.
How about your eyes?

1006
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,710
My eyes?

1007
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:11,290
This?

1008
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,490
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

1009
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:22,820
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart.

1010
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,950
Heart! You have a heart?

1011
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,460
Oh, my!

1012
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,350
There's Howl.
He's trapped.

1013
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,440
Hurry, Calcifer!

1014
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,560
Don't!

1015
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:56,360
Grandma!

1016
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:58,230
Stop it!

1017
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,070
Howl's heart!

1018
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,450
Cut it out!

1019
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,130
Grandma!

1020
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,210
It's hot, hot!

1021
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,010
Let go!

1022
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,010
You'll die, Grandma.

1023
01:41:22,010 --> 01:41:24,300
No, it's mine!

1024
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,110
Sophie!

1025
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,080
Sophie!

1026
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:53,120
She's so mean.
That's mine.

1027
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:40,040
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done.
I poured water on Calcifer.

1028
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,880
What if I've killed Howl, too...

1029
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:15,120
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

1030
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,120
Show me where he is.

1031
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:40,440
The castle door...

1032
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,730
Heen...

1033
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:36,220
Howl...

1034
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,450
This must be Howl's childhood...

1035
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,360
Howl!
Calcifer!

1036
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:23,950
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you.

1037
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:27,460
Wait for me in the future!

1038
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:03,490
I'll walk there.
Heen, I'll walk.

1039
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:05,490
I can't stop crying.

1040
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:31,310
Howl.

1041
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:40,740
I'm sorry I took so long.

1042
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,700
You've been waiting all this time.

1043
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,920
Take me to Calcifer.

1044
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:54,850
Is he dead?

1045
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,810
No, He's fine.

1046
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:02,530
Grandma...

1047
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:06,320
Don't look at me.
I don't have anything.

1048
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:07,700
Please.

1049
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:11,580
Grandma.

1050
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,880
You want it that badly?

1051
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,170
Yes.

1052
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:23,130
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it.

1053
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:25,010
There.

1054
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:28,550
Thank you, Grandma.

1055
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:46,030
Calcifer.

1056
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,950
Sophie...
I'm all worn out.

1057
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:53,450
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1058
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:56,120
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.

1059
01:50:56,670 --> 01:51:01,050
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me.

1060
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:02,670
I'd better try, then.

1061
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,300
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird.

1062
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,640
It's still only a child's heart.

1063
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:15,600
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1064
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:18,810
and may Howl recover his heart...

1065
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,580
I'm alive!

1066
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:33,330
I'm free!

1067
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:41,790
He moved, He's alive!

1068
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:48,090
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1069
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:03,940
Turnip!

1070
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:18,410
Turnip, are you okay?

1071
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,500
I'll get you a new stick, right away.

1072
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,130
Thank you, Turnip.

1073
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:34,680
Thank you, Sophie.

1074
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,980
I'm a prince from the next kingdom.

1075
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,310
A cruel spell turned me
into a scarecrow.

1076
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:43,770
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break.

1077
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:48,570
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
I would have died.

1078
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:51,200
My, you're good-looking.

1079
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,030
What a racket.
What's the fuss?

1080
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,330
I feel terrible.
Like I'm trapped under a stone.

1081
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:00,410
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden.

1082
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:03,960
Oh, Sophie, your hair is
just like starlight.

1083
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,460
It's so beautiful.

1084
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:07,920
I love you, Howl!
How wonderful.

1085
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:12,800
So, now you see how Sophie feels.

1086
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,720
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war.

1087
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,350
That's exactly what I shall do.

1088
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:21,980
When the war is over, I shall return.

1089
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,610
"A fickle heart is the only constant
in this world."

1090
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:27,440
My, you have a way with words.

1091
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:30,030
I'll wait for your return, then.

1092
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:40,410
Why should you contact me now?

1093
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:42,540
What on earth have you been up to?

1094
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:48,050
A happy ending, I see.

1095
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:49,880
You two-timer.

1096
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,600
Well, there it is.

1097
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:02,480
Bring the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Defense.

1098
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:06,730
Let's put an end to this foolish war.

1099
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,150
It's Calcifer!

1100
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:12,280
You didn't have to come back.

1101
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:18,410
I really missed you all.
Besides, it looks like rain...

1102
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,580
Thank you, Calcifer.
