1
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,939
<i>Only in silence the word,
only in dark the light,</i>

2
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>only in dying life:</i>

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,946
<i>bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.</i>

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,283
THE CREATION OF EA

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,135
Ease the sail!

6
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,140
It's blowing too hard!

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,396
Curse it! A storm this time of year?
Where's my weatherworker?

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,985
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waves before we sink!

9
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,030
What's wrong?

10
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:16,117
Captain... I can't remember them.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,496
I can't remember the true names
of wind and waves.

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,249
What? Are you mad?

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,459
Captain!

14
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,878
There's something above the clouds!

15
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,757
Where?

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,385
What is that?

17
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,538
A dragon! What is it doing here?

18
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,039
There's another one!

19
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,991
Dragons fighting? That's impossible!

20
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,980
More than 2,000 sheep
have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

21
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,983
Half of them have died.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,736
Seven hundred cattle have been infected.

23
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,988
We've lost 50 head so far.

24
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:22,994
In fact, a baby on Taon
has also come down with the fever.

25
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,247
Silence!

26
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,002
If we panic,
what will become of the People?

27
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,254
Seal off the affected areas.

28
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,508
Send every healer
in the kingdom to find a cure.

29
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,929
Send provisions to those who need them.

30
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,557
Wizard Root! Find out what's behind this.

31
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,142
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,483
And the drought in the provinces?

33
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,945
We sent weatherworkers
but the results were disappointing.

34
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,075
Soon it may be too late
for the spring planting.

35
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,537
Why have these misfortunes
befallen us, Root?

36
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,457
I sense the Light dimming, Your Majesty.

37
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,959
The Light?

38
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,879
The Light of the Balance
that sustains the world.

39
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,130
Your Majesty!

40
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,632
What now?

41
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,467
Terrible news!

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,512
Dragons have been sighted off the coast!

43
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,516
- Dragons?
- Two, Majesty. One was killed.

44
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:32,730
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?

45
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,318
Long ago, dragons and men were one.

46
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,532
But men who coveted possessions
chose the land and the sea.

47
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,452
Dragons who wanted freedom
chose wind and fire.

48
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,623
Since then, dragons and men
remained apart.

49
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,211
To hear that dragons have been seen,
and were even fighting...

50
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,382
The twilight that threatens
us is ever deepening.

51
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,307
Bring the captain to me.
I would hear more of this.

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,601
Root, I want you there too.

53
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,441
Please... Your Majesty!

54
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,651
- We'll get in trouble!
- I have to!

55
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,113
- What is it?
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

56
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,366
He's been gone since last night.

57
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,118
Prince Arren? Gone?

58
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,369
That's enough.

59
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,920
His Majesty is occupied.

60
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,339
Surely you can see that.

61
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,050
Forgive me.

62
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,511
It's just... He seems so sad lately.
We were worried.

63
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:50,516
That's absurd! Arren is 17, not a child.

64
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,270
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,356
Your people are more important.

66
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,109
- Very well, then.
- Your Majesty.

67
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,406
I must tend to my correspondence.

68
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,784
We await your command, sire.

69
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,968
I'm imagining things.

70
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,538
Arren!

71
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,631
So you are my death...

72
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,857
Are you hurt?

73
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,869
Steady there, lad!

74
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,270
Is this what you seek?

75
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,401
This is dangerous country for travelers.

76
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,281
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.

77
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,202
It's not much, but you're welcome to it.

78
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,500
What is your name, lad?

79
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,047
My name is Arren.

80
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,259
Arren, is it? It means sword, doesn't it?

81
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,307
So you hail from Enlad.

82
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,267
How did you know?

83
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,314
That blade was forged with magic.

84
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,318
I doubt you could unsheathe it.

85
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,995
What is it?

86
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,500
It's nothing.

87
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,888
Arren?

88
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,517
If you have nowhere to go,
why not come with me?

89
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,272
I doubt our meeting here was an accident.

90
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,067
And I'd welcome a companion on the road.

91
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,659
Arren! Are you coming?

92
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,664
What should I call you?

93
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,667
Call me Sparrowhawk.

94
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,532
Another abandoned farm.
Farmers leaving their land...

95
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,326
There's more to this than poor harvests.

96
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,497
Come, Arren. We'd better push on.

97
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,502
Lord Sparrowhawk?

98
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,380
Sparrowhawk will do. What is it?

99
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,549
Sparrowhawk?

100
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,884
Where are we heading?

101
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,889
First, we go to the next town.
But after that...

102
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,892
even I don't know.

103
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,328
- Getting tired?
- No.

104
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,330
Come along. We're almost there.

105
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,353
There it is.

106
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,107
Hort Town.

107
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,677
Are they prisoners?

108
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,428
They are slaves.

109
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,223
Here, people are goods to buy and sell.

110
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,558
Trading in human lives!

111
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,104
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do I hear two guineas?

112
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,772
I have two guineas!

113
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,901
Three! Sold to the gentleman
for three guineas!

114
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,997
No, sorry! Couldn't possibly find room!

115
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,268
Gauzes from Sowl! Silks from Lorbanery!

116
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,437
Furs and felts and woolens!

117
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,815
Is this a market day?

118
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,942
No. It's like this year round.

119
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,446
Silks and satins! Canvas and fleecefells!

120
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,615
What can I show you?

121
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,994
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

122
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,413
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

123
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,418
I don't have a wife.
I need a cloak for my friend.

124
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,504
Wizards! No girlfriend, eh?

125
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,382
But I don't need a cloak.

126
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,552
You can't go about like that.

127
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,764
You should hide that thing on your belt.

128
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,973
What about this?

129
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,101
Fleece from Gont. Highest quality.

130
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,106
Four warp strings. This is Andradean work.

131
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,401
On Gont they use six or more.

132
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,157
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?

133
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,911
People don't believe
in foolish tricks any more.

134
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,914
My goods are not what I claim.

135
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,167
But at least they're real...

136
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,796
not mere lies and air
like magic and sorcery!

137
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,218
Sparrowhawk!

138
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,179
Thank you!

139
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,715
What!

140
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,343
Unhand me!

141
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,763
Calm yourself, young master.

142
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,019
I have something for you.
It's the door to bliss.

143
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,437
What is it?

144
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,108
Hazia, my lord. Ha-zi-a.

145
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,443
Take one. Leave sorrow and fear behind.

146
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,904
No more sorrow or fear...

147
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,451
You'll never be troubled
with the pain of this world again.

148
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,330
You needn't pay me. It's my pleasure.

149
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,293
Arren.

150
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,712
What are you doing?

151
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,423
Is this your friend, my lord?

152
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,429
And what about you?
Don't wizards have troubles too?

153
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,933
I'm sorry. I have no use
for what you're selling.

154
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,563
Save us from the arrogance of sorcerers!

155
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,275
I suppose you've lost your powers too!

156
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,698
Hazia is not something
to toy with, Arren. Look!

157
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,161
The hazia eater feels himself in paradise.

158
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:09,249
Then the spirit leaves the body
and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

159
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,463
When it returns? More hazia.
And finally, death.

160
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,715
What's the matter?

161
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,562
Feeling better?

162
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,572
The wind is fresh up here.

163
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,783
Something's wrong with this town.

164
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,702
Not only this town, lad.

165
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,582
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

166
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,710
Even people's minds have lost their way.

167
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,214
Is it some sort of pestilence?

168
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:02,219
No. A pestilence
is how the Balance restores itself.

169
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,223
But this? I fear someone
is trying to destroy the Balance.

170
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,103
There's only one creature
in Earthsea capable of such evil.

171
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,437
Only one.

172
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,569
Well then. Shall we go back to the inn?

173
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,072
I'd like to rest a little longer.

174
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,532
Very well.

175
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,120
I'll be waiting. Keep your wits about you.

176
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,038
I will.

177
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,536
Slave takers?

178
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,722
Look at this little witch.

179
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,058
And an ugly one at that!

180
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,523
Won't fetch much with that face.

181
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,736
Just a few guineas.
But we can still have a little fun.

182
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,365
Oww! My finger!

183
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,243
There's a feisty witch!

184
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,328
I'm going to enjoy this.

185
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,371
Who's there?

186
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,998
Step forward and show yourself!

187
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,006
Well, well.

188
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,510
What are you doing here, boy?

189
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,428
Go ahead. Take him!

190
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,060
No hard feelings, boy.
Just following the boss's orders.

191
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,188
I'll make it quick.

192
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,277
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

193
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,946
Beg for your life!

194
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,286
Changed your mind?

195
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,330
Life is nothing to me.

196
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,293
So you want a fight, eh?

197
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,342
Draw your sword!

198
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,645
All right. Now it's my turn.

199
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,411
Uh oh.

200
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,589
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?

201
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,926
Do it.

202
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,308
If you want her so much, here she is!

203
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,562
Come on men! Let's go!

204
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,153
Are you...

205
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,828
Therru!

206
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,873
Therru!

207
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,092
Therru...

208
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,538
A bird...

209
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,683
So! We meet again, boy.

210
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,980
Take him!

211
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,612
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.

212
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,786
Take him away!

213
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,042
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't give it away!

214
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,505
Give it up, it's no use.

215
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,423
Quiet!

216
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
Silence! Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

217
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,707
Come on!

218
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,667
Get moving!

219
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,295
What's going on?

220
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,715
I don't know. Move, you lazy animals!

221
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,176
Confound it! What's wrong?

222
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,791
Sparrowhawk...

223
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,337
Let's go, Arren.

224
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,845
Can you stand?

225
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,399
What about the others?

226
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,945
I left none bound. Now it's up to them.

227
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,298
How did you know where to find me?

228
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,053
When you didn't come, I scoured Hort Town.

229
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,724
Finally, someone told me
a young man was taken by slavers.

230
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,062
I had to make a spell of finding.

231
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,567
I am sorry, I was foolish.

232
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,903
No, it was my fault.

233
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,698
I should've been more careful.

234
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,826
I'm sorry.

235
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,265
Who's there?

236
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,643
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

237
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,019
Sparrowhawk?

238
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,562
Someone's been hurt.

239
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,697
I'm sorry. It's late.

240
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,701
It's been a long time, Ged.

241
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,047
He's asleep.

242
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,427
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

243
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,639
It's his now. Here, this will warm you up.

244
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,932
Thanks.

245
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,567
You haven't changed.

246
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,697
No. Are you keeping well, Tenar?

247
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,617
I suppose. It hasn't always been easy.

248
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,702
And you?

249
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,912
Do you still wander about?

250
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,206
That was good.

251
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,709
It has been a long time.

252
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,793
Yes, it has.

253
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,673
As Archmage, I have no time...

254
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,509
to wander about as I once did.

255
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,972
And what brings the Archmage
so far from home?

256
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,436
Evil tidings come
from every corner of Earthsea.

257
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,230
Things are out of balance...

258
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,985
as if the sun's light were ebbing away.

259
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,989
Is the Art Magic ebbing away too?

260
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,494
Yes. As if our very blood
were flowing out of our veins.

261
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,039
So you're searching for the answer?

262
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,165
Yes.

263
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,086
Oh dear, we woke you up.

264
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:15,219
Come, child. Don't worry.
This man is an old friend of mine.

265
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,394
This is Therru.
She's been with me five years.

266
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:29,233
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

267
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,072
Hawk?

268
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:43,081
Well, you should be honored.
Therru never speaks to strangers.

269
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,374
What is it?

270
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,797
Could she really be...

271
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,066
Lord Cob.

272
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,109
Enter.

273
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,659
Forgive my intrusion.
I beg leave to speak.

274
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,786
What is it?

275
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,789
I'm afraid some of our slaves escaped.

276
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,794
I see. You let my precious merchandise go.

277
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,590
No. We've captured most of them.

278
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,799
And?

279
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,803
What about the others?

280
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,807
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.

281
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,811
You're a fool.

282
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,857
Do you think I can't manage without you?

283
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,366
It was a wizard!
A wizard with a scar on his face!

284
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,868
What?

285
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,371
A scar on his face?

286
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,169
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Archmage pays me a visit.

287
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,131
Find him for me, Hare... or else.

288
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,675
I won't fail you, my lord.

289
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,019
I've waited long
for this day... Sparrowhawk.

290
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,766
Tenar! I brought the water in!

291
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,476
Where is she?

292
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,229
Tenar? Are you still asleep?

293
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,731
Tenar?

294
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,276
Are you sick?

295
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,866
Who was that?

296
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,996
It's that girl!

297
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:18,170
That must've been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear. I should've told you.

298
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,590
Don't worry. Arren is with me.

299
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,676
You have nothing to fear.

300
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,680
Sometimes his eyes are wild,
but he has a good heart.

301
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,020
Good morning.

302
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,439
Good morning.

303
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,817
I'm done eating!

304
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,860
Well!

305
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,197
Did you sleep well? How do you feel?

306
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,409
I'm all right.

307
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,454
I didn't do anything to her.

308
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,665
Of course you didn't. Come have breakfast.

309
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,001
Can't work if you don't eat.

310
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,627
Work?

311
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,080
Ouch...

312
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,582
Are you getting blisters?

313
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,501
Yes.

314
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,669
Shall we rest a bit?

315
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,594
What a good smell.

316
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,471
- But...
- Yes, lad?

317
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,681
You're a wizard, aren't you?

318
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,100
Oh, I see.

319
00:39:54,892 --> 00:40:00,272
You want to know why a wizard
toils in the field like a farmer?

320
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,315
Yes.

321
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,068
Listen, Arren.

322
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:08,823
Everything under the sun
and stars depends on the Balance.

323
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,953
The wind and seas.
The power of earth and light.

324
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,497
All that these do is well

325
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,043
and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

326
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:26,382
But now, men hold
the power to control the world.

327
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,969
So Man must learn to keep the Balance...

328
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:34,849
and do what leaf and whale
and wind do of their own nature.

329
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,853
You know everything has its true name.

330
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:44,775
Magic is the power to command,
if you know a thing's true name.

331
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:49,989
Use that power in ignorance
and the Balance is easily damaged.

332
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,075
Spells should be made only of necessity.

333
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,994
You've been busy.

334
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,873
I suppose you two deserve some lunch.

335
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,919
Are you feeling better, Arren?

336
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,674
Now eat hearty,
or you won't get your strength back.

337
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,218
What about the girl?

338
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,137
Oh, Therru?

339
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,474
One of the spring lambs is sick.

340
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,934
She's nursing it today.

341
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,814
Shall we change places?

342
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,441
No, I can manage.

343
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,955
- How did it go?
- That's it for today.

344
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,459
Dinner will be ready soon. Better wash up.

345
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,049
- I'll take the ox to the stable.
- Thanks, lad.

346
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:08,025
There, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.

347
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,280
That's it.

348
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,538
Good girl.

349
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,004
What do you want?

350
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,632
Oh... Nothing.

351
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,592
Why did you come here?

352
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,012
To hurt me? To kill this little one?

353
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,015
You don't understand! I was just...

354
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,812
Stay away! Get out of here!

355
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,816
I hate anyone who doesn't value life!

356
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,737
I'm sorry.

357
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,286
Step aside!

358
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,502
Let's eat.

359
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,674
It's so good having men
to help on the farm.

360
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,968
Even you two.

361
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:20,055
I'm no good with a plow,
but I do know animals.

362
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,392
You used to be a goatherd.

363
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,647
What's wrong, Arren? Aren't you hungry?

364
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,192
No.

365
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,444
What is this place?

366
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,799
Come, Arren. This way.

367
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,258
Sparrowhawk?

368
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,438
Come. Take my hand.

369
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,986
Arren!

370
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,615
No! Leave me alone! Stop!

371
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,828
Arren!

372
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,842
Arren! Wake up!

373
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,218
Arren!

374
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,518
What's wrong?

375
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,146
A bad dream, I think.

376
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,689
A dream...

377
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,203
Spring is very short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.

378
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:52,708
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I have an errand that cannot wait.

379
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,711
I still can't rely on you.

380
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,713
Come now, Tenar.

381
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,717
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

382
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,847
He's better off without it.
Tell him I borrowed it.

383
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,226
Tenar. Keep a close eye on him for me.

384
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,229
I promise.

385
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,066
I'll be back tonight!
And back at work tomorrow!

386
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,861
I certainly hope so.

387
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,092
Haven't seen him around here.

388
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,303
And that scar!

389
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,847
He must've come from that woman's house.

390
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,726
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.

391
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,981
Yes, she's an odd one.
And that little girl she keeps!

392
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,985
That child will bring bad luck on us all.

393
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,780
No! Don't say that out loud!

394
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,370
Who was that?

395
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,622
He's not from around here.

396
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,499
He's a friend of ours.

397
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,543
He's helping us out.

398
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,169
Is that so?

399
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,796
Can I help you?

400
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:25,509
My child has a fever, ma'am.
I need that potion again.

401
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,053
All right. Just wait there.

402
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,225
Quit sticking to me!

403
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,102
I'm afraid!

404
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,523
Spare us from evil!

405
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,941
That's enough!

406
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,904
There. If the child doesn't get better,
come see me again.

407
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,532
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

408
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,909
Actually, I was wondering...

409
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,038
Yes, I know. Pay me when you can.

410
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,041
Thanks ma'am. You're very kind.

411
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:01,920
Hope she feels better!

412
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,049
I wish there were
more decent people in the world.

413
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,552
Therru never hurt anyone.

414
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,932
Well, at least the woman
looks after her own.

415
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:20,522
As for Therru, her parents
abused and abandoned her.

416
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:25,444
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.

417
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,862
What a frightful child!

418
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,490
My goodness! Did you see her eyes?

419
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,498
Please, have mercy!

420
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,501
No one will buy an old woman!

421
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,632
Nothing to fear ladies.
Maybe you can even help me.

422
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,345
Seen any strangers around here?
I'd be much obliged for any help.

423
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,597
And I'll pay.

424
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,227
There's one at Tenar's farm!

425
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,979
And one with a scar on his face!

426
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,148
Tenar? Who's that?

427
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,859
The witch! She lives right up this road.

428
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,404
Thanks for the help, old hags!

429
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,451
Wait! Where are you going?

430
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,496
Stop! Liar!

431
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,040
You promised to pay!

432
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,379
There it is! That's it!

433
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,721
What's that?

434
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,271
What are you doing?

435
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,693
You're looking fit, boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.

436
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,404
Swine! What are you doing here?

437
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:37,576
Now, now. I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?

438
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,079
He's gone! Sparrowhawk's not here.

439
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,332
You'd better not be hiding him.

440
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,668
Why should I?

441
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,337
You're no match for him.

442
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,760
Looks like she's telling the truth.
All right, we'll be back!

443
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,262
Till then!

444
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,520
Never come back, you swine!

445
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,566
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

446
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,249
So that's what happened.

447
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,127
Neither of you said a word about it.

448
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,299
I think we fixed most of it.

449
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,634
Let's rebuild the fence.

450
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:43,475
Tenar? Have you known
Sparrowhawk for a long time?

451
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,062
Yes, I guess I have. A long, long time.

452
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,441
He's always been a wanderer.

453
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:57,531
It's the life he chose.
He does it because he has to.

454
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:02,661
And finally he became Archmage,
the greatest of all wizards.

455
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,455
Head of the Great House of Roke?

456
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,543
Yes. But years before that, he rescued me.

457
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,549
Rescued me, and led me into the light.

458
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,682
One man, all alone.

459
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:29,604
He brought me out of the Tombs of Atuan.

460
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,625
Welcome.

461
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,088
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?

462
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:57,048
Show me that sword.

463
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,471
Can't recommend this one.

464
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,182
Very unusual workmanship, so I bought it.

465
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,519
But it's rusted solid. Can't be drawn.

466
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,488
You there, wizard!

467
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,909
Are you deaf? I'm talking to you!

468
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,661
You said something, sir?

469
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,000
Is there something stuck to my face?

470
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,586
Wrong wizard!

471
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,757
You! If you see a wizard
with a scar on his face,

472
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,843
tell him Lord Cob wants to see him!

473
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:46,598
Cob? Never heard that name
back where I come from.

474
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,143
You will, when he's Lord of the Two Lands!

475
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,811
Don't forget it!

476
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,730
Yes sir.

477
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,110
I'll take the sword. How much?

478
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,614
Wait a minute... Your face!

479
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,199
What's wrong?

480
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,368
Nothing... I suppose.

481
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,871
Have you heard of this wizard named Cob?

482
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,916
Careful! Keep your voice down.

483
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:18,254
Only wizard in these parts
who still has his powers.

484
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,384
Can't say he's loved
by people around here.

485
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:26,596
He lives in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.

486
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,145
I never thought I'd find you here, Cob.

487
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:46,074
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.

488
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,742
Thank you.

489
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,205
Won't you stay on for a while and help?

490
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,207
Therru would like that too.

491
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,125
But...

492
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,212
You don't have to decide now.
Think about it, all right?

493
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,130
All right.

494
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,966
Stable the ox for me.

495
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,050
Yes.

496
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,472
I'm home!

497
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:14,436
Therru? Now where is she?

498
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:24,696
Arren! I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.

499
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,824
Tell her to come home before dark.

500
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,784
I will.

501
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,219
Therru?

502
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,517
Therru...

503
00:55:54,601 --> 00:56:00,732
<i>Far, far above the clouds
Against the setting sun</i>

504
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:07,947
<i>A falcon flies alone
Soaring in the wind</i>

505
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:15,330
<i>I hear his lonely cry
So sad must he be</i>

506
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:21,878
<i>Riding the silent wind
A falcon flies alone</i>

507
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:29,219
<i>Reaching out with his wings
Grasps the empty sky</i>

508
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:36,684
<i>Riding the silent wind
Never can he rest</i>

509
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:45,151
<i>What it is within my heart
None can ever know</i>

510
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:52,158
<i>A heart like a falcon's
Is this very heart</i>

511
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:59,082
<i>What it is within my heart
None can ever know</i>

512
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:06,297
<i>Lonely falcon in the empty sky</i>

513
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:15,014
<i>I walk alone along
Deserted country roads</i>

514
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:22,063
<i>Walking with me side by side
You are always there</i>

515
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:29,362
<i>I feel your loneliness
Lonely you must be</i>

516
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:36,244
<i>Crickets whispering
In the grassy fields</i>

517
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:43,293
<i>You walk there by my side
You walk the path with me</i>

518
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:50,633
<i>But you never say a word
Never do you speak</i>

519
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:59,309
<i>What it is within my heart
None can ever know</i>

520
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:06,274
<i>Here inside this heart
That walks its path alone</i>

521
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:13,239
<i>What it is within my heart
None can ever know</i>

522
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:20,330
<i>The sadness of one
Who always is alone</i>

523
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,935
I killed my father.

524
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:42,852
Huh?

525
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,189
I stabbed him and ran away.

526
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:50,276
I don't understand it. Why did I kill him?

527
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,946
Did he hurt you?

528
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,407
No. My father was a great man.

529
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,871
I am nothing. I failed my father
and I failed myself.

530
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:07,669
And yet, I'm filled
with a rage I can't control.

531
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,507
It's as if there were
someone else inside me.

532
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,509
You saw it too, didn't you?

533
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:19,222
You were right. I shouldn't be here.

534
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,182
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

535
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,059
No, you were right.

536
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,356
If I don't leave, it will come again.

537
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,161
A woman?

538
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,747
She lives past the marshes.

539
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,751
And the Archmage is with her?

540
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:53,756
He was seen in the town.
There are many witnesses.

541
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,800
Splendid.

542
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,517
My lord.

543
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,354
Let's go, men!

544
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,795
A greeting from the Archmage.
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

545
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,730
Therru! Arren! Dinner is ready!

546
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,857
Where's Arren?

547
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,902
Isn't he with you?

548
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:56,944
No.

549
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:01,616
Maybe he's resting.
Therru, go see if he's there.

550
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,784
Yes.

551
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,413
He's not here.

552
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,167
That's strange. Where's he gone?

553
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,252
I'll look outside.

554
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:31,771
Arren...

555
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,455
Tenar, Therru... take care.

556
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,608
Doesn't matter which way I go.

557
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,830
Looks like a dead end.

558
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,643
It's here!

559
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,762
I wonder if that's Arren?

560
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,641
Arren?

561
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,935
Sparrowhawk?

562
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,236
That's odd.

563
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,154
What are you doing?

564
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,992
It's you! You're back!

565
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:36,122
So sorry, but it seems
you'll do in place of the wizard.

566
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,499
- What?
- Tenar, what's wrong?

567
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,417
Run away!

568
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,168
What a surprise!

569
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,547
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

570
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,135
No! Leave her alone!

571
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,685
Therru!

572
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,399
Well now, princess, where's your prince?

573
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:04,942
Hey! Watch those teeth!

574
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:09,947
I need you to deliver a message.
Tell this to the wizard!

575
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,825
If he wants his woman,

576
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,787
he can find her at Lord Cob's castle.

577
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:18,956
Take her away!

578
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,709
- Therru!
- Tenar!

579
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,672
Let me go, I tell you! Let me go!

580
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,846
Therru! Are you all right? Therru!

581
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,307
Stop it! Let her go!

582
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:41,187
You stay here and be good
till the wizard gets back!

583
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,441
Lord Cob's waiting. Let's get moving!

584
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,609
Stop!

585
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,821
Tenar!

586
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,742
Tenar!

587
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:29,860
I'm sorry. I'm afraid he's coming with me.

588
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,701
Go!

589
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,270
Where am I?

590
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:10,276
You're safe now.
The Shadow can't follow you here.

591
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,528
You saw it?

592
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,282
I know a bit of Magic myself.

593
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,452
I know what you're running from.

594
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,748
You were wise to flee from that man.

595
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,666
What man?

596
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,754
Sparrowhawk. That is, the Archmage.

597
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,592
Here, drink this. It will soothe you.

598
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,516
What's wrong? It's not poisoned.

599
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,035
Now lie still and rest here for a bit.

600
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:05,664
The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

601
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:09,335
No... Sparrowhawk is a good man.

602
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,670
He protected me.

603
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:17,051
Then tell me. Did you ever
wonder what he seeks?

604
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,055
No.

605
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,684
He seeks eternal life.

606
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,188
Eternal life?

607
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,527
The Archmage stands
at the pinnacle of sorcery.

608
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:39,782
Only the secret of eternal life
lies beyond his grasp.

609
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,327
And yet, he covets it.

610
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:48,457
But as he covets, so does he fear
another will discover it first.

611
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:54,046
That would be unbearable
to one so proud as the Archmage.

612
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,091
What does that have to do with me?

613
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,804
Because it is you who have been chosen

614
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,348
to gain the secret of eternal life.

615
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:10,104
That's why Sparrowhawk
follows you. To kill you.

616
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,356
To bring me death...

617
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,943
Arren, will you come with me?

618
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,112
I've already found it.

619
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:21,782
I found the door between life and death.

620
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,494
Together we can open that door.

621
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,289
And together, we will live forever.

622
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,917
We will conquer every form
of fear and suffering.

623
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,503
Fear and suffering...

624
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:40,009
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible!

625
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:46,265
I don't want to die.

626
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,895
Listen to me, Arren.
Tell me your true name.

627
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,523
Then you will have that
which you most desire.

628
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,822
Come, tell me your true name.

629
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:07,369
Lebannen...

630
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,504
Now I'm ready for you, Sparrowhawk.

631
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,016
Where are you, Hawk?

632
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,970
Hawk!

633
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,392
What's wrong, Therru?

634
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,187
They came and took Tenar away!

635
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,232
You have to go to Cob's castle!

636
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,441
Where is Arren?

637
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:24,446
He left! He said it would
come again if he didn't go!

638
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,657
Cob...

639
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,451
Don't worry, Therru.

640
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:34,957
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.

641
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:39,962
Keep this sword. Arren will need it.

642
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,430
Stay home, Therru!

643
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,404
Here we are!

644
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,076
Come on!

645
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,412
I'm not going anywhere!

646
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,126
Lord Cob.

647
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,464
We brought the woman. Just as you ordered.

648
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,384
You've done well, Hare.

649
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:32,806
It was nothing, my lord.
My pleasure is to serve you.

650
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,308
Stand aside!

651
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,226
Why, you!

652
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,020
Are you the boss?

653
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:42,024
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!

654
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,611
So sorry for the rough treatment.

655
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,030
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

656
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:53,619
You're a wizard, aren't you!
You should be ashamed!

657
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,788
Go find him yourself!

658
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,832
He's an old friend of mine.

659
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,294
I'd like to invite him here.

660
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,673
And I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!

661
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:10,010
Women tax my patience.

662
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,346
Put her in the dungeon.

663
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,515
Do it!

664
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,184
Answer me!

665
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,188
If something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me!

666
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,192
- Arren...
- This way!

667
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,164
Come, Lebannen.
I have something special for you.

668
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:08,152
Get in there!

669
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:21,039
Make yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

670
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:41,977
This place reminds me of the Tombs.

671
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,481
Sparrowhawk...

672
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,996
Cob! Are you making
the same mistake again?

673
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,088
At ease!

674
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,299
Any sign of the wizard?

675
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,343
Not yet, sir.

676
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,597
Where is that confounded wizard?

677
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,601
Let's see...

678
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,606
There he is!

679
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,441
Take your positions!

680
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,034
Here he comes!

681
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:47,459
Don't let him escape! Now!

682
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,632
Hear me! Open the path!

683
01:15:58,178 --> 01:15:59,555
Stop! Wait!

684
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:02,432
He tricked us!

685
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,726
Well? Don't just stand there!

686
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,653
Cob! It's Sparrowhawk. I'm here!

687
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:16,822
Show yourself!

688
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:24,162
It's been a long time, Sparrowhawk.

689
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,665
I've been waiting.

690
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,711
Cob of Havnor! I left you at the border

691
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,254
of the land of death.

692
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,300
I hear you're the Archmage now.

693
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,260
Congratulations.

694
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,514
I'm here, Cob. Now release Tenar!

695
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,184
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

696
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:50,522
The great Archmage, smitten by a woman.

697
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,526
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?

698
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,820
What do you think?

699
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,406
I haven't forgotten how you dragged me

700
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,159
to the gates of the Dry Land.

701
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,953
But you've forgotten why!

702
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,997
You used the Pelnish Lore...

703
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,293
to toy with the spirits
of the living and the dead.

704
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,420
Isn't that enough to repent?

705
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:18,508
You taught me a splendid lesson
there at death's door.

706
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,470
Now I know I can never accept extinction.

707
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:26,183
So I gathered every
ancient lore book I could find.

708
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,354
Alas, some of their owners
were not cooperative.

709
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,858
What evil are you planning, Cob?

710
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,403
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

711
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,615
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

712
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:45,202
The door between life and death
has been closed

713
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:48,872
since the beginning of time,
but I will open it.

714
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:53,043
That is forbidden! Don't you understand?

715
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:57,172
Those with power
must wield it with wisdom.

716
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,883
Would you destroy the Balance
that sustains the world?

717
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,761
What nonsense!

718
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,931
The Balance is long gone.

719
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:09,726
You know that better than anyone.

720
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,895
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

721
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:17,901
You think you can limit
Man's desire? It's impossible.

722
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,987
I will live forever.

723
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,907
I will gain existence without end!

724
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:29,663
Cob! Without the cycle
of death and rebirth, there is no life!

725
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,541
I am above Nature!

726
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,176
Sparrowhawk! There's someone else
who wants to meet you.

727
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,813
Arren! What are you doing here?

728
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:59,443
Lebannen! This man
would deprive you of eternal life!

729
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,286
Arren! Did you reveal your true name?

730
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,916
I'm going to live forever!

731
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,923
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of living in fear.

732
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,677
Arren! Life without death is not life!

733
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,931
Refuse death, and you refuse life as well!

734
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,893
Don't lie to me!

735
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,580
Listen to me, Arren.

736
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:58,168
No man nor any thing
in this world lives forever.

737
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:02,714
But only to us is it given
to know that we must die.

738
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:07,385
And that is a precious gift.

739
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:13,850
This life that is our torment
and our treasure does not endure.

740
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,186
It is a wave on the sea.

741
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:20,398
Would you force the sea
to grow still, to save one wave?

742
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,692
To save yourself?

743
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,538
Arren...

744
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:47,717
Thought you made a fool of me?

745
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,346
There's more
than one entrance to this castle!

746
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,725
What's happening? I'm getting weak.

747
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,814
Coming here was another
of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

748
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:03,733
Your powers are useless in this place.

749
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,946
Hare! Put him in the
dungeon with the woman.

750
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:10,198
I'll finish them off tomorrow

751
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,618
in the most painful and humiliating way.

752
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:15,620
Yes, my lord.

753
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,914
On your feet, chickenhawk!

754
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:42,689
Sparrowhawk!

755
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:46,818
Sparrowhawk! Are you all right?
Sparrowhawk!

756
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,987
It'll all be over tomorrow.

757
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,740
Say your goodbyes
while you still have time!

758
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,337
Sparrowhawk! Sparrowhawk!

759
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,464
Tenar...

760
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:11,509
How did they do this? You're the Archmage!

761
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:16,056
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I keep getting you into trouble.

762
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:18,642
Stop talking nonsense!

763
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,953
Which way should I go?

764
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,335
Arren?

765
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:52,926
Arren! Wait!

766
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:58,431
Arren! Cob's men came and took Tenar away!

767
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:13,363
Arren, your sword!
Sparrowhawk said to give it to you!

768
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,205
Follow you?

769
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:05,832
Tenar is a prisoner here.

770
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,000
Sparrowhawk too.

771
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,335
Even Sparrowhawk.

772
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,923
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

773
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:18,428
We've got to hurry. They need our help!

774
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:23,892
I can go no further. You must go alone.

775
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,687
Bring me that sword.

776
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,190
I know you can do it.

777
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,694
What do you mean? You're right here.

778
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,363
I'm not here.

779
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,201
Cob is holding me against my will.

780
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,745
Then who are you?

781
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,331
Stay away! Get back!

782
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,958
Don't come closer!

783
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,801
Arren's heart was always full of fear.

784
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,971
The fear filled his heart with darkness.

785
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,974
Fear of what?

786
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:09,395
The darkness stole his body
and ran away with it.

787
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,732
But it left something important behind.

788
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:22,784
Wherever there is darkness,
you will also find light.

789
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,245
Now the light that was left behind

790
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,372
wanders alone, like a shadow.

791
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:29,624
A shadow?

792
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:36,589
What you see now
is just a shadow chasing its body.

793
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,390
Father...

794
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,269
You are Arren, aren't you?

795
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,650
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

796
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,154
I'll give you my true name.

797
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:04,659
My true name is Lebannen... Lebannen.

798
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,579
Lebannen...

799
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,946
It's him.

800
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:29,577
He should be ashamed
to call himself Archmage!

801
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:32,914
Remember who he was up against.

802
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:35,250
No wizard in Earthsea
is a match for Lord Cob!

803
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,668
Well spoken!

804
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:42,257
By the way,
what's our little friend up to?

805
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,801
He shut himself in his room.

806
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,428
Arren's really here!

807
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,932
He's a lucky one, that boy.

808
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:55,812
It's just like Lord Cob
to steal the wizard's apprentice.

809
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:58,815
He's not much use though, is he?

810
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,650
None at all.

811
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:04,570
When we're through
with the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

812
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,125
All right!
Go get Sparrowhawk and his woman.

813
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:21,045
The Archmage's time has finally run out!

814
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,049
They're going to kill them.

815
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,210
Arren!

816
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,837
Arren?

817
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:51,219
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?

818
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,522
Here. This belongs to you.

819
01:30:03,397 --> 01:30:06,192
I'm not worthy to hold my father's sword.

820
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:10,822
Arren, they've got Tenar and Sparrowhawk.

821
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,615
They're going to kill them.

822
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:15,701
Please! Help them like you helped me!

823
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,454
I can't help anyone.

824
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,707
All I can do is fail.

825
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,793
What's wrong with you?

826
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:26,587
They'll die if we don't do something!

827
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,470
They'll die! We'll lose both of them!

828
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:47,150
We'll lose
the most important thing in the world.

829
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:52,405
Therru?

830
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:58,452
What's the most important thing?

831
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,458
Life is the most important thing!

832
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:10,131
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?

833
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:15,845
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.

834
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:19,932
No! Life is precious because
we know we're going to die!

835
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:24,604
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!

836
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,982
You want to live forever,
then you say nothing matters.

837
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,067
It's the same thing!

838
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:33,237
You're afraid to live
the only life you have!

839
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,615
Therru...

840
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:38,159
You think your life belongs to you?

841
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,957
Tenar gave me life.
That's why I have to live...

842
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,919
To give life to someone else.

843
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:52,965
Lebannen...

844
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:57,220
That's the only way we live forever.

845
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:15,321
Therru... How did you know my true name?

846
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:18,032
You told me yourself.

847
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:25,373
Now I'll tell you mine. My true name is...

848
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:28,000
Tehanu... It's Tehanu.

849
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,419
Tehanu...

850
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,361
It'll be dawn soon.

851
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,323
Come on, Therru. We've got to help them!

852
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:10,501
Arren, wait!

853
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:12,420
What is it?

854
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:13,421
There!

855
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,970
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

856
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,805
Come on!

857
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,352
Jump!

858
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,063
I can't! It's too far!

859
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,815
Don't worry! You can do it!

860
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:41,282
Let's go!

861
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,394
Sparrowhawk!

862
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:14,273
Time to say goodbye, Sparrowhawk.

863
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:18,319
Your lover is going on a journey.

864
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:20,905
Why don't you send him off yourself?

865
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:30,122
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

866
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:33,042
This world
will be in good hands after you're gone.

867
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:37,380
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

868
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,048
Tenar.

869
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:44,053
It's not over yet. The sun will rise soon.

870
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,306
What do you mean?

871
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:53,646
Don't you hear it, Tenar?
Help is almost here.

872
01:34:57,274 --> 01:35:00,069
That's enough time for goodbyes.

873
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:02,530
Do it! Finish him off!

874
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:03,489
No!

875
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,911
Let them go!

876
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:10,704
It's you!

877
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,248
Arren! Therru!

878
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,792
Stay out of this, boy!

879
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:18,421
Don't show him any mercy!

880
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,297
Get back!

881
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:26,929
Take him!

882
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,693
Please don't hurt me!

883
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:42,820
I'm disappointed.

884
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:46,699
I thought you and I had an understanding.

885
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:50,703
Silence! You don't control me any more.

886
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:55,708
Then you shall see
the face of death, Lebannen!

887
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:03,174
A summoning spell!

888
01:36:08,804 --> 01:36:10,598
- Arren!
- Stay back!

889
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:14,018
Now die!

890
01:36:34,413 --> 01:36:36,832
Please! Let me draw it.

891
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,210
For Life!

892
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:20,751
That sword was forged with magic!

893
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:46,277
He's an old man!

894
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:48,988
Disguised by sorcery.

895
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:51,073
Lord Cob!

896
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:56,412
You can't stop me.

897
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:59,498
I will never accept death.

898
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,627
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

899
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,130
You wretched girl!

900
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,882
I'm not like you!

901
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,635
I'm better than you. Insignificant worms!

902
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:14,638
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

903
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:18,559
I wield power! I am almighty!

904
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:24,773
Scorned as a fool by the wizards of Roke.

905
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,817
Driven out like a dog!

906
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:32,990
But I'll have my revenge.
I will never die.

907
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,327
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

908
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,676
Therru!

909
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:26,669
Therru!

910
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,262
That little fool!

911
01:39:37,596 --> 01:39:41,767
Hear me, stones. I unbind you!

912
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:35,070
Sunrise...

913
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,158
Let me go!

914
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:44,872
Does it hurt, girl?

915
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:45,789
Cob!

916
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,251
Let her go!

917
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:51,587
Stay back!

918
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,840
Death is terrifying!

919
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:56,842
Don't do it!

920
01:41:00,512 --> 01:41:03,348
So terrifying.

921
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:09,646
Wait!

922
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:36,465
So terrifying... very terrifying...

923
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:39,968
Cob! You're just like me.

924
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:44,056
You turn away from light
and see only darkness!

925
01:41:46,099 --> 01:41:47,935
No! Keep away!

926
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:53,023
You forgot that all life is connected.

927
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:56,443
Life can't be hoarded,
it can only be given!

928
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,947
Deny death, and you deny life!

929
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:03,075
No! You're wrong!

930
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:08,163
Face the truth, Cob! Everyone fears death!

931
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:14,044
No! I don't want to die.

932
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:16,171
Cob!

933
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:18,507
No!

934
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:20,926
Therru!

935
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:34,106
Therru... Arren...

936
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:44,992
Arren!

937
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:57,629
Time to die! Time to die!

938
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:58,797
Arren!

939
01:42:59,798 --> 01:43:02,467
And you will join him.

940
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,143
Let her go! Don't kill her!

941
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:17,983
All who oppose me must die!

942
01:43:47,846 --> 01:43:51,516
She's dead, she's dead. Poor thing.

943
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,488
Sun is rising.

944
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:11,620
Hurry... Must hurry...

945
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:12,788
Stop!

946
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:51,451
Therru!

947
01:44:59,584 --> 01:45:02,838
Eternal life!

948
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,554
Shadow, return to darkness!

949
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,599
Give me life!

950
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:23,608
I want life... Life!

951
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,117
Life!

952
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:40,792
I want to live!

953
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:14,493
Tehanu!

954
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,037
So you're safe too.

955
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:05,710
What about them?

956
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:10,674
They'll be fine. They have wings.

957
01:48:34,257 --> 01:48:36,635
Thank you... Therru.

958
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:45,936
I'm going back home to pay for my crime.

959
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,356
And to face myself.

960
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:52,609
Arren.

961
01:48:54,819 --> 01:48:58,448
Can I come to see you again someday?

962
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:05,121
Come on.

963
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:08,667
We have to thank Sparrowhawk and Tenar.

964
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:13,416
THE END
