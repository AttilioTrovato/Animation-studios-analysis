7
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,230
- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it?

8
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm home.

9
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,990
Thanks.

10
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,200
You don't need a bag for just milk!

11
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,620
They put it in one.

12
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:23,250
Just say no. Pour me some too.

13
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,790
Dad, want some barley tea?

14
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,590
Please, I'll come there.

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,930
- Thanks. The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.

16
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,550
I should buy an electronic notebook.

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,140
You could've gone to your aunt's too.

18
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,900
No. Onee-chan wears me out.

19
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,150
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

20
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,650
Do you need lunch?

21
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,440
No, I'll eat out.

22
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:55,530
The library's busy
going to a bar code system.

23
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:58,410
I like the book cards better.

24
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,200
Me too.

25
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,660
Hey, this isn't right...

26
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:04,960
What?

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,380
Did you leave out a line?

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,340
- You're right!
- Let me go first.

29
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,130
I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.

30
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:18,220
Note: Amasawa Seiji

31
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,470
This guy...

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,020
You can read,
but don't stay up too late.

33
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah. Good night.

34
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,370
I thought I'd seen that name before.

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Here too.

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,460
Note: Amasawa Seiji

37
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,460
He's taken all
these books out before me.

38
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,430
Amasawa Seiji. What's he like?
Is he good-looking?

39
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,870
Shizuku! Get up!

40
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,580
I'm leaving!

41
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,340
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

42
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,800
Bye!

43
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,930
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,930
My purse!

45
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,650
You ran back upstairs again?

46
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,440
Yeah.

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,150
That's funny.

48
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,240
Try by the phone...

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Found it!

50
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,820
Just where you left it...

51
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,490
I'm late! Lock the door!

52
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,040
Silly!

53
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,000
It's flying so low!

54
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,470
Today's a lucky day!

55
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,660
Is it ever hot!

56
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,970
Yahoo! How's it going?

57
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,610
Hit it!

58
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,280
Hi, Shizuku!

59
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,950
Hi! Try your best!

60
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,250
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?

61
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,500
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?

62
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,710
Could I ask a favor?

63
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,420
Nothing weird, I hope...

64
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:44,220
- Let me in the library!
- What?

65
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:46,850
Can't you wait till school starts?

66
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:50,850
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

67
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

68
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:59,360
Don't forget, you've got high school
entrance exams.

69
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:02,610
- Hurry it up!
- Here it is!

70
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,030
Bring it here.

71
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,040
Give me your card and the book card.

72
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,120
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,710
No one's ever borrowed this book!

74
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,210
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

75
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,260
Note: Donated

76
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,310
"Amasawa." Sensei!

77
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,480
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?

78
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:37,690
Look what you made me do!

79
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:41,150
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

80
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,150
Ask an older teacher.

81
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,740
Shizuku!

82
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:49,910
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

83
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,750
If I have to stand in the sun,
I get more freckles!

84
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:54,750
S-Sorry!

85
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:58,500
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.

86
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,920
They're a serious problem, Sensei!

87
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:05,260
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.

88
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,140
Move up! Move up!

89
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,940
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?

90
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,440
<i>White clouds spreading up over a hill</i>

91
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:29,070
<i>A road winds up to the town</i>

92
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:33,330
<i>An old house with small windows</i>

93
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:37,540
<i>An old dog waits for me to come home</i>

94
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:42,130
<i>Country road leading far away</i>

95
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:46,630
<i>The road to my old hometown</i>

96
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:51,180
<i>West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain</i>

97
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:55,810
<i>My good old hometown</i>

98
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,600
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.

99
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,900
It's trite.

100
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,060
Yeah?

101
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,820
I wrote another one.

102
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,700
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere</i>

103
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:15,700
<i>Cut down all the trees
Filled in the valleys</i>

104
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,290
<i>Western Tokyo</i>

105
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,500
<i>Tama Mountain</i>

106
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:24,840
<i>My hometown is concrete roads</i>

107
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,970
What is this?!

108
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,640
But what's this problem?

109
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,760
You don't need the lyrics yet.

110
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:37,390
No. Are you in love with anyone?

111
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:38,770
What?

112
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:42,610
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.

113
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,360
We could encourage each other.

114
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,650
Yuko! You're in love!

115
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,570
You got a love letter?!

116
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:52,950
Shh!

117
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:55,160
When? Who? Is he handsome?

118
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,580
He's in another class. He's not bad.

119
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,920
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!

120
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,130
Yeah, but...

121
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,130
So there's someone else you like!

122
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,930
You can't hide it from me! Confess!

123
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,470
It's Su... Su...

124
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,770
Tsukishima!

125
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,560
Bring me my bag, will you?

126
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,560
- Sugimura!
- That blue sports bag.

127
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,070
Come on, Tsukishima!

128
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,820
Throw it over here.

129
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,860
Shut up and go back to the bench!

130
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm first-string,
and we're through to the regionals!

131
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:38,740
Yuko?

132
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,930
You're in love with Sugimura?

133
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:58,060
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

134
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,560
Don't worry. He's too dense.

135
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,350
But what about the love letter?

136
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,900
I'll think about it awhile.

137
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,070
I see.

138
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,280
At least your parents
aren't always after you to study.

139
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,120
Silence isn't always great.

140
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,660
I wonder...

141
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,500
- Oh, no!
- What?

142
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:25,710
I forgot my book! I'll go back.

143
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll ride you.

144
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,840
No. You'll be late for cram school.

145
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,630
I'll call you.

146
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,630
That book...

147
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,630
Oh, is it yours?

148
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.

149
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,560
How do you know my name?

150
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,560
Guess!

151
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,070
My library card.

152
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:35,150
<i>I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.</i>

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,080
You read it!

154
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,830
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

155
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,460
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

156
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,090
Jerk!

157
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,270
<i>"I'd forget about Concrete Road."</i>

158
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,100
Get lost!

159
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm home.

160
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,230
Onee-chan? You're back already?

161
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,070
I'm beat!

162
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,160
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

163
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,990
Where's Mom?

164
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:07,160
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.

165
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,370
You could clean up a little.

166
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,670
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.

167
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:16,670
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!

168
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I'm getting to it!

169
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,850
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

170
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,770
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

171
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,110
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.

172
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,410
Are you studying?

173
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't think you can take it easy just
because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

174
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,410
I know!

175
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,460
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

176
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:56,250
That's your aunt, all right.

177
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,760
It was the same thing last year.

178
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,340
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

179
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,100
Two kilos of it!

180
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,860
Shizuku! Get up
and vacuum by your desk!

181
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm washing the sheets.

182
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,280
And airing the bedding.

183
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,540
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.

184
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,050
Put that stuff away
and bring Dad's lunch to him.

185
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,170
Me?!

186
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:44,430
Why not? You're going to the library.

187
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,180
Shall I go instead?

188
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:52,680
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the co-op?

189
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,400
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

190
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,610
I'm going!

191
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,870
Shizuku!

192
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,370
Mail these, will you?

193
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,620
What?

194
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:16,540
M-A-I-L!

195
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,420
You don't have to read them!

196
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,930
Take the paper clip off.

197
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,300
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!

198
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,320
Hey, cat, are you alone?

199
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,330
Where are you going?

200
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,710
What's out there?

201
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,840
Hey! Answer me!

202
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,600
I get off here. What about you?

203
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,610
See you.

204
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,460
Hey! A cat!

205
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,100
The library's that way!

206
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,260
And it felt just like
the start of a story.

207
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,540
There he is!

208
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,740
Note: No Entrance

209
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,270
What a hill! How far up is he going?

210
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,870
Cat?

211
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,670
Cat?

212
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,420
Does he live around here?

213
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,080
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

214
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,900
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here.

215
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,630
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

216
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,140
Maybe you're teasing me too.

217
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,950
I never guessed there was
a store like this up here either.

218
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,730
Beautiful doll!

219
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,910
Are you that cat?

220
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,510
- Oh, hello.
- Um...

221
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:47,590
That's all right.
Look around all you want.

222
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,800
The Baron gets bored.

223
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,980
Is this doll the Baron?

224
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:58,940
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.

225
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,870
Sorry.

226
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,830
- Thanks. I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.

227
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:18,210
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out. Look.

228
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,630
It's beautiful. What is it?

229
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,140
Wait and see.

230
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,680
What great dwarfs!

231
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:19,020
So, you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?

232
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Watch the face... if it works.

233
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,090
A fairy!

234
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,840
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

235
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,800
- A princess?
- That's right.

236
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,570
Are they in love?

237
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,820
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.

238
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,370
Only while the clock is striking 12
she is changed back from a sheep.

239
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:21,160
But he appears every hour

240
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:23,120
and waits for her.

241
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,960
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

242
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,380
That's why they both look so sad.

243
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,970
This clock's fast, isn't it?

244
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:42,100
Only about five minutes, though.

245
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh, no!

246
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,560
I've got to be at the library! Goodbye.

247
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,860
Can I come back sometime?

248
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:53,240
Sure, but go left
to get to the library!

249
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,080
I'm right above it!

250
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,010
What a find!
A place where stories start!

251
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,430
Fantastic!

252
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,600
Tsukishima!

253
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,480
Tsukishima Shizuku!

254
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,610
Isn't this yours?

255
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,110
Forgetful, aren't you.

256
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:40,120
- Thanks, but how?
- Guess!

257
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,250
The cat. Is that your cat?

258
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,130
You sure eat a big lunch!

259
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,420
No!

260
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:55,510
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere...</i>

261
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,430
It's not mine! Hey!

262
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh, here you are.

263
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,850
What's wrong with you?

264
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,270
It's hard to explain.

265
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,030
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

266
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:17,990
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

267
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,990
Sounds complicated.

268
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,660
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.

269
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:30,460
- Still at it? What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.

270
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:32,880
You will? Thanks, then.

271
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,690
June 16th...

272
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,780
Wow! Amasawa's read this one too!

273
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,990
What's he like?

274
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,540
No! He's not you!

275
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,100
Shizuku! Hurry!

276
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,890
I'm late!

277
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,600
Pass my umbrella.

278
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Rain every day this term!

279
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,030
At least you're studying
because you want to.

280
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,280
Sorry.

281
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,070
Study hard!

282
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:25,490
Don't you worry!

283
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,460
- Shizuku!
- Hi!

284
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,000
Hurry! We'll be late!

285
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,680
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!

286
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,520
- Did you answer?
- No.

287
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,810
Did he say anything?

288
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,940
I'm going to say no.

289
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:58,070
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

290
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,530
Sugimura!

291
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,530
Better hurry!

292
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,740
I know!

293
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,500
Time's up. Gather the papers.

294
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,470
See you this afternoon.

295
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,720
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.

296
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,640
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

297
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,020
Sure.

298
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:36,100
- Tsukishima!
- What?

299
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,400
I lucked out on the test!

300
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:39,900
Isn't that nice.

301
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:42,900
Everything I studied was on it!

302
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:45,450
So, you're not just a baseball goof.

303
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:49,700
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?

304
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
With Harada?

305
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,250
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?

306
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,540
Come on!

307
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,120
Stop fixing me up!

308
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,260
Was it obvious?

309
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:06,390
I never just guess!

310
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,510
Sorry!

311
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,430
Excuse me.

312
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,340
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.

313
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,100
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.

314
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,870
Oh...

315
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,080
That's Dr. Amasawa.

316
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:31,160
I've read it. It's a good book!

317
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,660
Yes, very. What kind of person is he?

318
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,130
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

319
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:44,030
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?

320
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,830
His given name?

321
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:50,400
Kimura-sensei, do you remember
that Dr. Amasawa's given name?

322
00:33:50,435 --> 00:33:54,240
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.

323
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:55,680
Amasawa Koichi.

324
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,650
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?

325
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,650
He is?!

326
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,580
Umm... Thank you very much!

327
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,320
Goodbye!

328
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,620
Sorry!

329
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,620
Shizuku, where are you going?

330
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,930
What a surprise!

331
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,630
Tell me about it!

332
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,700
What's with you?!

333
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,900
Sorry!

334
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,680
Hey, where are you going?

335
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,570
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

336
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:59,540
Who is he? Where are you going?

337
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:02,540
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!

338
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,760
I've been carrying her lunch all over.

339
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,720
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

340
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:17,180
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

341
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,350
It isn't true!

342
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,310
You met a prince
from one of your books?

343
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:23,480
Is he handsome?

344
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:26,150
I just want to find out what he's like!

345
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:30,320
Come on, Yuko,
you heard his name. Tell us!

346
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,360
Yuko!

347
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,200
It happened too fast.

348
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:38,200
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...

349
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,910
Right, Shizuku?

350
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:41,080
Dunno...

351
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:46,130
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

352
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:48,670
You want to know, but you don't.

353
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,840
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

354
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,100
How terribly romantic!

355
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,390
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?

356
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,190
- You finished?!
- Let's see!

357
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,610
Oh, Shizuku-sama! Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!

358
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,950
All right, then.

359
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,870
I'm not sure...

360
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,620
I don't know about old hometowns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

361
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,750
This is great!

362
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,340
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

363
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:35,970
<i>If I go right to the end</i>

364
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:40,640
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

365
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:45,980
<i>To that town, country road</i>

366
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,400
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

367
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,690
It's not hard to sing?

368
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:51,940
We'll manage.

369
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:56,160
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank you!

370
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,450
There too?!

371
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,370
- Slow down!
- I like this part.

372
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:04,370
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing.

373
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:08,580
Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."

374
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:10,630
Ladies, the bell.

375
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,970
The sun's come out!

376
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,470
Shizuku!

377
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:26,810
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

378
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,230
No, I'm going to the library.

379
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:31,360
There's another test tomorrow.

380
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,360
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!

381
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,450
- Later.
- Bye-bye.

382
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,730
Harada.

383
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,240
Can I talk to you for a minute?

384
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,540
It's closed.

385
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,340
Have these flowers been watered?

386
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,940
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.

387
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,320
Note: World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.

388
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,330
Nishi Shiro. Maybe
that jerk's name is Nishi too.

389
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,470
Shizuku! Shizuku!

390
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,220
Yuko-chan's on the phone!

391
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,940
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

392
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,100
Yuko?

393
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,070
What? I can't hear you.

394
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,650
I'll be there in a minute.

395
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,700
Bye.

396
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,570
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

397
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,170
What's wrong?

398
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,840
- Shizuku!
- What's the matter?

399
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,340
What's with this face?

400
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,550
What am I going to do?!

401
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:06,260
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

402
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,390
Huh? That's bad.

403
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,270
Why you, of all people?!

404
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,190
Hey!

405
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,990
That guy is so dense!

406
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,950
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him.

407
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,790
I'll apologize to him.

408
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:36,880
But I can't go to school tomorrow
looking like this.

409
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,130
And miss the test?

410
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,590
Yeah.

411
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,010
I see.

412
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,530
Idiot!

413
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,070
What?

414
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,620
It was easy.

415
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,700
The library again, Shizuku?

416
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,950
I'm going to Yuko's.

417
00:41:12,985 --> 00:41:14,870
I see. Say hello to her.

418
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,300
Tsukishima!

419
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,800
Wait up!

420
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,390
About Harada...

421
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,820
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

422
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,160
She said, "Why you, of all people,"
didn't she?

423
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,710
Yeah. A guy on the
baseball team asked me.

424
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,960
No!

425
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:04,050
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

426
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,420
Don't you understand?!

427
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,760
No, I don't!

428
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:08,880
Tell me!

429
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,270
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

430
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,270
What?! No way! I don't need this!

431
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,770
You don't? How do you think Yuko
feels? She stayed home sick today!

432
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,200
But... I like you!

433
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,780
What?

434
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,950
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

435
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:36,040
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!

436
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,080
Not me! You can't!

437
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,380
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?

438
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,170
I don't have a boyfriend.

439
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,340
But...

440
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,550
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!

441
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,050
Tell me the truth!

442
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,980
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

443
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,940
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

444
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,950
Just friends?

445
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,200
Forever?

446
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,210
I see.

447
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,010
I'm the one who's dense.

448
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,860
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.

449
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:30,230
Thank you again.

450
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,920
You don't have to do this.

451
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:49,380
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

452
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,510
Oh, you're home.

453
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Shizuku?

454
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,130
Hi.

455
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,970
Have you been shut out too?

456
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,180
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

457
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,190
You're not very nice. Just like me.

458
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,200
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.

459
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,700
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

460
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:52,170
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy."

461
00:46:52,205 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm not very nice.

462
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,990
Hey! Tsukishima!

463
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,950
Moon lets you pet him?

464
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,620
Moon, you're not coming in?

465
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,290
Is that his name?

466
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,370
He's like a full moon.

467
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,040
That's why I call him that.

468
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,550
Isn't he yours?

469
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:42,470
He won't stay in one house.

470
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:46,010
I heard him being called Ball at one place.

471
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:48,310
I'm sure there's others.

472
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:50,980
So he does the rounds.

473
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,480
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

474
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,980
The train?

475
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,780
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here. I followed him.

476
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,780
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

477
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,910
I insulted him.

478
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:14,290
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.

479
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,130
You're not like Moon at all!

480
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,800
He's half-devil...

481
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,060
- Um...
- Would you?

482
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,730
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...

483
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:41,820
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

484
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:43,820
I'm glad he's all right.

485
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:47,870
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

486
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:50,950
That cat doll?
You want to see it? Come on.

487
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,720
Close the door.

488
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,320
It's like we're in the sky!

489
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,210
Afraid of heights?

490
00:49:35,245 --> 00:49:38,040
No, I like high places. This is great.

491
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,010
This is the time it looks best. In here.

492
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,910
Perfect timing.

493
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,410
Sit there.

494
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,410
The clock's gone!

495
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,080
The one that was there?

496
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,920
Grandpa's delivering it today.

497
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:24,050
Did he sell it?

498
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
It was here being fixed.

499
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:30,050
I wanted to see it again.

500
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:34,020
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

501
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:35,560
That lunch!

502
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:38,480
I know it wasn't yours.

503
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:40,150
Look into the cat's eyes.

504
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,480
Quick, before the light goes.

505
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,210
<i>Engelzimmer: "angel's room."</i>

506
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:04,590
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.

507
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:06,460
It's beautiful.

508
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:09,470
The Baron won't go. He's a treasure.

509
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,090
A treasure?

510
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,680
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

511
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:19,940
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

512
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,900
Turn on the light if you want.

513
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,420
It's weird. I feel
as if I've known you for years.

514
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:46,710
Sometimes I really want to see you.

515
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,100
You look sad today, somehow.

516
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,580
- Had enough?
- Yeah. Thanks.

517
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,250
Are you making a violin?

518
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,370
Uh, yeah.

519
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,040
Can I see?

520
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,130
It fits like this.

521
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,390
You made all that? By hand?

522
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,020
- Sure!
- Amazing!

523
00:53:22,055 --> 00:53:25,440
The shape hasn't changed
in 300 years.

524
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:28,650
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.

525
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,320
You made all those?

526
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:36,070
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.

527
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,700
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.

528
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,410
- Which one?
- That one.

529
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:45,290
This one?

530
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:50,250
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!

531
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,420
How can you talk like that
with a straight face?

532
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,930
Why? It's what I think.

533
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,760
Anyone can do that.

534
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,680
I've got a long way to go.

535
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,320
You can play, can't you?

536
00:54:13,355 --> 00:54:14,440
A little.

537
00:54:14,475 --> 00:54:17,030
Play for me, OK? Please!

538
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:18,450
Listen...

539
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:20,700
Please, please, please!

540
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,580
You have to sing too.

541
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,420
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

542
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:29,000
Perfect!

543
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,770
Sing. You know this song.

544
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:17,670
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

545
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:23,140
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

546
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:28,060
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

547
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:33,110
<i>And pretended
I was strong as I could be</i>

548
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:38,570
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

549
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:44,160
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

550
00:55:44,195 --> 00:55:49,960
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

551
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:54,920
<i>To that town, country road</i>

552
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,470
<i>It doesn't matter to me
how sad I might be</i>

553
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:07,010
<i>I will never ever let
a tear show in my eye</i>

554
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:12,940
<i>If my feet are moving faster
that's because I only want to</i>

555
00:56:12,975 --> 00:56:17,530
<i>Push away memories</i>

556
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:23,030
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

557
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:28,580
<i>Could go right to my hometown</i>

558
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:34,130
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

559
00:56:34,165 --> 00:56:39,960
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

560
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:45,300
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

561
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:51,140
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

562
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:56,480
<i>Want to go back there
Can't go back there</i>

563
00:56:56,515 --> 00:56:58,980
<i>Fare thee well</i>

564
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,570
<i>Country road</i>

565
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,980
That was fun!

566
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,570
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.

567
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:51,240
I was hoping you'd come back again.

568
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,330
These are my musical friends.

569
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,830
Nice singing.

570
00:57:56,865 --> 00:58:00,630
You're the lucky one who was there
when he fixed the clock.

571
00:58:00,665 --> 00:58:03,630
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.

572
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,930
Seiji? Are you Amasawa Seiji?

573
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,430
Yeah. Didn't I tell you my name?

574
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:15,640
No! It says Nishi outside.

575
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,150
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

576
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:25,490
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen in!

577
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:29,280
What difference does it make
what my name is?

578
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:32,950
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

579
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:35,250
You never asked me mine!

580
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:36,960
I never had the chance!

581
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,960
My image of Amasawa Seiji...

582
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,130
What?

583
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,170
...was someone quiet and gentle.

584
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:46,420
You read too many books.

585
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:48,470
So do you!

586
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,360
That was fun. They're nice people.

587
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,530
Come back. They'll like that.

588
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:13,410
Just to listen. Singing's too hard.

589
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,120
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

590
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,330
There's lots as good as me.

591
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:24,500
What I want to do is make violins.

592
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:27,130
Yeah. You're good at that.

593
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,260
There's a school for it
in Cremona, Italy.

594
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,140
I want to go there.

595
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,640
And not go to high school?

596
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:43,150
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

597
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,330
It must be great
to know what you want to do.

598
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,630
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

599
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,970
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

600
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,680
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

601
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,430
I'll see you home.

602
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:22,310
No, it's not far. See you.

603
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,190
Tsukishima...

604
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,190
Yeah?

605
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:29,240
You've got a talent for poetry.

606
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,450
<i>What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked Concrete Roads too.</i>

607
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:37,290
You told me to forget that!

608
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:40,160
- Did I say that?
- Yes!

609
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,910
I did?

610
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,460
Thanks for everything. Good night.

611
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,650
Don't fall asleep
with the light on again.

612
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,660
When did you decide on your future?

613
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:20,910
What?

614
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:22,250
Your future!

615
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,120
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

616
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't mean that!

617
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,090
I'm at university finding that out.

618
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,300
Good night.

619
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Good night.

620
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,740
Mom's class is canceled,
so now she sleeps in!

621
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,750
- Morning!
- Morning!

622
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,170
Run faster!

623
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,040
You go ahead!

624
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,770
Note: Hour 1: Spare Period

625
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,730
Great!

626
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,070
Shizuku!

627
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,940
You look awful!

628
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:35,900
You sure got better fast!

629
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,660
I hear you were out
with a boy last night.

630
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:40,780
Who told you that?!

631
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:43,790
A little bird who said
you were like lovers.

632
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:45,000
We are not!

633
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:57,380
Harada, I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

634
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,390
I'm sorry too.

635
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,850
That's OK.

636
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,100
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!

637
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,530
This formula will be
on the midterm, so remember it!

638
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,490
That's all!

639
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,480
Is Tsukishima here?

640
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,140
Amasawa? What do you want?

641
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,310
Is Tsukishima in this class?

642
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,730
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

643
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,690
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

644
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,530
A male!

645
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,990
There she is.

646
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,620
Seiji-kun?

647
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,170
Can I talk to you?

648
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,590
Yes!

649
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,710
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

650
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,890
No, I don't!

651
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,480
What is it?

652
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:35,860
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?

653
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,820
Come with me.

654
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,370
- Where are we going?
- The roof!

655
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,920
Wow!

656
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:58,460
We can't talk
with all those people around.

657
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,130
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

658
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:08,140
Let them think what they want.

659
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,390
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.

660
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,400
What's that?

661
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,570
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

662
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,690
Apprentice?

663
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:26,410
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.

664
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,410
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.

665
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,540
Otherwise I go to high school.

666
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,460
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

667
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,420
...but it's a good chance.

668
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:41,050
When do you go?

669
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,930
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.

670
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,760
Soon then.

671
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,640
Great! Your dream's coming true.

672
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:54,730
Well, I'll do the best I can.

673
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:58,360
- Um...
- Well...

674
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,950
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.

675
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,450
Look over there.

676
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,960
There might be a rainbow.

677
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,180
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

678
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:36,190
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

679
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,900
It's great. You're on your way.

680
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,650
I feel like a fool.

681
01:06:42,685 --> 01:06:46,030
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school.

682
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,950
What a stupid thing to think.

683
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:12,010
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

684
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,390
We passed each other in the library.

685
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:20,020
I even sat beside you there.

686
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,860
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

687
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,030
I...

688
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,950
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

689
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,920
Me too.

690
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,670
Don't push!

691
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,600
Hey!

692
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,220
Look out, she's mad!

693
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,520
Run!

694
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,140
- Here.
- Thanks.

695
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:37,220
Excuse me.

696
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:40,060
Finished already?

697
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,440
I'm meeting Yuko.

698
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:47,730
If you're by the station, get some milk.

699
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,200
You're the one who drinks it all!

700
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:55,410
She's slacking off these days.

701
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,680
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.

702
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,430
My head's in a whirl.

703
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,230
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.
- Hello.

704
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:30,030
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

705
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,160
I'll make some tea.

706
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,780
Dad and I aren't speaking.

707
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,630
Boys are so lucky!

708
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:55,010
When he comes back to graduate,
he goes again for ten years!

709
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:57,220
That's like forever!

710
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,060
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

711
01:10:02,095 --> 01:10:07,190
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books,

712
01:10:07,225 --> 01:10:10,730
except one's going forward
while the other stays behind.

713
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:12,900
Yeah.

714
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,320
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.

715
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:21,790
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

716
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,370
Don't tell me that, will you!

717
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:27,750
I just feel worse!

718
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,880
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!

719
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:33,880
Now I'm not so sure.

720
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:42,890
I don't get it. I'd write every
day. We'd encourage each other.

721
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,900
You can't say "Go for it"
to someone more ambitious than you.

722
01:10:47,935 --> 01:10:49,520
Maybe...

723
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,490
But I don't understand what you want.

724
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:57,740
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?

725
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,330
You have talent.

726
01:11:02,365 --> 01:11:05,870
<i>All the juniors liked
your translation of Country Roads.</i>

727
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,790
You can express yourself too,
unlike me.

728
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,510
"There's lots as good as me."

729
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,090
That's what he said.

730
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:21,010
He's going to find out
if he has talent. Well, so will I!

731
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,390
I'll write a story!

732
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:29,940
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

733
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,820
But it's exam time.

734
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:36,820
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

735
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,740
- You going?
- Yeah.

736
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,910
Good night.

737
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,290
Tell your mother hello.

738
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,540
You go for it too.

739
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:57,380
Sugimura will realize. Bye.

740
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,840
Bye.

741
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,850
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!

742
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,020
Moon?

743
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,230
Muta?

744
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,490
Mom! Muta's gone again!

745
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,070
Muta!

746
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,320
Muta...

747
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:31,920
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart': Listen
to the voice of the woods...

748
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,360
The Baron as the hero?

749
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,700
Would you mind?

750
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,030
I ask because Seiji-kun says
the doll is a treasure of yours.

751
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,370
You didn't have to ask.

752
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,630
Of course you can.
But on one condition.

753
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,090
Yes?

754
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:22,380
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

755
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,300
Um...

756
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,550
All right?

757
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:31,640
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not.

758
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,440
It's the same for a craftsman.

759
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:40,740
Don't expect perfection at first.

760
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,700
Here, let me show you something.

761
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,620
This.

762
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,130
Look at it.

763
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,140
It's called mica slate.

764
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:10,470
Look at the seam.

765
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,730
Like that.

766
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,360
It's beautiful!

767
01:14:25,395 --> 01:14:30,160
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.

768
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:33,790
- Emerald? The jewel?
- Yes.

769
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:37,040
You and Seiji are like this stone.

770
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:40,500
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

771
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,300
I like stones that way.

772
01:14:44,335 --> 01:14:48,840
But making violins
or writing stories is different.

773
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:54,390
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

774
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,100
It takes time and effort.

775
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:01,070
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

776
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,820
Yes.

777
01:15:02,855 --> 01:15:07,820
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

778
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,580
The smaller part inside is purer.

779
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:17,580
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

780
01:15:17,615 --> 01:15:21,750
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.

781
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,880
I'm scared. What if there
isn't a beautiful crystal in me?

782
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,140
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.

783
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:35,890
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

784
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:48,400
A rough stone... lapis lazuli...

785
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,740
Let us go forth together

786
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,370
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

787
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,840
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

788
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:11,180
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

789
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,680
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

790
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,730
Make haste! The planetoids converge!

791
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,330
Good! We're riding the wind!

792
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,790
Straight up to that castle!

793
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,210
It's so high!

794
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:50,050
It's not so high once you're there!

795
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:13,740
When the air currents mingle in the
afternoon, you can touch the stars!

796
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,740
Huh?

797
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,210
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...

798
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,090
He's making a violin in his cell.

799
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,500
Seiji-kun!

800
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:45,790
I thought you'd gone!

801
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,630
Grandpa said I might find you here.

802
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,420
Glad I met you before. I leave tomorrow.

803
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,260
Tomorrow...

804
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:00,470
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.

805
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,920
Sorry I can't walk you home.

806
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:32,130
That's OK. I'm glad you came.

807
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,970
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

808
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:38,050
Yeah. It's only two months.

809
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:50,520
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

810
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,860
I'll see you, then.

811
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,910
Have a good trip!

812
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:28,230
I and Luisa, my betrothed,
were born in a distant land.

813
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,820
<i>In that town, magic still lived,</i>

814
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,160
<i>and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sorcerers.</i>

815
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:52,170
<i>It was a poor doll maker's
apprentice who fashioned us,</i>

816
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:58,460
<i>but Luisa and I were happy</i>

817
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:02,430
<i>because he had made us
so we could love others.</i>

818
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,140
<i>But then...</i>

819
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,810
Shizuku! Shizuku!

820
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,780
Shizuku!

821
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,410
What's going on? Tsukishima!

822
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,290
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

823
01:21:27,325 --> 01:21:30,000
Pay attention! This is important!

824
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,120
Sorry, sir.

825
01:21:31,155 --> 01:21:33,370
Harada, you read.

826
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,800
You were up until four again?!

827
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:41,630
It's OK. I'm not sleepy at all.

828
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:46,720
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...

829
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:51,390
I was thinking. I've got
to organize what I want to write.

830
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,310
I'm not hungry.

831
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,430
Shizuku? So, you are home.

832
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,180
Turn on the lights!

833
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,180
At least you could bring in the laundry!

834
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:36,690
Shizuku! Come here!

835
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,030
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

836
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,030
She's not hungry.

837
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:12,100
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.

838
01:23:12,135 --> 01:23:15,600
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?

839
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,310
Please.

840
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:25,780
I'm home!

841
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,160
Welcome back.

842
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:32,790
You're home early, Shiho.

843
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,870
I'm beat!

844
01:23:36,905 --> 01:23:39,250
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

845
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,670
Mom, can I talk to you?

846
01:23:45,705 --> 01:23:46,720
What?

847
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,140
I'm thinking of moving out.

848
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:59,100
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?

849
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,520
I've saved from my job.

850
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:04,900
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

851
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,700
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

852
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,830
I'll talk to your father.

853
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,450
You will? Great!

854
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:21,920
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working,

855
01:24:21,955 --> 01:24:24,090
but I'll help you out then.

856
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,960
Sounds good.

857
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:28,920
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.

858
01:24:28,955 --> 01:24:30,640
Thanks.

859
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:34,560
You helped enough just
with sorting out data.

860
01:24:34,595 --> 01:24:40,190
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

861
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:41,810
You think so too?

862
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,150
The school called me. Look at this.

863
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,030
What is it?

864
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,370
She's gone down a hundred places!

865
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:57,540
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?

866
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,420
- Good evening.
- Hello.

867
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,300
Excuse me.

868
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,480
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!

869
01:25:21,515 --> 01:25:24,020
I'm not going to high school!

870
01:25:24,055 --> 01:25:29,900
Not going to high school?  Use your head! What can you do
with a middle school education?

871
01:25:29,935 --> 01:25:32,530
I can decide my own future!

872
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:34,120
Don't get too cocky!

873
01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:38,620
Face the facts! The school makes
its report on you after the second term!

874
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:41,040
You're a fine one to talk!

875
01:25:41,075 --> 01:25:44,000
You don't study!
You just work part-time!

876
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,290
I do what I have to!

877
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,090
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?

878
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,550
I've got something more important to do!

879
01:25:55,585 --> 01:25:58,430
Like what? Tell me.

880
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,060
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.

881
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:06,360
But Dad, listen to this girl!

882
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:09,940
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

883
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:12,400
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

884
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,570
Come on.

885
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:34,550
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

886
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:36,760
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!

887
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:39,470
You just said you
weren't going to high school.

888
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:42,140
You said I wouldn't get into one!

889
01:26:42,175 --> 01:26:46,730
Shiho, can Shizuku
and I talk alone for a bit?

890
01:26:46,765 --> 01:26:48,560
Yes.

891
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,030
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.

892
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:56,990
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.

893
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:58,990
- Is your dad back?
- Yes.

894
01:26:59,025 --> 01:27:03,620
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

895
01:27:03,655 --> 01:27:04,750
Coming.

896
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,420
All right, Shizuku.

897
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:18,930
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

898
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,100
Can you tell me what it is?

899
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,600
When it's time.

900
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:30,940
Is this something
you have to do right away?

901
01:27:30,975 --> 01:27:34,070
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

902
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,990
I'm testing myself.

903
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,950
I have to.

904
01:27:39,985 --> 01:27:43,330
Testing yourself? How?

905
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,040
How will we know if you don't say?

906
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,130
Is it something you can't even tell us?

907
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:56,670
- Dear!
- Oh, sorry. Just one moment.

908
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:11,270
Whatever you're doing at the library,

909
01:28:11,305 --> 01:28:12,860
I admire how hard you're working.

910
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:17,070
Let's let her do what she wants.

911
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,820
Not everyone has to be the same.

912
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:27,500
I should know that if anyone does...

913
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:31,670
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

914
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,760
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

915
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,220
You've only got yourself to blame.

916
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:45,390
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

917
01:28:45,425 --> 01:28:48,310
- Yeah. We're a family.
- Yes.

918
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,390
Call Shiho.

919
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,230
I'll make some tea.

920
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,240
Shizuku.

921
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:05,370
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

922
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,330
I know. It's written on his face.

923
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:12,120
I'm moving out next Sunday.

924
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,750
You'll have your own room.

925
01:29:14,785 --> 01:29:16,670
You're leaving home?

926
01:29:16,705 --> 01:29:18,800
Yep. So, smarten up!

927
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:30,770
Hurry!

928
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,310
Hurry!

929
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:37,150
Only one is real.

930
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,030
Which is the real one?!

931
01:29:40,065 --> 01:29:42,360
Hurry! Hurry!

932
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:44,660
Hurry!

933
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:28,680
Luisa, you've finally come,
but I've grown so old.

934
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,960
Shizuku-san.

935
01:31:56,995 --> 01:32:01,130
Come in. I was fast asleep.

936
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:07,170
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

937
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:13,600
It's finished?

938
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:19,270
You promised you'd be
the first to read it.

939
01:32:19,305 --> 01:32:21,520
It's a novel!

940
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,900
Note: Whisper of the Heart

941
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,910
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

942
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:35,410
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?

943
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:41,040
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

944
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,250
My heart's pounding.

945
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,720
I see. I'll read it right now.

946
01:32:47,755 --> 01:32:51,220
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

947
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,390
Now we won't be bothered.

948
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:06,570
Can I wait downstairs?

949
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:09,320
It's OK. I'm not cold at all.

950
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,830
Of course, but...

951
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,940
You're asleep here?

952
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:32,110
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.

953
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:37,120
Thank you. It's very good.

954
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:39,160
It's not!

955
01:34:39,195 --> 01:34:39,620
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

956
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,540
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

957
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:50,590
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished,

958
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,760
just like Seiji's violin.

959
01:34:55,470 --> 01:35:01,020
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

960
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,020
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.

961
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,860
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

962
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,140
It's cold out here. Come inside.

963
01:35:39,175 --> 01:35:40,680
Now...

964
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,020
Now that I've written it I know.

965
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,100
Wanting isn't enough.

966
01:35:47,135 --> 01:35:49,730
I have to learn more,

967
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:55,780
but Seiji-kun's getting
further and further ahead.

968
01:35:55,815 --> 01:36:00,200
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared.

969
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,500
You like Seiji, do you?

970
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:27,850
How is it?

971
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,190
It's very good.

972
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:37,610
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

973
01:36:37,645 --> 01:36:39,410
Jumbo size.

974
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:45,910
Thank you.

975
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,920
Now, where was I?

976
01:36:50,955 --> 01:36:54,130
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...

977
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,340
Yes, yes.

978
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,350
He looked so melancholic.

979
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:05,560
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

980
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,520
But he wouldn't.

981
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:13,610
The Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.

982
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:20,450
He was waiting for her to come back
from being repaired

983
01:37:20,485 --> 01:37:22,280
at the doll maker's shop.

984
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,540
Just like in my story!

985
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,370
Yes, quite the coincidence.

986
01:37:30,405 --> 01:37:34,500
I had to come home,
so I'd just about given up.

987
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,760
Then a lady friend of mine

988
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,180
<i>said when the other doll
came back, she would take it</i>

989
01:37:43,215 --> 01:37:46,180
<i>and bring the two dolls together.</i>

990
01:37:46,215 --> 01:37:48,560
<i>So the owner gave in.</i>

991
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:53,190
<i>So I ended up leaving Germany
with just the Baron.</i>

992
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:59,570
<i>I promised her I'd come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll.</i>

993
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:04,030
<i>The day the dolls met again</i>

994
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:08,580
<i>would be the day we did.</i>

995
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:14,750
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

996
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:21,590
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

997
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:28,010
But there was no trace of her
or the Baron's lover.

998
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,520
She must have been
very important to you.

999
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:36,980
Your story brought the Baron
out of my memory

1000
01:38:37,015 --> 01:38:39,980
and back to life.

1001
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:41,740
Oh, yes.

1002
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,080
Hold out your hand.

1003
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,550
But...

1004
01:38:59,585 --> 01:39:03,800
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1005
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,390
Now, finish up your story.

1006
01:39:08,425 --> 01:39:09,390
Yes.

1007
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,700
Thank you!

1008
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,240
Goodbye!

1009
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:43,760
I'm home.

1010
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,590
Welcome back.

1011
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,430
Where's Dad?

1012
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:53,680
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?

1013
01:39:53,715 --> 01:39:59,230
Sorry I worried you. Today I return
to studying for my entrance exams.

1014
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:02,230
So, your trials are over?

1015
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,110
For now.

1016
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,610
Did you eat? There's curry.

1017
01:40:08,645 --> 01:40:09,530
I'm fine!

1018
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:13,080
"For now."

1019
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,670
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1020
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,450
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1021
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,300
No way!

1022
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:04,860
Wait there!

1023
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,460
It's a miracle! You're here!

1024
01:42:22,495 --> 01:42:24,170
We're not dreaming?

1025
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:27,590
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.

1026
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,340
Wait, you'll be cold.

1027
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:34,840
Climb on.

1028
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,560
I'll get a coat.

1029
01:42:37,595 --> 01:42:39,720
No time! Get on.

1030
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,100
Hang on tight.

1031
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,240
I was out there calling you in my head.

1032
01:42:53,275 --> 01:42:54,950
"Shizuku!"

1033
01:42:54,985 --> 01:42:58,780
And then you appeared!

1034
01:42:58,815 --> 01:43:00,120
What a team we are!

1035
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:05,250
Me too. It's like I'm still dreaming!

1036
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:12,590
How was Cremona?

1037
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:16,140
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1038
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,350
It's getting light!

1039
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,900
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.

1040
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:36,360
I made up my mind
I was going to ride you up this hill!

1041
01:43:36,395 --> 01:43:38,070
That's not fair!

1042
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,950
I'm no man's burden!

1043
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,670
I want to be of use!

1044
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:52,710
OK! Push!

1045
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:54,670
Almost there!

1046
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:12,110
Shizuku! Jump on!

1047
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,540
We made it!

1048
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,760
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.

1049
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,140
Here...

1050
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,990
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!

1051
01:45:04,025 --> 01:45:08,080
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.

1052
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:55,040
I wanted you to see this.

1053
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:01,510
Grandpa told me everything.

1054
01:46:01,545 --> 01:46:06,010
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.

1055
01:46:06,045 --> 01:46:09,180
No, you were the reason I did it.

1056
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:15,150
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1057
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,820
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.

1058
01:46:20,855 --> 01:46:23,280
Listen, Shizuku.

1059
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:28,040
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1060
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:30,960
...would you marry me?

1061
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:36,590
I'm going to be a violin maker
and then...

1062
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,090
You mean it?

1063
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:46,300
That's exactly what I wanted.

1064
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,600
Yeah? Great!

1065
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:52,020
Wait, it's cold.

1066
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:55,860
Shizuku, I love you!
