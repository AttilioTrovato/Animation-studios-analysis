1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,280
<i>Raccoon, Raccoon,
Come on out and play.</i>

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,642
<i>I can't right now, I'm eating.</i>

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,568
<i>What is it you're eating?</i>

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,688
<i>Pickled plums and radish.</i>

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,647
<i>How about some for me?</i>

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,722
<i>Hey. Don't be so greedy.</i>

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,609
<i>We raccoons
have always lived close by humans.</i>

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,923
<i>Not to steal their food. Not at all.</i>

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,927
<i>Where there are paddies and fields,</i>

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,838
<i>there are frogs and grasshoppers,
mice and moles.</i>

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,325
<i>There's fruit,
like persimmons and mulberries.</i>

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,999
<i>There's much more food
than in the woods.</i>

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,082
<i>Last spring, the old farmhouse
was suddenly abandoned.</i>

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,601
<i>It looked like no one was coming back,
so we all moved in.</i>

15
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,605
<i>We spent a really wonderful year there.</i>

16
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,599
<i>Living in a detached house
with a garden was like a dream.</i>

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,884
<i>But then...</i>

18
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,567
<i>We raccoons usually don't make a fuss
over territory, but this was different.</i>

19
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,801
<i>Wherever we went looking for food,
we ran into other raccoons.</i>

20
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,649
<i>There were quarrels,
and fights over burrows.</i>

21
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,039
<i>And finally...</i>

22
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,885
<i>Pom Poko 31, autumn.</i>

23
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,326
<i>On the newly logged border between
Taka and Suzu Woods,</i>

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,568
<i>the raccoons of the Tama Hills
gathered for their final battle.</i>

25
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,881
<i>The Red Army was commanded by Gonta,
a fearsome raccoon of Taka.</i>

26
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,286
<i>The Blue Army was led by Seizaemon,
an elder of Suzu.</i>

27
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,923
<i>Now, it's a little-known fact,</i>

28
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,126
<i>but when humans aren't around, raccoons
walk on two legs, just as you see here.</i>

29
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,326
<i>The battle was hard-fought,
but it did not last long.</i>

30
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,088
Fight! Fight! Taka!
Fight! Fight! Suzu!

31
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,248
Red wins! Blue wins!
Both of you lose!

32
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,798
Slaughter the losing raccoons!

33
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,448
Taka loses today,
Suzu loses tomorrow!

34
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,403
The raccoons have nowhere to go.

35
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,124
Where can the raccoons go to?

36
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,248
There's nowhere for them to go.

37
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,487
Whether Red wins or Blue wins,
both sides lose.

38
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,889
Kill the losing raccoons!

39
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,570
There are too many of them!

40
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,210
Fewer raccoons is better for all!

41
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,605
The rest of you,
control yourselves!

42
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,001
Stop having children!

43
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,485
Have more children
and you'll lose everything!

44
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,805
Your homes are disappearing,
and that's a fact!

45
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,325
<i>Granny Oroku was right.</i>

46
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,402
<i>The raccoons were stunned
by the desolation around them.</i>

47
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,441
<i>Their woods were disappearing.</i>

48
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,970
<i>A chilling panorama of denuded,
flattened hills</i>

49
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,847
<i>A chilling panorama of denuded,
flattened hills</i>

50
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,928
<i>stretched as far
as the eye could see.</i>

51
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,642
This is madness!

52
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,523
It's no time for us to be fighting!

53
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,927
<i>In those days, Japan was entering
a golden age of economic growth.</i>

54
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,006
<i>Demand for housing
around Tokyo exploded.</i>

55
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,839
<i>Lots of farmland and forest disappeared
in waves of uncontrolled development.</i>

56
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,403
<i>As Tokyo grew, it gnawed the land in
random patterns like a huge insect.</i>

57
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,799
<i>Then in 1967, the city fathers
hit on a better idea:</i>

58
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,161
<i>A plan for a new suburb of Tokyo
called Tama New Town.</i>

59
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,239
<i>Over 300,000 people would populate
an area of 3,000 hectares.</i>

60
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,369
<i>Forests would be cleared,
hills flattened, valleys filled,</i>

61
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,448
<i>farms and fields obliterated,
old farmhouses demolished.</i>

62
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,564
<i>The Tama Hills would be transformed
into an enormous construction site</i>

63
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,041
<i>to create a model bedroom town
for Tokyo's workers.</i>

64
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,401
<i>It was the largest urban development
project in history.</i>

65
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,246
You've got to hand it to these humans
they're really something.

66
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,840
We always thought
they were animals just like us,

67
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,921
but now we know we were wrong.

68
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,687
They must be even more powerful
than the gods.

69
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,685
<i>Raccoon clans
from all over the Tama Hills</i>

70
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,048
<i>gathered secretly late one night
at the old abandoned Manpuku Temple,</i>

71
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,604
<i>deep in the forest.</i>

72
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,005
<i>By unanimous agreement of all present,</i>

73
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,246
<i>the meeting was chaired
by Tsurukame Osho,</i>

74
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,049
<i>the temple's 105-year-old
resident raccoon.</i>

75
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,206
...so in view of
the current difficulties,

76
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,846
we must abandon our nocturnal habits

77
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,367
and be prepared to act
at any time of the day or night.

78
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,559
<i>Amid some confusion,</i>

79
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,926
<i>the assembly agreed
on a policy to stop the development.</i>

80
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,838
That makes it unanimous!

81
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,924
<i>The raccoons turned for home,</i>

82
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,207
<i>leaving it to the clan elders to work
out a specific course of action.</i>

83
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,849
<i>The elders settled
on a five-year program</i>

84
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,245
<i>to revive the neglected art
of shape-shifting</i>

85
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,644
<i>and study the ways of humans.</i>

86
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,409
<i>They invited renowned practitioners
of shape-shifting</i>

87
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,963
<i>from Sado and Shikoku islands,</i>

88
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,049
<i>where the art was most advanced,
to teach the young raccoons.</i>

89
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,121
<i>But in view of the difficulties</i>

90
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,806
<i>and danger posed by the long journeys
required to fetch these teachers,</i>

91
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,286
<i>there were none willing to go.
So, they all pretended to fall asleep.</i>

92
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,004
I suppose we'll just have to wait
for the youngsters

93
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,081
to acquire the skills on their own.

94
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,686
Agreed!

95
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,082
<i>The McDonald's hamburgers
provided to facilitate the discussion</i>

96
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>were enthusiastically received.</i>

97
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,527
<i>And with that,
the council of elders concluded.</i>

98
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,481
NO DUMPING

99
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,683
<i>Keeping close track of the doings of
humans was of the utmost importance,</i>

100
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,278
<i>so the raccoons decided
to set up a television</i>

101
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,483
<i>in their headquarters,
the main hall of Manpuku Temple.</i>

102
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,800
<i>- Good evening.
- Good evening!</i>

103
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,639
<i>The arrival of the television
provoked great interest.</i>

104
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,321
<i>The headquarters at Manpuku Temple
were soon crowded with visitors</i>

105
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,126
<i>who were there just to spend the day
watching television.</i>

106
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,360
Shape-shifting requires the highest
degree of mental concentration.

107
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,568
It means changing one's
very cells in an instant.

108
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,284
Truly, this is nature's
greatest miracle.

109
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,768
Lesser forms of transformation can be
achieved by such animals as chameleons.

110
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,726
But only raccoons, foxes and some old
cats can practice real shape-shifting.

111
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,358
Gonta!

112
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,009
That you can assume
such an appearance, even for a moment,

113
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,368
proves you've taken the first steps on
the path, whether you realize it or not.

114
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,129
If one studies hard
and grasps the basics,

115
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,038
any raccoon can learn to shape-shift.
At least in theory.

116
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,527
Allow me to demonstrate!

117
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,881
Aren't you going to put a leaf
on your head?

118
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,850
That's for beginners!

119
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,646
That's for beginners!

120
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,363
It's been a long time!

121
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,760
And a one, and a two!

122
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,240
<i>With Granny Oroku as their instructor,</i>

123
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,885
<i>the raccoons made steady progress
in the art of shape-shifting.</i>

124
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,130
<i>Young raccoons from every clan burned
with desire to hone their skills.</i>

125
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,323
Bravo, Shokichi!

126
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,199
- Gotcha!
- Gotcha!

127
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,207
Gotcha!

128
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,521
I've been interested in humans
and their ways ever since I was a child.

129
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,848
As a rule we weren't supposed
to approach them,

130
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,326
but for my late father, I think that
just sharpened his interest.

131
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,765
Careful observation of humans is
a basic requirement for shape-shifting,

132
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,121
so I'm sure he thought getting close
to them would prove useful.

133
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,085
<i>It goes without saying that some of our
raccoons were not good students.</i>

134
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,682
<i>In fact, many of them
simply couldn't manage at all.</i>

135
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,123
<i>Shape-shifting requires rigorous
physical and mental discipline.</i>

136
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,526
<i>Naturally this discouraged
many of the raccoons,</i>

137
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,448
<i>who unlike foxes,
are inclined to be rather lazy.</i>

138
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,446
Hey!

139
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,325
Ponkichi!

140
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,408
All the arhats are here! Turn them!

141
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,407
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!

142
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,919
Back then all I thought about
was shape-shifting.

143
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,006
I never dreamed
my childhood pal Ponkichi

144
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,089
wanted nothing more than to live
like a normal raccoon.

145
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,883
...so when the traveler
reached the mountain pass,

146
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:49,644
he saw the pine tree seemed
to have grown an extra branch.

147
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,725
Now, this was odd.

148
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,809
The traveler said to himself, "There
wasn't a branch on that side last time."

149
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,481
And lo and behold!
The branch switched sides.

150
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,362
Seeing this, the traveler said aloud,

151
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,402
"That's not right either.
There were branches on both sides."

152
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,727
And sure enough,
branches sprouted on both sides.

153
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,283
The next instant, boom!

154
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,283
Something fell!
What was it, do you suppose?

155
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,439
A raccoon!

156
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,286
Right! And why did he fall? Gonta?

157
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,163
He was a klutz. I'd never fall.

158
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,729
That's the spirit!
Sasuke, why do you think he fell?

159
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,645
He had to let go of the tree
to make two branches.

160
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,441
Very good! And what is the moral
of this story? Shokichi?

161
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,724
It doesn't pay to take
what humans say literally.

162
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,522
That's correct.
We raccoons are naturally good-natured.

163
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,801
We get carried away!
We try too hard to please!

164
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,166
This is where we go wrong.
Do you see?

165
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,569
Yes, Tsurukame Osho!

166
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:59,488
So if I were to say: "Mr. Raccoon,
Mr. Raccoon, come out and play"?

167
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,444
We're in the middle of a lesson now!

168
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,280
See? You're already getting
carried away! This is what worries me!

169
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,089
<i>As the raccoons worked to understand
humans and practice shape-shifting,</i>

170
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,164
<i>winter turned to spring. The plum trees
blossomed, and love was in the air.</i>

171
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,249
<i>But most of the raccoons heeded Granny
Oroku's admonition to remain chaste</i>

172
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,002
<i>and avoid having children until
everyone's homes were safe again.</i>

173
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,768
<i>They suppressed
their maternal instincts</i>

174
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,446
<i>and firmly rejected the clumsy efforts
of the males to woo them.</i>

175
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>Meanwhile, the massive building program
was picking up steam.</i>

176
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,046
<i>Woods were cleared,
the earth was scoured,</i>

177
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,206
<i>and construction sites multiplied.</i>

178
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,446
<i>The raccoons,
filled with anger and sadness,</i>

179
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,603
<i>called these sites "bald hills."</i>

180
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,126
<i>Mr. Postman, you dropped something</i>

181
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,688
<i>Freed from the work of child-rearing,</i>

182
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,246
<i>some of the females started
to practice shape-shifting too.</i>

183
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,328
<i>When males tried to pass themselves
off as women or children,</i>

184
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,486
<i>the overall effect was not quite right.</i>

185
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,568
<i>With the participation of the females,
this problem was solved.</i>

186
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,489
<i>Naturally, some of the females wanted to
try their hand at turning into males.</i>

187
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,199
Ah, I'd like the males
to stay after class today.

188
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,121
<i>One day, Tsurukame Osho
gave a special lecture for the males.</i>

189
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:58,245
Now then, what do you think
the carpet you are all sitting on is?

190
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,644
I may as well tell you.
It's my testicles!

191
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,121
It's exactly eight mats.
And I'll prove it!

192
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,729
<i>The time finally came for the students
to test their skills in the real world.</i>

193
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,765
<i>The exercise was conducted
like a driving lesson.</i>

194
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,326
<i>Each student was accompanied
by an advanced partner,</i>

195
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,204
<i>in case of unforeseen problems or
someone seeing through their disguise.</i>

196
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,084
<i>Shape-shifting requires
large amounts of energy,</i>

197
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,599
<i>especially when assuming human form.</i>

198
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,560
<i>The dark circles
raccoons have around their eyes</i>

199
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,968
<i>are the result of sheer fatigue.</i>

200
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,245
<i>Even experienced shape-shifters</i>

201
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,009
<i>have to secretly carry special herbs</i>

202
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,405
<i>to replenish their strength
at a moment's notice.</i>

203
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,327
<i>Otherwise, out pops the tail,</i>

204
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,683
<i>and the next thing you know,
they're back to their original form.</i>

205
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,488
<i>Recently raccoons have discovered</i>

206
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,519
<i>that quick-acting energy drinks widely
sold in stores are a good pick-me-up.</i>

207
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,449
<i>To graduate
from the shape-shifting course,</i>

208
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,282
<i>students had to pass one final test:</i>

209
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,369
<i>To go out and earn at least
1,000 yen through honest labor.</i>

210
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,926
Help!

211
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,803
<i>Some raccoons got together and took
turns impersonating the same human.</i>

212
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,161
<i>Others transformed themselves
into monks with begging bowls.</i>

213
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,966
<i>Some females worked in clubs and raked
in money drinking with customers.</i>

214
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,767
<i>Another raccoon parlayed a discarded
pachinko ball into big money.</i>

215
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,405
<i>One tricky raccoon
burgled a temple donation box,</i>

216
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,082
<i>but all he got was small change.</i>

217
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,044
<i>So he transformed some leaves into
bills, but Oroku saw right through him.</i>

218
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,402
I told you modern shape-shifting
forbids turning leaves into money!

219
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,160
<i>One day, an urgent report interrupted
Gonta's training at headquarters.</i>

220
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,487
<i>He hurried home
to Taka Woods to face tragedy.</i>

221
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:44,607
<i>More than half his childhood home had
already been ravaged by construction.</i>

222
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,130
<i>Gonta went mad with grief.</i>

223
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,165
<i>Gonta went mad with grief.</i>

224
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,882
<i>He raced back to headquarters</i>

225
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,968
<i>and forced Tsurukame Osho
to call a meeting of the clan elders,</i>

226
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,082
<i>where he called for a strategy
of violent attacks on the humans.</i>

227
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,682
I'm completely against this.

228
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,765
Why?

229
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,644
The time is not ripe. We're still
in the first year of the Five-Year Plan.

230
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,246
We've all completed our training.
There's a lot we can do right now!

231
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,882
What do you think, Granny? Do you think
these youngsters are up to it?

232
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,246
True, they've mastered the basics,
but...

233
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,849
But?

234
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,129
They lack experience.
One slip and they'll be exposed.

235
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,649
Gonta, I have to ask you this.

236
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:32,846
I think your anger at what happened to
Taka Woods is clouding your judgment.

237
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,846
Isn't that so?

238
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,479
I swear there is
absolutely no truth to that.

239
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,523
I'm thinking of the welfare
of all the raccoons of Tama.

240
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,403
What do you mean, everyone's welfare?

241
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,280
Don't forget, Gonta's the one
who tried to take over Suzu Woods!

242
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,200
Shut up! Even if no one's for it, we
raccoons of Taka are going ahead anyway.

243
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,128
If Gonta's that determined,
I'm going to help him!

244
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,888
You too, Shokichi?

245
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,648
Thank you!

246
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,007
It's too late to stop us now!

247
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,808
Not so fast!

248
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,569
Don't try to stop us, Granny!

249
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,963
Just this once,
I'll teach you a special technique!

250
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,643
If you bungle this,

251
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,967
you won't return to your original form
for five days.

252
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,643
So, what is it?

253
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,760
A dead fox!

254
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,046
<i>Pom Poko 32, summer.</i>

255
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,765
<i>Ten young volunteers
led by Gonta of Taka Woods</i>

256
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,569
<i>set out to apply
their new skills in shape-shifting</i>

257
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,887
<i>with a series of desperate
surprise attacks on the humans.</i>

258
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,088
<i>The raccoons were fighting back at last.</i>

259
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,248
- Here they come!
- They're coming!

260
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,960
Keep going! Keep going!

261
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,888
We did it!

262
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,248
Multiple Accidents At
Construction Site

263
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,919
<i>Disaster struck the Tama New Town
development at approximately 2:30 p.m.</i>

264
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,840
<i>A series of landslides and accidents
killed three workers, injured two,</i>

265
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,122
<i>and destroyed
a residence under construction.</i>

266
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,240
Live

267
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,602
<i>Police suspect reduced visibility
and unstable ground from heavy rains.</i>

268
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,123
<i>The widespread, simultaneous nature of
the accidents is raising concern</i>

269
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,162
<i>there may be fundamental problems
with the development plan.</i>

270
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,280
<i>Some local residents
are calling for a review of the plan.</i>

271
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,201
Hold on, everyone!

272
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,599
I think we should take a moment

273
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,528
to remember the poor humans
who died in this operation.

274
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,647
Osho is right.

275
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,686
Let's observe a minute of silent prayer
for the unfortunate victims.

276
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,563
Agreed! A minute of silence!

277
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,681
All pray!

278
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,805
Look, it's Gonta!

279
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,121
The heroes have returned!

280
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,801
You really did it, Shokichi!

281
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,128
You youngsters have put hope back
in this old heart of mine.

282
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,763
That was only the beginning!
Today was just a practice run!

283
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,244
Raccoons, the war has started!

284
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,966
We must kill, crush,
and mangle every human we can,

285
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,729
until they are
driven from the Tama Hills!

286
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,364
Shokichi, you should say something too!

287
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,649
And let's plant trees! Lots and lots of
our favorite persimmon trees!

288
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,925
Little persimmon seeds,
send out your shoots!

289
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,568
We'll have
all the persimmons we can eat!

290
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,250
Out with the humans!
Slaughter the humans!

291
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,404
OK, OK, OK. But first we must celebrate
this auspicious victory!

292
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,239
You know, something worries me.

293
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,760
What?

294
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,438
Are we really going to
drive out all the humans?

295
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,559
Of course!

296
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,205
Can't we let a few of them stay,
the way it used to be?

297
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,924
No way!
The two-legs are our sworn enemies.

298
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,087
They're vermin. We've got to
get rid of them once and for all!

299
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,883
I see.
I mean, look, I hate humans too.

300
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,603
Well, some of them are not so bad.
I mean, I really do hate them. But...

301
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,558
But what?

302
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,969
But if we get rid of them all,
we'll never eat tempura again!

303
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,404
Or sardines!

304
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,440
Or corn!

305
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:37,726
Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!
Potato chips! Pizza!

306
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,799
I can taste it!

307
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,083
Well then, Gonta, shall we
let a few of the humans stay?

308
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,478
I guess it can't be helped.

309
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,405
Hooray for Gon!
Lift him up, fellows!

310
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:58,167
<i>The moon, moon, moon shines bright</i>

311
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,927
<i>Over Man, Man, Manpuku Temple</i>

312
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,838
<i>All our friends are here tonight
Pon poko pon pon, pon pon!</i>

313
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,165
<i>We'll show the world
What Tsurukame Osho can do!</i>

314
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,883
<i>Come on, come on! All our friends are
here tonight! Come on, come on!</i>

315
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,688
<i>... a government spokesman stressed</i>

316
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,644
<i>that the project is an urgent necessity
for the people of Tokyo,</i>

317
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,961
<i>and that today's accidents
will not affect</i>

318
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,685
<i>the government's determination to carry
out the building of Tama New Town.</i>

319
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,718
What?!

320
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,722
<i>It was a very unfortunate accident.</i>

321
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,638
<i>Poor Gonta,
the driving force behind the attacks,</i>

322
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,685
<i>suffered fractures and internal injuries
that would take a year to heal.</i>

323
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,289
<i>The news report plunged
the raccoons into depression.</i>

324
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,198
<i>But when television began to cover local
residents' fears of divine retribution,</i>

325
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,327
<i>their spirits soared again.</i>

326
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,320
<i>Maybe it was a mistake,
moving that Shinto shrine.</i>

327
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,326
<i>How do you mean?</i>

328
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,605
<i>Maybe all these incidents are revenge
from the gods of the shrine.</i>

329
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,764
<i>It's true that a lot of Jizo statues
and shrines have been moved.</i>

330
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,920
<i>Yes, that really worried me.</i>

331
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,723
<i>I asked the developers to observe
the proper ceremonies</i>

332
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,607
<i>before moving them, but...</i>

333
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,927
<i>Professor Mizuki,
what do you think about all this?</i>

334
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:31,044
<i>These spirit entities are usually
associated with a given location.</i>

335
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,441
<i>If their abodes are moved,
they'll try to return home.</i>

336
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,483
<i>If they do, and find everything has
changed, they naturally become upset.</i>

337
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,046
<i>I have a feeling there's a lot more
trouble to come.</i>

338
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,561
Maybe I can save my woods after all.

339
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,203
<i>Shokichi and the others
went into action.</i>

340
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,523
<i>The owner of Shokichi's woods
came to inspect his property</i>

341
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,164
<i>with one of the developers
before construction began.</i>

342
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,327
<i>To his surprise, he saw a lot more
Jizo statues than he remembered.</i>

343
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,846
<i>"I'd better give this more thought,"
he told the developer,</i>

344
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,404
<i>and held off on signing
the contract to sell his land.</i>

345
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,839
<i>During a ceremony at another shrine
that was slated to be moved,</i>

346
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:27,569
<i>one of the raccoons suddenly appeared
on the roof disguised as a fox,</i>

347
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,204
<i>the shrine's servant to the gods.</i>

348
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,570
<i>The fox's eerie cry brought the
proceedings to an immediate halt.</i>

349
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,320
<i>The fox's eerie cry brought the
proceedings to an immediate halt.</i>

350
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,487
<i>The ceremony was canceled,
the shrine's relocation put on hold,</i>

351
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,601
<i>and residents petitioned the authorities</i>

352
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,682
<i>to change plans for a road
through the area.</i>

353
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,246
<i>The raccoons were on a roll.</i>

354
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:04,249
<i>Each group tried to outdo the others
in a campaign of guerrilla operations.</i>

355
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,719
Come this way!

356
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,686
Go away!

357
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,445
Take it with you!

358
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,565
Let's take all the trash
and leftovers with us.

359
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,288
The leftovers!

360
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,089
Leave them behind!

361
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,926
Is something wrong, miss?

362
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,761
What's the trouble?

363
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,009
I have no face!

364
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,648
A goblin!

365
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,006
- J-j-just now, I... I saw
- A murder?

366
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,961
N-no, it was...

367
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,050
Not a murder? Too bad!

368
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,128
Th-th-there was a woman!

369
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,482
- Did she have a mouth like a shark?
- No! No! She was... I mean...

370
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,449
Then, was she something like this?

371
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,963
It's her!

372
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,765
Was... she... something... like... this?

373
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:20,729
<i>The raccoons took endless delight
in frightening the humans.</i>

374
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,601
<i>After every big success,
they held a celebration.</i>

375
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,365
<i>But Gonta, the one who started it all,</i>

376
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,482
<i>showed no signs of recovering
from his injuries.</i>

377
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,965
<i>His loving wife Otama
cared for him tenderly,</i>

378
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,480
<i>but she could not soothe his frustration
at being out of the fight.</i>

379
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,080
<i>Frankly, Gonta thought
his raccoon friends were wimps.</i>

380
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,923
<i>Yesterday's News Train was priceless.</i>

381
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,439
That special about
"Tama New Goblin Town."

382
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,323
They interviewed the cop we scared.

383
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,843
The other guests laughed in his face.
He was so furious! I almost died!

384
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,843
Idiot! So what?
Are they going to stop the project

385
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,409
just because of stuff like that?

386
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,998
If you're going to shape-shift,
do it the way I did!

387
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,321
Cause accidents, and kill them!

388
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,204
- Oh, no!
- Gonta!

389
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,924
<i>It was just as Gonta said.</i>

390
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,887
<i>The project didn't stop.</i>

391
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,885
<i>Rivers were encased in concrete,
roads were laid out everywhere,</i>

392
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,807
<i>masses of building material flowed in,</i>

393
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,240
<i>and the construction of thousands of
apartments finally got under way.</i>

394
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,690
<i>The strange happenings on the
construction sites and in the hills</i>

395
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,839
<i>The strange happenings on the
construction sites and in the hills</i>

396
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,998
<i>received nationwide coverage.</i>

397
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,127
<i>The raccoons became more and more
confident of ultimate victory.</i>

398
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,724
Rock, paper, scissors...

399
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,680
<i>Pom Poko Year 32, autumn.</i>

400
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,086
<i>It was time to choose messengers
to travel to Sado and Shikoku islands,</i>

401
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,202
<i>to seek the help of famous masters
in the art of shape-shifting.</i>

402
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,002
<i>Tamasaburo of Oni Woods
was chosen to go to Shikoku.</i>

403
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,929
<i>Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh
was chosen to travel to Sado.</i>

404
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,729
<i>So at the next full moon,</i>

405
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,082
<i>the two young raccoons
said farewell to their comrades</i>

406
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,606
<i>and set out for their destinations
in high spirits.</i>

407
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,049
What a smell!

408
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,009
<i>The raccoons continued
haunting the construction sites.</i>

409
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,323
<i>They were having so much fun
with their shape-shifting,</i>

410
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,403
<i>they almost didn't care
whether it was effective or not.</i>

411
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,648
- Out with the demons!
- Daddy!

412
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,804
Will this really
drive out the humans?

413
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,964
Won't they see through us
one of these days?

414
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,919
Maybe we should really go after them,
like Gonta says.

415
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,327
What does it matter
if one or two get killed?

416
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,440
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question."

417
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,445
Kiyo!

418
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,202
What are you doing up there?

419
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,689
Something wrong with your neck?

420
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,324
I was posing for you.
I was hoping you'd say I was pretty.

421
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,760
Oh, sorry.

422
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,605
Now there really is something wrong
with my neck.

423
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,000
You looked pretty.

424
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,765
It's too late.

425
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,723
I mean it.

426
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,119
It's OK.
I just need more practice.

427
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,523
<i>One day a raccoon
from Potamochi Mountain...</i>

428
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,321
Everyone likes that song, don't they?
I kind of like it myself.

429
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,007
<i>Do you know the song,
Where Are You From?</i>

430
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,285
Yes, but I can't sing all the lyrics.

431
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,439
That song used to be...

432
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,361
<i>There was a raccoon from Senba
Along came a hunter...</i>

433
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,886
A hunter shot my grandpa.

434
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,203
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

435
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,765
That's OK.
But Grandpa wasn't boiled or fried.

436
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,599
Someone paid a lot for his pelt.

437
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,763
I really like your fur too.

438
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,963
Why, that makes me happy.
Coming from you, that is.

439
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,165
So, what were you going to say
about that song?

440
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,004
My father used to sing it.

441
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,569
He was a good ball-bouncer too.

442
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,284
He must have been a character.

443
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,084
Whenever he got to the end of the song,
he always warned us.

444
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,919
About what?

445
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,883
"You kids better remember:

446
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,120
Even in a simple ball-bouncing song,

447
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,440
you hear about the cruel nature
of humans."

448
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,121
"How they hunt us raccoons, kill us
and eat us. And don't you forget it!"

449
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,360
Say, shall we bounce balls?

450
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,843
Are you good at it?

451
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,722
Yes, I'm pretty good.

452
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,327
Then I better do my best too!

453
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,922
<i>Where are you from? Higo.
Where's Higo?</i>

454
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,487
<i>In Kumamoto. Where's Kumamoto?
In Semba.</i>

455
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,159
<i>There was a raccoon from Semba.</i>

456
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,200
<i>Along came...</i>

457
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,289
Shokichi, when are you going to do that
"Operation Twin Star" you talked about?

458
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,799
Oh, I don't really
want to do it anymore.

459
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,319
But it was such a good plan.

460
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,841
Why don't we do it tonight?
Just the two of us.

461
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,847
With you?

462
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,843
Are you afraid
to do it with me?

463
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,206
No, it's not that. It's just...

464
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,205
Then let's try.
I'm sure it will go over really well.

465
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,644
OK, let's do it! With you as my partner,
I bet things will go great.

466
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,525
I can't wait!

467
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,404
Well, well,
what adorable little children!

468
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,006
We just got back from a trip
to the stars, but our home is gone.

469
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,958
A trip to the stars?

470
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,045
From red-eyed Scorpio
to the Eagle's wings...

471
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,686
From the coils of the Snake
to the brow of the Bear Cub!

472
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,890
We sprinkle the dew and frost
as we fly among the stars.

473
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,319
What is this?!

474
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,124
Our home is gone! We're cold!

475
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,889
Mister, do you know
where our home went?

476
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,122
Your home?
I don't know what you mean.

477
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,565
Nobody knows! Run along now!

478
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,164
We should call the police.
Someone get the police here!

479
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,049
Hey, what are you kids doing?

480
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,240
They're not kids,
they're gremlins!

481
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,280
Gremlins?!

482
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,125
Little gremlins,
please don't be angry!

483
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,200
Now, just hold on a minute.

484
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,805
I'll treat you right! You want a raise?
Come on, give me a break!

485
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:07,165
Nope, I've had it. I'm going back home.
I can't stay in these haunted hills.

486
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,043
Come on, Suzuki.

487
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,085
I heard Tokyo was a scary place,
but this is too much for me.

488
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,326
You'd best stop the construction.

489
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,883
Whether it's gods or devils,

490
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,002
somebody or something
is really upset about this project.

491
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,688
<i>The raccoons cheered.</i>

492
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,246
<i>That evening's celebrations
were especially grand.</i>

493
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,000
<i>Naturally, the guests of honor
were the two heroes, Kiyo and Shokichi.</i>

494
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:49,287
<i>Meanwhile, the workers' quarters
were dark and silent.</i>

495
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,924
<i>But the next morning...</i>

496
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,283
<i>It seemed there was
an endless supply of humans.</i>

497
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,486
<i>No matter how many
the raccoons scared away,</i>

498
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,159
<i>there were always others
to take their place.</i>

499
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,848
It's rumored among local residents

500
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,768
that this may be
the work of foxes and raccoons.

501
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,328
That would make things simple enough.

502
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,443
All we'd have to do is
exterminate all the offending animals.

503
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,489
<i>The raccoons monitoring the broadcast
were shocked.</i>

504
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,280
<i>But these incidents
are right out of old folk tales.</i>

505
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,482
<i>It's not surprising people think
foxes and raccoons are behind it.</i>

506
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,489
<i>But that's precisely what proves
this is all just malicious rumors.</i>

507
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,846
<i>What do you mean, rumors?!
I saw it with my own eyes!</i>

508
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,283
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

509
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,408
<i>In that case, we'll issue an
extermination order for these pests.</i>

510
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,369
<i>As soon as you find
any more raccoons playing more tricks,</i>

511
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,242
<i>let us know immediately.</i>

512
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,289
<i>That is, if you can prove it!</i>

513
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,120
<i>Shokichi was not the only one
who wondered</i>

514
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,969
<i>whether shape-shifting was enough
to drive out the humans.</i>

515
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,049
As you all know, the Edo period
was a golden age for raccoons.

516
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,679
Raccoon shape-shifting was a frequent
subject for painters and writers.

517
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,527
But unfortunately,
we raccoons were too conspicuous.

518
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,289
We aroused the resentment of humans.

519
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,200
In the modern era,
we've been hunted for our pelts,

520
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,640
and our fur has been used
for paintbrushes and toothbrushes.

521
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,689
That's how the humans
took revenge for our excesses.

522
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,562
Don't any of you ever forget:

523
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,448
The past few decades
have been peaceful for us raccoons

524
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,169
only because we've exercised restraint

525
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:40,644
and not used shape-shifting too often.

526
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,486
Our talents are a two-edged sword.

527
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,649
I want all of you to use this technique
with discretion.

528
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,123
Otherwise, we'll invite further
retribution from the humans.

529
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,241
<i>Oroku's speech dashed cold water
on the spirits of the young raccoons.</i>

530
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,120
<i>And now autumn was upon them,</i>

531
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,208
<i>the time of year when raccoons
need enough food to store ample fat</i>

532
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,608
<i>and grow the long, fluffy coats
needed for the coming winter.</i>

533
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,886
<i>The young raccoons focused their
attention and shape-shifting skills</i>

534
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,366
<i>on getting food for the winter.</i>

535
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:41,082
<i>One day, an exhausted raccoon
arrived in the Tama Hills.</i>

536
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,046
Don't worry, we're raccoons too!

537
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,889
Thank you very much.

538
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,040
You seem completely worn out.
Where did you come from?

539
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,523
From Fujino Woods.

540
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,481
Is that on Shikoku island?
Sado island?

541
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,319
Why, no.
It's just over the mountains from here.

542
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:24,006
Just over the mountains?
So you're not from Shikoku after all.

543
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,169
Oh, my, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

544
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,362
No, it's just that we've been waiting
for someone from there.

545
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,449
So, what brought you here?

546
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:40,483
Now I finally know
where all that dirt is coming from,

547
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,487
the dirt that's ruining our woods!

548
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,245
<i>According to this raccoon named Hayashi,</i>

549
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,728
<i>a huge amount of excavated dirt was
being illegally dumped in Fujino Woods.</i>

550
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,001
<i>The streams were polluted,
there were frequent landslides,</i>

551
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,368
<i>and the raccoons and other animals
of the woods were in dire straits.</i>

552
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,245
<i>To find out where all this
discarded earth was coming from,</i>

553
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,926
<i>Hayashi assumed human form and caught
a ride on one of the dump trucks.</i>

554
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,084
<i>Unfortunately, shape-shifting
was not one of his strong points.</i>

555
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,640
<i>The swaying of the truck and the stress
of the journey made him fall asleep,</i>

556
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,159
<i>and he changed back into a raccoon.</i>

557
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,522
It's not just Fujino Woods.
Other woods are being ruined too.

558
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,848
And now there are garbage dumps
and golf courses all over the place.

559
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,201
Our Tama Hills are leveled,
and we suffer.

560
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,245
Then the dirt is dumped in Fujino Woods,
and you suffer.

561
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,680
When will this insanity end?

562
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,641
And I was so astonished
at what I found here!

563
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,281
I thought the trucks came from
some site in the middle of Tokyo.

564
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,600
But we're in the hills here!

565
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,039
They dig up one hill
and dump it on another!

566
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,083
I just can't understand
why the humans are doing this.

567
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,206
So if we stop the construction,

568
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,606
it will help the raccoons
in Fujino Woods too, right?

569
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,687
What stirring words!

570
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,165
I beg you all to use
your skills in shape-shifting

571
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,765
to save our woods too!

572
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,004
Well, you see, it's not really
that simple, even for us.

573
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,845
Where could Bunta and Tamasaburo be?

574
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,246
They were supposed to go
and fetch the masters to help us.

575
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,767
<i>There was no word from Shikoku or Sado.</i>

576
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,041
<i>And so winter came to the Tama Hills.</i>

577
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,684
<i>With the raccoons down for the winter,</i>

578
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,807
<i>the haunting of Tama New Town
was forgotten,</i>

579
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,319
<i>and media attention evaporated.</i>

580
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,163
<i>The papers were filled with stories
of celebrity scandals</i>

581
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,322
<i>and sordid political goings on.</i>

582
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,406
<i>Sleet covers the garden
of Manpuku Temple</i>

583
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,278
<i>The sleet's like ice cream!</i>

584
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,198
<i>All our friends are here!
Pom poko pon pon, pon pon!</i>

585
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,560
<i>New Year's Day, Pom Poko 33.</i>

586
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,087
<i>The Tama Hills greeted the new year
covered with a rare blanket of snow.</i>

587
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,649
<i>Most of the construction workers had
already returned to their hometowns</i>

588
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,884
<i>and were enjoying the holidays
surrounded by their families.</i>

589
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:45,038
Push! Push! Push!

590
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,682
<i>Our golden balls swing and swing</i>

591
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,564
<i>Though there's not a breath of wind</i>

592
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:08,284
<i>The baby raccoon sees our balls
And swings his too...</i>

593
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,168
We saw it! It really happened!

594
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,963
A bunch of raccoons pushed
that earth mover over the cliff!

595
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,079
We're not lying!

596
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,885
<i>Police suspect the workers, who stayed
behind over the new year holidays,</i>

597
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,760
<i>were inspired by the numerous pranks
that finally stopped last fall.</i>

598
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,120
<i>However, snow around
the crime scene has melted,</i>

599
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,206
<i>and it may be difficult
to gather evidence.</i>

600
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,400
I hope you know what you're doing,
Shokichi.

601
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,839
Oh, I think we'll be all right.

602
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,847
What a stupid prank.

603
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,158
Not at all.

604
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:35,770
Shokichi was trying to encourage
the raccoons who can't shape-shift

605
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,489
Shokichi was trying to encourage
the raccoons who can't shape-shift

606
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,969
by giving them a way to help.

607
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,722
What do you think, Osho?

608
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,525
Hmm, I don't see any great harm done.

609
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,680
<i>It was just as Osho predicted.</i>

610
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,598
<i>The three workers were released
for lack of evidence.</i>

611
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,443
<i>Naturally, no one believed the raccoons
were responsible.</i>

612
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,004
<i>The case remained unsolved.</i>

613
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,841
<i>And so spring came.</i>

614
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,926
<i>The season of love
had arrived once again</i>

615
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,408
<i>The raccoons had been chaste
for more than a year,</i>

616
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,163
<i>and were unable
to control themselves any longer.</i>

617
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:23,408
<i>The air was filled with sweet nothings,
and the raccoons</i>

618
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,284
<i>pursued and wooed each other
until the very skies turned rosy.</i>

619
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,438
Hanako! Wait!

620
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,324
Hanako!

621
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,646
You're walking much better!

622
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,690
Hanako! Wait just a minute!

623
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,244
Can't you catch me?

624
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,845
Everyone has spring fever.

625
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,723
I guess we're all
like the flowers and the trees.

626
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,645
When winter ends
and the sun shines down on us,

627
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,840
we can't help sending out shoots.

628
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,367
Then at last we blossom and bear fruit.

629
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,120
But we have to keep
our promise to Granny.

630
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,004
Let's stay chaste
until we've finally won this war.

631
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,241
Shokichi, you're so wonderful.

632
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,486
I'm so happy!

633
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,285
Our love will last forever!

634
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,365
Shokichi!

635
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,762
<i>That was a mistake.</i>

636
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,568
<i>Their love grew passionate,</i>

637
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:50,165
<i>and later that year, four charming young
raccoons were born to Kiyo and Shokichi.</i>

638
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,442
Kincho Daimyo Shrine

639
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,401
<i>Now the previous autumn,</i>

640
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,328
<i>Tamasaburo had managed to reach
the island of Shikoku</i>

641
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,965
<i>after many trials and hardships.</i>

642
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:00,685
<i>He presented his request for help to
the master of shape-shifting, Kincho VI,</i>

643
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,529
<i>but then he collapsed
and was very ill for many weeks.</i>

644
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,120
<i>Luckily, Kincho had a daughter, Koharu,
who stayed by Tamasaburo's bedside</i>

645
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,241
<i>and miraculously
nursed him back to health.</i>

646
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,600
<i>With the coming of spring,
their bond deepened,</i>

647
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,841
<i>and Koharu bore Tamasaburo three cubs.</i>

648
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:24,607
<i>The island's elders held a council
in the inner chambers of the shrine.</i>

649
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,963
<i>They all agreed that success
in stopping Tama New Town</i>

650
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:35,923
<i>would be an important blow against
similar construction all over Japan.</i>

651
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,763
<i>But the elders were divided
as to who to send,</i>

652
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,721
<i>how affairs in Shikoku would be handled,</i>

653
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,449
<i>and how to avoid any succession disputes
that might arise</i>

654
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,283
<i>in case something should happen
to one of the participants.</i>

655
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,925
<i>Hundreds of questions were raised,
but no conclusions were reached.</i>

656
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:56,246
It's such beautiful weather. But Father
and the others just talk, talk, talk.

657
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,685
They've been debating
for six months now.

658
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,041
When will they ever reach a decision?

659
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,202
Oh, I hope they never reach a decision!

660
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,088
Tamasaburo, just the thought
that you might someday return

661
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,968
to far-off Tama Hills
makes my heart ache with sadness.

662
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:32,039
Koharu... I too dream that
this happiness we have may never end.

663
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,646
Why must it be just a dream?

664
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,445
I'll ask Father.

665
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,882
I'll ask him to let you stay here
and be his successor.

666
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:01,523
<i>While Tamasaburo was struggling
to make a decision,</i>

667
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:06,849
<i>Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh roamed the
fields and mountains of Sado island,</i>

668
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,530
<i>searching for a master of shape-shifting
called Danzaburo.</i>

669
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,646
<i>Searching for a master of shape-shifting
called Danzaburo.</i>

670
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:17,444
<i>But he found no one who knew anything
about the master's whereabouts.</i>

671
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,961
<i>During the summer and fall of that year,</i>

672
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,048
<i>the raccoons of Tama Hills
were beset by a series of misfortunes.</i>

673
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,645
<i>Their woods continued to shrink
before the onslaught of development.</i>

674
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:36,809
<i>And just when the baby boom of spring
had brought many new mouths to feed,</i>

675
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,799
<i>poor summer weather
brought a serious food shortage.</i>

676
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,208
<i>There were not nearly enough chestnuts
and persimmons to eat that fall.</i>

677
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,400
<i>Those with shape-shifting skills
tried to help</i>

678
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,566
<i>by gathering food meant for humans,</i>

679
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,160
<i>but it was still not nearly enough
to feed the growing cubs.</i>

680
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,405
<i>Finally, even raccoons
who could not shape-shift</i>

681
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,880
<i>were forced to come out of the woods
and scavenge around human dwellings,</i>

682
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:14,046
<i>looking for anything
to feed their children.</i>

683
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,480
<i>Inevitably, some of them
began to lose their lives</i>

684
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,445
<i>on the roads and in traps.</i>

685
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,805
I can't take any more!

686
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:03,048
The time has come for each of us
to take at least one human life,

687
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,364
even if we lose our own.

688
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,323
Are you sure you're all right now,
Gonta?

689
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,965
Of course! See? I'm in the pink!

690
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:22,648
This is wonderful.
When should we celebrate your recovery?

691
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,127
This isn't the time for parties, Granny.

692
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,167
I think we should wait for the masters
of shape-shifting to get here

693
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,520
before we decide our strategy.

694
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,046
You too, Shokichi?
You're too young to be such a coward.

695
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,644
You're wrong.
We can't underestimate the humans.

696
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,728
If we attack them head on,
they'll destroy us.

697
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,761
We've waited long enough!

698
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:48,962
Be patient. Let's hear Shokichi out.

699
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,402
I propose we adopt three policies
until the masters arrive.

700
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:58,081
One: Establish a system of distributing
food to raccoons who can't shape-shift.

701
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,246
In other words, a rationing system.

702
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,687
Two: Thorough training
in traffic safety.

703
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,406
Three: Formation of rescue squads
for raccoons caught in traps.

704
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,361
That's my proposal.

705
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:17,041
Shokichi, you're practically
like one of the humans.

706
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,929
No! I'm a raccoon, born and bred.

707
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:27,322
Well then, leaving the particulars
to later. All in favor?

708
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,042
Hands up!

709
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,049
In favor!

710
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,441
What is this nonsense, Gonta?

711
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,401
<i>It's not nonsense! It's a coup d'etat!</i>

712
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,843
Anyone who opposes me from now on will
be killed by my private guard! Got it?

713
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,118
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

714
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,322
That's "Sir Gon."

715
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,882
Raccoons!
We all know the humans are dangerous.

716
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,167
If we attack without concern for
our own safety, victory will be ours.

717
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,920
They can be killed. As the saying goes,
"a trapped mouse will beat the cat."

718
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,962
What's that supposed to mean?

719
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,409
He doesn't look like a mouse.

720
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,640
He means, we can win,
if we're desperate.

721
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,089
Exactly.

722
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:12,446
If a mouse is cornered,
he'll find the strength to beat the cat.

723
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,125
We're not mice, Gonta.

724
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,087
What's the point in beating a cat?

725
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:22,489
Come to think of it, it's been a while
since I had a nice mouse.

726
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,168
Mouse tempura can't be beat.

727
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,324
No, deep fried is the tastiest!

728
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:30,886
Are you sure? I think the tempura batter
really makes it.

729
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,320
That crispy deep fried tail!

730
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,607
What the hell are you talking about!?

731
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,969
What's important is
I love mouse tempura! Yes, I do!

732
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,567
See Gonta?
All we can think about is food.

733
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,280
I think we'd better wait for the masters
to get here.

734
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,489
My apologies.

735
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,443
I suppose it was too much

736
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,927
to expect the young raccoons to stay
chaste and not have babies.

737
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,570
No! Instead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!

738
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,879
The places they've infested
used to be our homes!

739
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,370
The humans are the intruders!
Drive them out!

740
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,088
The humans are the intruders!
Drive them out!

741
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,645
Kill them!

742
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,999
Drive them out! Kill them!

743
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,129
<i>But at that very moment...</i>

744
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,438
Hey, taxi!

745
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,087
I'll tell everyone you're here!

746
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,445
Tamasaburo!

747
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,879
I've brought the masters from Shikoku!

748
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,161
Tamasaburo! You did it!

749
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:50,046
Friends, on our way here
we saw your devastated woods.

750
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,649
You have our deepest sympathy.

751
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,969
We'd like to address all raccoons
tonight. There's no time to lose.

752
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,806
<i>Pompoko 33, autumn.</i>

753
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,401
<i>All the raccoons assembled to welcome
the three masters from Shikoku.</i>

754
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,249
There's a good moon out tonight.

755
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:15,285
Fellow raccoons,
I am Tazaburo Hage of Yashima.

756
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:20,359
I am 999 years old.

757
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:28,084
Why is Honshu ravaged by development,
while Shikoku is almost untouched?

758
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:33,568
The reason is, we raccoons
protect our woods vigilantly.

759
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,000
The humans of Shikoku know

760
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:43,285
that disaster will befall them
if they anger us.

761
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:46,800
In fact, all three of us are worshipped

762
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:52,243
at every shrine and temple in Shikoku.

763
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,930
The humans revere us.

764
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,206
But I have not introduced myself.

765
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:04,849
I am Inugami Gyobu, supreme leader
of the raccoons of Matsuyama.

766
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:12,605
I am Kincho VI, direct descendant of the
first raccoon master of Kincho Shrine.

767
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:16,928
To frighten the humans of Tokyo
and drive them out,

768
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:20,406
we have resolved to carry out
Operation Goblin.

769
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,285
This operation will require

770
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,369
unprecedented powers
of mental concentration,

771
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,847
concentration so great that
the three of us may lose our lives.

772
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:37,927
But if you successfully
carry out this plan,

773
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,645
you will regain the humans' fear

774
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:46,366
and their respect without fail.

775
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:53,166
And then, you can use the humans'
fear and respect of raccoons

776
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:58,159
to put an end to this infernal
construction once and for all!

777
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,208
We have a full array of potent tricks.

778
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,845
We have brought you a boat,
oh raccoons,

779
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:08,645
that will ferry all of you
back to a lost era of greatness!

780
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:13,446
We promise you: All who come aboard will
reach those blessed shores without fail!

781
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,120
What a beautiful moon.

782
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,048
We raccoons love moonlit nights.

783
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:44,526
Let us pray to the moon
for the success of our enterprise.

784
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,164
Right, everybody?

785
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,009
<i>The raccoons immediately embarked
on a special regimen of training.</i>

786
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:24,958
Congratulations on your
nine hundred and ninety-ninth birthday!

787
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,407
Thank you everyone! Thank you!

788
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,324
Master, please reenact
the story of Yoichi the Archer,

789
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,839
as you witnessed it
in your younger days!

790
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,086
So I shall!

791
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,678
The time is ripe!

792
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,159
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

793
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,606
<i>Pom Poko 33, December.</i>

794
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,802
<i>The day for Operation Goblin
arrived at last.</i>

795
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:49,847
<i>Slightly cloudy, no wind. Thirteen
degrees centigrade, humidity 65% .</i>

796
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,006
<i>Perfect conditions for goblins.</i>

797
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:31,724
<i>Transformation into monsters and goblins
has always been a raccoon strong point.</i>

798
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:35,763
<i>But now, they needed to draw
not only on their own latent energy,</i>

799
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,529
<i>but also the hidden energy
of the cosmos:</i>

800
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,770
<i>Fire, earth, water and air.</i>

801
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,809
<i>The intensity of the training
undertaken by the raccoons</i>

802
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:53,880
<i>under the tutelage
of the three elders of Shikoku</i>

803
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,843
<i>is almost beyond description.</i>

804
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,406
<i>All the raccoons,
even those who could not shape shift,</i>

805
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,687
<i>worked together
to focus their combined power.</i>

806
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,048
<i>That night, the fighting spirit
of the raccoons merged</i>

807
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,086
<i>into one consuming flame.</i>

808
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:14,839
<i>Their enthusiasm was so boundless,
they transformed themselves into goblins</i>

809
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:15,610
<i>long before they even reached
the dwellings of the humans.</i>

810
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,124
<i>Long before they even reached
the dwellings of the humans.</i>

811
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,042
Hey, look at that!

812
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,607
What is it?

813
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,688
Let the trees burst into full flower!

814
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:49,480
Let the trees burst into full flower!

815
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,962
Wow... it's a big parade of goblins!

816
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:14,163
I used to see stuff like that too,
way back when.

817
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,640
You know, foxes with lanterns,
that kind of thing.

818
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:21,365
You can really see them.

819
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,084
You can see the lanterns.

820
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,485
With little lights in them.

821
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:30,922
You can see them marching along.

822
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:40,079
I wonder why I could see them?

823
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,008
Maybe foxes can really do that.

824
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:45,644
I wonder.

825
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,770
You can really see them.

826
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,406
It must be your brain
playing tricks on you.

827
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:02,167
A fox wedding. Foxes with lanterns.
It's already in your head.

828
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,839
So, it's like...

829
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,643
Your brain plays tricks on you.

830
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:13,480
You can see them walking.
It's all in your head.

831
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:21,119
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way it's real.

832
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,004
People's brains are scary.

833
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,969
You think things,
and then you see them.

834
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:32,048
There's no way
they could be real, though.

835
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,046
They really are real!

836
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,682
It's just your brain
playing tricks on you.

837
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,843
Welcome home.

838
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,278
Sachiko!

839
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,399
Matter is void!

840
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,964
Form is emptiness!

841
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,398
Here they come again!

842
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,079
Master Gyobu!

843
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:06,159
- Master Gyobu!
- Master Gyobu!

844
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,448
That was amazing!

845
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,844
That was scary, wasn't it?

846
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:22,007
Aw, is that the end?

847
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,088
- That was really cool!
- Yes.

848
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,804
Come on, time for bed.

849
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,522
Oh, OK...

850
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,729
Don't forget to brush your teeth!

851
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,523
I feel like I just woke up from a dream.

852
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:43,807
Me too.
What was all that about, I wonder?

853
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:47,483
After that, flying saucers
would seem pretty tame.

854
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,325
There are some things
you just can't explain.

855
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:57,089
Long ago, when the Matsuyama
clan was at war,

856
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:00,282
Gyobu went over to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.

857
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,925
He regretted this so deeply

858
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:10,688
that he made a solemn vow to devote the
rest of his life fighting for justice.

859
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,644
We must ensure his sacrifice
was not in vain,

860
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:21,323
emulate his noble spirit, and vow
not to rest until the day of victory!

861
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:25,244
Gyahte gyahte hara gyahte

862
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:31,047
A raccoon of Potamochi Mountain

863
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:34,446
Got drunk and transformed himself!

864
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:38,119
Great success to Operation Goblin!

865
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:41,168
<i>The raccoons
were so convinced of victory,</i>

866
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,128
<i>no one was checking
the television for news.</i>

867
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,645
<i>Police and the media
are searching for anyone</i>

868
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,523
<i>who might have videotaped
tonight's mysterious parade.</i>

869
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,999
<i>But so far no one has come forward,</i>

870
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:55,122
<i>complicating efforts
to determine what really happened.</i>

871
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,721
<i>I'm sure I was taping the whole thing,
but there's nothing on the tape.</i>

872
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,562
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

873
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:05,888
<i>The goblin slipped in
right through this opening.</i>

874
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:10,401
<i>It was terrifying!
Nobody could have staged that.</i>

875
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,886
<i>There really is something strange
about New Town after all.</i>

876
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,763
<i>I'd like to move out,
but it's not easy.</i>

877
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,120
<i>There will be a special program
at 12:20 a.m.</i>

878
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:24,402
<i>With in-depth coverage
of this evening's strange events.</i>

879
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,444
The more people investigate this,

880
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:42,485
the more they will be convinced
it was no hallucination,

881
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:46,006
that it all really happened!

882
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:50,408
Then, when they realize
their science and logic are powerless

883
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:54,159
to unlock the riddle
of what happened...

884
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:59,410
They'll be dumbfounded
by the awesome mystery of the cosmos,

885
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:05,087
and realize how insignificant
human existence really is.

886
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:10,000
Listen, everyone: Our good fortune
awaits, but let's not wait for it!

887
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,405
Come then!

888
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:17,689
Drink! Sing! Dance!

889
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,968
Let's hear it for Master Hage!

890
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:28,563
<i>But the next day,
events took a totally unexpected turn.</i>

891
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:32,004
<i>It appears that the massive parade
staged yesterday</i>

892
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,041
<i>in a residential complex
of Tama New Town</i>

893
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,240
<i>may have been
a publicity stunt for Wonderland,</i>

894
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,486
<i>a theme park
now under construction in the area.</i>

895
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:41,682
<i>Police have summoned PR executives
of Wonderland for questioning,</i>

896
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,244
<i>on suspicion of having staged
a parade without a permit.</i>

897
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,405
You gotta be kidding!

898
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:48,124
<i>However, residents of the complex
and the surrounding area</i>

899
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,320
<i>remain convinced
that what they saw yesterday</i>

900
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,128
<i>could not have been a publicity stunt.</i>

901
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,842
You can say that again!

902
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,282
<i>The president of the company responsible
for Wonderland has admitted</i>

903
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:59,128
<i>that the parade
was a promotional event.</i>

904
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,569
What?

905
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,363
President of Wonderland
At Emergency Press Conference

906
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:09,725
<i>I deeply apologize for any inconvenience
caused by our parade yesterday.</i>

907
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,085
Who the hell is he?

908
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:17,524
<i>We just wanted the world
to know how wonderful, ah,</i>

909
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:21,603
<i>Wonderland will be.</i>

910
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:25,439
<i>So we decided the best way was to go out
and give the public a free taste of the,</i>

911
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:28,846
<i>ah, wonders they will soon
be able to experience at Wonderland.</i>

912
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:32,969
<i>As president of Wonderland,</i>

913
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:37,208
<i>I take full responsibility for the
staging of this unauthorized event.</i>

914
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:39,522
- What a liar!
- That's ridiculous!

915
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,639
<i>Fortunately,</i>

916
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:45,082
<i>we received
an overwhelmingly positive response</i>

917
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:49,203
<i>to our parade.</i>

918
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:55,047
<i>Frankly, we were astonished
at the enthusiasm we encountered.</i>

919
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,288
<i>If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail,</i>

920
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:04,564
<i>the positive reaction we received
will make it all worthwhile.</i>

921
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,530
- What in the world?!
- Is this for real?

922
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,043
- What in the world?!
- Is this for real?

923
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,286
There's got to be some mistake here!

924
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:15,204
<i>If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail...</i>

925
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,888
That asshole!

926
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,641
<i>This new development plunged
the raccoons into a state of panic.</i>

927
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,722
<i>Meanwhile, Wonderland
was desperately searching for the people</i>

928
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,966
<i>who staged the parade.</i>

929
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,887
It's too late!

930
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,843
Beat the bushes if you have to!

931
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:35,319
Just find out who did it
and hire them all!

932
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:39,079
Throw money at them!
I'll pay whatever they want!

933
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,762
It was the work of raccoons.

934
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,164
What's that? Raccoons?

935
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:47,728
I don't care if it was penguins! I want
them all working exclusively for me!

936
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,883
Raccoons? Wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

937
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,279
Oh, just a little joke.

938
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:59,124
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

939
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,678
Your assistant let me in.

940
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:04,483
I am Ryutaro.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

941
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,725
This affair is a bit delicate.

942
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:11,318
If you want to work
with the people who did this,

943
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,840
I'm probably the only one
who can deliver them to you.

944
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,439
Fine! I'll pay you 100 million yen.

945
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,205
<i>The raccoons were dumbfounded.</i>

946
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,848
<i>This bizarre human
had completely stolen their thunder.</i>

947
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,643
<i>At first, they railed against
the unfairness of it all.</i>

948
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:34,284
<i>But soon, the sheer hopelessness
of their situation</i>

949
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,203
<i>began to sap their will to fight.</i>

950
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:41,326
<i>Meanwhile,
with no footage of Operation Goblin,</i>

951
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:43,520
<i>media coverage petered out</i>

952
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:47,325
<i>and the public rapidly
lost interest in the whole affair.</i>

953
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,961
You're a fox!

954
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,800
Truly, you have a discerning eye.

955
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:11,969
I am Ryutaro, the shape-shifting fox,
at your service.

956
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:19,170
I am honored to meet you, master Kincho.
I have heard much about you.

957
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:22,362
I'm nothing more than the sixth
in a long line.

958
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,323
And what business brings you here?

959
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,442
I was astonished
by your fabulous parade.

960
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,959
At last, someone who understands!

961
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,159
How could I not?

962
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:36,203
And you have my deepest sympathies
for everything you've had to bear.

963
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:43,240
I see... At least someone understands
what we're going through.

964
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:47,321
And I was hardly surprised
by what happened after the parade.

965
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,439
What's that you say?

966
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:52,801
<i>Ryutaro the shape-shifting fox
could charm the birds from the trees.</i>

967
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,046
<i>He convinced Kincho to come to Ginza.</i>

968
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:58,640
<i>He showed the raccoon into a private
room in one of Tokyo's swankiest clubs.</i>

969
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,879
Step right this way.

970
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:04,806
Not to worry! All my girls are foxes.

971
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,607
Do you like them this way?

972
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,248
Would foxes suit you better?

973
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:14,725
Or they can be raccoons, if you prefer.

974
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,483
I'll get right to the point.

975
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,840
There's no future
for the raccoons of Tama.

976
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,649
They'll die out,
just like the foxes.

977
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:27,364
So that's what happened
to the foxes of Tama.

978
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:29,720
Yes, I'm afraid so.

979
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:35,482
The few of us who could shape-shift
have to live like this now.

980
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,249
Among the humans?!

981
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,601
That's the only way to survive
in the big city.

982
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,039
And that's why I invited you here,

983
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,968
to recommend
that you raccoons do the same.

984
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,762
Now hold on a minute!

985
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,240
I know this must come as a shock,
but allow me to complete the picture.

986
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,643
It's not enough
to start over in the human world.

987
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:57,330
If you must swallow poison,
drink the whole cup.

988
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,880
The best move would be for you all
to go to work for Wonderland,

989
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,807
and solve your problem in one go.

990
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:07,606
You can't be serious! Work for
the people who made monkeys of us?

991
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,925
Let's think about this calmly.

992
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,848
It's time for you raccoons
to start living as humans.

993
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,807
That's a foregone conclusion.

994
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,524
It takes big money
to live like a human!

995
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:20,124
And how do you
make the money you need?

996
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,639
You use the skills you have!

997
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:26,964
And who's going to pay
the highest salary?

998
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:30,486
I'm afraid that would be your enemy,
Wonderland.

999
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,170
They tell me
they'll pay generous benefits too.

1000
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:38,563
Here's the salary,
and these are the benefits.

1001
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:43,604
Naturally, I'll be the only one
who knows you're raccoons.

1002
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,999
Bon apptit.

1003
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:53,407
Now then,
let's take our time and think this over.

1004
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:56,522
Master Kincho,
you must be used to eating better

1005
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:58,248
than the scraps you get in Tama.

1006
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:00,679
I'm sure it's hard for you.

1007
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,488
That's not important.

1008
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,726
What I want to know is,

1009
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:08,638
so the raccoons
who can shape-shift live as humans.

1010
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,409
What about the ones who can't?

1011
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:13,367
They'll have to fend for themselves.

1012
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:18,319
The strongest genes must prevail
if the species is going to survive.

1013
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:22,719
We foxes had to abandon the others,
but we had no choice.

1014
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:25,125
And so... they died out.

1015
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,367
Yes, they did.
It was the choice we had to make.

1016
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,483
Ah, this is a tragedy!

1017
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:39,799
Well, you know, you raccoons
are omnivorous. Not like us foxes.

1018
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,081
Those who can't shape-shift
might not do so badly after all.

1019
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,920
<i>Meanwhile, the raccoons met once again,</i>

1020
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:50,965
<i>to consider what might be done to
improve their depressing situation.</i>

1021
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:54,008
<i>Only the core group came.</i>

1022
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,963
"We have a full array of potent tricks."
A load of hot air!

1023
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:02,286
We were idiots to think
those old geezers could help us.

1024
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,567
Reminds me of the saying,

1025
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,920
"Don't sell the pelt
till you catch the raccoon."

1026
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:13,004
No, I don't think even Buddha
could have seen how this would turn out.

1027
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,843
You shouldn't blame the masters.

1028
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:20,202
The humans say people like the president
of Wonderland are "sly as a raccoon."

1029
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:22,480
Humans are so weird.

1030
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,846
Speak for yourself, Shokichi.

1031
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:29,525
I just mean we need to do a lot more
research on the humans.

1032
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:33,364
Shut up! It's time to challenge them
to a fight to the death!

1033
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,606
Control yourself, Gonta.

1034
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:39,359
It seems to me
our only choice is to reveal

1035
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:45,520
that Operation Goblin
was really staged by us raccoons.

1036
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,720
Have you lost your mind, Osho?

1037
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:51,166
We can't reveal ourselves to the humans.
It's an ironclad rule.

1038
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:57,047
She's right. If the humans knew
we did it, they'd hunt us all down.

1039
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,207
But it's so frustrating!

1040
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:04,329
Someone else
got the credit for all our work.

1041
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:08,204
I just can't accept it.
I want to tell the world!

1042
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:12,522
I want to shout it out!
"We did that!"

1043
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:18,322
Master Osho, what could we do
to convince them it was us?

1044
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:21,880
All we have to do
is take public credit for it.

1045
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:25,161
Call the TV stations.
Send out letters.

1046
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:29,921
They'd just think
it was somebody's idea of a joke.

1047
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:33,963
Then one of us should go on TV
and demonstrate for them.

1048
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,762
Nonsense.

1049
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:39,519
The humans would just think it was
staged, and we'd be humiliated again.

1050
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:41,845
You see? Talk is useless!

1051
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:47,607
<i>The debate dragged on through the night,
and into the next morning.</i>

1052
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:52,324
You see? Talk is useless!

1053
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:56,125
But if we become terrorists,

1054
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,764
that will just incite
the humans to wipe us out!

1055
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:02,126
I keep telling you! We do it without
them knowing it was us!

1056
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:05,043
In that case, we can't do anything
really effective.

1057
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:12,968
Instead of going off halfcocked
in different directions,

1058
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:18,039
I think we should join forces for
another, even bigger Operation Goblin.

1059
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:23,563
Where's the guarantee
things won't turn out the same?

1060
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:27,649
All we have to do
is get together like before.

1061
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,479
Ha! You're just playing around
in the sandbox.

1062
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:35,603
You're like a stinking girl!

1063
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,846
Watch your tongue, Gonta.

1064
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:39,443
That's no way to talk about women.

1065
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,040
OK, but if he WAS a stinking girl,
that's what he'd be like!

1066
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:46,640
Anyway, I'm going to start getting ready
for Operation Goblin part two.

1067
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:49,045
Yeah? You and who else?

1068
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,722
Do you think anyone'll follow you?

1069
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,643
What was that?!

1070
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:55,482
Moron!

1071
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,040
Knock it off!

1072
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,358
Listen everyone!

1073
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:04,849
There's only one way out of this.

1074
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,444
We have to use our shape-shifting skills

1075
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:11,802
the way we did for Operation Goblin!

1076
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:17,129
You know what kind of impact Operation
Goblin had on the humans.

1077
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:23,327
But everyone thinks that idiot president
of Wonderland was responsible.

1078
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:26,200
So what can we do?

1079
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:31,928
How would you stand this egg on end?

1080
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,328
This is how Columbus did it.

1081
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:42,646
Very impressive!

1082
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,159
You must have a really
brilliant solution.

1083
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:52,445
It's time for us
to begin living as humans!

1084
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,562
No way!

1085
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:58,803
No, I'm absolutely serious.
This is not a joke.

1086
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,285
But what about the ones
who can't shape-shift?

1087
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:02,843
Where's Osho?

1088
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:06,849
Appeal From 808 Raccons

1089
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,959
<i>With Osho gone,</i>

1090
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:16,163
<i>the raccoons could not agree
whether or not to follow Kincho's plan.</i>

1091
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,804
<i>Their unity began to unravel.</i>

1092
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:24,446
<i>Operation Goblin took precedence over
important matters like food gathering.</i>

1093
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:29,246
<i>Most of the raccoons turned to survival,
but Gonta began gathering followers.</i>

1094
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,407
<i>Meanwhile, age seemed to have addled
Master Hage's brain.</i>

1095
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:34,964
<i>He gathered the raccoons
who could not shape-shift,</i>

1096
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,888
<i>and initiated them
into a Buddhist dancing cult.</i>

1097
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:41,127
This world is an abyss, a mud boat!

1098
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:44,048
Invoke the name of Amida and dance!

1099
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:47,122
Namu Amida Butsu,
this is the end for us

1100
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,320
Paradise will be our boat

1101
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,880
Master Hage
was always so hale and lucid.

1102
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,649
What an awful place Tokyo is!

1103
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,965
If Operation Goblin
had taken place in Shikoku,

1104
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:00,928
the humans would have known
it was us raccoons.

1105
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:06,966
Offerings to us at shrines and temples
would have increased ten times.

1106
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,039
Master Kincho!

1107
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,400
Master Kincho, my fervent desire
is to accompany you back to Matsushima

1108
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,521
and devote myself to training.

1109
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:19,319
Is that so, Tamasaburo?

1110
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:21,042
Yes.

1111
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:24,048
You're prepared to become my successor?

1112
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:26,121
Yes, Master Kincho.

1113
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:28,246
I've been waiting for those words!

1114
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:33,524
But you're not
selfishly abandoning your fellows

1115
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:38,440
to get back to Koharu, are you?

1116
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:41,522
Of course, Master Kincho. Only...

1117
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,402
Only what?

1118
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:47,882
Even Master Kincho has lost the support
of the other raccoons.

1119
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:50,325
What purpose would it serve
to stay here in any case?

1120
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:53,203
I think there's something
we can do about that.

1121
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:02,999
Wow, this is
quite an amazing restaurant!

1122
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:08,158
The owner has spared no expense
to make your visit a pleasant one.

1123
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:15,600
This place is really something!

1124
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:19,439
Good grief, it's better than Disneyland!

1125
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:44,439
<i>And so Master Kincho
not only got his revenge on Wonderland,</i>

1126
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,722
<i>he obtained a massive war chest
for the raccoons.</i>

1127
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:52,729
<i>The president of Wonderland
rushed to the police</i>

1128
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:55,569
<i>to report the theft of 100 million yen
by a pack of raccoons.</i>

1129
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,049
<i>But no one would listen to him.</i>

1130
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:03,200
<i>Meanwhile, Gonta and his crew
of hardliners were taking steps</i>

1131
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:06,606
<i>to stop further clearing of the forest.</i>

1132
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,165
<i>Nature preservationists!</i>

1133
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:31,119
<i>Please stop interfering with our snake
extermination, and leave immediately!</i>

1134
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:36,839
<i>You will be subject to prosecution!</i>

1135
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:39,763
<i>If you do not immediately
heed this warning and leave,</i>

1136
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:47,045
<i>we will use force to remove you!</i>

1137
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:02,524
<i>But Gonta and his army
ignored the warning.</i>

1138
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,210
<i>They pinned the police,
hunters and workers to the road</i>

1139
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,844
<i>and kept them from advancing an inch.</i>

1140
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:11,326
<i>And so both sides
continued the face-off as night fell.</i>

1141
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:22,889
What?! If Gonta insists on doing this,
we ought to be standing with him!

1142
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:31,685
Can't you hear? The riot police
are already here. It's too late.

1143
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,089
I'm going to take a look!

1144
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:41,807
- Shokichi! They'll get you too!
- I'm going with him!

1145
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:55,850
- Ready, men?
- Right!

1146
01:32:55,970 --> 01:33:00,839
Even if we should fall
in the heat of battle,

1147
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:04,923
our deaths are certain to redouble
our brothers' resolve to carry on,

1148
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:10,966
till the day of victory dawns!

1149
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:16,081
Our raccoon balls swing in the wind

1150
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:21,000
Back and forth, back and forth

1151
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:25,084
Amen

1152
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:26,529
Special ops!
Move aside!

1153
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,969
Gonta, wait!

1154
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:29,604
Move out!

1155
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,244
Gonta.

1156
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:31,162
<i>The raccoons used their family jewels as
weapons in a desperate kamikaze attack.</i>

1157
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:34,803
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

1158
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:39,248
<i>Meanwhile,
in another part of the Tama Hills,</i>

1159
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:41,764
<i>a reporter was trying
to interview the raccoons.</i>

1160
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:44,688
Mr. Raccoon, please come out.

1161
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,160
Any form you want to take is fine.

1162
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:54,120
The staff of World TeleReporter
is on your side!

1163
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:00,524
It looks like
they're not so eager to come out.

1164
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:07,447
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon,
why don't we talk?

1165
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,119
We've got nothing to eat!

1166
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,600
They answered!
It's true after all!

1167
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,520
We'd like to hear
more about this from you.

1168
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,720
Won't you please come out?

1169
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:24,843
Oh! There they are!
It's the raccoons! It's them!

1170
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:28,206
Are you raccoons really
responsible for the goblin parade?

1171
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,480
That's right!

1172
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:34,643
Please change into something
for our viewers.

1173
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:39,605
Otherwise no one will believe us.

1174
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:44,125
Some of us can't shape-shift.

1175
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:48,846
So if the woods are all gone,
we'll have nowhere to live!

1176
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:58,444
Raccoons, please listen!

1177
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:02,324
If you don't come out, this broadcast
will look like a cheap put-up job!

1178
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:07,041
If you want people to believe you,

1179
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,162
you'll have to show yourselves.

1180
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:12,040
Osho!

1181
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:17,282
Please go tell the humans everything!

1182
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:26,163
He came out! He came out!

1183
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,884
A ceramic raccoon
is walking toward me!

1184
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:41,689
Mr. Raccoon,
a word for our viewers!

1185
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:46,843
We... we...

1186
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,565
Yes?

1187
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:53,085
Go ahead!

1188
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,924
Granny Oroku!

1189
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:02,323
It was us! We made that parade!

1190
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,844
These woods are our home!

1191
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:07,040
Please don't destroy them!

1192
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:10,164
We speak for every animal in the forest!

1193
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:55,323
The person I saw yesterday
is gone today

1194
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:58,965
The person I see today
will be gone tomorrow

1195
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:03,564
Who knows
what will happen to us tomorrow?

1196
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:06,528
Today everyone is sad

1197
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:10,928
<i>Master Tazaburo Hage, last surviving
witness of the battle of Yashima,</i>

1198
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:16,363
<i>was 999 years old.</i>

1199
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:20,847
<i>But now he had seen enough, and he
decided to bid the world farewell.</i>

1200
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:25,282
<i>With a song of triumph, the raccoons
stretched his vast testicles</i>

1201
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:28,925
<i>into a fabulous treasure ship,
with fittings of lacquer and gold.</i>

1202
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:36,202
<i>Singing and dancing,
they boarded the ship,</i>

1203
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:40,408
<i>in anticipation of leaving the world
of suffering for the shores of bliss.</i>

1204
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:45,842
<i>The ordinary raccoons imagined paradise</i>

1205
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:50,566
<i>and boarded
as if they were going on an outing.</i>

1206
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:59,764
<i>The treasure ship set off down the
Tama River, swaying in the moonlight.</i>

1207
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,366
<i>The current bore the ship downstream,
the sail stood proudly in the breeze.</i>

1208
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:10,480
<i>The boat was full,
the sail was flying high.</i>

1209
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:15,638
<i>Now the tide helped them forward as the
moon glinted off the water.</i>

1210
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:20,168
<i>The raccoons drummed their bellies
as the ship sailed away,</i>

1211
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:22,485
<i>drumming and drumming
on this night of dreams.</i>

1212
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:26,529
<i>They celebrated with bells,
samisen, flutes and drums.</i>

1213
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:33,249
<i>The ship was laden with gold,
silver and precious coral.</i>

1214
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:35,759
<i>With tears in their eyes,</i>

1215
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:39,041
<i>the raccoons watching from shore
prayed this would be no mud boat.</i>

1216
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:44,762
<i>As in a dream, the ship sailed on
past mist-shrouded woods and fields.</i>

1217
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:50,522
<i>The raccoons strained to catch a glimpse
of Amida beckoning from paradise.</i>

1218
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:53,847
<i>The treasure ship
crossed over to the next world.</i>

1219
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:57,167
<i>Singing and dancing, the raccoons
crossed over to the next world.</i>

1220
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,923
<i>With bells and flutes,
they crossed over to the next world.</i>

1221
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:03,201
<i>With samisen and drums,
they crossed over to the next world.</i>

1222
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:09,087
<i>They crossed over to the next world,
and they never returned.</i>

1223
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:12,850
You can't beat the humans after all!

1224
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:16,081
You can't beat the humans after all!

1225
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:39,044
Bunta, it's you!

1226
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:42,165
Bunta! Bunta!

1227
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:43,359
Tamasaburo!

1228
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:45,003
Bunta!

1229
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,558
You've finally returned!

1230
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:51,043
Sasuke! Shokichi!

1231
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:56,324
Did you find Master Danzaburo?
Did you reach Sado and see the master?

1232
01:40:56,450 --> 01:41:01,683
I learned at last
that he was shot by a hunter years ago,

1233
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,247
after the war, when food was scarce.

1234
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:10,639
How sad.
I was looking forward to meeting him.

1235
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:14,202
You did well, Bunta.

1236
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:24,090
But what's happened here, in only
three years? I feel like Urashima Taro.

1237
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:27,161
We did everything we could to stop it.

1238
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,326
But everything has changed
beyond belief!

1239
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:31,446
The land has shape shifted,
not us raccoons.

1240
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,085
- We understand how you must feel.
- Did the humans really do all this?

1241
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:38,202
Yes, they did. They did it all.

1242
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:42,164
No, it can't be! Only raccoons
can change things like this.

1243
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:44,008
We're the only ones!

1244
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:47,445
The humans were really raccoons
after all!

1245
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:51,324
Old, stinking raccoons!

1246
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:58,959
Give us back our woods! Give us back
our fields! Give us back our homes!

1247
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:14,488
Shall we give it one more try?

1248
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:19,449
Let's use the power we have left to put
everything back the way it was.

1249
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:26,408
We'll see who's better at shape-
shifting. The raccoons or the humans.

1250
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:32,807
Sounds like fun! I can remember every
detail of the way things used to be.

1251
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:36,081
All right, then.
One last guerilla attack!

1252
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:39,924
But what's the point?
It's already too late.

1253
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:43,207
Oh, it'll cheer us up.
That's all that matters.

1254
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,886
It's this playful spirit
that keeps us raccoons, after all.

1255
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:51,763
Master Kincho, will you help us?

1256
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:56,088
Of course, though it may turn out
a bit like Shikoku.

1257
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:57,965
Ponkichi!

1258
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,008
Here I am! Shall I round up the others?

1259
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:03,086
Will you lend us your energy
one more time?

1260
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:04,239
You can rely on me!

1261
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:57,159
Wait up for me!

1262
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:12,399
Why, that's Mother!

1263
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:16,801
And Yotchan! It's Yotchan!

1264
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:20,080
Yotchan!

1265
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:48,088
That's us!
That's us when we were children!

1266
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:57,042
Look, raccoons!

1267
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:59,730
Wow! They're cute!

1268
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:02,922
Those are raccoons, right?

1269
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:07,601
I'm surprised to see them here,
so close to the city.

1270
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:13,478
Hey, raccoons! Don't go!

1271
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:19,287
Aw, they're gone.

1272
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:22,760
It would've been fun to feed them.

1273
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:26,001
I wonder if they can really change
themselves like in the stories?

1274
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:32,239
<i>So in the end,
we were defeated after all.</i>

1275
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:37,160
<i>Tama New Town kept growing
without the slightest hindrance from us.</i>

1276
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:42,606
<i>As the years passed, the city settled in</i>

1277
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:45,887
<i>and became a pretty nice place
for people to live.</i>

1278
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:52,610
<i>The hill where Manpuku Temple stood
is a trendy residential district.</i>

1279
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:56,643
<i>And I think our shape-shifting</i>

1280
01:46:56,770 --> 01:47:00,285
<i>did have a good influence on the humans.</i>

1281
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:06,079
<i>As it said in the papers, they're
concerned about preserving nature,</i>

1282
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:09,122
<i>and they're setting aside
little bits of the woods for parks,</i>

1283
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:13,926
<i>"to live in harmony with the raccoons."</i>

1284
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:18,446
<i>But the parks were too late for us.</i>

1285
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:20,805
<i>They're too small for raccoons, anyway.</i>

1286
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:26,766
<i>Some of us moved further from the city,
where there were still woods and fields.</i>

1287
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:29,404
<i>But of course
there were raccoons there already,</i>

1288
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:33,318
<i>and with construction and the cars
that took one of us from time to time,</i>

1289
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,600
<i>life was hard.</i>

1290
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:42,601
<i>So we took the final step.</i>

1291
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:56,565
<i>That's right,</i>

1292
01:47:56,690 --> 01:48:00,729
<i>those of us who could shape-shift
took a leaf from the foxes' book,</i>

1293
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:03,284
<i>and started living like humans.</i>

1294
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:07,119
<i>Nowadays I have a desk job
and my wife, Kiyo, works at a bar.</i>

1295
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:10,003
<i>A few raccoons got into
the real estate business and made a pile</i>

1296
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:13,361
<i>selling forests to developers.
They're no different from the humans.</i>

1297
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:16,482
<i>Most of us are just worn out
from the stress of living in the city,</i>

1298
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:18,726
<i>and wish we could go back to the woods.</i>

1299
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:24,243
<i>I'm impressed by the humans. It takes
stamina to live the way they do.</i>

1300
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:27,046
<i>Some of us dropped out of the rat race</i>

1301
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:32,927
<i>and are scrounging out a living
on the streets.</i>

1302
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:43,485
<i>Oh, and what about Ponkichi
and the others who couldn't shape-shift?</i>

1303
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:12,884
<i>"Living for the moment"
is an expression made for raccoons.</i>

1304
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:16,440
<i>We never let property development
or accidents on the road get us down.</i>

1305
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:19,562
<i>We live as we please, relaxed
and joyous, in the present moment.</i>

1306
01:49:19,690 --> 01:49:23,922
<i>We have children,
and we die, all too quickly.</i>

1307
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:12,568
Ponkichi!

1308
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:14,958
Ponkichi!

1309
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:16,881
Shokichi!

1310
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:21,483
You came!

1311
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:22,559
How long has it been?

1312
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:46,408
You often hear on the news

1313
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:50,205
how foxes and raccoons are disappearing
because of urban development, right?

1314
01:50:50,330 --> 01:50:52,366
I wish you humans
would stop saying that.

1315
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:57,120
Sure, some foxes and raccoons
can shape-shift.

1316
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:01,163
But unfortunately,
most of us who can't just disappear.

1317
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:03,485
What about the rest of the animals?
