1
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,441
Yeah?

2
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,861
<i>Porco Rosso!
The Mamma Aiutos are on the move.</i>

3
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,824
The Mamma Aiutos?
I don't work cheap, you know.

4
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,036
<i>They're after a mine's payroll
out of Venice.</i>

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,123
- Is that all?
<i>- Uh, no...</i>

6
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,959
<i>There's a school tour group aboard.</i>

7
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,920
That'll cost you.

8
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,047
<i>We'll pay top dollar.</i>

9
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,590
And a bonus too.

10
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,803
Stop!

11
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,806
Stop or we sink you.

12
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,391
Wow, pirates!

13
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,686
Not just pirates. Air pirates!

14
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,007
Time for an overhaul.

15
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,957
Are you bad guys?

16
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,042
Yep.

17
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,960
And we're hostages?

18
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,171
- Right.
- Are you air pirates?

19
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,088
Smart girl.

20
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,840
A skull!

21
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,384
- And very well-drawn.
- Hurry, come over here!

22
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
Come on, hurry up!

23
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,806
There's 15 of them. Do we take them all?

24
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,392
We can't leave anyone out.

25
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,537
Too late!

26
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,874
They took the girls and the money.

27
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,668
Bring them back!

28
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,379
They went that way.

29
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,682
No, not that way!

30
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,894
I know what those cheapskates are up to.

31
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:34,983
They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.

32
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,026
They can't waste gas.

33
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,781
Uh-oh.

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,999
Come on!

35
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,015
I don't have much time.

36
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,104
Gotcha!

37
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,621
What, it's just a tour group.

38
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,958
Hey, it's a pig. A pig!

39
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,252
Hey, piggy! He's so cute!

40
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,049
Be careful or the pirates will get you.

41
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,512
He's so cool!

42
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,986
Will you all shut up?

43
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,113
- We're flying!
- Let me see!

44
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,782
Hey, cut that out!

45
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,327
Be quiet, will you?

46
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,578
Do something!

47
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,415
You're the one who said to bring them all.

48
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,378
Just for a second.
I'm not supposed to let you.

49
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,882
It's beautiful. Hey, look!

50
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,634
A red plane!

51
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,928
Where? Where?

52
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,138
- We saw it, didn't we?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,353
That's as far as you go.

54
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,856
Here he comes!

55
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,859
- It's Porco!
- I can't see!

56
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,866
Oh, no!

57
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,119
- It stopped.
- We'll crash!

58
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,995
No, we've got another engine.

59
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,920
What are you doing? Shoot him down!

60
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,256
That red plane's tough.

61
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,428
- Missed!
- You're in my way.

62
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,314
Message from the pig.
"You're beat. Do what I say."

63
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,274
Shut up!

64
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,156
He's coming. Get down!

65
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,869
- Where did he go?
- He's hiding.

66
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,177
We crashed. We're going to sink!

67
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,846
No we won't. This is a seaplane.

68
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,599
Oh no!

69
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,479
We're sinking.

70
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,315
- Hey, stop that!
- We're not sinking!

71
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,067
Halt! You're hostages.

72
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,738
Don't worry. We're on the swim team.

73
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,407
- That's not the point!
- Me too!

74
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,367
Another message.

75
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:19,540
"You can keep half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids."

76
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,543
Or I'll kill you all.

77
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,879
- That's it.
- Half the money?

78
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:29,342
Shut up! Come on, you swine.
It's you and me!

79
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,015
Eat lead!

80
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,769
It jammed!

81
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,437
We surrender!

82
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,272
We surrender!

83
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,614
Bye-bye!

84
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,491
Farewell!

85
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,993
He left us money for repairs.

86
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,412
Don't be such a sap.

87
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,172
Be quiet, will you?

88
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,301
Don't pull on that, you'll break it.

89
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,307
Stay away from the propeller.

90
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,685
Got to pee? Do it over there.

91
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,105
PORCO ROSSO SINGS HIS VICTORY SONG
ONCE AGAIN

92
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,733
So the Mamma Aiutos can't come tonight.

93
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:32,029
And that filthy pig
of a bounty hunter is a hero.

94
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,533
But this young kid's an American, right?

95
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,954
The air pirates of the Adriatic,
asking a Yankee for help!

96
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,749
His grandmother was part Italian.

97
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,503
And he'll finish Porco for us.

98
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,131
But ten percent is outrageous.

99
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,072
Beautiful.

100
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,528
He's here.

101
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,032
With his snout in the air, as always.

102
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,298
Mr. Porco Rosso? I'm from <i>The Neptune.</i>

103
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,303
We hear you put
the Mamma Aiutos out of action.

104
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,600
Do you think that will affect
this year's bounties?

105
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,186
Hey, put me down!

106
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,567
Listen to the music.

107
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,785
She's quite a woman.

108
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,291
Even American pilots know
Madame Gina of the Hotel Adriano.

109
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,128
That's why we all leave
our quarrels outside.

110
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,380
Is that your Curtiss out front?

111
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,593
The Rattlesnake.
Winner of fame and fortune.

112
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,972
You took the Schneider Cup
two years running.

113
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,476
She's unbeatable in a dogfight, too.

114
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:53,522
But I hear there's this Porco Rosso
who's pretty famous, too.

115
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,817
Better watch your back
with those pirates, kid.

116
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,572
They're poor, cheap, and dirty.
They could use a bath.

117
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,702
- That's true.
- Who you calling dirty, pig?

118
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,123
Quite a distinguished gathering!
You boys must be planning something.

119
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,375
As usual.

120
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,296
Always glad to see you,
but no war games here, okay?

121
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,301
We know, Gina. We never work
within 50 kilometers of here.

122
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,387
We're even nice to the pig.

123
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,849
That's my boys.

124
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,643
See you again.

125
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,072
Porco, tell us a war story.

126
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,949
Next time we're alone.

127
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,126
That American is so funny.

128
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,047
He took one look and said marry me.

129
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,052
I told him I'd lost
three pilot husbands already.

130
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:10,307
One in combat, one in the Atlantic.
The third died in Asia.

131
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,813
They found him?

132
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,986
I got a call today.
They found the wreckage in Bengal.

133
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,913
I waited three years.
I've got no tears left.

134
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,419
The good guys always get killed.
To comrades.

135
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
Thanks, Marco. You're always here for me.

136
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,850
You're the only one left
from the old days.

137
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,396
One thing I don't like about this place...

138
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,356
is that picture.

139
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:06,071
Don't touch it. It's the only one
of you when you were human.

140
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,245
I wish I could release you
from that spell.

141
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,810
That Yank knows how to fly.

142
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,635
Must be nice to make that much money.

143
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,637
This month's payment.

144
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,390
That pays off your loan.

145
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:19,478
How about helping the people out
with a Patriot Bond?

146
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,690
Do I look like a person?

147
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,834
All ready for you, Mr. Porco Rosso.

148
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,628
- I'll take some ammo too.
- Okay.

149
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,340
The streets are packed.

150
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,261
Yeah? Maybe the government
is going to change again.

151
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,723
They'll pass a law against you guys.

152
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,475
Laws don't apply to pigs.

153
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,855
That's for sure. Or moles like me.

154
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,987
Just regular ammo?
No high-explosive or armor-piercing?

155
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,115
We're not fighting a war out there, kid.

156
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,366
See you.

157
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,993
Thank you!

158
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,166
Hey, Boss. How is war
different from bounty hunting?

159
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:28,714
War profiteers are villains.
Bounty hunters are just stupid.

160
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,802
We're air pirates.
We don't borrow from banks.

161
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,928
What else can we do?

162
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,514
These repairs were expensive.

163
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,767
Pirate Federation planes!

164
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,986
Why do we have to fly
with that bunch of losers?

165
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,946
It's all the pig's fault.

166
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,658
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?

167
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,786
That is so shabby.

168
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,789
It looks like everyone's here.

169
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,167
Hey, is the American here yet?

170
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,795
He's up in the sun.

171
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,797
Right where he should be.

172
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,767
Sighted target: <i>The Mediterranean Queen.</i>

173
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,436
We're taking a ship that big?

174
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,481
That's why we all got together.

175
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,985
Having engine trouble. Go first.
We'll cover you.

176
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,988
That's a dirty trick! We follow the plan.

177
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,492
Then we share repair costs!

178
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,996
You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always.

179
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,876
- Even if we get bombed?
- Engine trouble! Engine trouble!

180
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,337
- We settled all this before!
- You're so stingy!

181
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,839
- I'm leaving!
- Engine trouble!

182
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,508
All of you, shut up!

183
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,474
<i>Attention! We are under attack
by air pirates.</i>

184
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,395
<i>There is no need for alarm.</i>

185
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,232
<i>We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.</i>

186
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,194
<i>We will now introduce our pilots.</i>

187
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta.</i>

188
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>And the Wolf of the Tiber,
Signor Visconti.</i>

189
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,554
- They brought muscle!
- That wasn't in the deal!

190
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,272
Aw, what a mess.

191
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,066
Get away from me, Curtis!

192
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,652
All right, let's go!

193
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,214
That's not good.

194
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,885
Guess I have to go to Milan.

195
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>Both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety.</i>

196
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,442
<i>The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message.</i>

197
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,778
You're next!

198
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,280
Come and get us, pig!

199
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,494
<i>We repeat...
You're next. Come and get us, pig.</i>

200
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,787
<i>About this incident...</i>

201
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,957
Way to go, turkeys.

202
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,631
I'm afraid I'm on vacation.

203
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,930
White sheets, beautiful women.

204
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,106
Just get me to Milan, little engine.

205
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:43,427
I don't like this weather.
I'll have to fly low.

206
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,901
Come on, you can do it!

207
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,365
That's right. Good girl!

208
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,004
Pig!

209
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,181
It's one on one!

210
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,308
Not now!

211
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,153
I'll tell everyone you ran.

212
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,948
Catch you later, Yank!

213
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,244
Damn, lost my cover.

214
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,081
Uh-oh.

215
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,874
Gotcha!

216
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,877
No you didn't. My engine quit.

217
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,559
Yes! Now I'll be famous too. Yahoo!

218
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:18,957
I can't go back empty-handed.
They won't believe me without proof.

219
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,631
There!

220
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,152
That stupid red color. No mistake.

221
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,448
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama.

222
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,868
Please hurry.

223
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,585
Madame Gina!

224
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,089
There's a phone call.
He's safe. He's alive.

225
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:49,839
What?

226
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,176
Use the phone at the front desk.

227
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,355
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.

228
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,359
Oh? Good!

229
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,363
<i>I've lost weight.
Two nights on a deserted island.</i>

230
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:18,868
I'm taking the plane to Milan for repairs.

231
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,455
<i>If the Yank comes in,
tell him I'll see him again.</i>

232
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>Hey! I'm not a messenger.</i>

233
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:32,882
I worry about you pilots,
but you treat me like furniture.

234
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:40,390
Marco, you'll end up roasted.
I won't go to your funeral.

235
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,728
A pig's gotta fly.

236
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>Idiot!</i>

237
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,120
THE RED WINGS HAVE BEEN BROKEN
PORCO ROSSO: DEAD OR ALIVE?

238
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,161
I figured you'd show up tonight.

239
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,704
I need your help.

240
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,873
Looks pretty bad.

241
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,293
Why not just get a new plane?

242
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,753
I like this one.

243
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,005
I know how you feel.

244
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,509
Look out. I'll back her in.

245
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,807
Who's the cutie?

246
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,892
My granddaughter, back from the States.

247
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,231
Keep coming, keep coming.

248
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:35,004
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!
It's got great lines.

249
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:39,342
They don't make them like that anymore.

250
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,552
I can't see it.

251
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,805
She's really your granddaughter?

252
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,515
Hands off.

253
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,854
Fio, lock up.

254
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,564
Okay.

255
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,901
I'm going up against Curtis.
I need another 15 knots.

256
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,988
Curtis? I hadn't heard
that name for a while.

257
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,453
Well?

258
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,329
Where did you get a Folgore?

259
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,290
Don't ask.

260
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:16,129
The plane Curtis beat in 1927
for the Schneider Cup had this engine.

261
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,133
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

262
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,636
I can hardly wait.

263
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,724
Don't over-tune her. It's not a race.

264
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:32,604
Tell me about it!
You're preaching to the converted.

265
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,610
You're cleaning me out.

266
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,948
These days money's not worth
the paper it's printed on.

267
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,911
Empty your pockets.
That's for the propeller, the paint...

268
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,623
That's for hotel and meals!

269
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,043
Stay here. I'll put you up cheap.

270
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,548
Where are your sons? Are they good?

271
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,509
They left to find work.

272
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,762
- So who'll do the design?
- Fio.

273
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,765
Fio? That little girl?

274
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,520
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.

275
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:23,071
I've known you a long time,
but I think I'll try somewhere else.

276
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,865
Wait!

277
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,208
It is because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

278
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,252
Both, actually.

279
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,671
Well, I can understand that.

280
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,259
Tell me, what's the main thing
a good pilot needs?

281
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,011
Experience?

282
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,013
No. Inspiration.

283
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,058
I'm glad you didn't say experience.

284
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,021
Grandpa says you were very young
when you first soloed.

285
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,024
You were good from the start.

286
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,112
That was 1910. I was 17.

287
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,574
I'm 17 too!

288
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,037
I can't help being a girl,
but we've got your old blueprints.

289
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,041
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.
Okay, Grandpa?

290
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,836
She'll do fine.

291
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,548
I was overhauling engines when I was 12.

292
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,383
Sleep on it.

293
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:30,138
Shower's hot. Towels on the rack.
Breakfast at seven. Good night.

294
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,438
You're short, but we're friends.
I'll loan you the rest.

295
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,056
FLEXIBILITY

296
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,568
Good morning. Sleep okay?

297
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,278
Did you work all night?

298
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,072
Just a rough idea.

299
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,660
Same wing plan
with a different cross section.

300
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,746
That should give us five knots.

301
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:42,085
The original plans are amazing.
The old wings were monocoque.

302
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,379
I've never seen anything like it.

303
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,091
Whoever designed this wing
really understood wood.

304
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm so impressed.

305
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:55,807
They only built one.
They said it was too dangerous to fly.

306
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,810
Found it in a warehouse.

307
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,311
Lucky you.

308
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,649
With this wing sweep,
I'm surprised you even get lift.

309
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:10,405
Takeoffs and landings are tricky.
No one can touch her in the air.

310
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:15,493
Sweep the wings half a degree more.

311
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,787
The rest is fine.

312
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,332
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.

313
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,837
But on one condition.

314
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:31,009
Don't work all night.
You need sleep to do good work.

315
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,344
And to look good, too.

316
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,972
All right.

317
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,144
Actually, I was so nervous
last night I couldn't sleep.

318
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:45,481
To tell the truth, I was afraid
you wouldn't let me do it.

319
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,900
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.

320
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,948
I hope she's not going
to build it herself too.

321
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,077
- Good morning.
- The morning paper?

322
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,168
- My niece Monica will do the drawings.
- Hello.

323
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,004
My nephew's wife, the finishing.

324
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,799
My cousin's daughters, Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.

325
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:18,014
Fio's sister Giliola. Sandra's her cousin.
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty.

326
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,019
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and her sister Miletta.

327
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,771
Porcelino!

328
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,814
Grandma!

329
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,776
The angels haven't come for you yet?

330
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,030
You've grown into a fine man!

331
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,868
You all work here, too?

332
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,789
To buy things for our great-grandchildren.

333
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,797
Not a single man.

334
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,300
They're all family?

335
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,136
Yeah. There's no work here.

336
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,972
The men are all away working.

337
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,518
This depression...

338
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:08,523
Don't worry. The women
are tough and they work hard.

339
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,818
We're not making pancakes here.

340
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,453
Our Lord who art in Heaven...

341
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,749
We thank Thee for giving
our struggling company work and bread.

342
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:31,838
Forgive us for using women's hands
to build a fighter plane.

343
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,588
Amen.

344
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,928
Let's eat up and get to work!

345
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,400
Hear that? She's perfect.

346
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,742
How do you like them RPMs?

347
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,079
Watch out or you'll blow the shed away.

348
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,500
Curtis doesn't stand a chance.

349
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,862
SECOND BLUEPRINT
BIND THE TWO FUSELAGES

350
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,907
WE DO NOT OFFER CREDIT

351
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,742
Yeah, it's a good idea.

352
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,410
So can I do it?

353
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:49,040
Well, this is going to cost
a lot more money.

354
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,502
We're way over budget already.
Look at all these bills.

355
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,379
Ask our sponsor.

356
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,382
Porco...

357
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,639
Don't look at me like that.
Do whatever you like.

358
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,060
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work.

359
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,062
Porco, I love you!

360
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,483
WE DO NOT OFFER CREDIT

361
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,693
I can wait three months.

362
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,029
Maybe I'll become a pirate.

363
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,656
She's a good kid, huh?

364
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,783
Hands off.

365
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,286
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

366
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,071
So you made Squadron Leader.

367
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,656
Why did you come back?

368
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,118
I go where I want, Ferrarin.

369
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,789
The authorities don't like it.
Did you notice you're being tailed?

370
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,999
- Yeah!
- I eluded them.

371
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,173
There are warrants out on you
for treason, illegal entry, decadence...

372
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,051
pornography, and being a lazy pig.

373
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,512
It's not funny!

374
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,516
They want to seize your plane, too.

375
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,394
This is a lousy film.

376
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:21,067
Come back to the Air Force, Marco.
I could still get you in.

377
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,820
Better a pig than a Fascist.

378
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,822
Freelance daredevils are finished.

379
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:31,077
To fly now, you need a government
or an airline to pay you.

380
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,206
I only fly for myself.

381
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,793
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.

382
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,172
Thanks, Ferrarin. Say hello to the guys.

383
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,300
This is a good film.

384
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,429
Watch your back.
They won't bother with a trial.

385
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,972
I know.

386
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,016
See you, buddy.

387
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:13,911
Want a ride?

388
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,876
Good timing.

389
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:32,221
I borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.

390
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,932
No tests. I've got no time.

391
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,770
Don't be stupid!
I won't deliver an untested plane.

392
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,441
We can take it apart
and get it to the lake in a day.

393
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:48,571
I said there's no time.
Take a look behind us.

394
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,782
The Fascist Secret Police.

395
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,785
They followed you.

396
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,997
Me? Why?

397
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,794
Because they're following me.
And you're fixing my plane.

398
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,383
Porco, are you a spy?

399
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,848
Me, a spy?

400
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,145
I don't work hard enough to be a spy.

401
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,315
But you were a war hero.

402
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,984
Why follow an innocent man?

403
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,612
My thoughts exactly.

404
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,534
Whoops! Wrong way.

405
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,424
And you're telling me
you've done nothing wrong.

406
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,469
Time to get busy.

407
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,250
It's ready to fly.

408
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,045
There are two men out back
and three in front.

409
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,922
This is so exciting!

410
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,591
Settle down, Grandma.

411
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,805
- I'll see you.
- Take care.

412
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,568
What are you doing?

413
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm coming with you. Give me five minutes.

414
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,826
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid!

415
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,204
Shh! Don't shout.

416
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,081
Listen to me, Fio.

417
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,337
You're a respectable woman.
And you're not married.

418
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,672
Hold this.

419
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,135
Thanks. I just finished this.

420
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,099
Perfect!

421
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,101
Hold that, will you?

422
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:31,859
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I'm not running a tourist service.

423
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:38,866
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.

424
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:44,872
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne.

425
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:50,836
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtis.

426
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:55,841
I'm a man. We'll be all alone
on a deserted island.

427
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,926
Great. I love camping.

428
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,928
That's not the point.

429
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,559
Take her along. If you don't beat Curtis,
we don't get paid.

430
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,063
If you don't pay, we go broke.

431
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,564
You're her grandfather!

432
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:15,069
I'll give you a break on her salary
and throw in this voice tube.

433
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,322
They'll put a price on her head.

434
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,867
No. I'll be your hostage.

435
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,789
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.

436
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,960
Please take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.

437
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,965
Take out the right machine gun.

438
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,388
I don't care how small your bottom is,
that's a tight fit.

439
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,975
Okay! My hips are bigger
than they look. Wait a minute.

440
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,731
We better leave before Grandma
decides to come too.

441
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,942
Hey, that's an idea!

442
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,904
Grandma, quick!

443
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,407
No souvenirs, please.

444
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,292
Contact!

445
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,429
Open up!

446
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,438
Let go!

447
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,420
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!

448
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,472
How's the rudder, Porco?

449
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,476
A handful, just like you.
I can barely control it.

450
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,190
Stop and I'll fix it.

451
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,193
No time. I've got to get her up.

452
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,990
<i>This water's like glue!</i>

453
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,825
Barge ahead!

454
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,080
Here we go!

455
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,960
Come on, baby!

456
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,963
The flaps are in the water. Use your tabs.

457
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,049
- Tabs?
- They're new.

458
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,052
<i>Quick!</i>

459
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,317
That's right. Now you're behaving.

460
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,730
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.

461
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,611
Are they after us?

462
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,530
He's not stalking us.

463
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,200
But that's an Air Force plane.

464
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,786
It's Ferrarin.

465
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,294
You know him?

466
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,298
The Air Force is waiting for us.
He'll show us a way through.

467
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,653
He says to fly low to the Adriatic.

468
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,280
Thanks, buddy!

469
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,782
Thank you!

470
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,044
He saw you and signaled
"pearls before swine."

471
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,612
Beautiful.

472
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,908
A single rose blooming in a secret garden.

473
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,998
Naughty boy. This is a private garden.

474
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,626
You've got to read this.

475
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,718
It's from Hollywood.

476
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,638
"Regarding your starring
in the movie script you sent..."

477
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,475
I'm going to be a star, I'm sure of it.

478
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,438
The movie's called <i>Flower of the Adriatic.</i>

479
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,566
- Nice name.
- Like it? Then it's settled.

480
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,110
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

481
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,742
Being a hired gun
is just a rung on the ladder.

482
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,453
The next rung is Hollywood star.

483
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,954
And then?

484
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,956
President!

485
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:55,844
I'm serious. I'll make you
First Lady, Gina. I mean it.

486
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,554
Gina!

487
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,516
You're a dreamer. I like that in a man.

488
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,559
Really?

489
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,481
But I can't go.
I have a longstanding bet going here.

490
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,446
I bet myself a certain man
will visit me here,

491
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,573
and I'll tell him I love him.

492
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,952
But the fool only comes
to the club at night.

493
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
He never comes out in daylight.

494
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,708
That jerk is back!

495
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,312
You fool.

496
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,658
He kept going. I lost again.

497
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,912
You mean you're betting on that jerk?

498
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,663
Why not?

499
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,918
Life here is more complicated
than in your country.

500
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,295
Romance is easy, but...

501
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,507
Good luck in Hollywood, kid.

502
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,051
"Kid?"

503
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,850
I bumped my head when you did that roll.

504
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,102
Just saying hello to a friend.

505
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,063
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

506
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:59,444
The woman in white on the terrace?
Grandpa told me.

507
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,822
All the pilots in the Adriatic
are in love with Gina.

508
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,616
He's got a big mouth.

509
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,621
What's she like?
Are you in love with her too?

510
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,124
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.

511
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,960
Wait. Hey!

512
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,612
A girl in a fighter plane!

513
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,115
Where's Porco?

514
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,617
Talking politics with my dad.

515
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:52,122
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.

516
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:56,376
They want to link up
with the Pirates' Federation.

517
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,088
There's no money
in chasing pirates any more.

518
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,881
- There.
- Thanks.

519
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,093
All this talk about a depression!

520
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,638
You ought to sell
your services somewhere, too.

521
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,100
A good pilot can make good money.

522
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,435
Got any smokes?

523
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,396
Curtis will go back to the States soon.

524
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,233
We're the ones who should go to America.

525
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,280
Farewell to days of fun
and freedom in the Adriatic.

526
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,032
Is that Byron?

527
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,951
- No, it's me. See you.
- Thanks.

528
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,956
Porco, it's terrible!

529
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,752
Their fuel costs three times
more than in Italy.

530
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,756
Give us a break.

531
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,218
We don't dilute our gas here.
Girls are so stupid.

532
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,471
Talk to her, will you?

533
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,848
Pay him, Fio.

534
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:56,478
Then stuff your bigger-than-it-looks
backside in the jump seat.

535
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,271
We're off.

536
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,691
The fuel goes on your bill!

537
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,867
He wasn't gouging us. It's give and take.

538
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,414
It's pretty around here,
but everyone's broke.

539
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,460
There's the island.

540
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,899
It's beautiful!

541
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,209
What a great hideout.

542
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,047
Agh! My butt's gone to sleep.

543
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,688
Don't move!

544
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,067
Look at you silly idiots.

545
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,862
Boss! We got him!

546
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,655
Watch who you're stepping on!

547
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,407
Out of my way!

548
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,285
We've been waiting, pig.

549
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,078
We knew you were coming.

550
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,164
We've got scores to settle.

551
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,001
Look at this! He brought a girl!

552
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:43,918
She's pretty.

553
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:48,339
Shut up! So what?
Women make up half of the world.

554
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:53,178
That's not just any girl.
She's Piccolo's chief designer.

555
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:57,223
This cute little thing?

556
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,892
Are you sure?

557
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:04,439
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.

558
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,442
Really, Porco?

559
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,820
I never lie about planes.

560
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,449
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.

561
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,287
You're in debt, too? Serves you right!

562
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:24,209
Bust that plane up so bad,
all he's got left is the loan!

563
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,963
You're going to take an axe
to the plane I built?

564
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,342
A plane as beautiful as that?

565
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,970
It's a long story, miss.

566
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,349
- I'll bet!
- Well, you know...

567
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,143
And you call yourselves pilots?

568
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,020
Where are my shoes?

569
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,908
I was raised on stories
about seaplane pilots.

570
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:02,830
My grandpa always said
there are no finer people anywhere.

571
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:07,168
Their hearts are washed clean
by the sea and sky.

572
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,922
So they're braver than sailors...

573
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,092
and prouder than regular pilots.

574
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,722
That's right. That's us seaplane pilots!

575
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:25,478
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.

576
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,189
- Yeah! That's right, miss!
- You tell him!

577
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,650
Hurray for seaplane pilots!

578
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,987
Played them like a fiddle.

579
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:39,450
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

580
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:43,329
But honor won't let us
just walk away, either.

581
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,999
Mince the pig!

582
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,085
Yeah! Turn him into a baconburger!

583
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,087
Don't be so pigheaded!

584
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,466
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?

585
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,678
You need that American to save you?

586
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,807
Your mothers would weep.
And tell you to take a bath!

587
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,478
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one against Curtis...

588
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,316
for the honor
of the seaplane pilots of the Adriatic!

589
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,320
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing. Fight fair!

590
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,366
I always said
we shouldn't have hired Curtis.

591
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,036
Stop trying to weasel out.

592
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,706
- What do we do, Boss?
- She has a point.

593
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,628
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtis?

594
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,339
Get him to fight the pig again?

595
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,716
But the contract's expired.

596
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,968
This is embarrassing!

597
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:44,766
It's Curtiss!

598
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,560
Hey, it's Curtis!

599
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,939
I heard you! I don't run and I don't hide!

600
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,195
What idiot put a path up there?

601
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:09,874
Hold this for me.

602
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,006
So you want a return match?

603
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:23,012
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun now.

604
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,765
So what do you want?

605
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,277
Beautiful!

606
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,280
Will you marry me if I win?

607
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,828
I'm serious.

608
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:51,457
All right. But if Porco wins,
you pay his bills.

609
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,334
Wait, Fio!

610
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:54,877
You keep out of it.

611
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,089
- Stay out of it!
- Shut up!

612
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,176
Speak now or hold your peace, Fio.

613
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,928
It's up to him.

614
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,888
It's a lot of money.

615
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,014
It's a bargain!

616
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,808
Yes or no?

617
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,353
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

618
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,479
Good!

619
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:18,943
Listen, all of you!
I like this girl's spirit.

620
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:22,447
The Mamma Aiutos will sponsor this fight!

621
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,825
Count the Federation in!

622
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,249
See you later, Miss Fio!

623
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,711
Morons!

624
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,672
Don't forget to show up, pig!

625
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,676
Shut up and get out of here!

626
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,470
See ya!

627
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:53,811
Look what you've gone and gotten me into!

628
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,816
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.

629
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,324
Fio?

630
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,702
I've got to thank you anyway.

631
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,079
You got me an opportunity.

632
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:16,584
Thanks. I guess fate meant
for us to be a team.

633
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,836
So we're partners?

634
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,840
My chances are only 50-50.

635
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,802
I believe in you.

636
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:32,683
I hate that word, but it sounds
different coming from you.

637
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:42,360
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?

638
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,820
I'm fine.

639
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,741
My heart started beating
so fast I couldn't breathe.

640
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,535
I was really scared.

641
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,996
My knees are all wobbly!

642
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,626
Hey!

643
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,378
I'm going swimming.

644
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,899
Porco, we screwed up!

645
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,025
How?

646
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:27,530
We didn't pad the bill.

647
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,574
We blew it!

648
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,704
You're right!

649
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,759
Porco?

650
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,762
What? Can't you sleep?

651
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,514
I could've sworn...

652
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,768
Or was I dreaming?

653
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,064
Go back to sleep.
We're off early tomorrow.

654
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,775
Porco?

655
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,653
Why did you turn into a pig?

656
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,363
It's a long story.

657
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:57,286
My father was in the same unit
as Lieutenant Marco Paggot.

658
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:02,583
I used to love the story
about how he jumped off a cliff

659
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,669
to rescue an enemy pilot.

660
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,592
Porco! Shall I kiss you?

661
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:18,599
Like the princess who turned
the frog back into a prince?

662
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:23,062
Don't be stupid.
Save it for someone special.

663
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,482
Maybe I'm not the one.

664
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,695
You're a good girl.

665
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:35,866
You make me think
humanity's not a complete waste.

666
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,536
Now be good and go to sleep.

667
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,122
Tell me a story, then I'll sleep.

668
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:43,916
A story?

669
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,712
Let's see.

670
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,015
It was the last summer of the war.

671
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,685
We were on our usual patrol
over the Adriatic,

672
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,313
heading for Istria.

673
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,739
<i>Berlini was my wingman.</i>

674
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:19,410
<i>An old friend,
who'd gotten married two days earlier.</i>

675
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,748
<i>I was best man at his wedding.</i>

676
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,169
<i>But we couldn't get leave,
so we'd come straight back to base.</i>

677
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,359
Planes were dropping like flies,
ours and theirs.

678
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,196
There were three of them on my tail.

679
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,115
I had my hands full.

680
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,410
Then I was the only one left on our side.

681
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:06,874
The enemy kept on coming.
They had bloodshot eyes.

682
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:12,379
I was numb, I couldn't see.
I thought I was a goner.

683
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:16,801
Suddenly everything went white
all around me.

684
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,260
White?

685
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,930
Like I was in pure light.

686
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:27,394
<i>But a light so strange
I didn't notice I was in a cloud.</i>

687
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,733
<i>I didn't even have the strength
to hold the stick.</i>

688
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,945
<i>But the plane flew itself.</i>

689
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,806
A world above the clouds?

690
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:10,020
Yeah, and dead quiet.
The sky was so beautiful...

691
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:15,651
with this one long contrail
stretching out of sight.

692
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,264
Berlini, you're okay!

693
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,478
Berlini, wait! Where are you going?

694
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,912
Berlini, stop! What about Gina?

695
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,705
I'll go instead!

696
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:55,125
When I came to, I was all alone,
flying just above the waves.

697
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,131
Heaven wasn't ready for you.

698
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,846
I think God was telling me
to fly alone forever.

699
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,683
No, Porco! You're a good person!

700
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:16,689
The good ones are all dead.
And maybe what I saw was Hell.

701
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,817
End of story. Go to sleep.

702
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,447
That junkyard sold me rusty ammo.

703
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:32,371
I'm glad you came back alive.
I really like you, Porco.

704
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,040
Good night!

705
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:03,610
- Place your bets here!
- The pig or Curtis?

706
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,904
If you're real men, put your money
where your mouths are!

707
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,573
Come get ice cream!

708
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,127
You'd think it was a carnival!

709
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,254
They're all air pirates?

710
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:27,217
The scum of the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers...

711
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,429
spies, undercover cops,
and a few respectable citizens.

712
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,683
This is going to make me even more famous!

713
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:38,479
<i>Ten minutes to start!</i>

714
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:44,485
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtis is about to begin!

715
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:50,991
There's no rules. The first one
to run is a coward forever!

716
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,494
Shut up! We came here for a dogfight.

717
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,287
We're not here for a lecture!

718
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:02,461
Shut up! Open your mouth and we shoot you!

719
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,889
A ten-ton bomb would be better.

720
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:19,144
This fight decides the fate
of our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...

721
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,896
who needs no introduction!

722
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:25,859
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!

723
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,196
Get on with it!

724
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,658
Quiet! There are formalities to observe!

725
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:36,161
Both sides will place their wagers!

726
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,293
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

727
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,504
Put it down!

728
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:52,970
No complaints? All right, shake hands
and come out flying!

729
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,181
Forget it. I'll keep my hands clean.

730
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,061
That's not very friendly.

731
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,148
We'll go straight to the church!

732
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:09,278
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.

733
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,661
- May we have a picture?
- We took a bath!

734
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,663
Smile, everyone!

735
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,331
Smile!

736
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,833
Ready...

737
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:43,854
Here, here!

738
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,440
Black wins if it's over in three minutes!

739
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,943
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!

740
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,449
<i>15 seconds to start.</i>

741
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,413
That is so cool!

742
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,583
<i>Five seconds... Four...</i>

743
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,585
<i>Three... Two...</i>

744
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,295
<i>One... Zero!</i>

745
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,472
Curtis is up first!

746
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,575
It's all Curtis so far!

747
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,618
Gimme!

748
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,961
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

749
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,046
He's smart to stay low.

750
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,549
He's harder to hit.

751
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,849
Don't worry! I've got lots of ammo.

752
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,661
- A barrel roll. The pig's on his tail!
- A barrel roll?

753
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,248
That trick made him
the Ace of the Adriatic!

754
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,296
Damn!

755
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,720
Now!

756
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,977
- He didn't shoot!
- Did his gun jam?

757
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:51,064
He's not going to shoot
until the very end.

758
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,107
What?

759
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:56,862
The pig's not a killer.
The American still has plenty of ammo!

760
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,155
Now! Shoot!

761
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,742
He didn't fire. What did I tell you?

762
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,329
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.

763
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,750
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three rounds into the engine.

764
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:13,462
The damn fool!
This is no time for sportsmanship.

765
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:14,463
Porco...

766
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,383
What's wrong with you? Shoot!

767
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:23,930
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad.

768
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,729
Here they come!

769
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,234
Come on, fight like a pig!

770
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,659
Not this way! No!

771
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,494
He's coming around!

772
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,871
Get down!

773
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,675
Go fight somewhere else!

774
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,557
Look at those vapor trails!

775
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:17,943
You only see this once in a lifetime!

776
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,236
This is so moving!

777
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,457
If she doesn't hurry she'll miss it.

778
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,210
She won't come out of her room.

779
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,880
Are we going or not? I want to see it too!

780
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,311
<i>F to Gina. Warn pig.</i>

781
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,481
<i>Stop fooling around. Air Force is coming.</i>

782
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,025
"F"? That's Ferrarin.

783
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,238
Time to go!

784
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,719
They're both really tough.

785
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,804
They're just getting warmed up.

786
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,808
Go, Porco!

787
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,814
You stupid pig!

788
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:46,198
You think you can have Fio?

789
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,872
Now the pig's got his tail!

790
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,665
The finale!

791
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:00,629
Huh?

792
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,882
It's jammed.

793
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,179
You're finished!

794
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,850
What?

795
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,894
Jammed!

796
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:20,106
What's the matter, out of ammo?

797
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,985
It's broken. Fio's big butt!

798
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:29,324
No ties in this game!

799
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,538
This isn't a western!
What are you going to hit with that?

800
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,083
You jerk!

801
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,089
What's that going to do? Hi-ho Silver!

802
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,140
You rotten pig!

803
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,395
Missed!

804
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,480
Chicken!

805
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:01,648
You ducked!

806
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,108
You don't love her.

807
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,025
Shut up, pig!

808
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,153
Something's wrong.

809
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,363
They're coming down!

810
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,623
They're back!

811
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,585
Wait! The prizes stay here!

812
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:25,130
All right, wait for me!

813
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,804
You eat too much!

814
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,641
Cowboy!

815
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,732
Put 'em up.

816
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,984
Go punch a cow!

817
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,576
Come on, Porco!

818
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,622
Get up, pig.

819
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,960
That's dirty!

820
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:31,738
Uppercut! Block!

821
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,156
Yes! Yes!

822
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,953
Yes! The Federation can take bets.

823
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,663
Somebody bring a bell!

824
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,168
Can't you go faster?

825
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:47,170
No. She'll overheat.

826
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,548
Pilots are all crazy!

827
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:00,266
Fio! Did you see that punch?

828
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,065
I'll finish you in the next round.

829
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,401
I'll make sure

830
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,070
- I take you out.
- Stay in there!

831
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,239
I'm gonna flatten you, pig.

832
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,284
Come on, pretty boy!

833
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:21,454
You're the pretty boy here!

834
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:25,208
Chasing every girl you see!

835
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:26,710
What about you?

836
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,629
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

837
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,089
What was that?

838
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:35,719
You only get one!

839
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,431
Gina...

840
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,728
Miss Gina to you!

841
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:49,482
Gina's in love with you!

842
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,156
She sits in that garden...

843
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:00,869
and waits...

844
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,040
for you to come!

845
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,841
- Porco!
- The bell!

846
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:16,509
Start the count!

847
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,595
Look at him!

848
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,728
The Air Force isn't here yet.

849
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,493
Trying to psyche me out, huh?

850
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:47,707
I don't get you.

851
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,710
It's the truth!

852
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,423
You can't have Fio!

853
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,425
That's Gina!

854
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,388
There's trouble!

855
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,530
First one to stand wins!

856
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:22,408
Coming through!

857
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,496
Gina, stop!

858
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,918
Marco, can you hear me?

859
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,924
Are you going to break
another woman's heart?

860
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,518
Porco!

861
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,065
- Porco!
- Thank you, Porco!

862
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,734
It was nothing.

863
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,787
Okay, the party's over.
The Italian Air Force is coming.

864
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,290
Get out of here, everyone.

865
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,794
Come to the club. Drinks are on the house!

866
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,715
We're out of here!

867
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,060
It's over.

868
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,399
Boss! Hurry!

869
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,359
There are formalities to observe!

870
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:45,074
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes.

871
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,117
Bye!

872
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:49,329
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!

873
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:52,999
Thanks, Mr. Curtis!

874
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:56,127
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.

875
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:59,714
Sure. But I've made up my mind.

876
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,842
You ride in Gina's plane.

877
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,135
No!

878
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,056
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?

879
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:13,269
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.

880
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,857
You always do this. It's not fair.

881
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:23,279
Sorry. Off you go.

882
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:29,869
Take her up.

883
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:03,903
Here comes the cavalry.

884
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,365
Help me draw them away.

885
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,451
Hey, your face! Wait!

886
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:12,912
Show me your face!

887
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,456
- Your plane's over there!
- Just one look!

888
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:28,052
<i>I never saw Porco again,</i>

889
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,014
<i>even after the Air Force gave up...</i>

890
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,891
<i>and I went back to Milan.</i>

891
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:40,189
<i>But Gina and I became good friends.</i>

892
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:45,945
<i>And we still are, throughout the war</i>

893
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,324
<i>and all the turmoil.</i>

894
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,494
<i>Now I run Piccolo Co.,</i>

895
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:58,791
<i>but I still spend my summers
at the Hotel Adriano.</i>

896
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:05,089
<i>Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces.</i>

897
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,764
<i>Oh, yes. Mr. Curtis isn't President yet,
but he writes us...</i>

898
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:17,518
<i>to tell us how he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer.</i>

899
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:24,692
<i>And did Gina win her bet?
That's our secret.</i>

900
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,884
{\an8}THE END
