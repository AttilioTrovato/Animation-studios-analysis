<i>Yutaka called me at work.</i>

10
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,590
Hurry up kid!
More dishes! Keep 'em coming!

11
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,961
OK!

12
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,395
Taku, teIephone!

13
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,596
Coming.

14
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,338
HeIIo.

15
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,603
<i>- Taku?</i>
- Hey, Yutaka.

16
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,072
<i>Come to school</i>
<i>as soon as you finish today.</i>

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,515
<i>I'll be here waiting for you.</i>

18
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,980
OK.

19
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,980
Sorry, l have to leave
early today.

20
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,615
Now wait a minute!

21
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,290
See you tomorrow!

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,997
You can't reIy on kids!

23
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,704
See you!

24
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,472
Yutaka!

25
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,307
You got here fast.

26
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,973
You told me to!

27
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,073
Take a look.

28
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,891
Who is it? I can't see.

29
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,328
Just transferred to my class.

30
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,827
Her name's Rikako Muto.

31
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,898
- From next semester?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,828
A mid-year transfer?
That's unusual.

33
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,905
She moved here
from Tokyo, that's why.

34
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,064
I just showed her
around the schooI.

35
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,304
That's right,
you re on the student council.

36
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,707
You really like her, huh?

37
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,942
Anyone would,
she's reaIIy good looking.

38
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:47,917
ReaIly?

39
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,183
l can't tell, and we can't just
walk down and look.

40
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,520
lf you want,
we can go down...

41
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,532
...and say we have a question.

42
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,432
Nah, let's not
go that far.

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,232
The teachers know
I'm working this summer...

44
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,468
...and not taking cIasses.

45
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,376
Still mad about
the jr. high schooI trip?

46
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,447
l don't like the way
they just cancelled it...

47
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,712
...and tried to buy us off
with Hawaii in high school.

48
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,380
Do they think we're stupid?

49
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:28,893
Everyone's excited.
l think it was a good move.

50
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:34,089
A relaxing trip will help us
cram for coIIege entrance exams.

51
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:41,464
Hawaii's expensive.
l need to make some money.

52
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:47,012
Just remember to keep up
with your studies.

53
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,375
Don't faIl behind.

54
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,607
Sure. By the way...

55
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:54,116
...was there something
you wanted to talk about?

56
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,281
Not really.
I just feIt Iike seeing you.

57
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,284
l'll get my bike.
Wait by the gate.

59

00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,342

<i>he was a close friend.</i>

61
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,515
<i>lt all started in our last year</i>

62
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,917

<i>suddenly cancelled.</i>

<i>that this year's jr. high school trip... "</i>

64
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,925

65
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:40,966

<i>"Last year, our college</i>
<i>placement results... "</i>

67
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,670
<i>"...were lower than the</i>
<i>prefecturaI high school. "</i>

68
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,367
<i>"Our school's proud traditions</i>
<i>and your obIigations to your parents... "</i>

69
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,810
<i>"... make this completely unacceptable. "</i>

70
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>"To restore our school's honor... "</i>

71
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,147
<i>"... the high school seniors</i>
<i>must redoubIe their efforts. "</i>

72
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,715
<i>"You must set an example</i>
<i>for our jr. high school seniors. "</i>

73
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,387
Let's go see Miss Sayama.
Come on, Taku!

74
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,692
<i>The whole thing was so stupid...</i>

75
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,996
<i>... we decided to complain</i>
<i>to our home room teacher.</i>

76
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,575
We aIl think this is unfair.

77
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,944
Canceling the trip
won't help our grades.

78
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,347
The school owes us
a detailed explanation.

79
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,462
Ask for one
when your grades are better!

80
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,625
I'm already a top student!

81
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:55,196
Don't pressure Miss Sayama
just because she's a woman!

82
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,710
<i>We thought that was the end</i>
<i>of the matter.</i>

83
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,717
<i>But a week later,</i>
<i>at the morning assembly --</i>

84
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:17,060
Your parents have also approved
the trip cancellation.

85
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:22,726
lf you're still not satisfied,
we'II explain the decision.

86
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,233
Raise your hand
if you're stilI not satisfied.

87
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,881

89
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,419
OK.

90
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,856

Wow!

106
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,705
You're already thinking
20 years into the future.

107
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,894
<i>After that, l always thought</i>
<i>of Yutaka...</i>

110

This is Rikako Muto.
She's transferring to my class.

111

See you, then!

112
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,664
See you next semester.

113
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,246
What, you made your move aIready?!

114
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,350
Huh? No, she asked me
where the bookstore was.

115
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,446
She needs to buy her textbooks.

this former gang member.

118
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,935
Sometimes his oId habits come out...

119
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,306
... Iike, the way he smokes.

120
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,350
What?

121
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,719
Do you think there's something
behind her transfer?

122
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,825
<i>Ah, so that's it!</i>

123
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,724
<i>That's the real reason</i>
<i>Yutaka wanted to see me.</i>

124
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,666
Maybe her dad got transferred
or something like that.

125
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,805
See you!

126
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,241
<i>lt really irritated me</i>
<i>when l realized...</i>

127
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,817
<i>... that Yutaka was</i>
<i>interested in Rikako.</i>

128
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,986
<i>Better forget it!</i>
<i>GirIs onIy care about looks</i>.

129
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,488
<i>l never thought</i>
<i>she'd see his real vaIue.</i>

<i>When the new term started.</i> . .

131
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>... Rikako was a bit of a sensation</i>
<i>with us simple country boys.</i>

132
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,535
Hey Taku,
get a look at the girls!

133
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,849
Ariga, right?

134
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,715
l know, they're big.

135
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,258
No! The other court!

136
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,586
She's reaIIy cool.

137
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,816
She didn't even break a sweat.

138
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,521
She's really something!

139
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,994
She plays like a pro!

140
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,725
Tokyo kids can reaIIy hit the baII!

141
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,529
- She stands out.
- Nice legs too!

142
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,230
Bet that type's hard to handle.

143
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,704
Rikako realIy stands out, huh?

144
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,008
l don't know why
you'd say that.

145
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,850
Hey, Yutaka!

146
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,485
Sorry.

147
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,293
Rikako's out of pIace in cIass.

148
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,235
l think it's because
she stands out too much.

149
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,361
Out of place, huh?

150
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,406
Yeah... in lots of ways.

151
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:21,008
RIKAKO MUTO

152
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,578
She really stands out, huh?

153
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,719
She's already 12th in the schooI!

154
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,284
Sports and study --
she's a super woman!

155
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,822
- Let's see Taku, you're...
- Number 92!

156
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,461
You were a better student
in jr. high.

157
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,404
What an attitude!

158
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,671
She's so stuck up!

159
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,646
That's enough!
Stop gossiping.

160
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,940
Time for class!

161
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,362
What s wrong?
Got a crush on Rikako?

162
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:11,129
No, but she doesn't seem
very happy.

163
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:15,605
Oh, come of fit.
She's 12th in the schooI.

164
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,130
l hear you have a new student?

165
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,634
Yeah. Why?

166
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,870
l hear her grades are excellent.

167
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,632
Tokyo students reaIIy are top notch.

168
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,239
How did you hear?

169
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,403
They were taIking about it in town.

170
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,813
Rikako's family
is reIated to the Mutos...

171
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,385
... of Muto Fruit Packing.

172
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,350
Her mother moved back
for family reasons.

173
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,652
She brought
the two children with her.

174
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,627
Maybe her parents got divorced.

175
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,701
ls her father still in Tokyo?

176
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,497
I wonder.

177
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,536
I'm fulI.

178
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,300
Atsushi, mind your manners!

179
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,972
Poor Rikako.
With her grades...

180
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,308
... she'll just go back
to Tokyo for colIege.

181
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,182
Kids sure get jerked around.

182
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,210
Now don't taIk Iike that!

183
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,311
A mother needs
her chiIdren with her!

184
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,422
You don't need
to get upset about it.

185
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,724
ReIocating is a tough decision!

186
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,322
She can't leave them
behind just for schooI!

187
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,568
It's natural for her
to want them with her!

188
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,932
Speaking from experience, huh?

189
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,537
Now you be nice to Rikako!

190
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,742
She must be having
a hard time adjusting.

191
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,546
Sure, sure.

192
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,609
Taku!

193
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,748
Taku! Telephone!

194
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,592
OK!

195
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,559
Hello? Hey, Yutaka.
What's going on?

196
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,057
<i>Well...</i>

197
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,934
What?

198
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,665
<i>It's not really that important.</i>

199
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,907
<i>l visited Rikako today!</i>

200
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,308
Where? At her house?

201
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,383
<i>She was out sick.</i>
<i>l heard she lives alone</i>.

202
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,247
<i>l was worried.</i>

203
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:19,516
She lives alone? Her mother's
house isn't that far from school.

204
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,556
And you went
to see her? Alone?

205
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,165
<i>Yeah. And... she was</i>
<i>alone in bed!</i>

206
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,968
She was in bed. So?

207
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,564
<i>Nothing. That's it.</i>

208
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,002
<i>That's all.</i>

209
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,952
<i>So you like that kind of girl</i>,
<i>do you Yutaka ?</i>

210
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,031
<i>The year ended,</i>
<i>and March came...</i>

211
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,935
<i>... and with it,</i>
<i>the long-awaited school trip.</i>

212
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,296
Taku!

213
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,397
HAWAll

214
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,072
You're not going swimming?

215
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,874
Today's our Iast day!

216
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,007
l've had an upset stomach
alI morning.

217
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,449
Too bad! See you, then!

218
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,779
So long.

219
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,121
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>all the trouble started.</i>

220
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,669
Taku!

221
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,399
Could you lend me some money?

222
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,680
Money?

223
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,250
What happened?
Did you run out?

224
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,049
WelI... not exactly.

225
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,825
l lost all the money
I had with me!

226
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,519
That's awfuI!

227
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,991
Did you telI the teacher?

228
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,932
With traveler's checks,
you can get your money back.

229
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,329
l'lI get in trouble.

230
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:18,102
Don't be silly!
You've got to report it!

231
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,811
l'm sorry. Your Kochi dialect
reminds me of samurai movies.

232
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,150
Want to sit down?

233
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,321
Let me telI you what happened.

234
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:38,288
l mostly brought cash. Travelers
checks are a pain, right? So...

235
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,194
Cash? You mean doIIars?

236
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,859
Right, about $400 in cash.

237
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,698
I must have left it somewhere.

238
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:50,571
We were supposed to bring
Iess than Yen 20,000 in cash!

239
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,701
The rest was supposed
to be traveler's checks.

240
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,974
Nobody really does that!

241
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,050
You sound like
one of the teachers!

242
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,450
Are you a goody-goody?

243
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,216
Too bad.
l heard you were different.

244
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,894
Your Tokyo dialect
sounds so harsh!

245
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,901
Why? I'm not angry!

246
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,233
And l'm not a samurai!

247
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,410
You're mean, Taku.

248
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,002
Nobody ever caIIed me harsh.

249
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,241
ls that how I sound?

250
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,349
Yeah. Everyone thinks so.

251
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,923
But they're a fraid you'll say
they sound Iike samurai.

252
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,514
OK, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,087
I didn't mean
to make fun of you.

254
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,533
You hear diaIects in dramas, right?

255
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,228
I thought diaIects were alI gone.

256
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:01,472
But Kochi people really talk that way.
I was shocked.

257
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:07,341
Still, l never told anyone
I felt that way, tiIl today.

258
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,184
You'd better not!

259
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,017
At first l couldn't
understand a word.

260
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,485
l kept asking people
to say things twice.

261
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,622
Maybe that's why nobody likes me.

262
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,722
Who doesn't Iike you?

263
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,667
Everybody, boys especially.
Nobody taIks to me.

264
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,607
Well, except Yutaka, the class
representative. He's nice.

265
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,801
Yeah, Yutaka's a good guy.

266
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,969
Did he tell you about me?

267
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,412
Yes. l saw you working
at the restaurant...

268
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,507
... during the winter vacation.

269
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,885
Yutaka was with me.
He said you work reaIIy hard.

270
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,152
Then he told me
a Iot about you.

271
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,456
Like your protest
over the canceIIed schooI trip.

272
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,397
He told you about tha t?

273
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:58,060
You must have a lot of
money from your job, right?

274
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,272
OK, how much?

275
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,769
What can you spare?

276
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,813
I brought about Yen 60,000 and $400.

277
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,778
l haven't spent much.
How about $300?

278
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,877
Really? Then could you
lend me the Yen 60,000?

279
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,631
Wait here.

280
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,013
Sixty thousand yen!

281
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,060
Much obIiged, Mr Morisaki!

282
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,291
Should l give it
to you right here?

283
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,563
You're pretty cautious.
OK, sit down right there.

284
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,372
Put it in this handkerchief
and hand it to me.

285
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,670
Feels like we're doing
something illegal!

286
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,056
l probably can't pay
you back right away.

287
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,649
l'm expecting some money, though.

288
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,694
Pay me back anytime.

289
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,631
Please don't tell anyone about this.

290
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,961
Sure, but why?

291
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,930
Mama would yell at me.

292
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,970
<i>"Mama... "</i>

293
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,534
What's her story?

294
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,575
Hey!

295
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,180
l'm surprised she knew
so much about me!

296
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,955
So you guys are friends.
Oating, huh?

297
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,290
That wasn't a date.

298
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,597
I ran into her over vacation.

299
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,932
l asked her to a movie --
and she said yes!

300
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,301
l couldn't think
of a thing to say.

301
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:20,901
We passed your restaurant,
so I started talking about you.

302
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:21,979
lt reaIly helped.

303
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,777
Maybe, but I just got hit
for a Ioan.

304
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,818
Rikako asked you for a loan?

305
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:32,715
Yeah. l walked by,
and she said she lost her money.

306
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,850
Maybe she remembered
l made money over the break.

307
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,364
So she lost all her money?
Poor thing!

308
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,268
- Want to walk around town?
- Sure.

309
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,602
Wait a sec,
l'lI drop my stuff.

310
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,455
I said not to tell!
You already toId Yutaka!

311
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,827
Huh? What did he say?

312
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,970
He offered to lend me money!

313
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,098
See?
Isn't he a good guy?

314
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:29,545
l borrowed Yen 20,000...
but pIease keep this a secret!!

315
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,583
l hope you can remember this time!

316
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,714
How did her parents raise her?!

317
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,419
<i>The next day we returned to Kochi...</i>

318
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,755
<i>... and l bought some candid shots</i>
<i>of Rikako from a friend.</i>

319
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,198
<i>l felt like getting even</i>.

320
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,835
<i>And l thought that was it</i>
<i>for my bad feelings.</i>

321
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,405
<i>But next term,</i>
<i>we ended up in the same class.</i>

322
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,812
Yumi, Iunch!

323
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,988
<i>Rikako finally made a friend --</i>

324
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,695
<i>-- a quiet girl in the same class.</i>
<i>Her name was Yumi Kohama</i>.

325
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,799
<i>That was nice for her...</i>

326
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,099
<i>... but spring break came, and</i>
<i>l still didn't have my money.</i>

327
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,337
<i>l thought she'd forgotten it.</i>

328
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:37,074
Taku, telephone!
lt's Yumi Kohama!

329
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,880
Is that you Yumi?

330
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,281
Where are you caIIing from?

331
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,258
<i>You're the only person</i>
<i>l could think of to call!</i>

332
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,156
What's wrong?

333
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,794
We were going to Osaka
for two nights...

334
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,162
... for a concert.

335
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:01,403
Now we're at the airport,
and Rikako says she's going to Tokyo!

336
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,974
That was her pIan all along!

337
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,942
She doesn't know l'm calling you.

338
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:07,909
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

339
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:12,176
She says there's no difference
where we go.

340
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,020
<i>Rikako even bought</i>
<i>two tickets to Tokyo.</i>

341
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,249
<i>l don't want to lie</i>
<i>to my mother!</i>

342
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,985
Look, calm down!
You don't have to go!

343
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,495
Just leave and let Rikako
go by herseIf.

344
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,967
<i>l can't! Her mother let her go</i>
<i>because I'm with her!</i>

345
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:35,005
<i>She really wants me to go</i>.
<i>What should I do?</i>

346
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,903
What should you do... ?

347
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,973
Wait a minute!
Why are you asking ME?

348
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,142
She told me you lent her
the money for the tickets.

349
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,914
You're her friend.
Can't you convince her?

350
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,981
Please come to the airport.
Our flight is at 11:30.

351
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,492
We've got 90 minutes.

352
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,394
<i>l really need you to come</i>! 

353
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,132
That money again!

354
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,288
<i>So she didn't really</i>
<i>lose her money. lt was a lie!</i>

355
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,888
<i>It was just part of her plan</i>
<i>for this trip!</i>

356
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,398
<i>What a jerk!</i>

357
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,664
KOCHI AlR TERMlNAL

358
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,084
You came!

359
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,382
Where is she?

360
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,418
In the rest room.

361
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,826
Says she's not feeIing well.

362
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:08,331
l wish she'd get worse.
Then we wouIdn't have to go!

363
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,924
Anyway, she's way out of Iine!

364
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,328
You're her friend.
You should tell her off!

365
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,776
She really wants to see her father.
l feel sorry for her.

366
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,938
What about her father?

367
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,086
What are you doing here?
Did Yumi call you?

368
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,885
Rikako, let's not lie
about this trip!

369
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,690
Let's telI your mother.

370
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,094
She'd never Iet me go!

371
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,501
l've been planning
this for so Iong.

372
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,239
Wait a minute.
OK, how about this.

373
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,245
Yumi, call home.
Say you feeI sick and can't go.

374
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,211
But...

375
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,377
And Rikako's going by herseIf...

376
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,979
... because it would be a shame
to waste both tickets.

377
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,616
Your parents
will onIy worry about you.

378
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,626
They won't think about Rikako.

379
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:15,165
You're right!
My mom doesn't know Rikako's mom.

380
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,359
She won't say anything.

381
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,163
OK, fine.

382
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,828
I'll caIl her!

383
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,008
Yumi's from a strict family.

384
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,912
She's not going to run
off to Tokyo just Iike that.

385
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,623
So, you're not feeIing weIl?

386
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:46,288
My period just started.
Sometimes it's really bad.

387
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,523
lt must be tough.

388
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,766
Boys don't know what it's Iike.

389
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,568
Do you reaIly have to go?

390
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:59,041
l'll get your money from Papa.
Don't worry, I'II pay you.

391
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:09,651
lf you're worried about going alone,
shaIl l go with you?

392
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,416
Really?
Would you reaIIy do that?

393
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,764
Hey, listen.

394
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,342
Your father knows
you're coming, right?

395
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,311
ls he meeting you?

396
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,750
No, I doubt it.

397
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,753
Could he find a place
for me to stay?

398
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,249
Sure. I'II ask him.

399
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,224
When l see Papa,
l'm going to tell him.

400
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,195
l want to move back to Tokyo
and live with him.

401
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,272
<i>"We are now in our final approach</i>
<i>to Haneda Airport. "</i>

402
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:07,335
<i>As l folIowed Rikako</i>
<i>around Tokyo, l thought --</i>

403
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,913
<i>"she's done it to me again. "</i>

404
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:14,779
<i>But I couldn't just let her go</i>
<i>to Tokyo by herself</i>.

405
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:20,116
The cherry trees around here
are really nice.

406
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,556
My house is this way.

407
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:28,756
My grandparents used to live here.
This was aII farm land.

408
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,364
They built apartments,
and we got the nicest one.

409
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:39,068
lt was big, even for four of us.
I bet Papa's IoneIy.

410
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,941
He'Il be gIad to see you.

411
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,946
It s good to be back.

412
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,928
Who is it?

413
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,826
<i>lsn't this the Mutos?</i>

414
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,791
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

415
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,230
Umm... is Papa home?

416
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,499
<i>ls that Rikako? l'll come down,</i>
<i>wait in the lobby!</i>

417
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,852
What a surprise!
I didn't know you were coming.

418
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,259
Are you alone?

419
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,853
My boyfriend, from Kochi.

420
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,794
lt's spring break.
We came to visit.

421
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,166
Oh really?
Thanks for Iooking after Rikako.

422
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,861
ShaII we go for coffee?

423
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,403
l want to see my old room!
How's it look?

424
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,868
OK, Iet's go up.

425
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:53,411
l'm sorry... could you wait
here for a little whiIe?

426
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,644
Sure.

427
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,115
Morisaki, thanks
for putting up with Rikako.

428
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,627
l hear you don't have a place to stay?
I made a reservation.

429
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:42,790
And Rikako owes you money.
Thank you very much.

430
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,572
<i>I reaIly felt sorry for her</i>--
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

431
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,742
GUlDE TO WEST SHINJUKU

432
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,253
Hi, Mom?

433
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,093
<i>Taku? lt's almost dinner time.</i>
<i>Come home.</i>

434
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,030
Look, I can't make it tonight.

435
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:19,364
<i>OK, we'Il go ahead</i>.
<i>Don't be too late.</i>

436
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,131
l'm in Tokyo.

437
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,935
<i>Tokyo?! How did you get there?</i>

438
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,737
l took a plane
straight to Tokyo.

439
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,776
<i>What?!</i>

440
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,236
l'm escorting someone.

441
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,713
<i>Escorting?! Who?</i>

442
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,977
I'II be home in two days.

443
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,643
<i>What's going on?!</i>

444
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,147
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

445
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,689
I'II explain Iater! Goodbye!

446
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,052
<i>Taku! Wait!</i>

447
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,329
Rikako!

448
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,435
What happened?

449
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,198
l'm staying here tonight.
Papa's paying, so I can if l want.

450
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,240
Hey...

451
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:21,760
<i>The whole thing was starting</i>
<i>to feel like a bad soap opera.</i>

452
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,003
Want some beer, Rikako?

453
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:39,415
No? We drink it sometimes
when no one's around.

454
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,715
Make me a rum and coke.

455
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,923
I tried them at a friend's house.

456
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,669
Papa's going on a trip with his
Iady friend for the holidays.

457
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,901
WeIl, it IS spring vacation.

458
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,672
My room was completely changed!

459
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,010
The wallpaper's dark green!

460
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,473
l hate green!

461
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,679
You're right.
Green's no good!

462
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:25,225
All the pots are fancy enamelware.
It's so stupid.

463
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,795
Nobody uses enameIware anymore!

464
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,228
Listen. Taku.

465
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:35,030
When my parents were fighting,
l thought Mama was wrong.

466
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,235
She wouldn't give in,
so Papa didn't either.

467
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,312
It ended in a bad divorce.

468
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,909
My brother and l had to move
and Ieave all our friends.

469
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,313
I was on Papa's side.

470
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,755
But he wasn't on my side.

471
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,754
On your side? Wait...

472
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,792
My life is so sad.

473
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,567
Things must be tough,
but you should heIp your mother.

474
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,329
You shouldn't be living by yourself.

475
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,942
l didn't want to impose
on Mama's family.

476
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,604
l wasn't mad at her.

477
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,080
WeII, that's different.

478
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,946
lt's none of your business.

479
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,163
<i>"Good evening. "</i>

480
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,126
<i>"How are you spending</i>
<i>the spring holidays?"</i>

481
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,687
Ouch!

482
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,003
<i>She's having a tough time?</i>
<i>What about me?</i>

483
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,911
Taku!

484
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,372
Get up!

485
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:31,419
lt's about time.
I was waiting to use the bathroom.

486
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,819
I had to go downstairs!

487
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,149
Sorry...

488
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,820
Could you leave for a whiIe?

489
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,363
l'm meeting someone.
I need to dress.

490
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,557
Your father?

491
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,102
A high school friend.
I caIIed this morning.

492
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,034
We're meeting downstairs.

493
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,605
That s great.

494
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:53,776
l need to shower and change.
Hurry up and Ieave.

495
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,719
<i>I think this was when l decided</i>
<i>to attend college in Tokyo.</i>

496
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:13,553
<i>Seeing Rikako bounce back somehow</i>
<i>made me feel at ease here.</i>

497
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:23,164
Good timing. My friend just called,
we're meeting in the lobby.

498
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,798
- Oh, really?
- See you, then!

499
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:31,070
What about the key?
Are you going out?

500
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,206
No, l'll take a nap.

501
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,978
ReaIIy? Sorry!

502
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,916
Don't worry.
Enjoy yourself.

503
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,763
HeIIo?

504
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,342
<i>Taku, could you come</i>
<i>down to the coffee shop?</i>

505
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,074
What happened?
Forget your wallet?

506
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,945
<i>Just come down!</i>
<i>You're rescuing me.</i>

507
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,350
So, what is it this time?

508
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,926
Taku, over here!

509
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,939
This is Taku Morisaki.

510
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,571
He was worried about me,
so he came along.

511
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,445
Taku, this is Okada,
my former cIassmate.

512
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,079
Hi.

513
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,780
Rikako, a boyfriend already?
What a shock!

514
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,293
Look who's talking.
As soon as I Ieft...

515
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,761
... you got together with Ryoko.

516
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,458
I feeI kind of betrayed!

517
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,560
But you re prettier.
Ryoko says so too.

518
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,468
She says she can't compete.

519
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,006
Listen. Taku.

520
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:08,174
Wouldn't YOU be shocked?
l date Okada for a year...

521
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:12,874
... and two months a fter l leave,
he's dating a friend of mine!

522
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,281
Happens aII the time.

523
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,517
Nothing surprises him either!

524
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,053
l called Ryoko. Are you free?

525
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,394
Why don't we all see a movie?
Like a double date.

526
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,065
I'd like to, but...

527
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,674
... Papa's treating me to
Iunch this a fternoon.

528
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:44,010
Too bad. lf we'd known you were
coming, we couId've made pIans.

529
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,173
But your mother's not very fair.

530
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,684
She could've left you in Tokyo.
You're going to college here anyway.

531
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,920
She had to drag her children
off to the country.

532
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,823
What are you talking about?
She's not a child!

533
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,301
What's wrong, Taku?

534
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,300
You're a bore, that's what!
You and this guy both!

535
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:19,476
He must be jealous of me.
Sorry about that.

536
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,245
<i>I was disappointed.</i>

537
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:32,260
<i>ln Kochi Rikako seemed so strong, but</i>
<i>she gets to Tokyo and aIl she does...</i>

538
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,763
<i>... is put on a big show and</i>
<i>fawn over a stupid guy.</i>

539
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:41,832
Rikako?

540
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,544
Okada says to tell you
he's not mad.

541
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,408
That guy's reaIIy dumb.

542
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:57,917
When we were dating l thought
he was kind and thoughtfuI.

543
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,284
l called you because
I wanted to show off.

544
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,624
Afterwards I just felt stupid.

545
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,598
We're really bores--
him and me both.

546
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:15,569
Well, l can see you'd be shocked
about his new girIfriend.

547
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,001
You don't get it, Taku.

548
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:23,236
l was shocked because
he wasn't like l remembered.

549
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,708
AII he talked about was himseIf.

550
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,947
He didn't even ask about Kochi.
But that's his reaI personaIity.

551
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,647
l just never noticed.

552
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,786
I'll stay at my aunt's tonight.

553
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,387
We shouldn't stay
in the same room anyway.

554
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,764
Let's meet at the airport tomorrow.

555
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,899
Our Tokyo trip
wasn't much fun, was it?

556
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,744
<i>ln half an hour,</i>
<i>Rikako seemed to have grown up.</i>

557
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,077
Yumi, what's this?

558
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,451
Do you want one?

559
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,558
<i>After the holidays</i>,
<i>Rikako ignored me...</i>

560
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,020
<i>... just as if nothing had happened.</i>

561
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:17,197
<i>As usual, her only friend</i>
<i>was Yumi Kohama.</i>

562
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,847
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not worried about you...

563
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,788
... but you're going to end up
without any friends.

564
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,192
Try to be a Iittle more...

565
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,487
Leave me aIone!

566
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,717
How were your finals?

567
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:12,815
Awful. l'm going to cram school
in Osaka this summer.

568
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,891
Training camp, huh?

569
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,017
lt'll be a nice change.

570
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,362
Listen...

571
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,465
Don't be upset, but...

572
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:29,004
... did you and Rikako
take a trip during vacation?

573
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,098
Yeah, we did.
How did you know?

574
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,579
How do you think?
The rumor's all over schooI.

575
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,581
Haven't you heard?

576
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,911
No, I haven't.

577
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,747
That's just like you.

578
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,589
Nobody wants to joke about it
to your face.

579
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,124
People are whispering.

580
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,525
Listen, l don't know
what peopIe are saying.

581
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,893
Rikako just went
to see her father.

582
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,932
Yeah, I heard.

583
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,065
From who?
Oid Yumi tell you?

584
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,368
Yumi? Why her?
l heard it straight from Rikako.

585
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,671
l ran into her on the way
home and asked her.

586
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,917
What, that story again?

587
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,421
Yes, l stayed with Taku
in a Tokyo hotel!

588
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,823
What's that got
to do with you?

589
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,393
I'm...

590
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,170
l'm in love with you.

591
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,172
Look --

592
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,809
l hate Kochi, and boys
who speak Kochi diaIect!

593
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:51,149
Don't say that to me!
It makes me sick!

594
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,989
<i>Sick, huh?</i>

595
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,500
Yeah. It was kind of tough.

596
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,003
ls that what
did your grades in?

597
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,571
l'll get back on track
over summer.

598
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,737
Now she's gone too far!

599
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,374
Taku!

600
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,015
Red or white?

601
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,177
Red!

602
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,688
l've gotta talk to you.
Let's go!

603
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,123
What?!

604
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,174
What's the probIem?

605
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,112
Don't talk to me in school!
People wiIl notice.

606
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:56,550
You told Yutaka
we stayed in a hotel in Tokyo?

607
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:57,642
So what?

608
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:02,123
lt was all your idea!
But peopIe are pointing at ME!

609
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,223
Why, you...!

610
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:08,627
l'm suffering thanks to you.
You're the worst, you realIy are.

611
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,734
You're such a loyal friend!
Satisfied?

612
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,086
<i>That trip to Tokyo...</i>

613
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,747
<i>... really was a total disaster</i>
<i>for both of us.</i>

614
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,168
<i>And so autumn came.</i>

615
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,540
<i>Rikako was as isolated as ever.</i>

616
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,685
<i>But her grades</i>
<i>just got better and better.</i>

617
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:11,926
<i>Then, during the last event of</i>
<i>senior year -- the school fair...</i>

618
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,565
Sanuki udon noodIes!

619
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,469
She didn't come today either!

620
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,696
Probably won't come
to the dance performance.

621
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,002
She missed aII the rehearsals.

622
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,269
ProbabIy thinks it's stupid!

623
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:32,780
She cuts group events to raise
her grades! Can you believe it?

624
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,784
Let's tell her off!

625
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,579
How about tomorrow?

626
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,580
Excuse me...

627
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,283
WeIcome!

628
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,485
<i>"Announcement from</i>
<i>the Organizing Committee. "</i>

629
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,154
<i>"Today's final program</i>
<i>is Dance Paradise. "</i>

630
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:51,360
<i>"Classes finished with cleanup</i>
<i>should assemble in the courtyard. "</i>

631
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:57,634
<i>"l repeat. Classes finished</i>
<i>with cleanup should assemble... "</i>

632
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,972
ls that all?
I'm in a hurry!

633
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,102
What? What did you say?

634
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,115
In a hurry? Don't you care
about class harmony?

635
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,810
Class harmony? You sound like some
stupid poIitician!

636
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,057
You're wrapped up in yourself.
What about the rest of the worId?

637
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,054
What kind of world is it where people
can't think of themselves?

638
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,831
Does the world care about me?
I'II take care of myseIf!

639
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,961
You pretend you're not interested in boys,
but I see you fIirting!

640
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,404
Making eyes at Yanagida!

641
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,338
Yanagida?!

642
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,840
I don't even know who he is!

643
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,042
Bring him here!
I'Il teII him l hate him!

644
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,278
Stop it!

645
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,989
You'lI just hurt your school record.

646
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,289
No point crying
because of someone Iike this.

647
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,900
We won't forget this!

648
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,842
I think l expected
too much from you.

649
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,587
Taku! How long
have you been there?

650
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,459
l'm just throwing this out.
I heard voices.

651
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:33,995
Good for you.
You stood up to aII those girls.

652
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,470
Even made one of them cry.

653
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,370
It was reaIIy impressive.

654
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,178
You idiot! You're the worst!

655
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,505
Hey!

656
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:19,138
Rikako just ran by.
I think she was crying.

657
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:25,885
Oh, she just got bullied
by the girls in our class.

658
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,889
She cut aII the activities.

659
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:32,822
But she really stood up to them.
They couIdn't touch her.

660
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,421
That Rikako, she's tough.
It was reaIIy something.

661
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,697
You didn't stop them?

662
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:44,700
They'd have just told me
to butt out. They're fed up.

663
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,301
She can be a reaI pain.

664
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,872
You idiot!

665
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:17,739
<i>l figured Yutaka and l would</i>
<i>be back to normaI by next day.</i>

666
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,535
<i>At least, that's what I thought.</i>

667
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:27,240
<i>But we graduated</i>
<i>without speaking again.</i>

668
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,988
<i>Rikako enrolled at Kochi University</i>,
<i>Yutaka went to Kyoto...</i>

669
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,581
<i>... and l went</i>
<i>to college in Tokyo.</i>

670
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:44,024
<i>"We have just landed at Kochi Airport. "</i>

671
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,535
KOCHI AlR TERMlNAL

672
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,053
Hey, Taku!

673
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,518
Yutaka!

674
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,859
Thanks for picking me up.

675
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,856
Sure. l got my license
last month.

676
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,364
l'm impressed you found the time
to take lessons.

677
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:26,369
Took me two months
just to get used to Tokyo.

678
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,603
Another month for my job.

679
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,710
Before l knew it, summer came.

680
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,980
Tokyo and Kyoto are really different.

681
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:38,713
Kyoto's almost like Kochi.
I settIed in right away.

682
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,227
But Kochi's nice.
It's not crowded.

683
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:49,458
And everything you need
is right at hand.

684
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,968
Tokyo's got everything, but
it takes an hour to get anywhere.

685
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,964
Even Katsura Beach's
onIy an hour from here.

686
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,977
Jingu Stadium's an hour,
with train transfers.

687
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,070
An hour from Kyoto...

688
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,979
... you can get to Osaka or Nara.

689
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,984
Gosh, sounds like Kyoto's better.

690
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,555
Want to come in?

691
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,930
l'll pass for today.
Your famiIy must be waiting.

692
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,695
See you at the reunion?

693
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,906
l always wanted to apologize.
Sorry I punched you.

694
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:39,410
Ah, so that explains
the free ride from the airport!

695
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,846
I'Il caII you.

696
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,648
Want to take a walk?

697
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,823
It's been a while.

698
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,218
I was angry that time...

699
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,490
... because l knew you were
hoIding back on my account.

700
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,264
l hadn't noticed tiII then...

701
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,838
... that you reaIIy Iiked Rikako.

702
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:10,163
<i>Yutaka and l spent an hour</i>
<i>there -- then we went home.</i>

703
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,502
PRIVATE PARTY

704
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:27,616
You're living in Osaka?
l'm cIose -- Kobe!

705
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,554
Have a drink!

706
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,716
Thank you...

707
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,021
lt's ridiculous!
I can't even resign from a cIub...

708
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,827
... unless the alumni approve.

709
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,399
So, l went
to Disneyland with him.

710
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,739
We missed the last train.

711
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,704
What happened??

712
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:49,738
l thought l was joining a ski club,
not a religious group!

713
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,077
They keep telephoning me.
lt's driving me nuts!

714
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,477
Better watch the drinking, Yamao.

715
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,655
She's Iate...

716
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,750
Late? Who?

717
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,918
She's Iate...

718
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,632
Scoot over more!

719
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,061
What's happening?

720
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,568
Yamamoto just confessed.

721
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,474
He aIways liked Nishimura!

722
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,942
Good for him.

723
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,574
We've got a new couple!

724
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,682
Time for me to confess too!

725
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,586
l've always had a thing
for Yumi Kohama!

726
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:45,561
Well done, Yamao.
That's the spirit.

727
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,033
What did Yumi say?

728
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,797
She's not here yet!

729
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:56,036
From the start, she was always
in that fIashy Rikako's shadow.

730
01:01:56,145 --> 01:02:00,548
While you were mooning over Rikako,
I had my eye on Yumi.

731
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,413
What's that supposed to mean?

732
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:10,418
Come on, now.
Shall we go to men's room?

733
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,124
Hey, Yamao! Are you OK?

734
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,167
Maybe Rikako's not coming after aII.

735
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:32,580
Rikako said she regrets
the things she said to you.

736
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,186
WeIl, he's passed out.

737
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,054
You're reaIIy Iooking good, Shimizu.

738
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,651
Thanks.

739
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:50,357
Of course, Rikako was always pretty,
but she's even prettier now.

740
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,703
Shimizu toId me she saw Rikako.

741
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,362
Rikako's not here!

742
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,136
l ran into her yesterday,
in the department store.

743
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,972
I toId her about the reunion...

744
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,049
... but she's probably fIown home.

745
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,447
Flown?

746
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,283
Rikako went back to Tokyo?

747
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,326
Yeah. l'd always thought
she was in Kochi U.

748
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:22,791
She got into Kochi U
to please her mother.

749
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,925
But she secretly
tested for a Tokyo school too.

750
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,068
When you met her,
were you, Iike...

751
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:33,268
"Wow, it's great to see you. "
and stuff like that?

752
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,843
How'd you know?

753
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,038
Well, l knew
you never Iiked her!

754
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,041
You're right, l never did.
I really hated her.

755
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,555
But seeing her again
made me feel nostalgic.

756
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,723
It's kind of Iike changing seats.

757
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,225
When you're little and have to sit
next to someone you hate...

758
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,322
... you don't even
want to go to schooI.

759
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:01,870
The problem is,
your world is too smalI.

760
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:06,367
If you have something other than
schooI, like piano Iessons...

761
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,172
... people you dislike
aren't a probIem.

762
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,009
Let's see. That means...

763
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,918
... you realize your world
was too smaII then?

764
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,988
And that's why
you went after Rikako?

765
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,786
We both had the same probIem.

766
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:27,260
Rikako said her world
was really smaII, too.

767
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,367
Yumi!

768
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,837
Hey, Yumi!

769
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,606
Yumi?

770
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,175
Huh?

771
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,612
Yu... Yumi... ?

772
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,084
Yumi!!

773
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,084
Come on, Yamao!

774
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,654
Take it easy!

775
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,788
Yumi!!

776
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,563
Hey! Come on!

777
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,403
Yoo-hoo!

778
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,475
What? You saw Rikako too?

779
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,910
Yes. l wish Rikako had come.

780
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,717
It feIt Iike she was there.

781
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:28,585
Me too.

782
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,352
That reminds me...

783
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,121
... she said there's someone
in Tokyo she wants to see.

784
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,356
But she didn't say who.

785
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:40,458
It's someone who likes
to sIeep in bathtubs!

786
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,503
l'd forgotten
just how pretty it was.

787
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,044
The castle!

788
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,451
<i>l always thought</i>
<i>lighting up Kochi Castle...</i>

789
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,117
<i>... was a waste of electricity.</i>

790
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:09,630
<i>But with Rikako next to me,</i>
<i>it would have been beautiful.</i>

791
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:14,165
<i>There were so many things</i>
<i>l wanted to talk to her about.</i>

792
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,899
<i>l wanted us to see the castle</i>
<i>together, like this.</i>

793
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,669
<i>Taku! Could you</i>
<i>lend me some money?</i>

794
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,711
<i>You sound like</i>
<i>one of the teachers!</i>

795
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,179
<i>Are you a goody-goody?</i>

796
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,216
<i>I heard you were different.</i>

797
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,980
<i>l said not to tell!</i>
<i>You already told Yutaka!</i>

798
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:37,750
<i>My period just started.</i>
<i>Sometimes it's really bad.</i>

799
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,318
<i>When l see Papa,</i>
<i>l'm going to tell him.</i>

800
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,866
<i>l want to move to Tokyo</i>
<i>and live with him.</i>

801
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:49,666
<i>l'm staying here tonight.</i>
<i>Papa's paying, so l can if l want.</i>

802
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:55,404
<i>My room was completely changed!</i>
<i>The wallpaper's dark green!</i>

803
01:06:55,511 --> 01:07:00,414
<i>I was on Papa's side.</i>
<i>But he wasn't on my side.</i>

804
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,111
<i>We're bores -- him and me both.</i>

805
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,450
<i>Our trip wasn't</i>
<i>much fun, was it?</i>

806
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,217
<i>You're such a loyal friend!</i>
<i>Satisfied?</i>

807
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,691
<i>You idiot! You're the worst!</i>

808
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:16,225
There's someone in Tokyo
I want to see.

809
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:20,792
lt's a guy who
Iikes to sleep in bathtubs!

810
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:15,105
<i>And that's when l knew --</i>

811
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,484
<i>I'd always been crazy about her.</i>
