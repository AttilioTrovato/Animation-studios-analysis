1
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:26,360
In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:32,741
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,054
Yakul!

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,978
Ashitaka!

5
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,732
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

6
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,066
We just came from Ji-san.

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,734
Ji-san?

8
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,319
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

9
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,487
-The birds have gone.
-The animals too.

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:57,242
I'll go check with Ji-san.
You three hurry back home.

11
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,157
Something's there.

12
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,332
Ji-san, did you see it too?

13
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,834
I did. It isn't human.

14
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,754
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,298
There. Look.

16
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,912
It's some kind of demon!

17
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,663
A demon?

18
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,852
Run, Yakul!

19
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,172
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

20
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>Ashitaka!</i>

21
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,552
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

22
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,763
Yakul!

23
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,079
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!

24
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,959
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

25
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,478
-The monster!
-Come on!

26
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,397
Go back!

27
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,525
Leave our village alone!

28
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,527
Stop! Please!

29
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,032
Get up!

30
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,132
-He killed it!
-Ashitaka!

31
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,676
-Fetch the wise woman!
-Don't put the fire out yet.

32
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,470
Ashitaka!

33
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,560
Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.

34
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,646
Ashitaka is hurt!
Where is the wise woman?

35
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,441
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

36
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,026
What shall we do?

37
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,529
Take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.

38
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,363
All right.

39
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,921
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

40
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,883
I bow before you.

41
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,513
Where you have fallen we will raise
a mound and perform rites.

42
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,391
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

43
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,313
Disgusting little creatures,

44
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,234
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as I have suffered.

45
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,777
I'm afraid this is very bad.

46
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,781
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

47
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,952
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad, a poisonous hatred

48
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:20,083
that consumed his heart and flesh...
and turned him into a demon monster.

49
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,377
Prince Ashitaka?

50
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,503
Yes?

51
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,172
Show everyone your right arm.

52
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,640
Hii-sama!

53
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,938
My prince, are you prepared to learn
what fate the stones have foretold you?

54
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:42,856
Yes,

55
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,650
I was prepared the very moment
that I let my arrow fly.

56
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,240
The infection will spread,
cause you great pain and kill you.

57
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,164
Is there no way we can stop it?

58
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,584
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

59
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,919
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

60
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,214
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

61
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,719
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

62
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,304
Look at this.

63
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,309
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

64
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:25,398
It shattered his bones
and burned its way deep inside him.

65
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,360
This is what turned him into a demon.

66
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,240
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

67
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:39,079
It's your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

68
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,249
You may find a way to lift the curse.
You understand?

69
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,084
Yes.

70
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,171
We are the last of the Emishi.

71
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,342
It's 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe...

72
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,179
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

73
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,016
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

74
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,813
but our tribe's blood has grown thinner
and weaker with each generation.

75
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:10,401
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return?

76
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,738
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

77
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,967
Our laws forbid us
from watching you go, Ashitaka. Farewell.

78
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,081
Ashitaka!

79
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,375
Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

80
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,252
Do you think I care about that?

81
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,880
I came to give you this
so you won't forget your little sister.

82
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,636
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

83
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,681
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

84
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:26,352
Please, I want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.

85
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,689
Kaya, you know
I could never forget you.

86
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,488
A battle?

87
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,206
Move in!

88
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,003
Look! Up there, on the hill!

89
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,130
His head is mine!

90
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:28,975
Stop!

91
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,860
My arm! What's happening to me?

92
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,488
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

93
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,074
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

94
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,507
A demon.

95
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,689
The mark is getting bigger.

96
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,787
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

97
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,959
There he is now.

98
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,634
Will this be enough?

99
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,886
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.

100
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,263
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

101
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,308
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

102
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,773
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

103
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,529
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the
rice and take this nugget off your hands.

104
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,825
My good people, is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth?

105
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,077
No? All right.

106
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,497
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags of rice at least.

107
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,916
That's right, maybe even more.

108
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,251
Hey, wait a minute.

109
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
Give me my gold!

110
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,424
Hey! You can't just rush off now.

111
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,219
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

112
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,805
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.

113
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,059
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

114
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,772
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

115
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,238
I see you noticed we're being followed.
That's what we get for waving gold.

116
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,033
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

117
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,746
What to you say we give 'em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run?

118
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,260
So the demon monster
turned out to be a giant boar.

119
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:14,807
I followed its trail westward
through the mountains, but then--

120
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,476
You lost it. That's life.

121
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,269
See this place here?

122
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:24,775
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

123
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,280
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide. Everybody's dead.

124
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,577
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

125
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,081
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation. And nobody cares.

126
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,419
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

127
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,590
Ah, this is good!

128
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,179
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

129
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,015
<i>Samurai thugs.</i>
<i>You win some, you lose some.</i>

130
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,976
Hand me your bowl.

131
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,394
My point is, everybody dies.

132
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,105
Some now, some later.

133
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,858
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

134
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,404
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?

135
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,950
They're said to ride red elks.

136
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,620
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

137
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,547
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

138
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,800
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

139
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,344
Anyway, I've got
much bigger fish to fry.

140
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,515
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

141
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,020
Never have.

142
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:49,026
It was inside the giant boar.
I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.

143
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,081
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

144
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,083
It's where
the Forest Spirit dwells,

145
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,252
and it's very dangerous for humans.

146
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,920
To enter there is certain death.

147
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,547
The Forest Spirit?

148
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,799
I've been told the beasts there
are all giants,

149
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,677
just as they were in the dawn of time.

150
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,588
See ya there, my friend.

151
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,082
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

152
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,584
Coming this way!

153
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,919
Wolves!

154
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,013
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions!

155
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,057
Keep your powder dry.

156
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,559
Make sure you wait for them
to come within range!

157
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,944
Ready! And fire!

158
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,880
Second round! Fire!

159
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,848
That was it?
They weren't so big.

160
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,101
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.

161
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,276
It's Moro!

162
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,159
Come on.

163
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,257
We killed her!

164
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,719
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

165
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,437
She certainly did some damage.

166
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,938
We move out now.

167
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,774
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

168
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,692
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.

169
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,172
He's still breathing.

170
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,424
Hang on.

171
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,699
My name is Ashitaka! I have travelled
far from lands to the east.

172
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,452
Are you ancient gods, and have I come
to the realm of the Forest Spirit?

173
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,053
Go away.

174
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,993
A kodama! I never thought
I'd see one of them here.

175
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,873
Easy there. You don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?

176
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,174
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

177
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,343
But they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.

178
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,803
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?

179
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,891
No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer.

180
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,728
Where did it go?

181
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:07,321
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.

182
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,618
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest, little one?

183
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,256
Sir, I really think
we should turn around now.

184
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,051
No humans have ever made it
through these woods alive.

185
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,345
There's a lovely trail
back across the river.

186
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,139
The current's too swift
for us to get across,

187
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,851
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.

188
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,652
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost?

189
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,337
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

190
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,256
My God!
There's thousands of them.

191
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,113
Look at that. That must be their mother,
a fine old tree.

192
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,573
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.

193
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,658
This place must be
where the four of them live.

194
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:22,039
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn.
This is a place for gods and demons.

195
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,166
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.

196
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,262
More tracks?

197
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:47,606
Whatever made these
made them recently.

198
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,703
Sir! What's going on?

199
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,032
What just happened there?
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.

200
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,868
Here.

201
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,620
Did you see anything just then?

202
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,914
-Like what?
-Forget it.

203
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,918
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

204
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,836
Thank you.

205
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,011
It's gone,

206
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,850
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

207
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,853
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!

208
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,732
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.

209
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:03,700
Sir, you were right. We made it
back home just like you said!

210
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,192
It's a fortress.

211
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,444
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.

212
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,531
We make iron here
from the ore in the sand.

213
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey!

214
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,369
Hey!

215
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,415
-Someone's come out of the woods.
-Is it the Wolf Girl?

216
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,711
Look! It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!

217
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,715
-It's Kohroku! He's alive!
-Kohroku's alive!

218
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,134
It's true! Kohroku's still alive!

219
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,719
Let's go see!

220
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,473
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

221
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,310
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku's come back from the dead!

222
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,477
What?

223
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,325
This is unbelievable.

224
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,411
-Where are the others, Kohroku?
-Yes, is my son with you?

225
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

226
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,002
It's never the guards that die.

227
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,462
Stand aside.

228
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,507
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

229
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,134
He's obviously an outsider.

230
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:51,350
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

231
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,226
You should be grateful to him.

232
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,105
Hey, watch the arm.

233
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,151
Sir. Hold it right there.

234
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,749
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

235
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,335
but something doesn't smell right.

236
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,005
You got back almost as fast as we did

237
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,300
and through the forbidden forest
with two badly injured men

238
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,719
-and you want me to believe--
-Kohroku! You're alive!

239
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,429
Toki!

240
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:33,975
That's just great!

241
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,895
How are you gonna drive the ox
now, all banged up and mangled?

242
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,313
But...

243
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:42,192
You scared me half to death.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

244
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,528
Then maybe
I could have found a real husband!

245
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,406
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

246
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,409
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

247
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,995
And as for you, Gonza,
a fine captain of the guard you are,

248
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,791
always strutting and throwing
your weight around once the danger's over.

249
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,876
You never do a lick
of work around here.

250
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,920
That's unfair and untrue.

251
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,465
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

252
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,636
Oh, good. I was starting to think I'd done
something wrong by bringing him back home.

253
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,769
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

254
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,104
Gonza?

255
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,276
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

256
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,402
Kohroku.

257
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,948
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.

258
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,702
Milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

259
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,412
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

260
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,998
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.

261
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,417
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

262
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,420
That's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

263
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,381
the wolves would have eaten everyone.

264
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,717
-So true!
-No mistake!

265
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,137
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

266
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,227
Hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

267
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,091
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

268
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,718
Just dish it out!

269
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,013
There he is!

270
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,640
Where is he?

271
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,017
Toki was right.

272
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,102
-He is handsome.
-But he's so young!

273
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,897
That never stopped you before.

274
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,816
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

275
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,110
Yeah, there's lots
of gorgeous men in here, honey!

276
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,196
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

277
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,159
Listen, stranger, come over to our place?
You don't want to stay in this old barn.

278
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,872
Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring
you the rice, so watch your mouth.

279
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,167
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice? Tell me that.

280
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,670
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

281
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,632
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
I would like to see where you work.

282
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,716
You would?

283
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,969
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

284
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,762
Lend me your lipstick.

285
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,724
-Don't forget now.
-We'll be waiting for you.

286
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,020
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

287
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,691
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

288
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,026
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

289
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,738
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

290
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,741
Women like that--It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

291
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,703
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract

292
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,413
of every brothel girl she can find.

293
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,582
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

294
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,625
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

295
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:49,838
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

296
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,841
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

297
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,760
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

298
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,928
Who's Nago?

299
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,765
"Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

300
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,810
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

301
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,147
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months.

302
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,026
See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

303
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,404
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain,

304
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,281
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

305
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,285
Before we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

306
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,329
and that's what made the boar angry.

307
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,764
He's feeling no pain.

308
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,770
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

309
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,882
Young man, what's wrong?

310
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,304
Is something
hurting your arm?

311
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,432
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

312
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,144
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

313
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,153
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting, stranger.

314
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,863
That's good iron.

315
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,991
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

316
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,955
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.

317
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,206
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,210
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

319
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,381
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

320
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,466
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

321
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,850
I believe
you'll recognize this.

322
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,645
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

323
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,814
rotted his flesh
and turned him into a monster.

324
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,443
I fought with him, and for that
I was cursed with this mark on my arm,

325
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,361
and soon it will kill me.

326
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,323
Where is it you come from? I've never
seen a red elk like that before.

327
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,578
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

328
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,707
Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

329
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,668
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

330
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,547
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

331
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,383
"Eyes unclouded"?

332
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,556
That explains it.

333
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,058
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

334
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,351
Is that wise, milady?

335
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,395
Gonza, take over for me.

336
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,251
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

337
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,212
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

338
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,847
Good evening.

339
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,731
We've only just finished it, milady.

340
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,526
It's still too heavy.

341
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,195
Perhaps if you didn't hold it
so delicately?

342
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,240
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

343
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,161
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

344
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,539
That'll be something to see.

345
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,376
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

346
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,587
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

347
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,591
These will kill forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

348
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,970
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

349
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,099
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard.
I'll have wine sent down later.

350
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,767
That'll be nice.

351
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,440
First you transform the boar into a demon.
Now you're making even deadlier weapons!

352
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,735
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

353
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,863
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,

354
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,824
and I'm sorry that you suffer.
I truly am.

355
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,745
That brainless pig. I'm the one
he should have put a curse on, not you.

356
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,474
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

357
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,477
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

358
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,063
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

359
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,191
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

360
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,029
Milady, Osa has something to say.

361
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:53,242
Forgive me, milady. You must not
make light of the boy's strength.

362
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,122
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

363
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,793
and grief and helplessness.

364
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:06,756
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

365
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,845
She is the only one who saw us
as human beings. We are lepers.

366
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,349
The world hates and fears us,

367
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:21,062
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

368
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,066
Osa?

369
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,820
Life is suffering. It is hard.

370
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:33,616
The world is cursed, but still,
you find reasons to keep living.

371
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,369
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

372
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,598
They just keep coming back.

373
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,977
Every night they're out there
planting trees,

374
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,021
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

375
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,482
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

376
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,861
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

377
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,030
Without that ancient god,
the animals here

378
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,449
would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

379
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,453
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

380
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,329
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world,

381
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,914
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

382
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,125
Princess Mononoke?

383
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,046
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

384
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,465
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

385
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,766
The legends say the blood of the Great
Forest's Spirit can heal anything.

386
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:45,271
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.
Might even be able to lift your curse.

387
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,275
Milady!
How does the action feel to you?

388
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,862
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing
for ruling the world.

389
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,947
It's still too heavy for the girls.

390
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,657
All right.

391
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,686
Well, look who's here.

392
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,106
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

393
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,024
Well, I guess so.

394
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,445
Excuse me. May I try it?

395
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,949
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

396
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,463
When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

397
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,465
Well, that won't be long.

398
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,718
Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

399
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,930
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

400
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,307
It's hard work, isn't it?

401
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:06,060
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

402
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,646
You must lead hard lives here.

403
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:13,359
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city?

404
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,196
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

405
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,115
I see.

406
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,745
-No!
-But you can't leave tomorrow.

407
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,079
Can't you stay a little longer?

408
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,831
You can stay and work here.

409
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,043
Thanks, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

410
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,759
She's here.

411
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,141
The wolves are coming.

412
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,516
Stop!

413
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,476
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

414
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,274
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

415
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,110
Somebody cut her off!

416
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,287
Keep stoking those fires!

417
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,623
Riflemen to the stockade.
We've got her right where we want her.

418
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,918
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!

419
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,796
Toki, she's on the roof.

420
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,674
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

421
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,426
Whatever happens,
we can't let those fires go out.

422
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,264
-Is she alone?
-Yes. We have her cornered.

423
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,558
You know she means
to kill you this time.

424
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,019
We'll see about that.
Come on.

425
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,531
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

426
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,160
If you seek revenge
for all the animals we've killed,

427
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:14,165
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

428
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,333
They want revenge
for husbands killed by your wolves.

429
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,961
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

430
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,848
There she is!

431
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,146
Everybody out of the way!
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

432
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,446
It's a trap. No! Wait!

433
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,450
Princess of the wolf gods!
Don't go down there!

434
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,659
Go back to the forest!

435
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,124
Don't throw your life away!

436
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,168
Shall I stop him?

437
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,504
Leave him be.
Let him do what he likes.

438
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,568
She's down! We got her!

439
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,153
Stay back.

440
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,073
Cut off a wolf's head,
and it still has the power to bite.

441
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,993
-Take aim where she falls.
-Right.

442
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:52,972
Open fire.

443
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,607
Stay back!

444
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,242
Wake up.

445
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,374
No!

446
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,771
-Skin her!
-Kill her, milady! Kill her!

447
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,064
Kill her!

448
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,987
Are you all right, sir?
Can I help you?

449
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,790
Get away from me!
Begone!

450
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,633
Traitor! You're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?

451
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,595
Stay back!

452
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,100
Step aside.

453
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,036
What do you think you're doing, boy?

454
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,955
The girl's life is now mine.

455
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,917
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

456
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,504
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

457
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,511
Look, everyone!

458
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,098
This is what hatred looks like. This is
what it does when it catches hold of you.

459
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,976
It's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!

460
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,979
Fear and anger
only make it grow faster.

461
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,065
I'm getting a little bored
of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

462
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,858
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

463
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,573
Lady Eboshi!

464
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,078
Someone come here
and take her from me.

465
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,124
Milady!

466
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,920
Don't worry. She's just stunned.
She'll be all right.

467
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,011
As for me, I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!

468
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,015
No, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!

469
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,394
Move and I fire!

470
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,199
Kiyo, what are you doing?

471
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,956
How can he still be walking?

472
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,007
-Is she all right?
-Yes, milady's safe, sir.

473
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,178
Someone bring me my gun!
Riflemen to the square now, on the double!

474
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,888
They're not getting
out of here alive!

475
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,058
Toki, come here.

476
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,023
What? What's happened?

477
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,748
Sir, I can't let you pass.

478
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,793
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.

479
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,798
Turn back, please.

480
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,134
We're grateful. You brought those men
back to us. We don't want to hurt you.

481
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,010
Please!

482
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,763
I walked in
through this gate this morning.

483
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,723
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

484
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,019
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

485
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,071
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

486
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,665
It's opening.

487
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,507
Out of the way!

488
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,720
The wolves are attacking!

489
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:44,888
Flint!

490
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,891
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!

491
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,187
Stay and I will bring her!

492
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,689
Come on, Yakul.

493
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,112
You have my thanks.

494
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,370
Good luck, stranger.

495
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,603
Stop it!

496
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,064
Leave him! He's mine!

497
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:51,205
His own people shot him.
He's dying.

498
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,212
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.

499
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,716
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

500
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,970
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

501
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,474
I knew that
from the first moment I saw you.

502
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,019
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

503
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,235
That woman is evil. There's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

504
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,695
No. Live.

505
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,406
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore!

506
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,827
You're beautiful.

507
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,918
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

508
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,265
The ape tribe.

509
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,020
Apes, how dare you show
such disrespect to the wolf clan.

510
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,190
This is our forest.

511
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,401
The human, give him to us.

512
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,904
Give us the human and go.

513
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,323
You go before my fangs find you.

514
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,409
We will not go.

515
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,786
We will eat the human.

516
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,329
We will eat the human.

517
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,498
Yes, let us eat the man creature.

518
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:20,794
Are you crazy? Just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

519
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,297
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

520
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,260
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

521
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,805
and we will drive the other humans away.
Give us the man creature.

522
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,435
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

523
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,062
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

524
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,564
something even worse than human.

525
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:45,027
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

526
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,196
The forest does not come back.

527
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,115
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

528
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:54,786
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

529
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,080
Keep planting trees
and someday we'll beat them.

530
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:01,627
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

531
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,088
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.

532
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:10,260
Enough! I'll bite
your head off, you chattering ape.

533
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,723
Stop!

534
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,108
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.

535
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:29,321
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

536
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,907
What about the elk?
Can we eat him?

537
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,205
No, you may not. Go home!

538
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,048
Come over here.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.

539
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,760
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

540
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:51,296
You're very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island, huh?

541
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,341
I smell like a human.

542
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,104
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

543
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,198
There he is.
Come and see. Hurry.

544
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,868
It's the Nightwalker.

545
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,870
Quick, you idiots.

546
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,832
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

547
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,543
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.

548
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,047
And you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the West.

549
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,925
Look. We've got a letter
of pardon from the emperor,

550
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,802
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the Great Forest Spirit.

551
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,436
The legends tell us
that when day becomes night,

552
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,272
the Forest Spirit
turns into the Nightwalker,

553
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,608
and at sunrise,
it changes back.

554
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,818
Look! See there?
It's happening.

555
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,652
Take a look, Master Jigo.

556
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,529
What is it?

557
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,823
Over there.

558
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,339
Look. There must be hundreds of them.

559
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,841
Those boars are not from this region.

560
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,302
They must've been traveling
for months to get here.

561
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,020
That one's Okkoto!

562
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,814
Can't be. They say he died 100 years ago.

563
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,941
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.

564
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,195
And it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe.

565
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,325
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!

566
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,924
Come on, you cowards!
Move! Quickly!

567
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,062
The bullet wound's gone.

568
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,615
Yakul.

569
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:20,393
You're awake. You should thank Yakul.
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

570
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,147
How'd you know his name's Yakul?

571
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,192
He told me, and he told me about you--

572
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,278
about your village,
your people and your forest.

573
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,741
The Forest Spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

574
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:40,038
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.

575
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,331
Eat this.

576
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:47,837
Chew.

577
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,264
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

578
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,308
Why are there humans here, Moro?

579
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,852
Humans are everywhere
these days.

580
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:31,566
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them
there. The girl is San, my daughter.

581
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,778
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

582
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,281
What is that other human
doing here?

583
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,701
He was shot, and then
the Great Spirit healed his wound.

584
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,952
This man is not our enemy!

585
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:48,541
The Forest Spirit saved him?
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

586
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,462
Why didn't he save Nago?

587
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,965
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?

588
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,303
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

589
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:04,098
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

590
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,770
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

591
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,897
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

592
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,693
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too,

593
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,989
carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

594
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:24,535
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.
I remain and contemplate my death.

595
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:26,496
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

596
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,832
I have lived long enough, San.

597
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,252
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

598
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,464
All these years you defended
the Forest Spirit! He must save you!

599
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,591
You are not fooling us.

600
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,095
Nago was beautiful and strong.
He would not have run from anything.

601
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,306
You wolves must have eaten him!

602
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,685
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

603
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,813
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

604
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,608
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

605
01:09:56,275 --> 01:10:00,238
He had become some kind of demon.
One day he attacked our village.

606
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,325
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

607
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:14,335
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

608
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,840
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

609
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,846
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

610
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,229
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

611
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,068
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

612
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,279
Please, you mustn't eat him.

613
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,702
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?
I have heard of you.

614
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,705
You're blind.

615
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,208
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

616
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,710
It's all right, San.

617
01:10:56,544 --> 01:11:00,423
My Lord Okkoto, what I said
about Nago's death was the truth.

618
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,190
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

619
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:23,654
I am only grieved and ashamed
that a demon has come from our tribe.

620
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:29,035
O mighty Lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

621
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:35,792
Leave this forest... for the next time
we meet I will have to kill you.

622
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,755
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

623
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:46,385
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

624
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,763
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

625
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,517
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

626
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:57,480
You'd risk everything on one last battle?
That's just what the humans want.

627
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,484
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

628
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:08,407
Even if every one of us dies, it will be
a battle the humans will never forget.

629
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,351
The Forest Spirit.

630
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,911
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

631
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,166
Get ready now.
Little bit closer.

632
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,544
Fire!

633
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,968
Reload! Fire!

634
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,143
Ready--

635
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,695
Well, I see somebody is going to have
to go play the peacemaker.

636
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,489
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

637
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:54,096
-There they are!
-Where?

638
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,561
The hunters are ready, sir.

639
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,605
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

640
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,484
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

641
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,573
Greetings, Jigo.

642
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,825
I've got the emperor
breathing down my neck,

643
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,328
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

644
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:21,499
And you'd have nothing to do with him
being here, now, would you?

645
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,710
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

646
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,129
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

647
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,006
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

648
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,635
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

649
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,638
Listen, the boars are gathering
for battle. You know what that means.

650
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,724
You made a promise.
Get me the head of the Forest Spirit,

651
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:42,603
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together.

652
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,273
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

653
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,573
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

654
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,784
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.

655
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,035
Yes, ma'am.

656
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,081
Welcome back, milady!

657
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,003
Whoa! Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?

658
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:15,636
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring
a message to you from my Lord Asano.

659
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,682
You have fought valiantly and well.

660
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,600
Now, open your gates
that we may speak with you.

661
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,603
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

662
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,565
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

663
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,900
And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

664
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,444
Well, you won't get it!

665
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,196
You ladies need to be taught some respect!

666
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,781
Respect? What's that?

667
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:39,660
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

668
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,372
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!

669
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,008
They are really something.

670
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,094
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

671
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:01,223
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

672
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,977
Impressive for a piece of paper.

673
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,856
Well, you know, it's gotten me
all the best hunters and trappers around.

674
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,942
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

675
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,154
Yes, milady, what is it?

676
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,865
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?

677
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,034
From the emperor himself.

678
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,453
-The emperor?
-Who's he?

679
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,997
-The <i>Mikado</i>.
-The <i>Mikado</i>?

680
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,292
Okay, you got me there.

681
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,169
-Thank you.
-Yes, milady.

682
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,548
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron,

683
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,258
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

684
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,427
My way,
there is no loss of life, Jigo.

685
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,722
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

686
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:45,768
When you needed riflemen, I sent them,
and without them, you lose Irontown.

687
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,854
I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

688
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,398
Don't tell me
the emperor believes...

689
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,943
that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's
head granting immortality.

690
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:58,197
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor
believes. I'm just a humble monk.

691
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,740
I'm just trying to get by.

692
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,535
I keep my promises.

693
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,997
We have fought the boars before. They're
easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.

694
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,752
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

695
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,549
So I've been found out.

696
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,009
Just one more thing, milady.

697
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,512
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

698
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:25,015
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

699
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:26,934
Came and went.

700
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,414
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

701
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,499
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

702
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,376
-They're killers.
-Killers?

703
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,129
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

704
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,881
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

705
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,301
What if it goes wrong
and we're stuck here? We can't help you.

706
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,136
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

707
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,015
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

708
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,393
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

709
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,856
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

710
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,525
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

711
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,277
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

712
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,988
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.

713
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:22,865
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

714
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,369
Remember, you can't trust men.

715
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:32,082
Don't worry about her ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

716
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,501
-That's what we're afraid of.
-What?

717
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:37,046
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

718
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,409
Do you suffer?

719
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:54,248
You know, you could always jump, boy.
End it all.

720
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:57,626
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

721
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,255
It feels like I must've been asleep
for weeks.

722
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,591
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

723
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,262
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

724
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,598
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

725
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,684
It's a beautiful forest.

726
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,644
Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

727
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,397
Yes, the boars are marching.

728
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:23,152
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

729
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:29,074
I listen to the forest's pain and feel
the ache of the bullet in my chest,

730
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,577
and I dream of the day

731
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,205
when I will finally crunch
that gun woman's head in my jaws.

732
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,335
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

733
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,253
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

734
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:43,922
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

735
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,592
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

736
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:50,095
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?

737
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:54,141
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

738
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,227
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

739
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:00,647
When the forest dies, so does she.

740
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,359
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

741
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,444
Silence, boy.

742
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:08,530
How dare you speak
to a god like that?

743
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,743
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

744
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,371
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

745
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,791
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

746
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,419
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

747
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,047
How could you help her?

748
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,760
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

749
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:36,934
How? Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

750
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,437
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

751
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:45,442
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

752
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:48,695
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

753
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:51,156
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

754
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,422
You're feeling all right?

755
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,927
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the Forest Spirit.

756
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,699
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

757
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,831
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak?

758
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:57,157
It's so quiet. I wonder
where the little kodama went.

759
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,583
I can smell the ironworks.

760
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,344
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!

761
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,431
Will you please give this
to San for me?

762
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,358
Let's go.

763
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,975
It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

764
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:09,813
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

765
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:10,939
It's that damn woman again.

766
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,200
She knows we're out here.

767
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:25,579
-It's a trap and a stupid one.
-What?

768
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:30,167
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

769
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,044
The humans are planning something.

770
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,172
Then we have to find Okkoto
while there's still time to stop him

771
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,131
or they'll be killed!

772
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,343
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

773
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:43,930
They may even know it's a trap.

774
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,642
The boars are a proud race.

775
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:51,355
The last one left alive
will still be charging blindly forward.

776
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:57,819
Why chop the trees down?

777
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,780
To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

778
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:04,910
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

779
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,663
I must be his eyes.

780
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,289
You understand?

781
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,958
Do as you must.

782
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,254
You know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.

783
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,507
I hate him!
I hate all humans!

784
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:32,938
From Ashitaka for me?

785
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,693
Pretty.

786
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,237
You two, stay with San.

787
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,031
I must go to the Forest Spirit.

788
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,157
Let's go.

789
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,099
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

790
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,520
Thank you.

791
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,524
It's coming from Irontown.

792
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,447
Let's go!

793
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,369
Who goes there?

794
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:53,662
Samurai again.

795
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:56,748
Halt, I said!

796
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,334
Out of the way!

797
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,394
What the devil
was that thing?

798
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:23,900
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.

799
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,278
-He's a dead man anyway.
-Cease fire!

800
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,720
Toki, come and look.

801
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,388
It can't be. It's Ashitaka.

802
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:54,472
So it's not a ghost.

803
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,808
Ashitaka!

804
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:57,934
Toki!

805
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,686
Are you all right?

806
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,146
We're all right.

807
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:05,775
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try
and ambush us while our men were away.

808
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:09,362
-Thought we'd just roll over.
-But we showed them!

809
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,405
Where's Lady Eboshi?

810
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:15,118
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

811
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,203
We're cut off here. Can't
get a message to Lady Eboshi.

812
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:20,707
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.

813
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,418
Hey, sir, I've still
got your bow and arrows!

814
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,046
Aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?

815
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,714
-I do?
-You're useless.

816
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:29,966
Many thanks, Kohroku!

817
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,719
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

818
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:36,264
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

819
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,849
Bring back Lady Eboshi!

820
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,018
And don't take too long!

821
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,358
I missed.

822
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,401
They're bringing boats
across the river!

823
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:52,447
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

824
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,076
I'll be back! I promise!

825
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,122
Be careful!

826
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:05,752
Get him!
Stop that man!

827
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,681
Looks like they'll try
to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

828
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,642
Burning animal flesh.

829
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,024
Yakul!

830
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,023
Stay back!

831
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,788
Show me your wound.

832
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,292
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

833
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:13,755
I said, stay!

834
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,267
We're almost there,
my friend.

835
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,980
Who goes there?

836
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,067
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

837
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,778
All right, but I've just come
from Irontown.

838
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,614
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where she is.

839
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,075
The Eboshi woman's not here.

840
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,869
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.

841
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,705
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

842
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,542
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

843
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:34,961
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

844
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:36,921
We've been burying
our friends all day.

845
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:38,172
It was horrible.

846
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,842
-Irontown has come under attack.
-What?

847
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:44,512
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

848
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:45,805
We haven't got a lot of time.

849
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,223
Those samurai bastards.

850
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:49,726
Asano must've just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

851
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,936
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

852
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,772
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

853
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,733
Then someone's got
to stop her. Call her back.

854
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,736
If you're all done,
I want you out of here.

855
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:00,820
The rest of you, keep digging!

856
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:02,614
Wait! What about Irontown?

857
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,449
That's right! It's our home!

858
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:07,118
What do they expect us to do,
abandon Irontown?

859
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:09,829
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

860
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,581
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

861
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:14,834
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

862
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,837
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

863
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:21,132
Lady Eboshi
is just being used by Jigo.

864
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:25,053
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

865
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,430
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

866
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:31,017
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

867
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,102
She was there.
I saw her.

868
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:36,356
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

869
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,775
-What happened?
-I'm not sure!

870
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,736
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

871
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,114
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

872
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,325
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

873
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,619
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

874
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,674
Where's San?

875
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:51,472
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.

876
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:58,312
There's a wolf over here!

877
01:36:58,646 --> 01:36:59,981
Hey! Hurry!

878
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,403
Young master!

879
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,697
What do you think you're doing?

880
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,410
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

881
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,455
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

882
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:17,331
Stand aside!

883
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:21,669
What's more important? The head
of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?

884
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:23,546
Those darts are poison.

885
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:31,012
That's enough now!

886
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,645
I'm not gonna slave any longer!

887
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,982
Heave.

888
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,365
Look out!

889
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:06,089
After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

890
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,175
Be careful.
Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.

891
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,887
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

892
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,142
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

893
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,981
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

894
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:39,330
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

895
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,292
Sir.

896
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,336
Yes? Have you spotted them?

897
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,672
Okkoto's badly wounded.

898
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,383
He and the Wolf Girl are making their way
to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

899
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,428
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they? Keep after them,

900
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,640
but stay out of sight or you'll scare
the Forest Spirit away.

901
01:38:57,723 --> 01:38:59,851
Yes, sir. I understand.

902
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,729
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

903
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,858
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

904
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:18,411
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

905
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:37,346
What was that?

906
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:43,311
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

907
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,855
Something's out there.

908
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,983
What? With so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

909
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:54,906
I should have known it was you!

910
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,033
You did this!

911
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,202
Because of you, the forest will die!

912
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:00,953
You're wrong!

913
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,664
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?

914
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,917
You bring bad things!

915
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,669
Bad things coming,
neither human nor animal.

916
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:11,797
What do you mean,
"neither human nor animal"?

917
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,306
-They're coming!
-It's the end for us!

918
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:40,826
They're warriors.

919
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,831
They've come back.

920
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:53,089
My warriors! They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

921
01:40:57,009 --> 01:41:02,223
Forward, my warriors!
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!

922
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:12,441
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

923
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:20,366
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

924
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:21,826
It's a trick!

925
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:28,291
It's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

926
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,672
Come out, Forest Spirit!

927
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,757
If you are truly master here,

928
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:40,636
give my warriors the power
to slay the humans and be victorious!

929
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,640
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

930
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:48,644
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

931
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,647
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

932
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:56,152
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

933
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:59,155
She'll know what to do.

934
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:03,200
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

935
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:05,870
Go on now.

936
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,891
Stay back or you die!

937
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:30,269
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

938
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,698
Ashitaka?

939
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:50,081
Get back!

940
01:42:57,213 --> 01:43:01,550
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

941
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,387
You must fight it!

942
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:07,807
Don't let yourself become a demon!

943
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,268
Lord Okkoto!

944
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:15,022
What is it?

945
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,860
Is it San?

946
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:21,654
-She's in danger.
-Let's go.

947
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:51,600
I'm on fire.

948
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:01,652
No!

949
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:04,905
I don't want to become a demon!
Please stop, Okkoto!

950
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:17,918
You're too slow! Get on!

951
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,934
A wolf!

952
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:37,521
Eboshi!

953
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:46,113
You keep going!

954
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,575
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

955
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:51,035
Hold your fire!

956
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,119
What is it you want?

957
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:55,623
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

958
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:57,625
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

959
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,418
Forget about the Forest Spirit!

960
01:45:00,336 --> 01:45:04,173
Your men are already heading back,
but they need you to lead them!

961
01:45:04,757 --> 01:45:06,759
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

962
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:10,679
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

963
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:14,808
So we don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

964
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:19,480
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

965
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:23,651
Just whose side is he on anyway?

966
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:24,902
Shouldn't we go back?

967
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:30,908
The women are on their own now.
They can take care of themselves.

968
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,996
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

969
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,542
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

970
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,211
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

971
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,839
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

972
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:14,451
Moro, what happened to you?

973
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,329
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

974
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:19,540
San!

975
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,257
Ashitaka!

976
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:36,890
Okkoto?

977
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:46,191
Leave, boy.

978
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:50,029
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

979
01:46:54,617 --> 01:46:57,536
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

980
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:05,461
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

981
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:09,340
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

982
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:16,597
San!

983
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:25,564
Kill him!

984
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:32,154
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

985
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:57,596
San!

986
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,558
San!

987
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:05,896
Ashitaka!

988
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:11,235
San!

989
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,444
Ashitaka!

990
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:23,997
And here I was saving
the last of my strength

991
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,583
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

992
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:28,711
Close ranks!

993
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,772
Don't touch him.

994
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:50,691
He's no longer a god.

995
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,910
You can't even speak,
can you?

996
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:07,624
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

997
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,545
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

998
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,013
It's him.

999
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,778
Give me back my daughter, demon.

1000
01:49:58,383 --> 01:49:59,676
Ashitaka,

1001
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,137
can you save the girl you love?

1002
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,398
The Forest Spirit.

1003
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:25,577
Eboshi! Hold your fire!

1004
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:43,178
Eboshi!
Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.

1005
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,514
But that should have killed it.

1006
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:47,015
He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.

1007
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:57,901
San!

1008
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,371
Don't die.

1009
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:39,401
I don't get it. The Great Forest Spirit
took their lives away.

1010
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:01,673
Quick! He's starting to change.

1011
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:03,342
Now watch closely, everyone.

1012
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,053
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

1013
01:52:06,219 --> 01:52:08,764
a god of life and death.

1014
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:11,475
The trick is not to fear him.

1015
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,576
No! Stop!

1016
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:33,580
Eboshi!

1017
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:48,470
You will die!

1018
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,816
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

1019
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,816
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

1020
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,403
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

1021
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:51,575
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!

1022
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:57,831
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

1023
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:08,050
Milady!

1024
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:10,552
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.

1025
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:14,723
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

1026
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:15,849
It's coming, sir!

1027
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:20,854
Run!

1028
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:38,747
Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

1029
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:40,207
Island? I can't swim!

1030
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,000
Then walk along the bottom.

1031
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:12,364
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

1032
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:15,617
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

1033
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:17,160
Lady Eboshi.

1034
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:18,537
Help me.

1035
01:55:22,499 --> 01:55:24,459
Don't waste your sympathy.

1036
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:27,421
I promised Toki
that I'd bring you back to Irontown.

1037
01:55:33,802 --> 01:55:36,596
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

1038
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,722
San,

1039
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:39,349
you have got to help us.

1040
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:42,060
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

1041
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:44,104
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

1042
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:49,276
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

1043
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:53,780
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

1044
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:56,825
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

1045
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,703
-San?
-Stay back!

1046
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:08,837
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

1047
01:56:16,094 --> 01:56:20,015
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

1048
01:56:29,357 --> 01:56:33,778
Nothing is over. The two of us are
still alive. Now, will you help me, San?

1049
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:01,598
Hey, wait! Come back! Help us!

1050
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:04,559
A little crisis and they panic.

1051
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:09,689
Whoa! What are you doing?

1052
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:16,905
Look! The head is moving!

1053
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:21,952
It's calling him to us!

1054
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:07,455
-It shouldn't jam anymore.
-Thanks.

1055
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:11,251
-It's awfully quiet.
-Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1056
01:58:12,419 --> 01:58:15,547
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1057
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:18,008
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1058
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,719
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1059
01:58:23,096 --> 01:58:25,599
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1060
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:30,061
-Hey, Kohroku!
-Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1061
01:58:40,322 --> 01:58:43,366
-What's that?
-I don't know, but I don't like it.

1062
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,504
It's the Nightwalker!

1063
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:13,104
Everybody, hold your positions!

1064
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:16,232
-Toki, it's coming right at us.
-Run! We've gotta go!

1065
01:59:17,025 --> 01:59:20,445
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1066
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:28,828
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1067
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,210
Get everyone out!

1068
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:38,838
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1069
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:41,591
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1070
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:44,844
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1071
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,015
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1072
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,478
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1073
01:59:54,104 --> 01:59:56,356
-What are we gonna do now?
-It'll kill us all!

1074
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:58,566
-We'll never get out now!
-That's enough!

1075
01:59:59,067 --> 02:00:00,944
Get everyone
down to the lake and stay calm.

1076
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:03,154
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1077
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,666
Not that way! Stop!

1078
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:33,017
Oh! There it goes!

1079
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:39,941
We're done for!

1080
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,360
Once the forge burns,
it'll be the end of Irontown.

1081
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:46,656
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1082
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:06,468
There they are!

1083
02:01:18,688 --> 02:01:19,647
Go!

1084
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:21,983
Stop right there!

1085
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:25,779
Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1086
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:29,282
I'm giving the creature its head back.
Put the box down and back away.

1087
02:01:30,033 --> 02:01:32,410
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1088
02:01:32,786 --> 02:01:34,704
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1089
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:38,374
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1090
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:39,793
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1091
02:01:40,335 --> 02:01:42,170
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1092
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:45,215
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1093
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,175
But I might actually get it.

1094
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:49,010
Don't force me to kill you.

1095
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:54,432
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to... relax!

1096
02:02:01,064 --> 02:02:02,232
Get going!

1097
02:02:21,751 --> 02:02:22,627
Ashitaka!

1098
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:24,379
I got it!

1099
02:02:30,885 --> 02:02:31,845
This is bad.

1100
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:36,724
Master, we're surrounded!

1101
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:40,019
-Come on, sun! Rise!
-Open the box!

1102
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:42,146
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1103
02:02:42,814 --> 02:02:45,149
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1104
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:47,110
Human hands must return it!

1105
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:51,114
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1106
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:07,338
Forest Spirit!

1107
02:03:08,006 --> 02:03:09,340
We give you back your head!

1108
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:12,010
Take it and be at peace!

1109
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,856
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1110
02:03:56,179 --> 02:03:57,305
Well, I think it's over.

1111
02:03:57,388 --> 02:03:58,598
It's the men.

1112
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:15,073
-Milady! You're here!
-Her ladyship has been injured.

1113
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,645
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1114
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:53,611
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1115
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:04,265
I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1116
02:06:35,713 --> 02:06:37,507
San. San, look.

1117
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:11,040
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1118
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:13,668
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1119
02:07:14,502 --> 02:07:17,630
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1120
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:20,716
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1121
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:22,677
that it's time
for us both to live.

1122
02:07:31,394 --> 02:07:33,062
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1123
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:35,314
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1124
02:07:35,565 --> 02:07:39,152
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1125
02:07:40,153 --> 02:07:41,154
I'll always be near.

1126
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:44,782
Yakul and I will come and visit you...
whenever we can, all right?

1127
02:07:56,335 --> 02:08:00,590
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

1128
02:08:01,632 --> 02:08:04,927
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1129
02:08:05,636 --> 02:08:09,640
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1130
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:13,895
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!

1131
02:13:17,698 --> 02:13:24,622
THE END
