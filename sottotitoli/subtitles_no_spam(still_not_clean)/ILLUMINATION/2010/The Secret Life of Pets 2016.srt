1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,360
Illumination! Illumination!

2
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,324
I've lived in this city all my life.

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,161
I'm Max.

4
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,886
And I'm the luckiest dog in New York

5
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,760
because of her.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,285
That's Katie.

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,441
Katie and I...

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,284
Well, we have the perfect relationship.

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,611
We met a few years ago.

10
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,921
And, boy, let me tell ya,

11
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,441
we got along right away.

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
It was one of those relationships

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,729
where you just know.

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,806
And get this!

15
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,964
She was looking for a roommate.
And so was I!

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,090
So I just moved in that same day.

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,890
It was perfect.

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,443
We've been together ever since.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,727
Katie would do anything for me.

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,769
And I'm her loyal protector.

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,681
Our love is...

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,924
How do I put this?

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,844
Our love is stronger than words.

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,729
Or shoes.

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,120
It's me and Katie.

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,765
Katie and me.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,560
Us against the world.

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,930
I wouldn't go so far as
to call us soul mates,

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,441
even though any sane person
who saw us would.

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,767
There's just one little problem.

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,121
Pretty much every day...

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,281
Come on, Max.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,447
She leaves.

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,801
I'll see you tonight.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,844
Sometimes I try stuff to get her to stay.

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,291
Okay.

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,601
Sit.

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,851
Spin.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,847
Speak.

40
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,887
Okay. That's a good boy.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,684
But it never works.

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,365
Where is she going?

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,800
What could she possibly be doing?

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh, I miss her so much.

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,370
Oh my! She's back!

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,521
Forgot my phone.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,802
What took so long? Why did you...

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,167
Oh, come on!

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,571
I miss her so much.

50
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,206
Bye, Gidget. Be a good doggy.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,886
Hey, Max.

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,087
Hey, Gidget.

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,645
Any plans today?

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Yes.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
Big, big stuff today,
Gidget. I got big plans.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,009
I'm gonna sit here, and I'm gonna
wait for Katie to come back.

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,525
Oh, that sounds exciting.

58
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,244
Well, I won't interrupt.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,165
I've got a very busy day too.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,440
Here you go. See you later, Chloe.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,050
Bye, Peppy.

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,000
So long, Mel.

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,888
Bye, Sweetpea.

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,122
See you, Gino.

65
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,730
- Bye, Mr. Wiggles.
- So long, pal.

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,361
- I'll miss you, Shelly!
- Later, Runty.

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,481
Bye, everyone.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,806
Bye.

69
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,842
You be a good boy, Leonard.

70
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,441
Hey, Max.

71
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,809
Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder
where they go during the day?

72
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,365
Do you know what? I just...

73
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,010
I don't really care.

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,889
Maybe that's what it's like for you,

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,769
but Katie and I have
a different relationship.

76
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,167
You're a cat. So maybe that's why.

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,607
Because nobody could ever love
a cat the way they love a dog.

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,802
I'm just saying. Maybe that's why.

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,122
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,560
Hey! Morning, Max!

81
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,641
Hey, guys.

82
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,089
What's up, Sweetpea?

83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,802
Hey, Mel, where you been, man?

84
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
Get this!

85
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,370
Last Sunday, my owner feeds me
a small white pill, right?

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,204
I start to feel a little groggy.

87
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,045
The next thing I know,
I wake up, I'm in the sky!

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,725
Wait a minute. The sky?

89
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,406
Yeah. There are suitcases everywhere.
I'm locked up in a crate.

90
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,801
- Come on.
- There are suitcases in the sky?

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,321
So, I pass out from fear,
and when I wake up

92
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,323
I'm in Florida.

93
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,686
This did not happen.

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,928
I will never eat a pill like that again.

95
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,565
Unless it's covered in peanut butter.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,000
Because, I mean, come on! Right?
It's peanut butter!

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,201
Hey, guys.

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,646
Oh, hey, Norman.

99
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,444
You still looking for your apartment?

100
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,841
Yeah. Going on three weeks now.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,764
Is this the second or the third floor?

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,724
I don't know any numbers,
but you don't live here.

103
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,251
Pellets!

104
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,280
Well, see you guys later.

105
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,003
You know what? You can do it!

106
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,690
He can't do it.

107
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,570
Buddy! There you are.

108
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,727
Did you find it?

109
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,408
You know I did.

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
Ball!

111
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,726
Ball, ball, ball!

112
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,970
Katie's gonna be so excited!

113
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,929
This is exactly like the one she lost!

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,286
I mean, look at it!

115
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,408
It's round. It fits in my mouth.

116
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,406
Ball!

117
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,000
There is no other ball in the city

118
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,208
like this one ball, guaranteed.

119
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,925
This is the ball.

120
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,800
- Hey.
- Katie!

121
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,723
I'm home, Max.

122
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
Hey, Maximilian.

123
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,170
How was your day, buddy?

124
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,970
That's a good boy.

125
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,283
Oh, yes. I'm so psyched
to see you too, buddy.

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,329
Okay, boy. Calm down, it's okay.

127
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,766
Let's all be calm.

128
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,446
Now, I have some big news.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,082
I know this'll take
some getting used to,

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
but I think it's gonna be
a great thing in the long...

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,320
Max, this is Duke.

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,328
He's going to be your

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,527
brother.

134
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,524
No, Max.

135
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,364
It's gonna be all right, Duke.

136
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,045
It's okay.

137
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,170
See? He likes you.

138
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,885
Yeah, that's it, Duke.
Take a look around.

139
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,489
I know, buddy.
This is a lot to take in.

140
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,564
But he didn't have a home.

141
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,800
So you and I are gonna have
to take care of him.

142
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,041
Okay?

143
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,925
Oh, my gosh!

144
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,042
Duke found our lost ball!

145
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,520
What a great team we're gonna be.

146
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,730
Love you, Maxie.

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
Love you, Duke.

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,570
Sleep tight, boys.

149
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,967
Hey. Little guy.

150
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,731
This place is so great!

151
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,241
By the way...

152
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,323
That is one gorgeous bed.

153
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,084
Yeah, it's okay.

154
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,321
Maybe we could share?

155
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,842
You know, one night you get the bed.
The next night, I do.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,126
That kind of thing.

157
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,725
You know, this bed is mine.

158
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,604
You? You get an old blanket.

159
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,847
That suits you.

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
You're an old-blanket kind of a dog.

161
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,808
You are stubborn.

162
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,566
Hey, I get it. I'm stubborn too.

163
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,603
- But we gotta learn to get along.
- Wait. What are you...

164
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,808
I bet we can both fit in this bed
if we really try.

165
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,007
Let me scoot on in there.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,650
No, wait.

167
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,326
Perfect. This is comfy, right?

168
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,164
No, it is not.

169
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,443
I'm comfy.

170
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,047
Duke is just ruining our lives!

171
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
It's an emergency that
you get rid of this dog.

172
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,521
He stole my...

173
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,170
And he's scary, and he's frightening,

174
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,129
and he's the death of all good things.

175
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,362
You little cutie pie.

176
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,323
We'll play tomorrow, buddy, okay?

177
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,641
Okay, sleep well.

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,608
Are you trying to get rid of me?

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,688
Before I answer that...

180
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,127
I'd like to know how much you heard.

181
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,129
So, that's how it's gonna be, huh?

182
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,487
Oh, man, are you making me angry!

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,440
And when I get angry, I do this.

184
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,606
And I don't want to do that.

185
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,324
I need this place.

186
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,881
And if it's gonna
come down to you or me...

187
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,844
It's gonna be me.

188
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,846
Morning, Max!

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,241
Max! Max!
What are you doing? Hi!

190
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,687
It's me! Hi! Hi!

191
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,727
Chloe!

192
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,969
Chloe, Chloe! I got a bad situation.

193
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,961
Katie brought home
a new dog from the pound.

194
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,805
She said he's my brother.
I don't want a brother.

195
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,644
I don't even have a bed now.

196
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,802
I'm sleeping on the floor, like a dog.

197
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,769
Why would Katie do this to me?

198
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,082
Because she's a dog person, Max.

199
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,689
And dog people do weird,
inexplicable things.

200
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,524
Like they get dogs instead of cats.

201
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,768
Okay, please don't start now, Chloe.

202
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
That is not helping.

203
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,606
Max? Come on, I'm your friend.

204
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,728
Okay? And as your friend,
I gotta be honest with you.

205
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,843
I don't care about you or your problems.

206
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,450
But if you don't do something

207
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,126
about this guy, and soon,

208
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,124
your perfect little life
with your dumb, bleh, human

209
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,442
is gonna be over, forever.

210
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,971
Forever?

211
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,043
Forever. Yeah, that's what I just...

212
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,522
Why is this mouse on my paw still?

213
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,042
Look, if you really
want to get your turf back

214
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,208
you're gonna have to start
acting like the alpha dog.

215
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,970
Right. Alpha dog.

216
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,208
I can do that.

217
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,890
- Okay, okay.
- Please don't go!

218
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,366
This time, really don't go.

219
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,289
- I'm running late. I gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Stay!

220
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,129
Stay for the trick.
Spin! I'm doing spin.

221
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,526
You guys be good. I'll see you later.

222
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,681
Wait. No, look...

223
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,881
Okay, Max.

224
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,730
Listen, Duke.
I'm not sure if you're aware,

225
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,322
but one of those
food bowls, technically...

226
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,090
It's reserved for...

227
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,925
I know, maybe you
didn't read the names, but...

228
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,366
That's my bowl.

229
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,644
I know that it... Hey...

230
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,364
I was just thinking, I don't know,

231
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
maybe we could institute
some ground rules.

232
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,841
I just thought that...

233
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,280
Or not. I don't need a bowl.

234
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,361
Here again?

235
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,567
Rodent!

236
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,366
Oh, Duke.

237
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,931
Duke, Katie is not...

238
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,526
Katie's gonna be so upset
when she sees that.

239
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,405
Katie's gonna flip out...

240
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,922
When she sees how you
trashed her whole place.

241
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,327
Oh, it's just one vase.

242
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,608
Is it, Duke? Is it?

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,202
Oh, that's a shame.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,047
What are you doing?

245
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,725
Whoa, what am I doing?

246
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,645
Nothing. I'm a cute little doggy.

247
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,247
Katie knows I wouldn't
do anything like this.

248
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,890
No, no.

249
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,166
This could only be the work
of a dangerous stray,

250
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,969
who hasn't laid down
a foundation of trust.

251
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,246
You're the new dog.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,731
And, Duke, what'd you go and do this for?

253
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,811
- I'm gonna...
- What? Bite me?

254
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,450
Rip my face off?

255
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,602
Perfect. Wait till Katie finds out.

256
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,240
Help, Katie!
Thank goodness you're here.

257
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,206
I tried to stop him, but he's crazy!

258
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,450
Now, sit.

259
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,608
Okay, okay, okay.

260
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,570
Lay down.

261
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,164
Good boy.

262
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,291
Hi, Max.

263
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,646
Hey, Gidget.

264
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,370
Who's your new roommate?

265
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,965
Is it a girl dog or a boy dog?

266
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,645
Not that I care.
It doesn't matter to me.

267
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,161
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget.
He's just visiting.

268
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,521
Yeah, he's gonna be gone soon.

269
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Hey, what's up?

270
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,247
Oh, hi.

271
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,203
Your hat is the best hat I've ever seen.

272
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,361
Hey.

273
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,448
Excuse me. Genius!

274
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,120
You forgot my leash.

275
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,321
Never mind.

276
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,884
Hey, fellas, how's it...

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,650
Hey, fellas, how's it...

278
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,130
Hey, fellas...

279
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,726
Say, Duke...

280
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,006
Yes?

281
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,845
Be a good lad and bring me
a stick, won't you?

282
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,124
It would please me
to chew on a stick just now.

283
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,680
You heard me. Fetch.

284
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,203
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nah, not that one.

285
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,203
That one doesn't please me.

286
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,850
Find a really good one, Duke.

287
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,882
Yeah, that's it.

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,162
Hey, Max. Boy! Oh, wow.

289
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,721
There are a ton of sticks over here, Max!

290
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,410
You should come over and look at them.

291
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,001
Yeah, I wanna make sure
I grab you the right one.

292
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,481
Well, that's very thoughtful.

293
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,800
Look at all these sticks!

294
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Help! Help!

295
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,205
Hey, did you hear that?

296
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,761
Butterfly!

297
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,611
- Butterfly!
- Butterfly! Let's get it!

298
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
Wha... What's...

299
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,966
Help! Help!

300
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,081
So long!

301
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,446
Don't leave me here!

302
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,369
Didn't have to be this way, Max.

303
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,680
- Wait!
- No hard feelings!

304
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,761
Duke!

305
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,001
Please!

306
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Oy!

307
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,728
What's going on here?

308
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,081
Mind your own business.
Oh, my gosh, what happened to you?

309
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,611
I had a fight. All right?

310
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,288
With a big, stupid dog.

311
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,567
He lost.

312
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,571
Oh, you're headed into dangerous
territory there, kitty-cat.

313
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,887
I'd watch your tone, sunshine.

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,570
You know what I'm gonna do?

315
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm gonna cut you into
string, ball you up,

316
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,971
and then bat you around for hours

317
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,960
in a game that only I understand.

318
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
Oh, very nice.

319
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,161
I'll take that!

320
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,526
Wha...

321
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,770
You want to start with me,
little raisin?

322
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,451
Okay.

323
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,164
Get your umbrellas out, kitties,

324
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,169
because here they come!

325
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,926
The thunder and the lightning!

326
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,645
Right down on your face!

327
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,600
Gosh, there are a lot of you up there.

328
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,842
I'm talking about the thunder
and the lightning that's coming down

329
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,240
on all of your collective faces!

330
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,321
Attack on three...

331
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,241
Two...

332
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,928
I just remembered I gotta be somewhere!

333
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,646
That guy, huh? Am I right?

334
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,487
Okay. You know what? I'm just gonna...

335
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,404
No offense, but good-bye!

336
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,921
Hey!

337
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,006
You little...

338
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Duke?

339
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
You came back?

340
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,887
Run!

341
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,325
It's the po-po! Scram!

342
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,401
Wait!

343
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,088
Two, four, six, eight...

344
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,046
See you tomorrow, Guillermo!

345
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,406
You know it.

346
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,920
Ten...

347
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,047
Okay.

348
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,681
Right.

349
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Sheez, did you see that?

350
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Yeah, I saw it.

351
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,605
Throw it with your arm, you lazy weirdo!

352
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,240
I would not fetch that.
I'm old-school.

353
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
Thanks a lot, Duke.

354
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,761
I don't like to use this phrase

355
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,720
because it's offensive to our kind,

356
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,802
but you are a bad dog!

357
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,450
Katie's not going to like this.

358
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,483
I can't go to the pound.

359
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,962
What? What's wrong with you?

360
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,801
Well, Katie just...

361
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,486
She just got me out of the pound.

362
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,723
And if I go back...

363
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,927
Max, it's the end of the line for me.

364
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,321
Yes!

365
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,851
Why? Why?

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,445
What's the matter, Maria?

367
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,120
Maria, your face,

368
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,850
it wears a thousand sorrows.

369
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,689
What is wrong?

370
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,280
Oh, I have come face-to-face

371
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,761
with the worst thing in the world.

372
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,804
What? Oh, tell me, Maria.
Tell me now!

373
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,361
I cannot bear another moment
without knowing!

374
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,369
Loneliness.

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,604
Max! Max!

376
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,525
Max?

377
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,010
Hey, I see you, squirrel!

378
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,207
This is not your area!

379
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,441
We marked that tree!

380
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,844
Don't you try and hide!
I can see...

381
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,366
What was that?

382
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,363
- How dare you!
- Guys, where's Max?

383
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,602
Nobody likes you, squirrels!

384
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,361
Guys, seriously, where is Max?

385
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,204
Calm down, girl. He's right...

386
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
He is gone.

387
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,481
Oh, it's fine.

388
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,207
I heard him screaming after
he disappeared into those bushes.

389
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,243
Max is gone?

390
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,045
This is bad. This is so bad.

391
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,520
Maria, if he is your true love

392
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,443
you must go to him!

393
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,608
Save him! Save him!

394
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,369
Yes! Yes! Save my true love!

395
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm coming, Max!

396
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,800
Hi, Chloe. If anyone asks,

397
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,882
I'm on my way to the roof to look for Max.

398
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,841
Okay, bye-bye.

399
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,604
You see that?

400
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,242
Yeah, give me a second.

401
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,802
Hey, there, cute little bunny.

402
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,605
Whatcha doing in the middle of the road?

403
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,610
Bunny!

404
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,331
What's going on?

405
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,611
What the...

406
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,080
Save yourself!

407
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,400
Shut it, human!

408
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,527
Let's do this! Now!

409
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,563
Now! Yeah!

410
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,244
Get off me!

411
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,290
Wait up!

412
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,164
Get off me, pig!

413
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,846
Get off!

414
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,971
What's happening?

415
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,121
I don't know!

416
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,482
Ripper! Ripper, where you at?

417
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,006
Let's go, Ripper!
I'm busting you outta here!

418
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,284
The revolution has begun!

419
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,805
Liberated forever!

420
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,689
Domesticated never!

421
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah!

422
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,440
Who's driving this thing?

423
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,082
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

424
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,006
Who are you guys?

425
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,766
Who are we?

426
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,922
Who are we?

427
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,924
We are the Flushed Pets...

428
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,570
Thrown away by our owners

429
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,882
and now we are out for revenge!

430
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,246
It's like a club,

431
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,964
but with biting and scratching.

432
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,051
Take us with you!

433
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,609
I don't think so, pets.

434
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,366
Yeah, you got the stench
of domestication all over you.

435
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,320
You chose your side.
And now you're gonna burn.

436
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,721
No! Stop! Who you calling pets?

437
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,570
I ain't no pet!
You got it all wrong!

438
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
We're just like you guys.
We hate humans.

439
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,129
- Yeah! That's right!
- Hate them.

440
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,726
Oh, man, don't get me started on people.
Am I right, Duke?

441
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,241
Yeah, that's why we
burned our collars, man!

442
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,925
We burned them to the ground!

443
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,241
And killed our owners!

444
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,084
Yeah... Wait a minute,
that's too far maybe?

445
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,571
No, they dig it.

446
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,011
- Yes, we whacked them.
- Yeah, that's right!

447
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,880
Bang, bang with our own paws!

448
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,000
If I had a dime
for every owner I killed...

449
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Oh, yeah!

450
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,366
I'd have a dime.

451
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,650
Because I just killed the one.

452
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,124
Oh, y'all cold-blooded.

453
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,402
Oh, man, you remind me of my boy, Ricky.

454
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,806
He died though.

455
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,650
RIP, Ricky!

456
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,170
The truth is, the struggle
could use some more muscle.

457
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,526
All right, look, I'll tell you what.

458
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,449
We'll bust the both of you out of here.
But understand this.

459
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,965
From now on, you work for me.

460
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,963
- That's fine.
- Sounds like a fun challenge.

461
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,680
All right, guys, let's do this!

462
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,606
To the sewers!

463
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,491
The sewers?

464
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,371
What are y'all waiting for?
I'm not playing.

465
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,681
I said...

466
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,365
To the sewers!

467
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,763
Long live the revolution, suckers!

468
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,891
I can do it.

469
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,371
Max?

470
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,161
Max?

471
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,960
Max.

472
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,682
Oh, where are you, Max?

473
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,565
Looks like you could use a little help.

474
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,006
Who said that?

475
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,366
Over here.

476
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,400
In this dark and foreboding shed.

477
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Hello?

478
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,081
I can see for miles.

479
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,323
If you let me out,
I'll find your friend.

480
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,720
Wow! Really?

481
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,882
You're so sweet.

482
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,883
You're sweet too.

483
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,246
Thanks, stranger.

484
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,805
But not too sweet.

485
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,402
There's also a salty,
gamey thing going on.

486
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,766
Yeah, that's me.

487
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,366
Come on, let's get you out of that shed.

488
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,410
Yeah, that's it.

489
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,608
Just step over the pile of bones.

490
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,200
Pile of bones. Okay, will do.

491
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,402
I sure hope Max is safe.

492
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,602
You're a very thoughtful food.

493
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,286
Food? I didn't say that.
I said friend.

494
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,408
I meant food...

495
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,721
Friend.

496
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,006
You know what I meant.

497
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,646
I'm sure lucky I found you...

498
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,961
Tiberius.

499
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,208
And, yes, this is
a very good thing for you,

500
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,931
this whole meeting me thing.

501
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,003
Take off my hood.

502
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,081
The chain!

503
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,002
You tried to eat me!

504
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,451
I'm sorry.

505
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,765
You should be sorry.
You deserve to be locked up.

506
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,530
You're a bad, bad bird.

507
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,723
I can't help it.
I was born with killer instincts.

508
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,330
That is just no excuse.

509
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,165
You're right.
Even for a predator, I'm selfish.

510
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,607
I'm a selfish predator.

511
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,649
It's no wonder I have no friends.

512
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
Nobody.

513
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,284
This is hopeless.

514
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,644
Oh, don't... There's no need to cry.

515
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,848
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before.

516
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,689
Please, take off the chain.

517
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,491
This time I'll help you. I promise.

518
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,647
Tiberius...

519
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,122
This is gonna sound completely
horrible, but...

520
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,850
I don't fully trust you.

521
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,171
Oh, no, no, no...

522
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,408
But, I guess everyone deserves
a second chance.

523
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,403
And you are just a lonely, old bird.

524
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,846
And you do have weird manners

525
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,162
because you live
in a weird shed on a roof.

526
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,608
So, I'll tell you what.
If you find Max...

527
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,770
I'll be your best friend.

528
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,922
Best friend?

529
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,844
You and me?

530
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,841
Yes! That sounds nice.

531
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,121
Let's do this.

532
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,969
Okay.

533
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,441
So, what does this Max look like?

534
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,561
Brown and white.

535
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,530
He's a short-hair, roguishly handsome.

536
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,290
He's got a sparkle in his eye.

537
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,243
He sounds dreamy.

538
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,966
You have no idea.

539
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,521
I mean, what? Whatever. Shut up.

540
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,120
If my owner comes

541
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,766
put on the hood and pretend to be me.

542
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,405
Okay, thank you!

543
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,409
The smell is disgusting...

544
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,721
ly good.

545
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,365
This is all so great.

546
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,925
Love it here.

547
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,520
- What's...
- The...

548
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,568
- Pass...
- Word?

549
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,091
Password?

550
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,446
Look! Look at me.

551
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,204
I am your leader.

552
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,085
The leader does not recite the password.

553
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,442
The leader makes up the password, idiots.

554
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,443
Everybody, I'm making up
a new password right now.

555
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,045
The new password is...

556
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,920
Don't ask the leader for the password!

557
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,610
Follow me.

558
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,524
Welcome to the underbelly, brothers.

559
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,121
Home of the Flushed Pets.

560
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,160
Brothers and sisters!

561
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,287
As you see,

562
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,802
I've returned from the surface
with two new recruits.

563
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,491
These guys are owner-killers!

564
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,601
Hey, hey! Settle down!

565
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,491
Guys, I want you
to tell them how you did it.

566
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,331
Go ahead. Tell them the whole story
about how you took out your owner.

567
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,606
Don't leave out nothing.

568
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,250
We love gory detail, here.

569
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,845
- Oh, yeah!
- Tell us!

570
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,769
- Right.
- So, tell them, Max.

571
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,649
Okay, so. I was like...

572
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,801
Well, we were like...

573
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,121
- Take that!
- Yeah!

574
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,645
Stupid owner.

575
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,689
So, that's who you're dealing with.

576
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,090
That story bored me to death.

577
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,361
Boring!

578
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,760
Give us detail!

579
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,609
Okay. Max?

580
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,364
Okay, well...

581
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,488
So, there's this thing in the kitchen...

582
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,680
Yeah. Table!

583
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,205
- It's flat.
- Toaster!

584
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,240
And then round on just the end of it.

585
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,367
A spoon?

586
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,005
- Yes, a spoon!
- Exactly.

587
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,009
You can't hurt someone with a spoon.

588
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,889
You scoop with a spoon.

589
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,167
How many people wanna know
how to kill somebody with a spoon?

590
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,169
I do! Oh, yeah!

591
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,805
Okay. Well...

592
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,530
We used the spoon...

593
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,326
Hit a button on the machine
on the counter...

594
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,885
- Right, and it's got those...
- The, you know.

595
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,604
- Those blades.
- The... It's got blades!

596
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,160
Was it a blender?

597
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,209
You blended somebody?

598
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,211
He talking about the blender, guys.

599
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,129
Oh, please, tell me it was a blender!

600
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,726
Hey, buddy, I don't ask what
it's called, we just kill with it.

601
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,291
But it was a blender.

602
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,364
Do y'all hear this?

603
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,727
You know who was like this?
Ricky!

604
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,085
Rest in peace!

605
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,527
Ricky was the only soldier I had

606
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,160
that was ready to kill humans on sight.

607
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,209
Everybody else need a pep talk.

608
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,964
Not these two brothers.

609
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,720
See, all of us have suffered
at the hands of man.

610
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,086
I mean, take me for instance.

611
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,686
I was a magician's rabbit
for kids' parties.

612
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,083
But then bunny tricks went out of style.

613
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,440
So, what did my owner do?

614
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,080
My owner went and left magic behind

615
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,650
and made me disappear...

616
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,571
From his life!

617
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,843
I lived in a tattoo parlor!

618
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,606
The trainees used to practice on me!

619
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,762
Until they ran out of space!

620
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,128
I mean, yes, humans say they love us.

621
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,647
But then they turn around
and throw us out like garbage.

622
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,649
Ain't that right, Sea-Monkeys?

623
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,200
It's not our fault
we don't look like the ad!

624
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,281
Yeah!

625
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,924
All right, you guys
are joining the brotherhood.

626
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,809
- It's initiation time!
- Oh, yeah!

627
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,649
- The what?
- I'm sorry, what time?

628
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,371
Summon the Viper!

629
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,930
Is this Viper poisonous?

630
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,765
Because I should warn you,
I'm very allergic to poison!

631
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,528
All right. Show her!

632
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,960
Max's collar!

633
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,485
Where is he?

634
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,165
What happened to him?

635
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,970
I ain't saying nothing!

636
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,604
You're gonna tell us where Max is.

637
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,723
And you're gonna tell us now!

638
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,965
Is this supposed to scare me?

639
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,282
I'm a cat. I land on my feet.

640
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Does it always happen?

641
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,006
Because your head looks like
it's taken a lot of landings.

642
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,161
Do you want me to cut you?

643
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,840
Because I'll cut you this way and that.
You'll look like a waffle.

644
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,127
Okay.

645
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,600
He's too stupid to talk,
and too ugly to eat.

646
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,050
I'm done playing nice!

647
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,163
Where is Max?

648
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,841
Tell me!

649
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,921
Let me finish...

650
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,091
Help me!

651
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,168
Don't look at him. Look at me.

652
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,924
Nobody can help you!

653
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,520
Where is Max?

654
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,766
Okay! Okay!

655
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,922
He's in the sewers! He got taken!

656
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,246
Please! Have mercy...

657
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,926
Adorable puffy dog!

658
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,322
Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite!

659
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,969
As proof of your allegiance

660
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,724
you will now receive the bite

661
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,565
of a one-fanged, half-blind Viper

662
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,131
fueled by a diet

663
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,687
of anti-human rage!

664
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,210
Who wants to go first?

665
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,243
Okay, here's the thing though.

666
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,241
Tiny Dog.

667
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,371
Can I call you Tiny Dog?

668
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,409
It fits you. Let's admit that.

669
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,561
Look.

670
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,921
Between you and the fat dog,
I like you the best.

671
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,286
Oh, thank you!

672
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,283
Tiny Dog's gonna go first.

673
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,090
Everybody, TD's going first!

674
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,241
No, no, no.

675
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,886
Tiny Dog does not want to go first.
Take the fat dog!

676
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,081
Snake bite!

677
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,441
No, no, no. Stop!

678
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,803
Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite!

679
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,285
No, no, no, no.

680
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,203
Stop!

681
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,009
What are you doing initiating
a couple domestics?

682
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,167
Domestics?

683
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,123
Yeah. We just jumped
those two in the alley.

684
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,089
Slashed off their collars.

685
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,844
No, no, no. That's not true.

686
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,291
You said you burned your collars.

687
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,205
Well, burned, lost,
had them stolen by cats.

688
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,767
It's all just words, really, isn't it?

689
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,360
You don't deserve to
be marked by the Viper.

690
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,323
- Oh, no.
- We'll just show ourselves out.

691
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,601
You deserve

692
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,649
to be eaten by the Viper.

693
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,609
Get those leash lovers!

694
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,005
Hold on.

695
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,164
Go get them, Duke.

696
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,484
Fellas, that was an accident.

697
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,365
You squished the sacred Viper!

698
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,609
He's a flapjack.

699
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,645
Oh, Viper!

700
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,282
Viper, you in a better place!

701
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,521
You and Ricky!

702
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,001
You ain't never did nothing to nobody!

703
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,685
Well, you bit a lot of people, Viper.

704
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,649
So, technically, you might
actually deserve this.

705
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,167
This might be something
that was long overdue.

706
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,890
But it shouldn't have came like this.
Not on my watch.

707
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,684
Get them!

708
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,171
Oh, no!

709
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,328
Come on!

710
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,809
Wait up, Duke!

711
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,761
We're sorry. Can this be over now?

712
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,000
We've got a problem.

713
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,491
We have so many problems.

714
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,762
Which one do you mean at this moment?

715
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,524
Stop running, dummies!

716
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,966
Stop it right now!

717
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,447
- Hold your breath!
- Hold my breath?

718
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,441
Get them!

719
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,726
This is my least favorite part
of this whole thing so far!

720
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,161
Friends!

721
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,449
I am afraid that
I have some terrible news.

722
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,449
The squirrels are gonna
take over the world!

723
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,601
I knew it!

724
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,849
I always said, squirrels
are little shifty little guys.

725
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
No. We're not doing the squirrel thing
right now. That's not...

726
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,601
No!

727
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,769
Max is missing!

728
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,564
He's out there somewhere.

729
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,364
Lost. Scared.

730
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,164
So, so handsome.

731
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,766
We have got to find him
and bring him home!

732
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,690
But the outside world is loud and scary.

733
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,961
Is that a hawk?

734
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,769
This is my friend, Tiberius.
He's going to help us.

735
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,647
He's not going to eat us.
We've already been over it.

736
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,723
Come on, Gidget.
We go out there without a leash...

737
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,600
We'll get caught by a net.

738
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,681
Or something worse!

739
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,365
Yeah, like a hawk!

740
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,370
We're wasting time! Max needs us!

741
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,966
Come on, girl, Max doesn't
even know you're alive.

742
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,320
Well, I don't care!

743
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,881
I love him! I love him
with all of my heart!

744
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,408
And I'm gonna go look for Max,
no matter who's with me.

745
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,721
So...

746
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,041
Who's with me?

747
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,088
All right, fine. Fine.

748
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,729
Oh, come on, guys.

749
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,689
I can't believe you.

750
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,246
When I got my claws caught in the curtains

751
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,169
who pulled me down?

752
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,725
Max did.

753
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,850
Buddy, Mel.

754
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,043
When you were fixed, who taught you
to sit the comfortable way?

755
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,247
Max did!

756
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,561
Max did!

757
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,051
Max did. He did it!

758
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,084
And when that random cat
tried to eat Sweetpea

759
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,004
who saved him?

760
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,122
It wasn't a random cat. It was you.

761
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,888
The identity of the random cat
is not the point.

762
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,327
We're talking about who saved him!

763
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,441
Max did!

764
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,086
- We gotta save him. We gotta go save Max!
- Yeah!

765
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,366
Yeah! Let's go save Max!

766
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,600
Which one is Max, again?

767
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,930
Tiberius!

768
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,048
No! Bad, bad bird.

769
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,444
Nice little guy.

770
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,204
Nice little guy.

771
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,606
I like this bird.

772
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,605
Crazy bird.

773
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,766
Come on!

774
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,126
We gotta get to shore.

775
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,483
I only know the doggy paddle!
And I don't know it well!

776
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,766
Swim, Tiny Dog. Swim!

777
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,040
Duke!

778
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,969
Help!

779
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,850
Max, grab the ring!

780
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,841
I can't!

781
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,126
Keep it up, Max!

782
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
You're doing...

783
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,163
Well, you're not doing great.

784
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,322
But you're not drowning,
and that's something!

785
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,320
You're almost there!

786
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,526
Thanks, Duke.

787
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,491
No problem.

788
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,041
Finally. I'm going home.

789
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,522
Isn't home that way?

790
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,800
Seriously?

791
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,445
They're going to Brooklyn.

792
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,046
They say everyone's going
to Brooklyn these days.

793
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,844
It's making a real comeback.

794
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,201
I'm not talking about
hipster real estate trends.

795
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,601
I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo!

796
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,882
Death is coming to Brooklyn.

797
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,445
And it's got buck teeth

798
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,170
and a cotton tail.

799
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,610
Let's go!

800
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,329
Hi, how are you?

801
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,724
Chug! Chug! Chug!

802
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,642
What is this crazy joint?

803
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,489
This is Pops' place.

804
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,644
His owner is never home,
so it's kind of a hot spot.

805
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,689
Pops knows everyone in this city.

806
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,287
If he agrees to help us,
Max is as good as found.

807
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,851
- Cool!
- Fabulous!

808
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,400
Tell me you got that!

809
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,001
Oh, heck yes, I did.

810
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,003
- What's up, Peanut?
- Hey, Buddy.

811
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,645
You see Pops around here?

812
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,564
Yeah, he's over there.

813
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,041
Hey, Pops.

814
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,201
Mud and sweet potatoes.

815
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,407
Pops!

816
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,728
Who's that? What?

817
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,803
Oh, hey, Buddy.

818
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,845
How you been, old-timer?

819
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,845
Paralyzed.

820
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,084
Great! Listen, Mr. Pops,

821
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,890
our friend Max was taken.

822
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,168
Last we heard,
he was lost in the sewers.

823
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,727
Buddy said that maybe you could help us.

824
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,049
You know,
I do know a guy in the sewers,

825
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,287
but...

826
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,925
I don't go out anymore.

827
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,849
What a waste of time.

828
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,086
Who said that?

829
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,531
Oh, I said it.

830
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,409
By the way, I meant no offense,
I just...

831
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,891
Have you seen yourself?

832
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,565
Welly-well, well, well...

833
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,240
Looky what we apparently have here.

834
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,131
Meezy would like to have a look-see.

835
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,408
Myron! Brows!

836
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,806
Oh, no.

837
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,200
Oh, yes.

838
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,567
Me like what me see.

839
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,364
Well, what me can see.

840
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,409
It's all an attractive blur.

841
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,802
Little lady, this is my city.

842
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,769
I'll find your friend.

843
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,082
All right, party's over!

844
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,765
Myron! Vacuum!

845
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,084
So, where are you from, my fuzzy angel?

846
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,930
Dude, I'm a cat.

847
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,082
Well, nobody's perfect.

848
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,969
I'm so hungry.

849
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,209
Oh, man.
Would you look at that sandwich!

850
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,846
All right. Time to work the gift.

851
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,007
No, no, no!

852
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,080
Okay, this'll be fine. We're fine.

853
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,650
We can find our way home.

854
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,087
We are descended from the mighty wolf!

855
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,282
We have raw, primal instincts

856
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,360
that are mere moments away

857
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,886
from kicking in and leading us home!

858
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,690
I cannot wait!

859
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,763
Here it comes!

860
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,804
Anything?

861
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,001
No.

862
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,645
Wait! Oh, I...

863
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,843
No.

864
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,764
I don't know, Duke.

865
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,481
Maybe the legend of dogs coming
from wolves is just wrong.

866
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,763
Maybe one puppy asked his mom,
where did we come from?

867
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,166
And the mom said, woof.

868
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,004
And the kid was like, oh, wolves?

869
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,844
And she was like, yeah, fine.

870
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,160
Sausage.

871
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,846
You smell that?

872
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,083
Oh, man, it is.

873
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,804
Sausage!

874
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,604
Well, then what are we waiting for?

875
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,961
We're coming for you, baby!

876
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,127
Lower the ramp, dummy.

877
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,205
Who are they?

878
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,164
This is Puffball, Squash-Face,

879
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,163
Weiner Dog, Yellow Bird,

880
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,891
Eagle-Eye, Guinea Pig Joe.

881
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,883
And, of course, my girlfriend Rhonda.

882
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,720
100% wrong.

883
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,091
Good enough.

884
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,846
Come on! Let's go!
Move it or lose it!

885
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,281
Every bird instinct I have says

886
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,680
don't follow a dog on wheels.

887
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,728
Mr. Pops, sir.

888
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,201
Shouldn't we be heading to the sewers?

889
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,765
Now, if we take the human route,

890
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,405
getting there is gonna take days.

891
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,721
You may have lots of time,

892
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,928
but for me every breath is a cliffhanger.

893
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,050
So, we gotta take the secret route.

894
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,606
Okay. The secret route was death.

895
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,245
Well, that's that, I guess.

896
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,407
Come on!

897
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,410
Get down here!

898
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,610
Sweetpea...

899
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,124
Keep moving!

900
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,801
Oh, no.

901
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,287
Stop it! Look away!

902
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,962
Come on! I don't have all day!

903
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,684
Come on, slowpokes!

904
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,050
What is that smell?

905
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,885
It's poo-poo with a dash of caca.

906
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,931
The scent is getting stronger.

907
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,531
Oh, man.

908
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,081
Duke, let's eat!

909
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,685
Oh, yes!

910
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,568
Oh, it smells so good!

911
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,526
Oh, yes!

912
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,289
Sausages!

913
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,922
Come on, boys!

914
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,041
Holy schnitzel!

915
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,970
<i>We go together like rama lama lama
ka dinga da dinga dong</i>

916
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,884
<i>Remembered forever</i>

917
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,526
<i>As shoo-bop sha wadda wadda
yippity boom de boom</i>

918
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,881
<i>Chang chang changitty chang sha-bop</i>

919
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,482
<i>That's the way it should be</i>

920
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,529
<i>Wha-oooh, yeah!</i>

921
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,520
<i>We're for each other like a wop
ba-ba lu-bop and wop bam boom</i>

922
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,360
<i>Just like my brother is</i>

923
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,966
<i>Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
yippity dip de doom</i>

924
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,920
<i>Chang chang changitty chang sha-bop</i>

925
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,560
<i>We'll always be together</i>

926
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,768
<i>Wha-oooh, yeah!</i>

927
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,967
Getting a weird vibe, man.

928
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,841
All right, now,
these guys are a bit testy.

929
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,968
So, just let me do the talking.

930
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,520
Hey, you crybaby!
Where's the Viper at?

931
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,649
Don't you worry, Viper!

932
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,531
You will not be forgotten!

933
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,409
You will be avenged, Viper!

934
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,690
If you don't believe me,

935
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,405
you can look at my battle plans.

936
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,369
It's all laid out right here.

937
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,530
Boss...

938
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,882
I can't tell who anyone is.

939
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,168
Well, you gotta really
look at it to understand it.

940
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,408
That's you guys right here.

941
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,886
And, see, that's Brooklyn.

942
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,929
That's where we gonna get them dogs.

943
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,851
That ball of fluff's got a screw loose.

944
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,365
Let's skedaddle.

945
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,851
You get it, you see what I'm saying.

946
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,446
Bottom line is, I'm coming
right for you, Tiny Dog!

947
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,410
And that big, fat, brown dog?
He gonna get it too.

948
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,607
Tiny Dog?

949
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,728
There are lots of tiny dogs in the city.

950
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,201
I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay?
So, let's just go.

951
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,727
He also said, big, fat, brown dog.

952
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,729
Like Max's new roommate.

953
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,001
Not necessarily.

954
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,040
Max, Max, Max...

955
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,964
You are gonna get it!

956
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,642
That's kind of hard to dispute.

957
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,451
Hey, you stay away from...

958
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Wait, what?

959
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,921
You know Tiny Dog?

960
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,085
He's my friend!

961
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
And some might say my boyfriend!

962
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,810
Nobody says that.

963
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,769
I can't believe you know Tiny Dog!

964
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,360
That's cool.
It's such a small world,

965
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,124
that's the funny thing about it.

966
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,561
Get them!

967
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,966
Scatter!

968
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,761
Not good!

969
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,641
See you guys later!

970
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,761
Hang on!

971
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,610
Everybody, run!

972
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,846
Derick, you idiot!

973
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,206
Did they all get away?

974
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,687
That was a close one!

975
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,530
Oh, nuts!

976
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,768
Yes! We got one!

977
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,845
Oh, good for you guys!

978
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,650
Yeah!

979
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,564
Oh, yes, Tiny Dog,

980
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,245
we got your friend!

981
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,200
Advantage, me!

982
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,560
Just ignore what
just happened. Okay?

983
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,926
Yes!

984
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,120
You know what?

985
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,567
This may be the sausage talking,

986
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,000
but you're okay.

987
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,128
Right back at you, man.

988
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,240
When I met you, I was all like,

989
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,846
I don't know if I like him.

990
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,162
But now that I know you, I'm like,

991
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,169
I like him.

992
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,844
You know, I saw this
place from the outside

993
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,365
many times.

994
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,565
Had I known what treasures
awaited within these walls,

995
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,440
I would've broke down that door

996
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,363
a long time ago, I'll tell you!

997
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,530
What are you talking about?

998
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,001
My old owner and I
used to live around here.

999
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,600
Duke, man, wait.

1000
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,250
Did you use to have an owner?

1001
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,364
Well, it was a long time ago.

1002
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,851
I don't want to talk about it.

1003
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,689
Yes, you do. Come on.

1004
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,124
I don't know.

1005
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,886
But you know what?

1006
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,962
He was so cool.

1007
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,320
Yeah?

1008
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,126
Yeah.

1009
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,123
He was the best.

1010
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,651
Man, we had fun.

1011
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,085
We'd play fetch.

1012
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,084
We'd go for walks.

1013
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,844
We'd take naps.

1014
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,489
We were both big nappers.

1015
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,286
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly, or a car.

1016
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,807
By the time I had caught up
with it and ate it...

1017
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,450
Probably a butterfly then.

1018
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,365
I realized I was so
far away from my home

1019
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,284
I couldn't find it.

1020
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,889
A few days later, I was picked up
by Animal Control.

1021
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,322
I had a great thing going.

1022
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,803
But I had to go and mess it up.

1023
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,169
Duke, we gotta go to your house.

1024
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,566
Nah.

1025
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,882
Your owner's gonna be relieved!

1026
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,087
Will he?

1027
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Yeah, but...

1028
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,328
But he never came for me.

1029
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,650
Maybe he...

1030
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,403
Maybe he didn't like me.

1031
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,364
Of course he liked you.
He was your owner.

1032
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,761
I mean, he's probably worried sick!

1033
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,325
I don't know.

1034
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,323
Well, I do know and we're going!

1035
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,640
Your owner's gonna freak!

1036
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,722
I'm freaking out just thinking about it.

1037
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,001
Okay.

1038
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,080
Let's do it!

1039
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,321
There they are!

1040
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,246
All right, doggy, come on.

1041
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,760
Hey, hey, hey!

1042
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,205
Where do you think you're going?

1043
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,322
Come back here, you dogs!

1044
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,001
That rabbit...

1045
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,525
He had crazy eyes.

1046
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,126
There ain't no curing what's wrong
with that thing!

1047
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,567
Gidget, here's an idea.

1048
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,685
Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood
that looks like Max.

1049
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,683
Start hanging out with him.

1050
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,683
After a while, you'll think it's him

1051
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,165
you'll be done.

1052
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,368
We are not just giving up!

1053
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,686
We're dedicated. We're loyal.

1054
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,484
We're easily the greatest pet ever.

1055
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,721
We're dogs!

1056
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,200
- Cat.
- Hawk.

1057
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,601
Well, congratulations!

1058
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,842
Today you're dogs,
whether you like it or not!

1059
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,007
Sweet.

1060
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,691
Now let's find Max
before that rabbit does!

1061
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,161
Break! We're dogs!

1062
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,369
I don't like it.

1063
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,608
Yep, they were here.

1064
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,081
Excellent. We're closing in!

1065
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,527
This is groundbreaking
evil behavior, people.

1066
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,321
Groundbreaking!

1067
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,008
A light bulb just went off in my brain.

1068
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,208
The bunny has an idea.

1069
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,129
Okay, so how do I look?

1070
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,770
You look great.

1071
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,924
How do I smell?

1072
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,445
Like a dog, Duke.

1073
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,761
Relax, man.

1074
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,489
There it is.

1075
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,289
Well, go on up.

1076
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,930
Go scratch at that door.

1077
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,522
Remember that sausage factory?
That was fun, huh?

1078
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,960
Are you stalling?

1079
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,765
No. Why do you think that?

1080
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,240
Let's have a long talk about
why you think I'm stalling.

1081
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,288
Duke, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1082
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,363
Your owner is going to
be thrilled to see you.

1083
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,766
Okay.

1084
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,410
That car is new.

1085
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,723
Can I help you?

1086
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,122
No. We're good, thanks.

1087
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,129
You're not good. You look dirty.

1088
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,442
And I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off my lawn

1089
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,329
before I get...

1090
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,289
what you have.

1091
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,925
This is my lawn.

1092
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,844
Duke, maybe we should go.

1093
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,571
And why would Fred get a cat?

1094
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,006
He hates cats.

1095
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,844
That's one of the things I love about him.

1096
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,606
Fred? The old guy?

1097
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,531
He...

1098
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,489
He died.

1099
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,640
Duke, maybe I made a mistake,
saying we should come here.

1100
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,245
Let's go.

1101
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,204
You're a liar!

1102
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,328
Max, cats lie all the time.

1103
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,930
Don't fall for it!

1104
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,600
Who are they?

1105
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,605
Hey, this is my home.

1106
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,921
Go away!

1107
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,688
Duke, it's time to go.

1108
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,489
Duke, let's go! Come on!

1109
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,369
This isn't your home anymore.

1110
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,801
Why did you bring me here, Max?

1111
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,922
Wait a minute. This is my fault?

1112
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,605
I was trying to help you!

1113
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,927
You were trying to get rid of me!

1114
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,328
You know what, Duke?
I don't need this.

1115
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
I'll see you later.

1116
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,241
Gotcha!

1117
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,440
Come on, settle down!

1118
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,725
Go home, Max!

1119
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,411
Hey, help me out, here!

1120
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,443
Hold on! I'm coming!

1121
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,606
Let's go.

1122
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,681
- Finally got you, big fella.
- Come on.

1123
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,723
This is it for you.

1124
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,921
Duke!

1125
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,404
Koochi koochi koo!

1126
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,166
Tiny Dog!

1127
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,370
Ah, are you kidding me?

1128
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,361
You thought this was over, Tiny Dog?

1129
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,086
Stop!

1130
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,561
Jab, jab, jab!

1131
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,846
Body blow! Body blow!

1132
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,764
Karate chop to your neck!

1133
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,644
Would you get off me!

1134
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,206
Tattoo!

1135
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,842
No, no, no.

1136
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,810
Oh, TD.

1137
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,530
This kills me to say,

1138
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,682
but we gotta join forces, man.

1139
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,368
We make a great team, Tiny Dog!

1140
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,888
Well, mainly, I'm doing all
the hard work, but you're helping!

1141
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,081
Yes, yes, fine.

1142
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,447
Just keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving like an animal!

1143
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,050
What was that?

1144
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,810
Oh, that was a pothole.

1145
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,570
You're hitting things on purpose!

1146
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,041
You know me too well, TD!

1147
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,043
Always keeping me in check.

1148
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,961
Do you see the van?

1149
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,246
Yeah, I see it.

1150
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,004
We're about to hit it.

1151
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,084
Relax, Snowball, I got you.

1152
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,804
There he is!

1153
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,760
He's got Snowball!

1154
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,923
Look, fellas, this is
not what this looks like.

1155
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,565
Shush, you!

1156
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,924
You were gonna eat the boss!

1157
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,407
No, no, no. Snowball and I
are on the same side now.

1158
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,767
Tell them! Snowball, tell them!

1159
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,048
That raccoon is lying.

1160
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,080
He's not the president.

1161
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,761
Come on, now.

1162
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,126
Come here, you.

1163
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,487
Gidget?

1164
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,280
Go, Max!

1165
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,805
Right. Okay, gotta go.

1166
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,405
Thank you! Thank you!

1167
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,251
Stay down!

1168
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,170
Duke, hang on!

1169
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,560
Duke!

1170
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,846
Max? Max!

1171
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,803
- Oh, get the keys!
- Right!

1172
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,405
Hurry!

1173
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,484
Come on, come on.

1174
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,284
I got them!

1175
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,726
Max!

1176
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,726
Remember me!

1177
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,884
I feel heroic!

1178
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,445
And handsome.

1179
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,489
I'm a little wet, but I still look good.

1180
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,369
I look good.

1181
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,487
Are you...

1182
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,040
Are you okay?

1183
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,366
I'm good.

1184
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,767
I'm good.

1185
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,283
Thanks for coming to save me, Max.

1186
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,610
Max!

1187
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,051
Oh, Max!

1188
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,891
You need a lift?

1189
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,051
Yes, we need a lift!

1190
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,566
Let's go, Tattoo.

1191
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,284
Taxi!

1192
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,401
Yeah!

1193
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,405
Hey, hey...

1194
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,086
Gidget, wait up.

1195
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,880
Oh, hi, Max.

1196
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,960
Yeah. Hi...

1197
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,008
Play it cool.

1198
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,084
Yeah, I...

1199
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,884
I just wanted to...

1200
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,570
Look...

1201
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,326
Have you ever lived across
from someone your whole life,

1202
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,121
but you don't really
appreciate them, until...

1203
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,400
I don't know...

1204
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,404
Until they're beating up dozens
of animals on the Brooklyn Bridge?

1205
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,410
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

1206
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,730
If you ever wanna...

1207
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,841
Okay.

1208
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,530
Oh, great. You're in love.

1209
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,047
How gross for everyone. Now move it!

1210
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,804
- Good-bye! See you later!
- Good-bye!

1211
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,689
Does anyone know where we are?

1212
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,841
Bye, Max.

1213
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,047
Bye, Gidget.

1214
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,440
Okay, bye-bye!

1215
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,971
See you guys.

1216
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,289
Man, I feel sorry for them.

1217
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,482
Gotta run home to their owners.

1218
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,641
Not us.

1219
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,644
Now, it's back to our primary mission.

1220
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,531
The downfall of the human race!

1221
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,330
It is on, humans!

1222
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,209
It is on!

1223
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,481
Yeah!

1224
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,161
Mommy! Can I have a bunny?

1225
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,085
And a pig and a crocodile and a lizard?

1226
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,685
Yay, bunny!

1227
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,606
Jab, jab, jab!

1228
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,007
Body blow! Body blow!
Break-away move.

1229
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,327
What's going on? What's she doing?

1230
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,007
Bunny, I'm gonna love you
forever and ever and ever.

1231
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,929
Bunny.

1232
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,530
Here you go.

1233
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,131
Duke, this is the best part of the day.

1234
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,246
Is that her?

1235
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,243
Nah, no. That's... Wait...

1236
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,811
Yeah, that's her. That's her.

1237
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,090
Katie!

1238
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,125
There they are!

1239
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,480
Max and Duke, Duke and Max!

1240
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,210
My boys!

1241
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,251
So, how'd it go? Great, right? I...

1242
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,008
So, maybe a few bumps.

1243
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,640
But I knew this was gonna work out.

1244
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,042
So, who's hungry?

1245
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,603
Welcome home, Duke.

1246
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,451
Thanks, Max.

1247
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,840
Come on, man. Hurry it up.

1248
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,604
Okay.

1249
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,520
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1250
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,601
Sheesh!

1251
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,129
Welcome, my dogs.

1252
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,965
Oh, you guys look weird.

1253
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,167
Hurry up, come on in.

1254
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,807
You said it was a costume party.

1255
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,291
Why do you listen to me?

1256
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,570
I'm home, Leonard.

1257
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,280
Were you a good boy, Leonard?

1258
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,526
All right, party's over.
