1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:10,303
<i>Hello, everyone.
I have my friend Chris Renaud on my right.</i>

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,264
<i>And I have my friend Pierre Coffin on my left.</i>

3
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,434
<i>And we're both the directors
of</i> Despicable Me 2.

4
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:21,063
<i>Well, we haven't much to say, right,
about this?</i>

5
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,857
<i>That's right.
We had nothing to do with that logo.</i>

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,777
<i>- Although it's nice rendering.
- Pretty cool. Nice flare there.</i>

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,448
<i>Yes. Well, I don't know
what to say about that.</i>

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:36,329
<i>We started off doing them on the first one,
and then they got branded.</i>

9
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,998
<i>It helped brand Illumination, I guess.</i>

10
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,209
<i>Yeah, they've sort of taken on
a life of their own.</i>

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,295
<i>I think the first idea we had
was with an evil minion in there.</i>

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,880
<i>Yes, I get it.</i>

13
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,924
<i>We jumped ahead. I think I ruined something.</i>

14
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,177
<i>- Damn!
- Can't say that. Roll that out.</i>

15
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>I was gonna say the other word, but...</i>

16
00:00:56,641 --> 00:01:00,561
<i>To get into the movie,
one of the things we talked about,</i>

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,897
<i>what the opening scene would be.</i>

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,484
<i>And for us,
one of the big inspirations in this movie,</i>

19
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,237
<i>maybe even more than the first one,
was James Bond.</i>

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,991
<i>Where there would be some kind of
big action opening thing</i>

21
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,911
<i>that felt, actually, not disconnected,</i>

22
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,706
<i>but felt like it was in a different world,
a different environment.</i>

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,918
<i>So, compared to the first movie,
where we start in Egypt,</i>

24
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,213
<i>we thought a cool thing to try
would be the Antarctic.</i>

25
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,465
<i>Scale and mystery, basically.</i>

26
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,552
<i>Yeah. We needed a crime to occur
that nobody witnessed.</i>

27
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>So we could keep it top secret.</i>

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,396
<i>The original version of this scene, actually,
we were playing with setting it in Paris.</i>

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,442
<i>I remember, with all these Paris clichés,
and you almost got hanged in France.</i>

30
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:52,363
<i>- I decided I'd like to go for a Russian lab.
- Exactly.</i>

31
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,282
<i>Also, from a narrative point of view,</i>

32
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,326
<i>we knew we needed something
that not a lot of people could witness.</i>

33
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,662
<i>So the Antarctic worked great.</i>

34
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,793
<i>- All these guys are speaking Russian, right?
- Yes, that's actual Russian.</i>

35
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,714
<i>Although maybe not in Russia itself,
probably be something else.</i>

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:14,051
<i>- And here it is.
- Oh, my God! What is that?</i>

37
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,930
<i>Here's our big reveal of our magnet ship,</i>

38
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:22,768
<i>which was designed by Eric Guillon
to look like a giant magnet.</i>

39
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,398
<i>We even colored it like a big cartoon magnet.
It's red and silver.</i>

40
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,527
<i>But in this sequence,</i>

41
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,281
<i>it was just slightly different
than the one from the first</i> Despicable Me.

42
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,867
<i>We went for more of an action tone.</i>

43
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,830
<i>Also hoping to find some bits of comedy.</i>

44
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:47,501
<i>But truly it's more like, as Pierre said before,
just a sense of scale and action.</i>

45
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>Again, try to build some mystery as to
who could be behind this masterful heist.</i>

46
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,638
<i>I've got nothing to say about this shot.</i>

47
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,682
<i>I tried to find something intelligent,
but I can't.</i>

48
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,769
<i>Yeah, that's right. It's extremely tasteful.</i>

49
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:09,815
<i>But anyway, here, just sort of
setting up the</i> Despicable Me <i>world,</i>

50
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,944
<i>trying to punctuate with comedy
even in an action scene.</i>

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,282
<i>And then we come and...</i>

52
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:22,870
<i>This was one of the main concepts of the
movie, which was the Anti-Villain League,</i>

53
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>who, much like as we always talk
about</i> Terminator 2,

54
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,711
<i>what could we do with Gru in a second film?</i>

55
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,340
<i>And it seemed pretty clear that he
wasn't a villain by the end of the first movie.</i>

56
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,760
<i>So we thought maybe it'd be fun
to have him recruited by the good guys.</i>

57
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,431
<i>But before we get to that, we wanted to see
what Gru's doing with his kids.</i>

58
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:49,146
<i>Here in this scene, we see him prepping
to try to put together the perfect...</i>

59
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,108
<i>I guess it's six, right?
Agnes is turning six, is what we figured.</i>

60
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,235
<i>- Yeah.
- A 6-year-old birthday party.</i>

61
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,612
<i>It's a good opportunity
to sort of reintroduce all the characters.</i>

62
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,531
<i>Here's Edith dressed as a ninja.</i>

63
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,575
<i>I think originally,
didn't we say Batman, I think?</i>

64
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,828
<i>Yeah, a pink Batman.</i>

65
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,705
<i>But we weren't sure if we'd get the rights.</i>

66
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>We're like, "Let's try a ninja.
It's public domain."</i>

67
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,586
<i>Actually, in a lot of ways,
it felt more appropriate for Edith.</i>

68
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,717
<i>Yeah. We did try to find some little
evolutions, obviously, for all the girls.</i>

69
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,512
<i>We knew that we didn't want them to be</i>

70
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,099
<i>five years older than the first one
or four years older.</i>

71
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,935
<i>So we tried to find those little differences</i>

72
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,231
<i>that made these characters
a little bit different from the first movie.</i>

73
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,984
<i>So, there they are, the minions.</i>

74
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:39,738
<i>I just want to mention, this is one of
the funny things with these characters</i>

75
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,576
<i>as they've evolved across the two movies
and a couple of shorts.</i>

76
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,622
<i>Originally, our concept was
they would never appear in the daylight.</i>

77
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,793
<i>Or if they did, in other words,
outside of Gru's underground lab,</i>

78
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,212
<i>they always had to be disguised.</i>

79
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,467
<i>Which, in this movie, gave us
an opportunity for a lot of disguises.</i>

80
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,887
<i>But I think there is one scene, actually,</i>

81
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,056
<i>if they are noticed by anyone,
it's only children.</i>

82
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,601
<i>So, anyway,
those are just a couple of little things.</i>

83
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,688
<i>You find as you do these things and
you create more stories for these characters,</i>

84
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,149
<i>you sort of have to bend or break your rules
as you go.</i>

85
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,734
<i>Break almost.</i>

86
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,654
<i>We try to be subtle about breaking,
but sometimes we were not.</i>

87
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,492
<i>So, in this moment, Gru's found out</i>

88
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,996
<i>that his entertainment he's booked
for the party is not gonna show.</i>

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,668
<i>For us, this was a great opportunity
to show the lengths that he's gone to</i>

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,004
<i>to make sure
that his daughters have a great life.</i>

91
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,258
<i>In other words, what he'll do as a father
to ensure their happiness.</i>

92
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,345
<i>And in our initial conversations
about this scene,</i>

93
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,931
<i>I have to admit
there's some autobiographical elements,</i>

94
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:51,268
<i>since my wife has asked me to appear
as a shark, Darth Vader.</i>

95
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,230
<i>- And a fairy princess?
- Not a fairy princess.</i>

96
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,856
<i>I had been something pink, though.</i>

97
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,277
<i>Some kind of creature that was
in some TV show. I don't remember now.</i>

98
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:05,449
<i>- Have you ever dressed up as a woman?
- No. I haven't had to go that far.</i>

99
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,743
<i>But anyway, Gru has.</i>

100
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,706
<i>That's a nice indication of how far
he'll go to make sure Agnes has a great day.</i>

101
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,545
<i>Just to come back to Gru,
Gru is a great character in the sense</i>

102
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:23,259
<i>that since he thinks himself
as being sort of mean</i>

103
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,178
<i>and really dominant about things,</i>

104
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,432
<i>it's always cool showing these characters
in very demeaning situations.</i>

105
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,686
<i>Like dressed up
as this fairy princess right now.</i>

106
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:40,317
<i>I think when Pierre and I and the writers,
and Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy</i>

107
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,571
<i>and all of us sort of talk about this character,</i>

108
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:48,075
<i>there's a lot of elements
that I think do come from our lives.</i>

109
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:53,038
<i>I always say in some ways, Gru right here
is a good example, is about bad parenting,</i>

110
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:57,876
<i>which I think a lot of people can relate to,
some of those choices you make</i>

111
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>in the heat of the moment that
you maybe regret or wish you'd done better.</i>

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,093
<i>But in the end,
hopefully your kids still love you.</i>

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,184
I know it's really you, Gru.
I'm just pretending for the other kids.

114
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:23,110
<i>Anyway, one of our early conversations
was about how to keep Gru Gru,</i>

115
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,364
<i>now if he's more of a dad
and eventually working for the good guys.</i>

116
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,953
<i>And this character was... Not this one.
The one before, Jillian, his neighbor.</i>

117
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,956
<i>Was a good opportunity
to sort of let Gru be Gru.</i>

118
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,752
<i>That's what we did, is set up
other characters, you'll see some later,</i>

119
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:44,214
<i>that he can react to, that kept him true
to who we established in the first film.</i>

120
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,467
No, Jills, that is not happening.

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,595
<i>In the previous shot, you saw
some background animation that we love.</i>

122
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,307
<i>Like stuff that doesn't really
come in front of the foreground action.</i>

123
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,853
<i>A lot of things happen in the background
that are really funny sometimes,</i>

124
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,731
<i>so we'll try pointing those out.</i>

125
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,069
<i>Yeah, especially with some of
the minion scenes that are coming up.</i>

126
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,112
<i>You'll see what Pierre
and the animation team,</i>

127
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,199
<i>they always put a lot of good stuff there.</i>

128
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,497
<i>We saw Kyle, the dog, earlier,</i>

129
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,252
<i>and this is where we start to establish
our new character, Lucy Wilde,</i>

130
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,047
<i>played by Kristen Wiig,</i>

131
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,676
<i>who eventually through the film,
she's sent to recruit Gru,</i>

132
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,554
<i>but she also becomes his love interest
later in the film.</i>

133
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:37,643
<i>Again, this is the prime example
of romantic comedy dynamics,</i>

134
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,728
<i>where these two characters at first,</i>

135
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,690
<i>certainly their personalities
don't seem like they're going to mesh at all.</i>

136
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,276
<i>Lucy's very bright and optimistic.</i>

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,698
<i>In fact, her design is based on a sketch
from Eric Guillon.</i>

138
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:56,036
<i>He did this great drawing of her
almost like a shaft of sunlight</i>

139
00:08:56,245 --> 00:09:01,333
<i>surrounded by all these dark villains.
Really that became the basis of her character.</i>

140
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,254
<i>Do you want to talk about that
as the animation test?</i>

141
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:10,509
<i>Yeah. When I read that line of description
in the script,</i>

142
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,929
<i>I thought it was a great animation test to do.</i>

143
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,559
<i>Like how would Lucy try to put Gru
into the trunk of a car?</i>

144
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,895
<i>We did, I think, a test
that lasted maybe a minute long</i>

145
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>where Gru was really tortured
very slowly, painfully,</i>

146
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,778
<i>just to get him into that trunk.</i>

147
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,491
<i>Obviously, that didn't make it into the movie,
but we kept the essence of it.</i>

148
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,329
<i>And very often what happens
as the movie is developed</i>

149
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:44,209
<i>is we start with the script
from Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio,</i>

150
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:48,255
<i>but there's also animation work
being done simultaneously,</i>

151
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:54,470
<i>which very often also becomes a big part
of the scenes, certainly the characters,</i>

152
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:59,349
<i>so the movie sort of develops
in parallel paths</i>

153
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,394
<i>in both script and character animation.</i>

154
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,272
<i>That sort of enriches itself at every level also.</i>

155
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,275
<i>It's very evolutionary.
We were talking about that as we came over,</i>

156
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,570
<i>from the script
to the storyboards to animation.</i>

157
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,364
<i>And sometimes something early,
like an animation test,</i>

158
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,283
<i>which is done very early in the process,</i>

159
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,787
<i>becomes part of the scene
or informs the scene,</i>

160
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,163
<i>defines it in a lot of ways.</i>

161
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,082
<i>And sometimes leads also to a whole plot.</i>

162
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,543
<i>I mean, with the minion thing.
Do you remember?</i>

163
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,295
<i>Yes.</i>

164
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,344
<i>In the first movie, we had talked about
trying to develop a minion subplot,</i>

165
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,973
<i>but for various narrative reasons,
we had difficulty making that work.</i>

166
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,394
<i>But we knew in this one that was something
that we really wanted to try to create,</i>

167
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:49,191
<i>that they were more of a driver
in the storytelling itself.</i>

168
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,238
<i>So this is a moment...</i>

169
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,533
<i>This is Pierre being right.</i>

170
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,913
<i>We had a few conversations
about Lucy's car.</i>

171
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,834
<i>I think one cool thing
about the car is it feels,</i>

172
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:11,088
<i>for lack of a better word, very European
and very sort of period.</i>

173
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,550
<i>And I think this was Eric's first design,
which Pierre really liked,</i>

174
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,345
<i>and I remember we did some investigations
on other kinds of cars,</i>

175
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,642
<i>more big SUV,
more of what would be typical, I guess,</i>

176
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,727
<i>for a secret agent to be driving.</i>

177
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,606
<i>But this one just had such appeal,
and frankly, it was very unique.</i>

178
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,777
<i>And I think even,
you'll hear in Heitor's composition,</i>

179
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,988
<i>this is Lucy's theme you're hearing here.</i>

180
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,366
<i>Her theme also has
an old world feel to it, too.</i>

181
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,369
<i>It has a Henry Mancini quality.</i>

182
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,665
<i>So anyway, these elements
came together nicely for this character.</i>

183
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,133
<i>What's that?</i>

184
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,386
<i>- I think it's a huge shark.
- That's right.</i>

185
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,180
<i>That was the implication
in the storyboards, that it was a huge shark,</i>

186
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,974
<i>but no, it's a sub.</i>

187
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,393
<i>I don't think we fooled anyone with that.</i>

188
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,437
<i>I guess you're right.</i>

189
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,065
<i>It's easier to fool people
with storyboards than actual rendering.</i>

190
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,027
<i>"Yeah, it looked like
a huge shark in the shadow."</i>

191
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,737
<i>Looks like a sub.</i>

192
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,242
<i>Still works, though, just because
you've got a sense of discovery and scale.</i>

193
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,912
<i>One of my favorite
little design things in this set</i>

194
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:29,166
<i>is that the windows
of the submarine spell out AVL,</i>

195
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>which we realized if you're outside
the submarine, it would be backwards.</i>

196
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>So, it only works from the inside.</i>

197
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,423
<i>Works for the crew.</i>

198
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,344
<i>That's right, the crew, everyone else outside
has no idea who they are.</i>

199
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:46,433
<i>So this is another new character,
Silas Ramsbottom, played by Steve Coogan,</i>

200
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,020
<i>in an M type character
from the James Bond films.</i>

201
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,191
<i>And he did a great job.</i>

202
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,443
<i>Steve came in
with a couple of ideas for voices,</i>

203
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,948
<i>and this one was instantly
the one that we both liked, Pierre and I.</i>

204
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,119
<i>It's just a classic stuffy Englishman, I guess.</i>

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,789
<i>Do you remember the butler?</i>

206
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,166
<i>Yes, I remember the butler.</i>

207
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>He was the guy in the bathrooms
and in the gym.</i>

208
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,047
<i>Remember we also were doing a little,
not a subplot with him,</i>

209
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,967
<i>but remember we were
having some ideas with the butler?</i>

210
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,135
<i>In early days? Yeah.</i>

211
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,680
<i>- He was supposed to be everywhere, right?
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.</i>

212
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,724
<i>He was always gonna be with Silas,
was the idea.</i>

213
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,938
<i>So there's a lot of ideas as we develop
the movies that we discuss,</i>

214
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,856
<i>and a lot of them we throw out.</i>

215
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,441
<i>Yeah, yeah. But it's actually good.</i>

216
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:40,237
<i>We found those little secondary ideas,</i>

217
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,824
<i>like the butler following Silas around.</i>

218
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,452
<i>We managed to do that,
I think, with the minions,</i>

219
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,497
<i>with the minion jar,
the one that gets the jar stuck on his head.</i>

220
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,459
<i>You'll find him over the movie
up until the very end.</i>

221
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,295
<i>So sometimes we manage stuff,
sometimes we fail.</i>

222
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,755
<i>Yeah.</i>

223
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,091
<i>But also sometimes we just say
that it's not worth it.</i>

224
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,051
<i>Exactly, it's not worth pursuing.</i>

225
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,679
<i>A little Easter egg here.</i>

226
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:10,517
<i>Yes. The two scientists have
the nametags of our names,</i>

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>Coffin and Renaud.</i>

228
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,188
<i>Pierre is the tall, slim one.
I'm the short, fat one.</i>

229
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,067
<i>I am not sure that was our decision, actually.
It's the guy from...</i>

230
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:23,613
<i>It's sort of accurate.
I take a little bit of offense, but...</i>

231
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,158
<i>Well, I'm the one that gets killed.</i>

232
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,535
<i>That's true. I guess it evens out.</i>

233
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:35,459
<i>So that is the demonstration of
what we call PX-41, which was...</i>

234
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,879
<i>When we had the earliest conversations
about the movie, we're trying to figure out,</i>

235
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,300
<i>okay, what's the narrative story
that is going to drive the action,</i>

236
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,636
<i>and trying to come up with
what was an idea that would be on par</i>

237
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,848
<i>with Gru's theft of the moon.</i>

238
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,936
<i>So, it was hard to come up with something
that would rival that in scale,</i>

239
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,064
<i>so instead of looking externally
to something else,</i>

240
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,275
<i>like the Eiffel Tower or Mount Rushmore,</i>

241
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,863
<i>we looked internally
and started looking at the minions.</i>

242
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,909
<i>And when we started the conversation,
we were thinking</i>

243
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:13,914
<i>that maybe somebody broke into Gru's lab
and stole his minion-making machine.</i>

244
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,416
<i>And we had some funny sketches
based on that.</i>

245
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,627
<i>- But then it sort of evolved from there.
- Yeah.</i>

246
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,171
<i>I'm sorry, I wasn't following.</i>

247
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,174
<i>Here, Pierre is just watching the movie.</i>

248
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,259
<i>It looks really good.</i>

249
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,430
Attitude! That's right!

250
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>So anyway, from there we started talking
about the idea of our minions,</i>

251
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,815
<i>the yellow minions themselves
being minion-napped</i>

252
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:44,611
<i>and leading to something involving
this chemical PX-41,</i>

253
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,655
<i>which is obviously something
like a werewolf,</i>

254
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,658
<i>some sort of transformation, Incredible Hulk.</i>

255
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,034
<i>You want to talk about the...</i>

256
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:55,872
<i>I was just thinking about you telling
about a machine that makes minions.</i>

257
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,667
<i>We had this idea, actually, from the first</i> DM

258
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,211
<i>to explain where these guys came from.</i>

259
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,257
<i>And then we veered away from it,
then for</i> DM 2, <i>I think Eric Guillon,</i>

260
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,217
<i>the designer of the movie,
came up with the idea</i>

261
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,387
<i>that they all came from
the yellows of the eggs.</i>

262
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,055
<i>- Remember that machine?
- Yes.</i>

263
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,977
<i>It was a huge machine that would break
one egg, and then takes just the yellow out</i>

264
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,062
<i>and then makes a minion out of it eventually.</i>

265
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,523
<i>And we dropped that idea, and then...</i>

266
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,484
<i>Because I don't know
if it's unconscious or anything,</i>

267
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:28,613
<i>but it felt like maybe we were breaking
the mythology of the minions.</i>

268
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>We felt we were giving too much information.</i>

269
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,328
<i>Where do they come from?</i>

270
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,039
<i>And the idea was somebody
would take that machine and then...</i>

271
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,250
<i>There, you were gonna mention
those drawings.</i>

272
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,295
<i>Pierre's son did those drawings.</i>

273
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,007
<i>So, the idea that this machine would be taken</i>

274
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,594
<i>and somebody would reprogram it
and create evil minions.</i>

275
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,390
<i>But again, it's like we were talking,
that idea is where it started,</i>

276
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,977
<i>and then it evolved into
what became the narrative driver here,</i>

277
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,648
<i>where we were talking about things,
like</i> Hellboy's <i>Golden Army,</i>

278
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,484
<i>like the desire to create the evil army.</i>

279
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:12,115
<i>And that became our driver
for villain versus the theft of the moon.</i>

280
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,702
<i>I don't know if you remember
all these drawings that Eric had done.</i>

281
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,954
<i>We were supposed
to come in inside the movie,</i>

282
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>Gru was trying to find a job, I think,</i>

283
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:25,712
<i>and then the minions were actually sent off
to do other work</i>

284
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,714
<i>just because Gru didn't have
any work for them.</i>

285
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,759
<i>So you'd see them
working over at Santa Claus,</i>

286
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:35,138
<i>working over at
a hamburger stand or whatever.</i>

287
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:40,310
<i>And you'd see them, a few hundred of them
on a deserted island.</i>

288
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,355
<i>And it's funny to see that,
now in the movie, we've kept...</i>

289
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:47,400
<i>Yes, we've kept elements 'cause Pierre
and I, some of our early conversations</i>

290
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,363
<i>were like if Gru's not a villain anymore,
where are the minions, what are they doing?</i>

291
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,906
<i>Have they left? Are they there?</i>

292
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,451
<i>You sort of start having these conversations
theoretically about,</i>

293
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,578
<i>what would be fun to see?</i>

294
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,747
<i>And in fact, some of those early sketches,</i>

295
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>we see Dr. Nefario showing up trying
to get the minions to come back home.</i>

296
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,671
<i>So that was some early ideas
that we had discussed.</i>

297
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:13,218
<i>I think, for me, I really like this scene,</i>

298
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,512
<i>'cause I think it defines a lot about parenting.</i>

299
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:20,892
<i>I think Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, again,
they did a great job writing the scenes,</i>

300
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,604
<i>establishing the daughter who's growing up</i>

301
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,147
<i>and the one who's still young and innocent.</i>

302
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,942
<i>And then when
we were recording Steve Carell,</i>

303
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>he threw in this line, "Never get older."</i>

304
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,699
<i>And for me that just so defined the moment.</i>

305
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,534
<i>It was a great way to end that scene.</i>

306
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,371
<i>Got to be stuff in
the background here, Pierre.</i>

307
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,751
<i>Plenty of back stuff. If you look closely
at the left, guys over there,</i>

308
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,462
<i>the one with the hammer
just hit that other guy.</i>

309
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,883
<i>Then you've got this whole little story
happening in the background left</i>

310
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,594
<i>that's totally independent
of what's happening in the foreground.</i>

311
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,557
<i>We love that, those elements,
just trying to bring it back to life.</i>

312
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,727
<i>Mouth-to-mouth, and then eventually...</i>

313
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,442
<i>We got those all over the place,
we love those.</i>

314
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:16,072
<i>And I think this scene, the jelly-making,
when I talked to the story artists,</i>

315
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,452
<i>I was thinking of a Warner Bros. cartoon
called</i> Hillbilly Hare,

316
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,995
<i>which is one of my favorites.</i>

317
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,788
<i>And where Bugs Bunny
sings a square dance,</i>

318
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,624
<i>and these guys get caught
in a hay baling machine.</i>

319
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,544
<i>So, originally we had
the whole minion in the jar,</i>

320
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,881
<i>but we got to the point that didn't feel
like that was gonna work,</i>

321
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,549
<i>so we just put his head in there.</i>

322
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,426
<i>And then that was
the one that Pierre was mentioning,</i>

323
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,180
<i>- you see him throughout the movie.
- Yeah.</i>

324
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,516
<i>We should have ended his arc, actually,
break the jar at the very end.</i>

325
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,103
<i>I know, that's true, we didn't.
He is an evil minion, though, he gets that far.</i>

326
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,106
<i>And you recognize him just because
he's got this jar on his head.</i>

327
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,776
<i>That would have been funny.
Someone with a hammer...</i>

328
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,236
<i>But I tried to find a place
where maybe we could hit,</i>

329
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,406
<i>have him get rid of that jar
ultimately at the end</i>

330
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,786
<i>and then have some sort of thing happening,
he gets another thing stuck.</i>

331
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,996
<i>Exactly. Exactly.</i>

332
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:10,835
<i>So, here is where we find
what Gru is doing now,</i>

333
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,962
<i>as far as his employment.</i>

334
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:19,260
<i>He's working to convert his lab equipment
to something useful,</i>

335
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,430
<i>in this case building a jelly factory.</i>

336
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,768
<i>Unfortunately, his employees, especially
Dr. Nefario here, aren't very good at it.</i>

337
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,979
<i>So, even though Gru is very hopeful,</i>

338
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,316
<i>Dr. Nefario in this scene
announces he's going to leave.</i>

339
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,821
<i>So, it was just kind of a fun opportunity,
even the stuff we saw as we talked about</i>

340
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:42,826
<i>the Lucille Ball show, with them
and the grapes with the minions up top</i>

341
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:48,665
<i>stomping on various fruits, and Pierre
had the idea of the Chiquita banana thing.</i>

342
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,211
<i>So, just a great opportunity to take what
we'd established in the first film</i>

343
00:20:53,503 --> 00:21:00,385
<i>and repurpose it in a kind of a funny way
with the jelly manufacturing.</i>

344
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,221
Bigger lab, more evil,

345
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,140
full dental.

346
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:11,896
<i>Again, here we see
Dr. Nefario getting ready to leave, so...</i>

347
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,526
<i>And this was kind of a pivotal moment,
'cause we wanted it just a little bit like...</i>

348
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:22,031
<i>Basically the idea here was, why would Gru
decide to go work for the good guys?</i>

349
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:26,327
<i>And essentially, it's because his new
business... I should be quiet here, I guess.</i>

350
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,248
<i>Yeah, it's your gag. It's your joke.</i>

351
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,292
<i>That's Chris Renaud's joke.</i>

352
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,670
<i>It's Cinco Paul, actually, who
wrote the original version of that, but...</i>

353
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,548
<i>- But you fought to keep it inside the movie.
- Yes, I fought.</i>

354
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>I fought and storyboarded the original
version, so I'm in there somewhere.</i>

355
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,725
<i>Anyway, we needed Gru
to have a reason to accept their offer.</i>

356
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,393
<i>There he goes.</i>

357
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,313
<i>I should point out in that animation,
that wide shot,</i>

358
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,273
<i>you've gotta watch that minion there,</i>

359
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,151
<i>'cause he actually does fart in the last one,
it's the best.</i>

360
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,444
<i>- Twenty-second?
- It's the best.</i>

361
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,154
<i>Yeah, it's probably hard to see on a TV,</i>

362
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,114
<i>but on a movie screen,
it's big enough that you can see it.</i>

363
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,370
<i>So anyway, we needed Gru to really have
everything fail so he'd accept their offer.</i>

364
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,542
<i>So, this is a little like
what we had in the first movie,</i>

365
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,211
<i>where you basically say, "Let's go."</i>

366
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,087
<i>And then, didn't go that far.</i>

367
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:27,096
<i>If we revisited jokes from the first film,
we tried to do what you just saw,</i>

368
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,974
<i>which is put a new spin on it versus...</i>

369
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,521
<i>It can be tempting to do that, but we really
tried to make this feel like its own movie.</i>

370
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,649
<i>And we didn't really do it
that many times, I think.</i>

371
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,028
<i>Now, that shadow, that actually is Dr. Nefario
who's casting that shadow.</i>

372
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,905
<i>Yeah, 'cause we had debates about it.</i>

373
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,699
<i>You'll see later,
you'll meet a character named El Macho,</i>

374
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,954
<i>but the actual model that's casting
that shadow is Dr. Nefario.</i>

375
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,541
<i>So, here is our first minion-napping,</i>

376
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,876
<i>and we talked about how they should evolve,</i>

377
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,920
<i>'cause this one we wanted
to be very low-tech,</i>

378
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,507
<i>like basically the classic,
somebody getting...</i>

379
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,175
<i>- Knocking at the door.
- Yeah, right, right, right.</i>

380
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,802
<i>Very low, exactly.</i>

381
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,138
<i>And then from there, they sort of
get more and more sophisticated.</i>

382
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:16,145
<i>- I like the little touch at the end.
- Exactly! Still at work.</i>

383
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,066
Are you sure we should be doing this?

384
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,488
<i>So, coming into this scene,
we wanted to start to establish Gru's</i>

385
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,449
<i>resistance to dating,</i>

386
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,995
<i>and although we saw that
in the flashback earlier,</i>

387
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,791
<i>but sort of the girls
trying to drive it a little bit.</i>

388
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,335
Bruce Willis.

389
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,170
<i>Who else did we have there?
Vin Diesel, I think.</i>

390
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,839
<i>- Vin Diesel, yeah.
- Channing Tatum.</i>

391
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,424
<i>- Channing Tatum, yeah.
- At one point.</i>

392
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,927
Okay, what are you doing?

393
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,887
We're signing you up for online dating!

394
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:55,852
<i>Coming into this scene, we knew
we wanted Gru to announce to the girls</i>

395
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:00,940
<i>the fact that he's changing jobs, and he's
gonna be a spy and try to save the world.</i>

396
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,192
Now for the announcement.

397
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,696
<i>I think originally in this scene,
we even had Gru's mom.</i>

398
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,989
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

399
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,200
<i>But we felt, for this movie,</i>

400
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:15,079
<i>it gets tricky with sequels because
there's a lot of characters to service.</i>

401
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:20,126
<i>So you end up making the decision
where to put your energy,</i>

402
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,045
<i>for lack of a better word.</i>

403
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,882
<i>Because again, we have Lucy in this one,
we have Silas,</i>

404
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:30,178
<i>and so with all the new characters,
we had to make some decisions</i>

405
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,389
<i>about how to get through these scenes.
Here we go.</i>

406
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,395
<i>- Yeah.
- There's nothing to say about that.</i>

407
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,565
<i>- Indian food, the best.
- That's right.</i>

408
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,568
<i>That's right, listen,
for all the different food types</i>

409
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,112
<i>that are mentioned by the minions.</i>

410
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,532
<i>It's a whole language.</i>

411
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,582
<i>That's a gag that evolved from story.</i>

412
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:04,253
<i>It's funny how, again, the costumes
were started by a story artist,</i>

413
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,881
<i>a guy named Mark O'Hare at his storyboards.</i>

414
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,928
<i>And then that gag came from animation
and Pierre, where the dress gets caught,</i>

415
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,556
<i>and then it informed the scene before, so...</i>

416
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:21,521
<i>Again, it's all very evolutionary,
the whole process.</i>

417
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,025
<i>- And sometimes not very linear in that case.
- No, it isn't. Exactly.</i>

418
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,112
<i>They started by doing
that last sequence and then...</i>

419
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:35,201
<i>So, anyways, coming into this scene,
we tried to think of, where's the place</i>

420
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,662
<i>that Gru would like to work the least?</i>

421
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,707
<i>In a shopping mall, and a cupcake store</i>

422
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,503
<i>just felt like it was completely the opposite
of Gru, all pink and...</i>

423
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,006
<i>And so that's where
we set them up for surveillance.</i>

424
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,970
<i>And here he's surprised to find out
that he's being paired with Lucy.</i>

425
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:01,060
<i>That's the kind of thing that Kristen Wiig
would just throw in, and you just can't help</i>

426
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:06,441
<i>but love that kind of contrast in a character
and performance, both vocal and animated.</i>

427
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,859
I'll let you get it.

428
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,696
<i>Well, that's typically
the case where the contrast</i>

429
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,907
<i>actually helps the animation
just because you can enhance it,</i>

430
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,034
<i>so it becomes visual.</i>

431
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,248
<i>And this is a funny line from the guys,
from the writers,</i>

432
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,876
<i>and then Kristen took it
just singing that last part,</i>

433
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:31,507
<i>just really again informed what we could do,
and right there she dances offstage.</i>

434
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,218
It seems that
because of your checkered past,

435
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,012
everyone else refused to work with you.

436
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,431
<i>I love that little moment
that's about to come up.</i>

437
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,515
<i>Yes.</i>

438
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:44,604
<i>Yeah, this was something that...
I think we actually had it...</i>

439
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,858
<i>We have a little bit of it with Agnes later,
but remember we actually were gonna do</i>

440
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,236
<i>direct call backs to this fantasy
with Agnes and Gru.</i>

441
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,364
<i>Exactly, and this guy, Dave, was supposed to</i>

442
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,825
<i>- be in love with Lucy throughout the movie.
- Yes.</i>

443
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:02,079
<i>Yeah, we had that little moment
where he's giving her a rose.</i>

444
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:07,335
<i>Anyway, so what happened was, again,
it was a funny idea,</i>

445
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:11,130
<i>when Lucy first sees her...
I'm sorry, when Agnes first sees her,</i>

446
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,883
<i>she has a fantasy moment,
and then Gru towards the end of the movie</i>

447
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:14,967
<i>also has a fantasy moment.</i>

448
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,054
<i>The problem was that
Dave's was just the best,</i>

449
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,307
<i>so they didn't feel like an escalation,
so we sort of left...</i>

450
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,145
<i>Although we do have a little hint of it
when Agnes first meets Lucy later in the film.</i>

451
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,105
<i>We just kept it to Dave.</i>

452
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,777
<i>There's Pierre's
heart-shaped firework right there.</i>

453
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,404
Earth to Dave!

454
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,075
<i>That's one of my favorite shots
right there, personally.</i>

455
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,874
<i>So, we get into the surveillance
of the different...</i>

456
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,878
<i>And we had to sort of set up
what characters could...</i>

457
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,923
<i>We had this idea one time, remember?
Like a rogue's gallery in the mall.</i>

458
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,884
<i>- Literally like...
- Everyone was a bad guy.</i>

459
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,095
<i>Everyone sort of looked like a bad guy.</i>

460
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,683
<i>So, it was, again,
just a rogue's gallery of villains,</i>

461
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,643
<i>that each one ran a mall store.</i>

462
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,521
<i>But it just felt a little too unreal,</i>

463
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:14,193
<i>so we went the direction of Gru's dismissive,
until this guy walks in,</i>

464
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,905
<i>Eduardo, played by Benjamin Bratt.</i>

465
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,243
<i>A very gregarious guy, a restaurateur,</i>

466
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,330
<i>who comes and welcomes
Gru and Lucy to the mall.</i>

467
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:32,253
<i>And we see his necklace there,
which is an abstract "E" for Eduardo.</i>

468
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,131
<i>Which becomes important later
when it gets rotated.</i>

469
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,092
<i>90 degrees and becomes an "M,"
like El Macho.</i>

470
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,720
<i>It's very, very important.</i>

471
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,723
<i>Yes, a tiny detail.</i>

472
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,808
<i>That gag.</i>

473
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,311
<i>We had a couple of versions of that one.</i>

474
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,731
<i>And the best one was actually
when it was on the belly,</i>

475
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,610
<i>but some people wouldn't allow us to do it.</i>

476
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,281
<i>So, this guy, we were thinking,</i>

477
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,993
<i>he's so much similar to Gru
in a lot of ways in that</i>

478
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,916
<i>he's maybe retired from villainy,
we'll find out later that he's also a father.</i>

479
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,921
<i>But in this moment,
Gru thinks he recognizes him</i>

480
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:18,174
<i>as being a villain
from the past named El Macho.</i>

481
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,802
That guy looks exactly like...

482
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:25,848
<i>And in fact, it's funny
when we started with Eduardo,</i>

483
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,600
<i>he kind of looked like El Macho.</i>

484
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,728
<i>He looked like this, big and strong,</i>

485
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,816
<i>and we kind of realized, as much
as we liked the look of the character,</i>

486
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:41,322
<i>it sort of stretched believability</i>

487
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,950
<i>that he'd look basically exactly the same,</i>

488
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,287
<i>but with shorter hair
and nobody would recognize him,</i>

489
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,958
<i>so we really went the route
that he's a guy past his prime,</i>

490
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,836
<i>obviously made him fatter,
almost appearing shorter in a lot of ways.</i>

491
00:29:55,962 --> 00:30:00,007
<i>In fact, we had to work that out.
Yeah, he's probably a bit of a cheat there.</i>

492
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:03,803
<i>And so, beyond the costume,
we really changed him physically</i>

493
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,931
<i>to sell the idea
that you may not recognize him.</i>

494
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,477
<i>It feels like we're killing a lot of animals
in this movie.</i>

495
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,229
<i>- We just killed a bird, now a shark.
- Yeah. That's true.</i>

496
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,232
<i>Comedically, though, comedically.
Always with love.</i>

497
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,235
<i>- We kill people with a smile.
- That's right.</i>

498
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,322
<i>That was a very Warner Bros. moment.</i>

499
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,825
<i>- Completely silly.
- Over the top.</i>

500
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,787
Looney Tunes, <i>I should say, I guess.</i>

501
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,040
...was a pile of singed chest hair.

502
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,752
But that face! It has got to be El Macho!

503
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,007
<i>I remember when we did this,
we restructured this scene a bit,</i>

504
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,883
<i>and it actually worked really nicely</i>

505
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,220
<i>where we end it
on Gru really being determined</i>

506
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,890
<i>to follow through on his conviction.</i>

507
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,603
<i>And originally we had
a nose-picking joke there, but a butt scratch.</i>

508
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,732
<i>- Which I think is better, actually.
- I think it is better.</i>

509
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,859
<i>It's weird, though,
that we would get criticized</i>

510
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,862
<i>for a nose pick and not an ass scratch.</i>

511
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,699
<i>I don't know.
I guess there's something slightly less gross.</i>

512
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,785
<i>It is weird, though.</i>

513
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,579
But you said you'd help me practice...

514
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,205
<i>This is one of those moments for me.</i>

515
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,042
<i>I love the way
Gru actually throws Edith into bed.</i>

516
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,210
<i>And even his reaction here.</i>

517
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,713
<i>What I like about it is it feels very real.
You know what I mean?</i>

518
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,216
<i>You're trying to get the kids to bed,
somebody's like, "I got to practice this."</i>

519
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,222
<i>You're like, "Come on," versus
sort of maybe more happy about it.</i>

520
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,474
That was something else.

521
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:37,480
<i>Yeah. What's great about Gru is that
even when he pretends, he can't.</i>

522
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,649
<i>Yeah. Exactly. He's very authentic.</i>

523
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,027
Okay.

524
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,738
<i>And that was one.
We played with different versions of the line.</i>

525
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,493
<i>But truthfully, Carell just made it so funny.
"Zombie." It just really works.</i>

526
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:55,998
<i>Okay, so how do we set up everybody?</i>

527
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:59,919
<i>Here, we were playing with the idea</i>

528
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:05,591
<i>of Agnes missing the fact that she has a mom
without making Gru feel bad.</i>

529
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,219
<i>That was the tricky balance,</i>

530
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,846
<i>that she just felt a little left out</i>

531
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:16,435
<i>because she was unsure about participating
in this Mother's Day program at school.</i>

532
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,356
<i>So Gru gives her a little bit of a pep talk here.</i>

533
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,861
<i>- Now we break the emotional moment.
- Completely!</i>

534
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,782
<i>A little of the evolution on this.</i>

535
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:35,121
<i>Originally, we'd started with just a handful
of minions at the bar downstairs.</i>

536
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:38,374
<i>Gru comes in, and they're having ice cream,
and it's a very sort of quiet moment,</i>

537
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,795
<i>he gets them
to accompany him on his mission.</i>

538
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,299
<i>- But...
- But... Take it from there, Pierre.</i>

539
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,888
<i>But I just didn't want to have
another small scene with the minions.</i>

540
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,937
<i>We found this song existing,
it's called</i> Yet Another Irish Drinking Song,

541
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,314
<i>- I think from Da Vinci's Notebook.
- Yeah.</i>

542
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,317
<i>Little group. I love this song.</i>

543
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,321
<i>So we thought it could be hilarious</i>

544
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,159
<i>having those guys, instead of drinking
obviously, having ice cream,</i>

545
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,369
<i>singing that drinking song.</i>

546
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:20,583
<i>We really play it that way,
even with their heads underneath the taps.</i>

547
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,918
<i>- Yeah.
- Just have fun with it.</i>

548
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,338
<i>- Everybody's half sick in the background.
- That's right.</i>

549
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,091
<i>- That's you singing. Wait, wait.
- There I am.</i>

550
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,678
<i>- And that's me.
- Actually, believe it or not, that's still me.</i>

551
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,347
<i>- It is?
- Yeah. I re-sang your part.</i>

552
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,765
<i>Damn you!</i>

553
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:42,021
<i>That's a source of constant battling.
It's the only thing that we battle on.</i>

554
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,231
<i>I've lost consistently.</i>

555
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,276
<i>So, here's our second minion-nap,</i>

556
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:53,199
<i>which we played with making it feel
like a UFO abduction.</i>

557
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,701
<i>Also... I'm sorry. Go ahead.</i>

558
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,286
<i>I want to say this is the first scene</i>

559
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,080
<i>that actually went into animation
before the other one.</i>

560
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,582
<i>I think it is.</i>

561
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:06,545
<i>One thing we quickly discovered with the
minions is that it's hard to tell them apart.</i>

562
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:11,175
<i>- So, in this movie, it was more...
- Central?</i>

563
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,552
<i>It was also important
to track certain minions.</i>

564
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,138
<i>So the costuming
became the way we did that.</i>

565
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,433
<i>And Kevin here, to the right,
dressed as a golfer,</i>

566
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,730
<i>he's kind of the minion,
along with the French maid and one later,</i>

567
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,025
<i>that we tracked through the little subplot.</i>

568
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,111
<i>He's the first one that's going
to get transformed, I think, right?</i>

569
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:35,157
<i>He's the second. The French maid is first
and then he's second.</i>

570
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,786
<i>Then the French maid
is the last one transformed back.</i>

571
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,832
<i>So, the costumes became a way for us to
track them individually when we needed to.</i>

572
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,169
<i>Those guys are singing
the drinking song again.</i>

573
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:55,344
<i>So, here's Gru and Lucy
looking to break into Eduardo's place</i>

574
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,098
<i>to hopefully find some evidence
that he is indeed El Macho.</i>

575
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:04,520
<i>Funny thing about this, that floor
is actually not even half a meter thick.</i>

576
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,523
<i>It's actually a second story.</i>

577
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,734
<i>So they're basically
dangling down the floor below them.</i>

578
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,987
<i>Yeah. You can see their legs hanging down.</i>

579
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,196
<i>Everything is full of cheats.</i>

580
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,118
<i>It's like this, the little cord
Gru is going to trip that isn't here.</i>

581
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,453
<i>- Obviously, because...
- They'd see it.</i>

582
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,081
<i>Yeah, if you can see it, it wouldn't be fun.</i>

583
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,001
<i>And all of a sudden,
it appears when he trips over it.</i>

584
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,836
There are no booby traps.

585
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,839
Booby!

586
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:37,761
<i>We're laughing right now, but it feels like
everybody's going to notice that.</i>

587
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,056
<i>But it seemed funny to have a low tech way
to summon this...</i>

588
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,726
<i>Do you want to talk about the chicken?
Why the chicken?</i>

589
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,270
<i>Well, the chicken started
with the design of the restaurant,</i>

590
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,315
<i>because we had actual chickens
in the restaurant.</i>

591
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,900
<i>- Do you remember when we started doing it?
- Yeah.</i>

592
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,153
<i>It sort of evolved from there.</i>

593
00:35:54,236 --> 00:36:00,951
<i>I think it was Pierre who said, "Hey, what if
he had a pet chicken, Eduardo?"</i>

594
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,662
<i>So, we had live chickens
walking around the restaurant,</i>

595
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:08,208
<i>we thought, "Well, why not have one of them
be an actual guard dog? Yeah."</i>

596
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,503
<i>The scene was originally written
with a Chihuahua.</i>

597
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:17,343
<i>It just felt like we started investigating
in design and in animation this chicken.</i>

598
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,057
<i>I essentially called the two storyboard artists</i>

599
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,771
<i>and said, "Hey, what if we made that
Chihuahua a chicken? What could we do?"</i>

600
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:34,276
<i>We talked about some ideas
and this stuff with the alien homage.</i>

601
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:38,197
<i>Even where the chicken is on Gru's head</i>

602
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,658
<i>came from the storyboard artists
as we were developing the scene.</i>

603
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,951
Okay, let's go.

604
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,081
<i>There's some chicken scratches
on Gru's face that we never...</i>

605
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,708
<i>- That disappear.
- Yeah, they're gone.</i>

606
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:56,465
<i>- We use the Daffy Duck rules of cartoon.
- Yeah. We hide behind those a lot.</i>

607
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,685
<i>One thing we did with Lucy is</i>

608
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:13,148
<i>we wanted her to have just a lot of
cool technology, actually, and cool gadgets.</i>

609
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:17,403
<i>So, she had that whatever that is,
that's almost like a Spider-Man web-shooter.</i>

610
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,280
<i>The resin thing
that the chicken was encased in,</i>

611
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,492
<i>and then these goggles
that are X-ray goggles.</i>

612
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,993
<i>We wanted her to really feel like...</i>

613
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,746
<i>One of the fun things we always liked
about the Bond films were...</i>

614
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,165
<i>- The gadgets.
- The gadgets. Exactly.</i>

615
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,419
<i>But Gru, not to be outdone,
has this safe cracker here.</i>

616
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:39,591
<i>By the way, do you believe, like me,
that each time a new James Bond came out,</i>

617
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,554
<i>it got usually trashed
just because it had too much gadgets in it?</i>

618
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,473
<i>- Yeah.
- But I always thought, "Oh, man! It's cool!"</i>

619
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,684
<i>I know. I miss the gadgets.</i>

620
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,105
<i>'Cause now it seems like we went
in the opposite way, there are no gadgets.</i>

621
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,190
<i>Yeah. That's true.</i>

622
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,737
<i>So, Eduardo returns back to the restaurant
a bit early.</i>

623
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,991
<i>This scene we played with
a few different ways</i>

624
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:08,412
<i>to try to find the way
to create the most amount of tension.</i>

625
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,666
<i>So, we played with it editorially a few ways.</i>

626
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:17,129
<i>That was an idea from Janet Healy.
She threw it out in an editorial session.</i>

627
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,006
<i>One of our producers.</i>

628
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,841
<i>And it really worked.</i>

629
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:26,054
<i>So, again, from the way these things evolve,
ideas come from a lot of different places.</i>

630
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,015
My eyes!

631
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,268
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

632
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,312
<i>"Call one of your munchkins!"</i>

633
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,814
<i>- Where did that come from?
- I can't remember.</i>

634
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,234
<i>I think somebody wrote it,
but I don't remember who.</i>

635
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:42,696
<i>I actually don't remember.</i>

636
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,492
<i>So, anyway, thinking of
one of our inspirations</i>

637
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,702
<i>here was</i> The Blues Brothers, <i>actually.</i>

638
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:53,832
<i>Thinking, "Okay, what would the minions do
if they were called to come get us?"</i>

639
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,169
<i>We thought, "Well, you know what?
They'd drive right into the mall."</i>

640
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,839
<i>So that's what we played.
We played with the multiple levels.</i>

641
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,091
<i>Thank goodness
for Lucy's car being so small.</i>

642
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,843
<i>It really allowed us a lot of freedom.</i>

643
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:10,015
<i>There was a time that this scene
was much longer. Too long, one would say.</i>

644
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,101
<i>But sometimes
when we're putting these things together,</i>

645
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,730
<i>we're thinking, "Do we need more action?
Do we need more comedy?"</i>

646
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:20,442
<i>We're trying to find that balance.
We had a whole scene...</i>

647
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,529
<i>- I love this moment right here.
- Yeah.</i>

648
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:28,033
<i>We had a whole scene where El Macho
pursued them on a motorcycle.</i>

649
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,495
<i>- Shot the chicken at them.
- Yeah. I liked that, actually.</i>

650
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:37,292
<i>There was a narrative problem though,
is that El Macho couldn't recognize them.</i>

651
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:43,340
<i>It felt difficult given this long involved chase
that he wouldn't know who he was following.</i>

652
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:48,595
<i>So, that and for pacing reasons, we scaled it
way back. But it's still a lot of fun.</i>

653
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,265
<i>Love that sequence.</i>

654
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,102
<i>In this one, basically we needed an idea</i>

655
00:39:55,394 --> 00:40:00,732
<i>to make it feel like a lot of minions were
being taken versus one and two at a time,</i>

656
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,734
<i>just to create the escalation.</i>

657
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,362
<i>This is the last beat where we see
the minions being kidnapped, right?</i>

658
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,655
<i>Exactly.</i>

659
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,453
<i>So, we had basically the ice cream truck,
was the thought,</i>

660
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,748
<i>queuing off their love
of ice cream from that song,</i>

661
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,292
<i>a moment we saw earlier.</i>

662
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,087
<i>It's actually Dr. Nefario
who's animated driving the truck,</i>

663
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,215
<i>even though you can't see him in there
with the blacked-out windows.</i>

664
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,676
<i>And watch out there,
you got a little</i> Platoon <i>moment</i>

665
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,846
<i>where this big guy
is trying to sacrifice himself.</i>

666
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,681
<i>There is the jar-headed minion.</i>

667
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,437
<i>So here we wound up
settling for the last minion.</i>

668
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,273
<i>I mentioned to</i>

669
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,444
<i>our storyboard artist, Didier,
to have a little hand come down,</i>

670
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:48,405
<i>and then Pierre said,
"Why doesn't he get his tongue stuck?"</i>

671
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,741
<i>And boom!
And that's how we ended the scene.</i>

672
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:56,163
<i>Which we'll see that minion again later
with the ice cream stuck to his tongue.</i>

673
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,373
<i>Again, that's how we identified him.</i>

674
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,459
See if you can get closer.

675
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:05,130
<i>So this is a character, Floyd Eaglesan,
played by Ken Jeong, and did a great job.</i>

676
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:09,259
<i>I can't remember who he'd said.</i>

677
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:14,097
<i>One of his relatives was who he
was thinking of for a little bit for this voice.</i>

678
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,768
<i>And there was a time when we had
a bit more of the character in the film,</i>

679
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,019
<i>'cause we were...</i>

680
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,066
<i>Again, we were trying
to set up multiple threats, who could it be</i>

681
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,528
<i>that committed this crime
that we saw at the beginning of the movie?</i>

682
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,491
<i>But again, we got to the point
where we just had to reduce it</i>

683
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:36,203
<i>and keep it more focused
on Gru's relationship with Lucy</i>

684
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:39,623
<i>and the coming rivalry with Eduardo.</i>

685
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,961
<i>I remember Floyd Eaglesan
used to have this magnet</i>

686
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,964
<i>- for Gru to make the hair grow.
- That's right.</i>

687
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:51,093
<i>Gru went to get a baldness treatment.</i>

688
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,012
<i>Yeah, the magnets...
One of the reasons they suspected him</i>

689
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:57,849
<i>is because he used magnets
to try to pull hair out of your scalp.</i>

690
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,769
<i>- Anyway... That's right.
- It's true.</i>

691
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:04,189
<i>So there you see Agnes,
that's her little fantasy moment.</i>

692
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:09,778
<i>We simplified it greatly, but still it really
serves its purpose nicely,</i>

693
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,407
<i>where we see how she instantly connects.</i>

694
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,909
<i>I love that little animation moment
where she waves to Lucy.</i>

695
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,788
<i>She instantly connects to her
and sees her as a good match for Gru.</i>

696
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,873
Are you out of your gourd?

697
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,792
<i>And then goes into the classic</i>

698
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:29,339
<i>Gru and Lucy sitting in a tree,
K-I-S-S-I-N-G, or a version of that, anyway.</i>

699
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:30,841
Stop. This is a song of lies.

700
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,008
<i>And I will be the flower girl!</i>

701
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,219
I don't even like her. Now, go have fun!

702
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,221
<i>And also, a moment like this is important</i>

703
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:40,183
<i>because it gives our character Lucy
an opportunity</i>

704
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,644
<i>to see a bit softer side of Gru.</i>

705
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:47,399
<i>And so you try to find these moments
so you can build some kind of affinity</i>

706
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,608
<i>between the two characters,</i>

707
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:52,028
<i>so when eventually they get together,
it feels a bit earned.</i>

708
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,197
<i>I love this line.</i>

709
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,491
I am pretty fun.

710
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,161
<i>Every dad would like to say that, I guess.</i>

711
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,207
<i>- That scene evolved a lot also.
- Yes, it did.</i>

712
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,959
<i>We had many versions of this.</i>

713
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:12,966
<i>Trying different ideas, like what's
the best version of a coin fountain gag?</i>

714
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:16,720
<i>How do we find the girls after they left Gru?</i>

715
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:22,184
<i>So, this is another character Antonio,</i>

716
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:27,022
<i>who we find out in a bit
is actually Eduardo's son.</i>

717
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:32,736
<i>But Margo doesn't care,
this is a budding crush on her behalf.</i>

718
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,865
<i>And it's a nice moment for Miranda,</i>

719
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,871
<i>Miranda Cosgrove who plays Margo,
to have some fun with this character.</i>

720
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:47,292
<i>And I love it, too, because it's such
a great thing for Gru as a dad to react to</i>

721
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,085
<i>and be totally thrown off by.</i>

722
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,880
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

723
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:53,965
Sure.

724
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,718
I'm Margo.

725
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,515
<i>And then, the next moment,
you get an opportunity</i>

726
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,725
<i>to see how the other girls react to this,</i>

727
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:09,815
<i>where Edith wants nothing to do with it,
and a concerned Agnes.</i>

728
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,150
<i>Kind of a little thing there are the coins.</i>

729
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:15,904
<i>We animate the movie,
create the picture entirely in France,</i>

730
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:20,033
<i>and a lot of those coins, some of them
are silver and look like US money.</i>

731
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,536
<i>A lot of them are gold and look like the euro.</i>

732
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:26,164
<i>There's always little details like that.</i>

733
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:29,334
<i>So it feels like everywhere and nowhere,
although they're small, I guess.</i>

734
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:33,880
<i>We sort of based the mall actually
on the mall in Santa Monica, a little bit.</i>

735
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:38,343
<i>It doesn't have an enclosed ceiling,
but is in the round like that.</i>

736
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,886
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

737
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,805
It's about time you showed up.

738
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,598
<i>- Little James Bond reference there.
- Yes.</i>

739
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:47,269
<i>There's a little Ernst Blofeld,
except it's a toupee in this case.</i>

740
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,273
When someone moves into the mall
who is folically-challenged...

741
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:56,361
<i>And that eagle was thrown out there
by one of our board artists, Matt Nealon,</i>

742
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,864
<i>and we just thought it was funny,
so we built it.</i>

743
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:01,199
<i>- But it doesn't make any sense.
- No, it doesn't.</i>

744
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,368
<i>And we never see it again.</i>

745
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,413
<i>But sometimes those little details
make all the difference.</i>

746
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:13,461
<i>- Okay.
- With this scene,</i>

747
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,840
<i>one of our board artists, Didier,
we were trying to...</i>

748
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:21,428
<i>It was written in the script that
the sensor was on Gru's belt buckle.</i>

749
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,100
<i>So, he came to me with this idea of
how does... Basically, what you see here,</i>

750
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:30,812
<i>maybe not quite, maybe his version
was more graphic, actually.</i>

751
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:36,735
<i>But it's a funny idea based off
of this thing that's on Gru's belt buckle,</i>

752
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:41,406
<i>how would he use that,
and so this very physical comedy scene</i>

753
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:45,452
<i>grew out of something that was
just a description in the script.</i>

754
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,205
<i>So it reminds me of a lot of things
that Peter Sellers would do.</i>

755
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,917
<i>- Like John Cleese with the funny walk.
- Yes, yes.</i>

756
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,877
<i>- Or Mr. Bean.
- Mr. Bean, totally.</i>

757
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,795
<i>Those are our ultimate references.</i>

758
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,423
<i>And that's the great thing
that comes out of animation</i>

759
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,052
<i>is, again, it's this evolution of ideas.</i>

760
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:06,181
<i>And suddenly you've got something
that feels very fun.</i>

761
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:14,105
<i>So, Gru is heading off to see if he can find</i>

762
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,025
<i>Margo.</i>

763
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,320
<i>And he ends up seeing</i>

764
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,365
<i>that she is heading into
the restaurant with Antonio.</i>

765
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,118
<i>And again, this was the moment
where we wanted to,</i>

766
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:30,121
<i>this whole scene, in fact...</i>

767
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,542
<i>How would Gru react to his beloved daughter</i>

768
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,713
<i>dating a boy who we're sure he thinks
is not good enough for her?</i>

769
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,884
<i>So, for some reason,
they have cookies in a Mexican restaurant,</i>

770
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,512
<i>but that's... I suppose that's possible.
I don't know.</i>

771
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:49,891
Margo.

772
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,647
<i>We basically...
I forget where this line came from,</i>

773
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,566
<i>but we always really liked it,
sort of Gru's reaction.</i>

774
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,694
<i>"Me llama-lama ding-dong."</i>

775
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,571
<i>And then here's a chance to see...</i>

776
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,659
<i>This was, I think, one of the first boarded
scenes, might have been the second</i>

777
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:12,038
<i>of Eduardo, and dancing.</i>

778
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,333
<i>And it was just so great.
In fact, what we were talking before</i>

779
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:18,420
<i>about how Eduardo used
to look very big and muscular,</i>

780
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,171
<i>that was it, he was boarded that way.</i>

781
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:23,425
<i>But it was so much fun,
even when he got short and fat, we kept it.</i>

782
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,178
<i>It is weird that all these women would like...</i>

783
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,764
<i>Remember when we had
a man here for the third beat?</i>

784
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,851
<i>That would have been so good.</i>

785
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:38,106
<i>This is some great work from
some of the boarding, great animation, too,</i>

786
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,609
<i>from Eric Favela.</i>

787
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:48,742
<i>I think in our eyes, in a lot of ways,
it's a great way to reintroduce the character.</i>

788
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,995
<i>There's a lot of dancing in the movie,
you'll see.</i>

789
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,706
<i>- It's very musical, actually.
- Yeah, a lot of music and dancing,</i>

790
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,335
<i>which I think honestly is, for us,
a part of the appeal.</i>

791
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:03,506
<i>We really like doing the music-based scenes.</i>

792
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,883
Look at you.

793
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,718
<i>We try not to be serious about it,
that's why we...</i>

794
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,220
<i>- Yes.
- We like them.</i>

795
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:13,558
I'm sorry. Pollito is usually very friendly.

796
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,101
<i>So, yeah.</i>

797
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:19,481
<i>In animation, one of the things that we tried</i>

798
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,484
<i>was that the chicken
always felt like a chicken.</i>

799
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,862
<i>Except in that one moment
where he squints his eyes.</i>

800
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,739
<i>Again, it's a question of contrast.</i>

801
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:32,035
<i>We could have gone the easy route
and made him like a cartoon character,</i>

802
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,747
<i>but we thought the comedy
would come more out of the fact</i>

803
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,666
<i>that it's a real chicken than a comical one.</i>

804
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,627
<i>An anthropomorphized chicken.</i>

805
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,964
<i>And also the animation team,</i>

806
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:50,011
<i>I think Pierre is probably remembering
his own days of youth,</i>

807
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,140
<i>Antonio always is animated
with his mouth hanging open.</i>

808
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,684
<i>- That's the way I see teens.
- That's right.</i>

809
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:04,526
<i>So using that scene, it became a great way
in that last moment with Gru</i>

810
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:08,071
<i>to power into this scene where Gru now
is convinced more than ever</i>

811
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,656
<i>that Eduardo is El Macho.</i>

812
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,909
<i>But the funny part, and this was
where Steve Carell...</i>

813
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,703
<i>This is one of the first scenes
we animated, as well.</i>

814
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,456
<i>And his vocal performance in this,</i>

815
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,543
<i>I would just say I think
he really understood the moment.</i>

816
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:25,713
<i>Because this actually became our bar.
You know what I mean?</i>

817
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,676
<i>Just for Gru's character,
'cause he did such a great job in here,</i>

818
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:33,972
<i>where he just won't let go of the fact
that they should arrest the son.</i>

819
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:39,519
<i>Do you remember Chris Meledandri saying
that this was "the scene" of the movie,</i>

820
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:43,481
<i>just like the sleepy kitten
was "the scene" of the first movie?</i>

821
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,817
<i>It was character defining,
it was story defining.</i>

822
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,735
<i>It had everything in there.</i>

823
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,990
<i>- It had character and story...
- Intertwined.</i>

824
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,158
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

825
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,703
Gru discovered traces of the serum
at Eagle Hair Club!

826
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,913
Interesting.

827
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:03,168
<i>Unfortunately for Gru, though in Silas' eyes,</i>

828
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:08,173
<i>the fact that he's now connecting Eduardo
to his son undermines his case.</i>

829
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,928
<i>We wanted Gru leaving this scene
more determined than ever</i>

830
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,763
<i>to prove his hunch right.</i>

831
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,185
<i>Do you remember... I was gonna say...</i>

832
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:23,897
<i>We had another scene, actually,
with Silas that was on the submarine,</i>

833
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:27,901
<i>but we found that we just didn't need it.
It became more... You find that a lot.</i>

834
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,614
<i>Sometimes you think you need
more information than you do.</i>

835
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,992
<i>So, this is a scene I was inspired...</i>

836
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:41,206
<i>I was inspired...
Basically, we had a few things,</i>

837
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:45,084
<i>there were these sketches that Pierre
was mentioning before with Eric Guillon</i>

838
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:50,465
<i>with the minions at the beach,
that's right, but</i> The Truman Show

839
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,761
<i>and</i> Happy Feet, <i>where the penguin
wakes up in an enclosure</i>

840
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,305
<i>but he doesn't know he's in an enclosure.</i>

841
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,476
<i>We set up the way
we had this great beach scene.</i>

842
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,312
<i>We're like, "Good. Let's use it."
So we made that their...</i>

843
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,398
<i>And this is actually inspired by</i> Jaws,
<i>it's hard to believe.</i>

844
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,609
<i>- But...
- Butt, what?</i>

845
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,446
<i>No, when I pitched it to the board artist,
I said, "Ripping his clothes off</i>

846
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,031
<i>"like</i> Jaws <i>and running into the ocean.</i>"

847
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,117
<i>Nobody gets eaten by a shark,
but the shots are similar.</i>

848
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:21,329
<i>Then we see that they're actually imprisoned.</i>

849
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,374
<i>And that's Dr. Nefario once again.</i>

850
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,253
<i>So, again, we were able to take some ideas</i>

851
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:32,173
<i>that really had nothing to do with that
moment and use them in a fun way.</i>

852
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:37,470
<i>This little moment, I'd say this is based
on my apartment right here.</i>

853
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,973
<i>Because my Wi-Fi always goes out.</i>

854
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:46,521
<i>Anyway, we had to create a moment where
Gru noticed that the minions are missing.</i>

855
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,898
<i>We didn't want to make too much of it
because we didn't want...</i>

856
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:50,900
<i>We felt if he notices minions are missing...</i>

857
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,527
<i>- He would do something about it.
- Exactly.</i>

858
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,070
<i>So, we make it a vacation joke.</i>

859
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,489
<i>But in a way, it kind of did its job.</i>

860
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,157
I've got good news!

861
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,868
I have my friend Shannon here with me.

862
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:06,582
<i>This is a scene also that was much longer
and was more about information.</i>

863
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,169
<i>But then we started talking
about a simplification,</i>

864
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,755
<i>Gru just basically
wanting to get out of the date</i>

865
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:17,385
<i>and using Agnes as somebody
who's misinterpreting his hand signals.</i>

866
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,847
<i>And we had a couple we didn't use,
jazz hands was one.</i>

867
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,224
<i>'Cause I was the only one
that was advocating jazz hands,</i>

868
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:30,606
<i>and I think the way the writers wrote it,
and the way it evolved in performance...</i>

869
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:34,610
<i>It really was a very funny
relatable moment for any parent</i>

870
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,654
<i>trying to use their kids as an excuse.</i>

871
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:39,073
<i>Particularly to arrive to this moment here.</i>

872
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:46,331
<i>And so, this is a bit of a tricky moment.</i>

873
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:47,623
<i>The wig!</i>

874
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,501
<i>We debated many times how to get into that.</i>

875
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,088
<i>And so we use Kyle, the dog,</i>

876
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,883
<i>to remind us about that trial wig
from the other scene,</i>

877
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,218
<i>'cause we wanted to lead right there
where she says phony,</i>

878
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,597
<i>and we see him wearing this toupee.</i>

879
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,515
Well...

880
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,852
<i>It serves two purposes.</i>

881
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:11,064
<i>It shows Gru's
lack of confidence in this situation,</i>

882
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,482
<i>the fact that he would even do this.</i>

883
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:16,694
<i>The more important was,
we needed, in a little bit later, you'll see...</i>

884
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:22,325
<i>Here you go.
You'll see that Lucy comes to Gru's defense</i>

885
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,202
<i>right here in a couple of moments.</i>

886
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,164
<i>And we really needed that to turn Gru's...</i>

887
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,375
<i>- Perception of Lucy?
- Perception of Lucy, exactly.</i>

888
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,132
<i>And I think in animation,
although we had stuff in boards,</i>

889
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,552
<i>the exercising in the restaurant</i>

890
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,639
<i>actually became much, much stronger
once it went to animation.</i>

891
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,725
<i>'Cause sometimes when you're in boards,
like, "God, is this gonna work?"</i>

892
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:51,729
<i>But you don't take into account
that next evolution. You know what I mean?</i>

893
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:55,274
<i>So, sometimes it can be,
even for us, difficult to sort of say...</i>

894
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,443
<i>You're like, "Well, it feels like it's right."</i>

895
00:53:57,527 --> 00:54:00,071
<i>And then you take it to the next step
and then you're like, "Okay."</i>

896
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:05,076
<i>Well, that's the thing, right?
The way we work is that Chris,</i>

897
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,869
<i>you take care of storyboard</i>

898
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,580
<i>and mainly script discussions
and stuff like that, right?</i>

899
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,917
<i>- Yeah.
- And I take care of animation.</i>

900
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,256
<i>We focus each other
on our particular strength,</i>

901
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:21,801
<i>meaning that when Chris is happy
on the storyboard,</i>

902
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:26,264
<i>then we try to plus it, basically.</i>

903
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:33,271
<i>And so, it's fun, actually having that
canvas of a thing to start with and ends...</i>

904
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,566
<i>- Ideas come out of that simple situation.
- And even sometimes ideas,</i>

905
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,234
<i>'cause I think in this case,</i>

906
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,237
<i>they'd even started when
we were having discussions in rough layout.</i>

907
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,115
<i>And I was even thinking later in the movie,</i>

908
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:50,037
<i>sometimes we'll sort of ape an idea in
rough layout and then that could be helpful.</i>

909
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,166
<i>Although poor rough layout,
that can be a rough phase for the movie,</i>

910
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:57,336
<i>because it's sort of not storyboards
and not animation,</i>

911
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,130
<i>so it can be tough to visualize.</i>

912
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:00,882
Shall we take her home?

913
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,719
<i>From here, I can't remember
what was here before,</i>

914
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,014
<i>but I remember our conversation
and I think that it was Cinco Paul</i>

915
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,183
<i>that first mentioned this idea.</i>

916
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,310
<i>Where were we?</i> Weekend at Bernie's.

917
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,645
<i>A little bit.</i>

918
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:19,525
<i>But there was something here before that
I can't quite remember that just didn't work.</i>

919
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,903
<i>You know what we find
when we develop the movie,</i>

920
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,656
<i>there's a couple of cases,
is that we need an idea,</i>

921
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,783
<i>a comedic idea that drives it.</i>

922
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:33,831
<i>It can't just be, "It's serving a story point."
Orit's, "We have to get this information out."</i>

923
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,958
<i>And so, once we knew,</i>

924
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,878
<i>obviously we needed Lucy
to come to Gru's defense,</i>

925
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,965
<i>but once it became about taking
this unconscious woman home,</i>

926
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:47,553
<i>it suddenly became something more
and funnier and really had an idea behind it.</i>

927
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:53,559
<i>Very often when we start, it's very basic,
"Okay, we need to deliver this information."</i>

928
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:55,269
<i>And then when we go into our reviews</i>

929
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,855
<i>with Chris Meledandri
and the writers, then it's like,</i>

930
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:01,901
<i>"Well, okay, we got the information across,
but how do we make it good?"</i>

931
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:06,989
<i>So that becomes the discussion
and we all chip in to,</i>

932
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,534
<i>or pitch in to evolve those sequences.</i>

933
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:11,994
This was fun.

934
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:14,372
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

935
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,040
<i>There's this thing of the debate
about the kiss.</i>

936
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,291
<i>To kiss or not to kiss.</i>

937
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,962
<i>But that used to not be in, and now it is in,
and I think it's really good.</i>

938
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,129
<i>- I do.
- Yeah.</i>

939
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,966
<i>I remember, sometimes we...</i>

940
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:28,427
<i>And we worked very hard
to avoid the cliché, I'll say,</i>

941
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,055
<i>but sometimes the cliché is what works,</i>

942
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:35,226
<i>and I think in the case here,
we weren't quite feeling the connection,</i>

943
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,395
<i>and I remember even having
a discussion at editorial,</i>

944
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:40,231
<i>if you really want to feel the connection,
a little kiss on the cheek,</i>

945
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,400
<i>and I think somebody,</i>

946
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:45,903
<i>I can't remember,
I know it came from another place, too.</i>

947
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:51,951
<i>And then that again informs the process.</i>

948
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,746
<i>I just want to mention quickly,
Pharrell Williams,</i>

949
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,251
<i>who wrote some terrific songs,
this, I think, is my favorite.</i>

950
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:05,881
<i>And we knew we wanted Gru after that
little kiss to be happy, essentially,</i>

951
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:09,260
<i>and Pharrell really quite literally wrote that.</i>

952
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:13,264
<i>But it's great, it's such a nice moment.</i>

953
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,601
<i>This is "the shot."</i>

954
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,270
<i>I want to say to everyone
that we're sorry for the...</i>

955
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,896
<i>- Sorry for that transition?
- Yeah.</i>

956
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,024
<i>We thought it would be better.</i>

957
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:28,696
<i>It just defines how Gru feels at this moment,</i>

958
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,241
<i>and it's such a nice contrast, so you think
of the first movie when it's</i> Despicable Me,

959
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:36,203
<i>and he spends the whole time
walking with his hands behind his back.</i>

960
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:39,498
<i>- Little animation moment here.
- Yeah, great moment there.</i>

961
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:42,585
<i>And she keeps going.</i>

962
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,919
<i>Originally, we had the classic,</i>

963
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,713
<i>this is where it was good to go
beyond the cliché</i>

964
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,716
<i>where he was twirling a woman
and he dropped her.</i>

965
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,051
Got who?

966
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,761
Floyd Eaglesan!

967
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:53,804
Our agents located a secret room...

968
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:58,726
<i>So, this is where
we sort of set up the idea that</i>

969
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,190
<i>Gru's mission's over, basically,
and he and Lucy are going to separate.</i>

970
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:08,986
<i>You start to get the couple together
and then,</i>

971
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,281
<i>through circumstances beyond their control,
they have to separate.</i>

972
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,701
<i>- It's the end of the second act, usually, right?
- Exactly. Exactly.</i>

973
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,831
<i>Floyd Eaglesan there
has been framed by we know not who.</i>

974
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,002
<i>But in the eyes of the Anti-Villain League,
the case is closed,</i>

975
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:28,673
<i>so they're gonna send Lucy off to Australia.</i>

976
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:29,757
Yes.

977
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:31,717
But thank you for everything.

978
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:35,346
<i>I think it's a nice moment narratively</i>

979
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:41,102
<i>where Gru is so happy just a moment ago,
and then it all comes crashing down</i>

980
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:45,189
<i>as he learns that she's gonna leave.</i>

981
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:50,528
<i>This is the thing we have coming up here,
is Lucy's lipstick taser, which, again,</i>

982
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:54,865
<i>you find these elements
that you can track through the movie,</i>

983
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,659
<i>which are very helpful.</i>

984
00:58:56,742 --> 00:59:01,789
<i>When the lipstick taser started,
it was really just a gadget at the beginning.</i>

985
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,336
<i>And then we used it here
as a memento of the first time they met,</i>

986
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:10,840
<i>and then it sort of tracks
through the movie from there.</i>

987
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,759
<i>It becomes what Gru looks at when he's sad.</i>

988
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:16,387
<i>And actually, we even used it
in the third act action.</i>

989
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,056
<i>So, it's always cool when you sort of like,</i>

990
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,852
<i>"Wait, we've got this piece
and how can we use it more effectively?"</i>

991
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,022
Thank you, Lucy.

992
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,524
Agent Wilde.

993
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,985
<i>And both actors here did a great job.</i>

994
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,904
<i>'Cause I remember we talked at one point
about re-writing the dialogue,</i>

995
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:38,159
<i>but actually, it was more
about how the dialogue was performed,</i>

996
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:41,120
<i>and it wasn't about what they were saying
but how they were saying it.</i>

997
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,456
<i>And they both did a terrific job.</i>

998
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,878
<i>This, we thought, was very cool.</i>

999
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:52,798
<i>Like having that happy moment
and then mirror that happy moment with...</i>

1000
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:57,178
<i>- But his change of mind, basically.
- Yeah.</i>

1001
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,223
<i>Feels like the old Gru, actually.</i>

1002
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:04,018
<i>Maybe a little meaner than the old Gru,
I'm not sure.</i>

1003
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,271
<i>So, this again,
this is another one of those scenes</i>

1004
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,649
<i>that evolved in many, many different ways,</i>

1005
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,322
<i>and again, certainly
from the versions we discussed,</i>

1006
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,240
<i>this was absolutely the strongest,</i>

1007
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,744
<i>and it became a nice little moment
between Gru and Agnes.</i>

1008
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:28,250
<i>Agnes is such a great character, as played
by Elsie Fisher, to balance against Gru.</i>

1009
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:31,545
<i>I mean, she's a pure innocent. She's a child.</i>

1010
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:40,763
<i>The scenes between her and Gru are, I think,
a great thing for particularly Gru's character.</i>

1011
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,684
<i>And we try, obviously, in animation also,
not to push those moments</i>

1012
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:50,523
<i>where they feel tacky or overly emotional,</i>

1013
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:55,820
<i>just because the situation and the words
are actually carrying the heavy weight.</i>

1014
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:59,406
<i>To quickly mention, also,
Yarrow Cheney and the lighting team.</i>

1015
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,409
<i>I think the lighting in that scene
really was quite beautiful.</i>

1016
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,620
<i>Very cheated, but excellent.</i>

1017
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:09,250
...and you're leaving for Australia
and all, but...

1018
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,378
<i>This, I think for Pierre and I,
is one of our favorite scenes.</i>

1019
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:14,171
<i>- And it's...
- No.</i>

1020
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,008
<i>- How dare you.
- No. It's good.</i>

1021
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,177
<i>Just because it's so weird.</i>

1022
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:22,805
<i>- Just this shot is weird.
- Yeah.</i>

1023
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:27,560
<i>Remember we debated that joke
over and over, how to play that joke?</i>

1024
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,520
<i>It makes no sense, that joke,</i>

1025
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:32,523
<i>but I don't know why,
at the end of the day, we felt it worked.</i>

1026
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:36,819
<i>- We used to have a jury in there, didn't we?
- Yeah. There were numbers.</i>

1027
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,904
<i>Then it was,
"He wouldn't be holding the phone</i>

1028
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:43,784
<i>"because that's not how you would do it."
You remember all those conversations?</i>

1029
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,037
<i>One nice thing here,
we got some great boards,</i>

1030
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:51,041
<i>but also it was very nicely edited
by Greg Perler.</i>

1031
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,294
<i>And I think that, in a lot of ways,</i>

1032
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,463
<i>there was potential,
just because of the music.</i>

1033
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:02,428
<i>Like using this phone
as the object of his discontent.</i>

1034
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,682
<i>And then, you know...</i>

1035
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,894
<i>Who came up with that idea
of the firemen arriving?</i>

1036
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,313
<i>- Matt Nealon. Yeah.
- The boarder.</i>

1037
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,027
<i>So, just having them play...</i>

1038
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:22,406
<i>Actually, you know what? I'm not sure.
He came up with the way it is.</i>

1039
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,826
<i>But it might have been mentioned
in the script. I don't remember, to be honest.</i>

1040
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,413
<i>I have to do this.
All the "beados" were done by Chris.</i>

1041
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,876
<i>The scream was Pierre.</i>

1042
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,046
<i>So, then we're back to the beach.</i>

1043
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,174
<i>- With Kevin.
- That's right.</i>

1044
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,302
<i>They were drinking alcohol at one point.</i>

1045
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:47,765
<i>Remember we had to do an alcohol pass and
cut down how many drink references we had.</i>

1046
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:51,685
<i>So, they were eating bananas,
which is probably truer to form.</i>

1047
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,604
<i>So, this is when we first get an opportunity</i>

1048
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:57,399
<i>to see what exactly is going on
with these minion-nappings.</i>

1049
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:02,196
<i>I love that.
That's one of my favorite vocals right there.</i>

1050
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,617
<i>So, then we see the French maid,
who was the first minion taken.</i>

1051
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:14,041
<i>We get to see what the PX-41 actually does.</i>

1052
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,294
<i>With the evil minions,</i>

1053
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:23,801
<i>we talked about several things, but we knew
that we wanted them to be a different color.</i>

1054
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:27,972
<i>Because things that are different colors
always seem to be appealing.</i>

1055
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:30,724
<i>So, we had some sketches from Eric.</i>

1056
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:35,020
<i>I think some of them had black hair,
and then Yarrow did some with purple hair.</i>

1057
01:03:35,104 --> 01:03:36,981
<i>We're like, "Okay, that's it."</i>

1058
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:41,402
<i>We did a couple of things
like lengthen their arms, their teeth.</i>

1059
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,529
<i>They have an undercut jaw.</i>

1060
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,074
<i>We even, at one point,
talked about one version having three eyes,</i>

1061
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:51,078
<i>but we ended up not doing that,
just felt too far off the mark.</i>

1062
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:57,126
<i>So, just sort of making them feel like
a werewolf version of our regular minions.</i>

1063
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,086
Edith, try not to kill anyone.

1064
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,587
Margo!

1065
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:01,797
Hello, Mr. Gru.

1066
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,132
Okay.

1067
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:09,763
<i>I love this kind of a gag where a character
can seemingly move, defy actual physics.</i>

1068
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:12,141
<i>- What do you mean? Like here?
- Yeah.</i>

1069
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,475
<i>"Wait. What?"</i>

1070
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,935
You are a funny man.

1071
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,813
There are no rules, <i>señor.</i> It's <i>Cinco de Mayo.</i>

1072
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,442
<i>And just expressing Gru's frustration.</i>

1073
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,947
<i>Should I mention this next moment?</i>

1074
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:31,785
<i>Yeah. This moment came from
an animation test that Christophe Delisle,</i>

1075
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,164
<i>one of our greatest animators,</i>

1076
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,916
<i>that Mac Guff did.</i>

1077
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,839
<i>And that moment had to last just about
a minute long, I think, or something like that.</i>

1078
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:49,803
<i>Basically what you see
is the structure of what he did.</i>

1079
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:54,475
<i>- A little bit shorter.
- Yeah, we had it longer,</i>

1080
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:58,854
<i>but actually ended up
going back to the original animation test.</i>

1081
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,690
<i>One thing about the animation test,
to talk about process,</i>

1082
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:05,778
<i>is with Antonio's character,
we were trying different things.</i>

1083
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,740
<i>And in truth, that animation test
informed who he became.</i>

1084
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:14,036
<i>Someone who would defy Gru.</i>

1085
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,080
<i>This is Matt Nealon again. Chip hat.</i>

1086
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,541
<i>We ended up realizing
that he couldn't be too nice.</i>

1087
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:24,671
<i>It made it difficult
to let Gru really cut loose on him.</i>

1088
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:28,342
<i>We didn't want him to be sympathetic,
I guess, at the end of the day.</i>

1089
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:32,096
<i>But we did try that at the beginning.
He was more of a romantic.</i>

1090
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:35,432
<i>This is an example, I think, where</i>

1091
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:40,729
<i>the storyboarding process in concert
with the script really is great and very cool.</i>

1092
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,607
<i>Because this was really
these two characters talking,</i>

1093
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:48,362
<i>and our board artist
pitched out this idea of a chip hat,</i>

1094
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:53,367
<i>which doesn't exist, but feels like it could,
if you know what I mean.</i>

1095
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,496
<i>And instantly the conversation has, again,</i>

1096
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,541
<i>each scene, each moment needing an idea.</i>

1097
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:04,711
<i>It needs something more
than just the words that are being spoken.</i>

1098
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:10,300
<i>And this used to be the place, also,
where the whole rhythm sort of fell down.</i>

1099
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:14,012
<i>- Yes.
- We used to give a lot of explanation</i>

1100
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:16,640
<i>- as to what El Macho was after.
- That's right.</i>

1101
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:21,478
<i>The reason why he became evil, and
we cut that all out just because of rhythm.</i>

1102
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:27,734
<i>'Cause it was really a place where
we were starting to get bored a little bit.</i>

1103
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:29,736
<i>Yeah, that's the danger.</i>

1104
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:34,158
<i>You have to balance, again, the amount
of information the audience needs</i>

1105
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:38,287
<i>versus the entertainment.</i>

1106
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,541
<i>You don't want anyone lost, but you also
don't want to bog them down in exposition.</i>

1107
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,418
<i>So it's a discovery process.</i>

1108
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,545
<i>It's funny, because as talky as it was before,</i>

1109
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:50,507
<i>this particular sequence
that we're seeing right now didn't exist.</i>

1110
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:55,721
<i>Yeah. We sort of got to a place where, "Gosh,
we need something that pushes the mystery,</i>

1111
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,599
<i>"is a little bit action-driven, not big."</i>

1112
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:04,688
<i>We started talking about ways
for Gru to follow Eduardo down to his lab.</i>

1113
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:09,276
<i>This is obviously heavily inspired
by</i> Raiders of the Lost Ark, <i>the first one.</i>

1114
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,238
<i>I always forget the name
of that video game.</i> Dance Dance?

1115
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:17,743
<i>It's the one
where you jump on the colored tiles,</i>

1116
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:20,078
<i>and also</i> Billie Jean,
<i>the Michael Jackson video.</i>

1117
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:22,873
<i>So we thought we'd combine those elements</i>

1118
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:30,589
<i>along with a musical cue
to get Gru down into El Macho's laboratory.</i>

1119
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,675
<i>Here, again, this scene,</i>

1120
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:39,431
<i>we knew we wanted Lucy missing Gru,</i>

1121
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,892
<i>but how could we have fun with that?</i>

1122
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:45,562
<i>So we started playing with the idea
of her seeing him everywhere.</i>

1123
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:49,233
<i>It was your idea.
I remember you pitching it out in editorial.</i>

1124
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:53,070
<i>I don't know.
I try to remember how these things evolve.</i>

1125
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,738
<i>I can tell you, I was there.</i>

1126
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,573
<i>I wasn't saying a word,
then you came up with that.</i>

1127
01:07:56,657 --> 01:08:00,202
<i>I thought, "Damn, how does he do that?"
It's really good.</i>

1128
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,167
<i>We had her looking around.</i>

1129
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:12,214
<i>We recorded Steve Carell saying,
"I just did a boom boom,"</i>

1130
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:15,175
<i>I'm still laughing thinking about it,
for another scene, actually.</i>

1131
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:19,263
<i>He was an adult Gru disguised as a baby
doing the mall surveillance.</i>

1132
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:23,433
<i>Greg remembered it, and pitched it slightly,
and put it as the button to this scene,</i>

1133
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,977
<i>and it made all the difference.</i>

1134
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,231
<i>We had the baby. I think
when the guys wrote it, the baby was there.</i>

1135
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,901
<i>And we went from...</i>

1136
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,947
<i>Using that little bit
that we remembered from Carell</i>

1137
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,616
<i>created a nice button on the scene.</i>

1138
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,870
<i>I'm not sure you're going to be able
to see that sequence in the plane.</i>

1139
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:47,708
<i>Yeah. That's right. It's a little scary.</i>

1140
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,298
<i>We had to figure out a way
how to get those off of Gru's face.</i>

1141
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,216
<i>So that was what we came up with.</i>

1142
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:05,517
<i>From a set design point of view, we were
really thinking of</i> Raiders of the Lost Ark.

1143
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,980
<i>Even the</i> Last Crusade, <i>that long bridge</i>

1144
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:13,608
<i>that Indiana Jones has to cross.</i>

1145
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:21,616
<i>Basically, we wanted it to be
a distinct underground laboratory,</i>

1146
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,287
<i>knowing that Gru has his own
that's covered in steel.</i>

1147
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:30,250
<i>So, this one being carved from rock
felt like a Mayan temple or something.</i>

1148
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:33,670
<i>It felt like a nice contrast.
More warm in its tones.</i>

1149
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:35,964
Dr. Nefario?

1150
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:39,760
<i>So, this was our big reveal.
Now we know where Nefario went.</i>

1151
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,139
<i>Although, my son did notice
that it was Nefario.</i>

1152
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,059
<i>We didn't fool him! That's not good.</i>

1153
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:51,730
<i>- No. He's only eight, right, is he? Is he nine?
- I think he's two.</i>

1154
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:56,568
<i>All right. So, here's Kevin again,
you can see his golf hat.</i>

1155
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:03,784
<i>And we wanted to do
this demonstration scene, basically,</i>

1156
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:08,997
<i>that would really, in structure...</i>

1157
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:11,333
<i>What do we say?
A little like the animation of Bill Plympton.</i>

1158
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,627
<i>Totally Bill Plympton. Yes.</i>

1159
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,382
<i>Pierre and I both,
particularly for these movies,</i>

1160
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:25,097
<i>what we call sort of a graphic presentation
for particularly cartoon comedy.</i>

1161
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:30,018
<i>It's very presentational, straight on.
It just always plays funnier that way.</i>

1162
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:36,274
<i>It feels like that scene in</i> Time Bandits.

1163
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:39,903
<i>But I remember Pierre was looking for
what could the minions be in</i>

1164
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,823
<i>that would feel unique.</i>

1165
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:46,410
<i>And so these cages came about
from a sketch from Eric.</i>

1166
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,871
<i>And very graphic, too, just because
you could use those cages</i>

1167
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:52,457
<i>to help you frame the shot a little bit better.</i>

1168
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:54,251
Their city gets eaten!

1169
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:58,338
<i>Why don't they eat out of the cages?
I never figured that out.</i>

1170
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:01,174
<i>- Some gray kryptonite.
- That's right.</i>

1171
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,218
<i>Great performance by Benjamin Bratt here.</i>

1172
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,471
<i>And you can see now his necklace is an "M."
So, yeah. See.</i>

1173
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:08,723
We would be unstoppable!

1174
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:13,019
<i>Every detail has been given
months and months of thought.</i>

1175
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,521
<i>There's no mistake in this movie.</i>

1176
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,565
<i>- That's right.
- Not one.</i>

1177
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,236
<i>I love that popper.</i>

1178
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:26,074
<i>Again, I think that was originally
a bottle of champagne. We got rid of it.</i>

1179
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,788
I just need to get some things off my plate

1180
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:35,083
before we start taking over the world,
that's all.

1181
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,210
<i>- Again, a great performance.
- Yeah.</i>

1182
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:40,505
One hundred percent! I am in!

1183
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,800
<i>Yeah, I mean, this is a nice moment</i>

1184
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:49,139
<i>from the writers and then augmented
by the animation.</i>

1185
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:53,685
<i>And then we did do, again,
some work to find the perfect length,</i>

1186
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,938
<i>for lack of a better word,
and I think it works nicely.</i>

1187
01:11:57,022 --> 01:12:02,277
<i>And then where El Macho still thinks
that maybe Gru isn't being entirely truthful.</i>

1188
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,698
<i>This, I love. This is like AI Capone in...</i>

1189
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:11,453
- The Untouchables.
- The Untouchables.

1190
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,248
<i>They should have made those confetti red.</i>

1191
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,584
<i>I know, that's right. The confetti.</i>

1192
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:20,754
<i>So, this was again another
one of those moments</i>

1193
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:24,090
<i>that we tried many versions of,</i>

1194
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:28,136
<i>including Margo almost having
her first kiss. Or actually having?</i>

1195
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,305
<i>I think almost, we never, with Antonio.</i>

1196
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:32,933
<i>But again, it wasn't helping us.</i>

1197
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,894
<i>And it made Gru seem a little too mean.</i>

1198
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:39,981
<i>So we brought back the chip hat.
For anyone who is lonely, they get a chip hat.</i>

1199
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:43,360
<i>And then gave Gru a nice moment
to freeze this Antonio guy.</i>

1200
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,986
<i>- And to become Gru again.
- That's right.</i>

1201
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,571
<i>Who's not too nice a guy.</i>

1202
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:53,286
<i>Short, sweet and really
solved the narrative issue nicely.</i>

1203
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:58,333
<i>That is one hand glider, boy, I don't know...</i>

1204
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:05,215
<i>I don't know if you've noticed,
we've just totally cheated the time of day,</i>

1205
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,175
<i>'cause when Lucy was on the plane,
it was during the day,</i>

1206
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:08,426
<i>and then she shows up there, it's night.</i>

1207
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:11,888
<i>We figured she's halfway on her way
to Australia, so it's a different time zone.</i>

1208
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:13,682
<i>That was our theory.</i>

1209
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:16,226
Pollito, what's the matter?

1210
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,435
Hey, Eduardo!

1211
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,354
Lucia, I apologize.

1212
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,232
Pollito, he's usually not like this.

1213
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,442
<i>Well, we didn't know
how to show the chicken</i>

1214
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:27,988
<i>just because he had to hold that bag
and not bring attention to himself,</i>

1215
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,364
<i>so we left it like...</i>

1216
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,075
<i>Literally just facing
the wrong way the whole time.</i>

1217
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:38,665
<i>Yeah, so there was, I remember...
Gosh, where was that used?</i>

1218
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,750
<i>Anyway, I can't remember,</i>

1219
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,420
<i>but I remember another character
holding a chicken reversed like that.</i>

1220
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,589
<i>- He's still reversed.
- Of course.</i>

1221
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:48,550
<i>He's about to reveal
something very important.</i>

1222
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,970
For instance, he never mentioned

1223
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:54,806
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

1224
01:13:54,889 --> 01:14:00,353
<i>So this is the moment where we put Lucy
in jeopardy, kind of start driving.</i>

1225
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,147
<i>There is Nefario.</i>

1226
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,989
<i>There's no reason for Gru to arrive
with such violence.</i>

1227
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:14,075
<i>He's not sure,
he's suspicious something bad is coming.</i>

1228
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,577
...knew it was him all along,

1229
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,871
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

1230
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,373
<i>I feel like this moment
went through some changes.</i>

1231
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,208
<i>I remember when we talked about,
when it was in layout,</i>

1232
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:24,461
<i>we talked about the minions
playing video games, which was funny.</i>

1233
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,796
<i>'Cause we were talking like,
"What would kids be doing?"</i>

1234
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,506
<i>Which is how we often talk
about the minions,</i>

1235
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:29,966
<i>like, "What would children be doing?"</i>

1236
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:33,053
<i>'Cause that's sort of their attitude
about a lot of things.</i>

1237
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:34,262
<i>Nefario?</i>

1238
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,764
<i>Sorry, gotta go!</i>

1239
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:38,808
He's got Lucy?

1240
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:44,064
<i>And then this is what gets Gru
going into his Gru cycle.</i>

1241
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:48,693
<i>Which we're certainly
gonna use in the next movie.</i>

1242
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:53,698
<i>Again, the fun of this, really,
when creating a sequel</i>

1243
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:55,700
<i>is always trying to create something
new and different</i>

1244
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:58,787
<i>that you haven't experienced before,
so we thought it would be cool.</i>

1245
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,040
<i>And also that little house
was always on the lawn,</i>

1246
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,377
<i>so it felt neat to say that that little house,
the little girl's dollhouse,</i>

1247
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,630
<i>not dollhouse, but playhouse,
serves a purpose.</i>

1248
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:12,258
<i>It's covering that little ramp
for that motorcycle.</i>

1249
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:18,306
<i>So, we really wanted this
to be a sense of grandeur</i>

1250
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:21,893
<i>and sort of frankly like Darth Vader
assembling his troops.</i>

1251
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,689
<i>All the rockets have
a different city painted on them.</i>

1252
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,816
<i>There's Paris and New York.</i>

1253
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:31,945
<i>The one you're about to see is our joke on
Hoboken, which I lived in for several years.</i>

1254
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,364
<i>That's a city? I always wondered.</i>

1255
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,741
<i>Yeah, it's actually a city in New Jersey.</i>

1256
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:39,828
<i>But we've got Tokyo and Beijing.</i>

1257
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,955
<i>So, that's his plan coming to fruition.</i>

1258
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,791
<i>He's about to launch
the minions all over the globe.</i>

1259
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:50,964
<i>- We spent a lot of time on this shot.
- Yes, we did.</i>

1260
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,883
<i>Just because of the reflections,
we didn't know how the shadows were,</i>

1261
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,261
<i>if the shadows were gonna be well-placed.</i>

1262
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,973
<i>How much of the limbs we should see
from that evil minion?</i>

1263
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,016
<i>So all that had to be dosed.</i>

1264
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,728
<i>One of our big influences,
actually, were video games,</i>

1265
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,230
<i>like first-person shooters.</i>

1266
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:12,068
<i>Seeing the limbs a bit, but playing with that
particularly because it's in 3D.</i>

1267
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:13,987
What was that?

1268
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:19,534
<i>So this is the moment, actually, which
is probably the scariest in the movie,</i>

1269
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,954
<i>and we designed it that way.</i>

1270
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:27,959
<i>'Cause we wanted the evil minions
to be not really evil,</i>

1271
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,920
<i>but they did have to be
a bit of a threat in some moments.</i>

1272
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:34,966
<i>So this is really
where they are the most threatening.</i>

1273
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:40,346
<i>Obviously, 'cause partly because
it's the girls that are in danger,</i>

1274
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,519
<i>and it's more intimate 'cause it's one-on-one.</i>

1275
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:52,776
<i>This is something that the writers threw in,
which was great,</i>

1276
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:56,279
<i>which is Agnes having this superpower.</i>

1277
01:16:57,906 --> 01:17:00,283
<i>And it was a great moment.</i>

1278
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:03,536
<i>'Cause how do we get
these little kids away from this guy?</i>

1279
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:07,916
<i>So, his glasses break, and then he's blinded
and can't see where he's going.</i>

1280
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:19,469
<i>So they go down, this is where we find...</i>

1281
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,346
<i>'Cause we had a lot of discussions,
where is Edith?</i>

1282
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,015
<i>'Cause there was a time
when Edith accompanied Gru.</i>

1283
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:26,309
<i>- Remember she snuck away?
- That's right, yeah.</i>

1284
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:32,273
<i>She snuck away with Gru
to help him try to rescue Lucy.</i>

1285
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:36,194
<i>So, when we got rid of that idea,
we needed, "Okay, where's Edith gonna be?"</i>

1286
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,530
<i>So we put her downstairs playing Ping-Pong.</i>

1287
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:40,198
<i>- With nunchucks.
- With nunchucks.</i>

1288
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,075
<i>It's a Bruce Lee reference.</i>

1289
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:47,247
<i>You notice there that the minion
is now wearing black overalls,</i>

1290
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:50,250
<i>'cause El Macho changed them.
He's got a little "M" on him.</i>

1291
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:57,632
<i>And then Nefario has returned
with a rather convenient antidote.</i>

1292
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,891
<i>We went back and forth on this.
I believe the idea was originally pitched</i>

1293
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:10,186
<i>by Eric Guillon a long time ago
about the jelly.</i>

1294
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,023
<i>Whether the jelly itself was the antidote
or do you put the antidote in it?</i>

1295
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:18,653
<i>So we ended up putting the antidote in it,
which is what made the most sense.</i>

1296
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,739
<i>This third act evolved quite a bit over time,</i>

1297
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:25,159
<i>and the idea started with the writers.</i>

1298
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:28,788
<i>I always think of it as the Death Star moment</i>

1299
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:35,336
<i>with Han and Luke dressed as Stormtroopers
taking Chewbacca into the detention center.</i>

1300
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:43,344
<i>Anyways, so painting our yellow guys purple
felt like a great idea.</i>

1301
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:48,057
<i>Comedically, it was rich with opportunities.</i>

1302
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:51,978
<i>And then this is one of Pierre's
favorite things is the... sound.</i>

1303
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,814
<i>And in my discussions with the board artists</i>

1304
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:57,942
<i>and sending him
some of the animation tests,</i>

1305
01:18:58,026 --> 01:19:01,738
<i>what you'll see is this little showdown,
which is basically a... showdown.</i>

1306
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,156
<i>Fight.</i>

1307
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:07,243
<i>- We do that now.
- That's right.</i>

1308
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,203
<i>- Between us.
- That's right.</i>

1309
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:16,169
<i>I even talked to Bruno Chauffard,
our CG Sup, about creating spit.</i>

1310
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,421
<i>'Cause we didn't have it originally.</i>

1311
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,214
<i>I was like, "Well, we've got to see spit."</i>

1312
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:22,383
<i>I love those discussions.</i>

1313
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,927
<i>You don't feel serious.</i>

1314
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,346
<i>Yeah, you have to take it seriously.</i>

1315
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,227
<i>So, yes, basically this became a spit fight</i>

1316
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:38,399
<i>that eventually reveals our Dave there
to actually be painted.</i>

1317
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:43,821
<i>We talked about the evil minions a little bit
in this moment you're about to see,</i>

1318
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,907
<i>very much like
the</i> Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

1319
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,785
<i>when he does his "bah" and there's a scream.</i>

1320
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:52,830
<i>- He looks like Donald Sutherland there.
- He does, exactly.</i>

1321
01:19:56,668 --> 01:19:59,087
<i>And one of our influences here was...</i>

1322
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,505
- World War Z?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1323
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:03,299
<i>We saw a trailer</i> for World War Z
<i>and obviously</i>

1324
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:04,801
<i>we're like, "That's cool."</i>

1325
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:08,805
<i>So we just tried to create
a swarm of these evil minions</i>

1326
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,932
<i>to sort of behave like a wave.</i>

1327
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,184
<i>Yeah, like water simulation.</i>

1328
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:24,946
<i>And I think in this moment,
really it was fun to create a sense of scale</i>

1329
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:29,367
<i>with the odds against Gru
and then these two little guys.</i>

1330
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:36,416
<i>And this was something I worked
with the board artists on the evolution.</i>

1331
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:40,461
<i>The fun part about doing something like this
is the staging of the action.</i>

1332
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:42,338
<i>And like, "Okay, what do we do?"</i>

1333
01:20:42,422 --> 01:20:46,551
<i>And we had this set and we had this rooftop
at the end of the set.</i>

1334
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:48,469
<i>It felt like a great place to get them stuck.</i>

1335
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:56,227
<i>So, the jelly now is the antidote.</i>

1336
01:20:58,271 --> 01:20:59,772
<i>Yeah, we know.</i>

1337
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,861
<i>And we do know also
that all these jelly things aren't</i>

1338
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,988
<i>properly aimed at the mouth of the minions.</i>

1339
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,657
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.</i>

1340
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:11,325
I put an antidote in the jelly.

1341
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,661
<i>It works, at least visually.</i>

1342
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:15,496
<i>- Yeah.
- Don't question it.</i>

1343
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:20,501
<i>So, the second time Dr. Nefario
saves the day in that ship.</i>

1344
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,214
Hi!

1345
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,134
- You brought the girls?
- Yes!

1346
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,054
<i>For me, I really liked this moment,
it's like a parenting thing.</i>

1347
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:33,681
<i>'Cause movies, I think, very often
just make that assumption</i>

1348
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:36,309
<i>that the girls would be in the third act action
without acknowledging it,</i>

1349
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,519
<i>but I like blaming it on Dr. Nefario.</i>

1350
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,148
<i>A deluded old guy who thinks it's okay.</i>

1351
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:44,817
Gru?

1352
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:49,697
<i>So, in here, we really wanted to...</i>

1353
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:53,743
<i>We talked about this a few ways,
like how the action evolves</i>

1354
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:57,997
<i>and making sure that we kept Gru's focus
on finding Lucy,</i>

1355
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,250
<i>just again to keep that character drive</i>

1356
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:05,505
<i>versus the other things,
which probably in some ways...</i>

1357
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:09,175
<i>I guess our feeling was when you start
developing a story about saving the world,</i>

1358
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,677
<i>ironically, it starts to feel a little abstract.</i>

1359
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:21,813
<i>So, in the designing of the jelly guns,</i>

1360
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:26,275
<i>we actually made it so the jars of jelly
themselves are the magazines.</i>

1361
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:29,278
<i>So we can easily identify...
There's the French maid.</i>

1362
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:35,034
It's over, El Macho.

1363
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:37,745
<i>So the first minion's
the last minion transformed.</i>

1364
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:43,960
<i>Again, we tried to design those things
that run through the movie.</i>

1365
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,586
<i>And here's another one!</i>

1366
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:50,967
<i>So, for some reason,
El Macho has tied Lucy to a shark.</i>

1367
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:55,721
<i>You said earlier about killing a lot of animals.
Here goes another one.</i>

1368
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:00,518
<i>Of course, they're just animated.</i>

1369
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:05,439
<i>That one will suffer
more than the others, actually.</i>

1370
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:07,483
<i>- That's true.
- Like a sushi shop.</i>

1371
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,194
<i>Was that Didier's idea? The sushi thing?</i>

1372
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:11,863
<i>No, that was me. No, that was me.</i>

1373
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:13,239
<i>- You're cruel.
- Yeah.</i>

1374
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:14,866
Tallyho!

1375
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:18,452
<i>What did we have there before?
I can't remember, with El Macho.</i>

1376
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,163
<i>There was something
and then we changed it to the minion.</i>

1377
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:21,998
<i>- I don't remember.
- I don't, either.</i>

1378
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:24,208
<i>I think it was Gru grabbed it,
they were in a fight.</i>

1379
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:26,002
<i>Yeah, that's right, cat fight. Yeah.</i>

1380
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:30,756
<i>Yeah, we had a whole wrestling match
between Gru and El Macho</i>

1381
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,508
<i>when El Macho was human.</i>

1382
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:35,261
<i>It just was too long.
Remember we had the minions cheering?</i>

1383
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:39,182
<i>They had foam fingers and they were
rooting for Gru versus helping.</i>

1384
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:41,767
<i>Actually, we didn't have that moment of</i>

1385
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:44,854
<i>- El Macho transforming with the PX-41.
- That's right.</i>

1386
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:49,567
<i>We actually had the idea very early on,
and I can't remember in what form that was.</i>

1387
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,904
<i>I remember Eric did sketches of this
a long time ago.</i>

1388
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:57,033
<i>And then when we started boarding this,
our board artist said,</i>

1389
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,535
<i>"He really should drink that stuff."</i>

1390
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:03,080
<i>And I was like, "You know what? We had
that. I don't remember what happened."</i>

1391
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:09,462
<i>So we actually went back to the idea,
and it just felt like a nice evolution.</i>

1392
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:13,341
<i>But again, playing it comedically
where he evolves,</i>

1393
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:16,385
<i>- but then his belly...
- Drops down.</i>

1394
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:26,687
<i>And so here again sort of thinking
about what do we...</i>

1395
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,814
<i>How do we track something
through the movie?</i>

1396
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:32,068
<i>Particularly something relating
to Gru and Lucy, who are the main storyline.</i>

1397
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:35,112
<i>So the lipstick taser. Here we go.</i>

1398
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:39,784
<i>The same ridiculous dance that Gru does.</i>

1399
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:41,452
<i>Isn't that</i> Gangnam Style <i>a little?</i>

1400
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:42,745
<i>It is.</i>

1401
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,082
<i>- Loosely is.
- Yes.</i>

1402
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:53,673
<i>So, then we had a lot of talks
about how to end El Macho.</i>

1403
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:58,344
<i>I don't know if this is
the most elegant ending.</i>

1404
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,846
<i>But we thought it was the funniest.</i>

1405
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,600
<i>So, we just ended him here with the fart gun.</i>

1406
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:08,062
<i>Although it's funny, I think,
that we did this little thing</i>

1407
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:11,607
<i>with the big game hunter
and Dr. Nefario posing for a photo</i>

1408
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:13,859
<i>that I think, at the end of the day,
buttons it nicely.</i>

1409
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:18,990
<i>We had an idea at one point about El Macho
ending up in the zoo in the gorilla cage.</i>

1410
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:22,952
<i>We never pursued it.</i>

1411
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,579
Don't worry, I will get you out of this.

1412
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:34,005
<i>What I like about this with the chicken is that
that's actually what a chicken could do,</i>

1413
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:35,214
<i>is just hit that button.</i>

1414
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:38,301
<i>Innocently, but he does it
with a bad feeling in mind.</i>

1415
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:43,889
<i>And you remember also we wanted to make
him pay and have him at the very end of...</i>

1416
01:25:43,973 --> 01:25:46,225
<i>We were gonna serve him</i>

1417
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:48,811
<i>- at the restaurant.
- The feast at the restaurant.</i>

1418
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:51,772
<i>- That would have been good.
- That would have been funny.</i>

1419
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:55,151
<i>I thought no one would be upset
with a chicken getting eaten.</i>

1420
01:25:55,401 --> 01:25:58,654
<i>Yeah, here's the sushi bit.
We had something. It was a fisherman.</i>

1421
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,072
<i>- Remember?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1422
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:02,616
<i>The shark ate the fisherman
and then it just didn't work.</i>

1423
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,285
<i>- It wasn't funny.
- It wasn't funny.</i>

1424
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,078
<i>So, then we went with the sushi bit.</i>

1425
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,290
<i>It's always good
when you're trying to think of comedy,</i>

1426
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,792
<i>you have to think of those
unexpected consequences,</i>

1427
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:15,254
<i>but that gives something,
it's hard to describe but...</i>

1428
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,714
Better make it quick.

1429
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,675
<i>When you do something visually
and you put it together and you're like,</i>

1430
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:21,886
<i>"Oh, boy!
That didn't work as well as we'd hoped.</i>

1431
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,596
<i>"Back to the drawing board."</i>

1432
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:29,268
<i>So here we had to sort of build the tension</i>

1433
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:33,689
<i>as Gru finally gets the courage
to ask Lucy on a date.</i>

1434
01:26:36,484 --> 01:26:40,029
<i>And originally we had them
hanging in the volcano. Remember that?</i>

1435
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,031
<i>- Yeah.
- They were slipping.</i>

1436
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:47,078
<i>And we played this idea
that they were slipping, slipping, slipping,</i>

1437
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,872
<i>and then we cut to their funeral
or we thought it was their funeral.</i>

1438
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,916
<i>- A couple of coffins.
- Caskets.</i>

1439
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:54,877
<i>- Don't say "coffins."
- That's right, it's caskets.</i>

1440
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,506
<i>But it ended up just being
a little hard to understand,</i>

1441
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,842
<i>so we moved the tension back
to when they're riding the rocket.</i>

1442
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:04,512
<i>And we added those guys
from the beginning.</i>

1443
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:06,680
<i>We really like doing call backs, don't we?</i>

1444
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:08,641
<i>That's right, that's right. Always feels fun.</i>

1445
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:13,729
<i>So, this was an idea</i>

1446
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:17,608
<i>that started with, I believe,
it was Ken Daurio who mentioned it.</i>

1447
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,861
<i>And we talked about
a lot of things for this ending.</i>

1448
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:26,158
<i>But I think, certainly in my mind, a wedding
was gonna give us the best opportunity</i>

1449
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:29,662
<i>to get our characters together
and land the right tone.</i>

1450
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:34,041
<i>Because, from the first film,
we sort of end with a celebration,</i>

1451
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:40,005
<i>and there's always dancing and music,
and it just felt like a rich opportunity.</i>

1452
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:45,094
<i>So, Pierre did a version of this song,</i> I Swear,

1453
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:50,474
<i>and the first version, it was just minionese.</i>

1454
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:53,644
<i>And then we talked about it and...</i>

1455
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:56,021
<i>- We needed some ridiculous words.
- Yeah, but I said,</i>

1456
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:59,775
<i>"It would be great if we could do a word."
And Pierre goes, "What about underwear?"</i>

1457
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:03,112
<i>And I said, "Yeah."
And he goes, "I don't know if that'll fit."</i>

1458
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:07,116
<i>And so I think we sang it back and forth
and then that was it.</i>

1459
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:08,951
<i>Do you think people
recognize that word though?</i>

1460
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,619
<i>- I think they do. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

1461
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,789
<i>- So...
- Animation test again.</i>

1462
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:14,957
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

1463
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,794
<i>How would these two characters,
with each of their graphic elements</i>

1464
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:22,089
<i>being so strong, be able to kiss,
and we played off of it, basically.</i>

1465
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:25,885
<i>And we talked about it with the board artists,
and layout contributed, too,</i>

1466
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:29,180
<i>just really playing it
like one of those videos from the '90s,</i>

1467
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:32,224
<i>one of those boy bands,
and that's really what we pursued.</i>

1468
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:35,769
<i>Love those guys in the background
with that little heart.</i>

1469
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:39,398
<i>And so here again, we had...</i>

1470
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:43,736
<i>These kinds of moments are challenging
to discover, to say the least.</i>

1471
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,238
<i>But what we ended up doing is going back</i>

1472
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:50,201
<i>to what we'd set up in the earlier sequence
with Agnes.</i>

1473
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:51,494
<i>- Mother's Day?
- Yeah, Mother's Day.</i>

1474
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:55,706
<i>And her finally getting the chance
to say it to her new mom.</i>

1475
01:28:56,415 --> 01:29:00,794
<i>And do it successfully,
so we play her a little bit timid here.</i>

1476
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:04,840
<i>And it's always nice
when you've got this piece in place</i>

1477
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:07,384
<i>and then you're able to pay it off.</i>

1478
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,555
<i>Which was what we were shooting for here.</i>

1479
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:13,516
<i>And again, we try to be true,</i>

1480
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:16,310
<i>as opposed to illustrating
the moment a little bit too much.</i>

1481
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:19,855
And my new mom, Lucy, is beyond compare.

1482
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,235
<i>Even Lucy's reaction here is very true.</i>

1483
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:27,279
<i>Yeah, it sort of has a nice authentic quality.</i>

1484
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,616
<i>And then we have the other girls join
and it feels like just...</i>

1485
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,535
<i>I think that's the theme
of the movie in a lot of ways.</i>

1486
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:37,122
<i>We were just thinking of extending this nice
family that we established in the first film.</i>

1487
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:43,963
<i>Now, for the very end, I should probably
just let it play and stop talking.</i>

1488
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:45,506
<i>- But...
- We should sing.</i>

1489
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:50,761
<i>Yeah, right. But really what happened was
the</i> I Swear <i>moment was playing so nicely,</i>

1490
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,221
<i>we just had a conversation.</i>

1491
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:56,058
<i>Gosh, we've got them singing
and knowing what weddings are about</i>

1492
01:29:56,141 --> 01:30:01,981
<i>and those archetypal songs
that work just great.</i>

1493
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:04,400
<i>Y.M.C.I... Y.M.C.I.</i>

1494
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:05,776
- Y.M.C.A.
<i>- Where'd that come from?</i>

1495
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:10,656
<i>I don't know. Felt like it was something
the minions could sing wonderfully</i>

1496
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,992
<i>and would just be a lot of fun.</i>

1497
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:16,161
<i>You said it all.</i>

1498
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:19,206
<i>Do you remember that character?
Who is she?</i>

1499
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:23,836
<i>What was the...</i>

1500
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,338
<i>- They drove off into the sunset.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1501
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:29,258
<i>But this was a better opportunity...</i>

1502
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,343
<i>I think Cinco threw this out.</i>

1503
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:33,721
<i>- That was your idea.
- Yeah.</i>

1504
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:39,059
<i>To do the photographs
as a great way to collect our characters.</i>

1505
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:44,106
<i>And in the end credit sequence, we really,
really wanted to have fun with the 3D.</i>

1506
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,527
<i>Within the movie itself,
we don't have that many moments</i>

1507
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:52,948
<i>where we have the freedom to do it
without actually killing either the emotion</i>

1508
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:57,536
<i>or taking the people
out of the story the movie's telling.</i>

1509
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:03,167
<i>And so, the end credits is a chance
for us to overplay the 3D a little bit more</i>

1510
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,503
<i>and have fun with it in the literal sense.</i>

1511
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:12,051
<i>Meaning, play around with the black bars,
with stuff like cutting it, going beyond it.</i>

1512
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:17,973
<i>And also, we sort of noticed
that against black, 3D works the greatest.</i>

1513
01:31:18,057 --> 01:31:19,391
<i>Yeah.</i>

1514
01:31:19,475 --> 01:31:22,603
<i>It's fun, too,
'cause one of our big influences, I think,</i>

1515
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:25,230
<i>I speak for both of us,
are the</i> Looney Tunes <i>cartoons.</i>

1516
01:31:25,314 --> 01:31:30,611
<i>And what's fun about this
is a lot of that stuff, even the 3D...</i>

1517
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:34,031
<i>You'll see in a moment,
the guy with the giant piece of dynamite,</i>

1518
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,618
<i>and they smash into the steel and the saw,</i>

1519
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:40,954
<i>all those little fun cartoon things.</i>

1520
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:47,252
<i>This gives us a chance, even a moment
like that, to play with those things in 3D.</i>

1521
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:51,173
<i>And the added benefit
is that the three characters that you see</i>

1522
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:54,885
<i>are actually gonna be the stars
of the next movie.</i>

1523
01:31:54,968 --> 01:32:00,599
<i>Exactly. So it felt like a great opportunity
to set them up.</i>

1524
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,689
<i>So we talked about the black bars,</i>

1525
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:10,275
<i>that became the concept
of keeping them open.</i>

1526
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,027
<i>And a musical element, too.</i>

1527
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:16,156
<i>This is another song by Pharrell Williams,
which is great, with CeeLo Green singing.</i>

1528
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:20,452
<i>So, there are attempts
to perform as an audition.</i>

1529
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:24,957
<i>It's a very elusive concept
that strings it together.</i>

1530
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,668
<i>But I think it makes way more sense</i>

1531
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:31,046
<i>than the first ending credits
we did on the first</i> DM,

1532
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:34,299
<i>which were total nonsense and very abstract.</i>

1533
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:37,052
<i>At least this one
has something you can grasp.</i>

1534
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:40,305
<i>I like that you think
this one actually makes more sense.</i>

1535
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:41,932
<i>Does it not?</i>

1536
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:49,189
<i>Also, the things we talked about were,</i>

1537
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:54,737
<i>particularly in Europe,
some of the 3D advertisements</i>

1538
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:58,741
<i>that appear before the films
with candy floating in mid-air.</i>

1539
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,033
<i>They're really a lot of fun.</i>

1540
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:03,287
<i>And when you go with your kids,
they reach out and try to grab them.</i>

1541
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:06,749
<i>So, really just,
particularly those bubbles, taking advantage</i>

1542
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:09,042
<i>of what really works so well in 3D.</i>

1543
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:11,628
<i>But the irony of it all is actually</i>

1544
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:14,465
<i>that those commercials
can permit themselves</i>

1545
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:17,509
<i>to go beyond
what the eye sometimes permits,</i>

1546
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,554
<i>just because they don't care
about storyline or anything.</i>

1547
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,556
<i>- Exactly.
- And so...</i>

1548
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,101
<i>We've also freed ourselves
of those constraints.</i>

1549
01:33:26,185 --> 01:33:27,644
<i>We don't have any storyline whatsoever.</i>

1550
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:31,732
<i>We just have characters
interacting with each other.</i>

1551
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:35,194
<i>That probably is the way we make
too many of our decisions.</i>

1552
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,418
<i>I wonder what people will think of this
when they watch it in 2D.</i>

1553
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:54,046
<i>They won't understand what they went for.</i>

1554
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:56,340
<i>So that's it.</i>

1555
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:58,592
<i>That's great. Here we go.</i>

1556
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,469
<i>We don't talk through all this, do we?</i>

1557
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,054
<i>No. Let's go eat.</i>

1558
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,182
<i>Sorry, it's just our lunchtime.</i>

1559
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:07,810
<i>- Shall we go?
- I think so, yeah.</i>

1560
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,603
<i>- Guys, what do you think?
- Okay, yeah.</i>

1561
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:10,979
<i>Goodbye, everyone. Bye-bye.</i>

1562
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:13,816
<i>Thank you so much. Hope you enjoyed it.</i>
