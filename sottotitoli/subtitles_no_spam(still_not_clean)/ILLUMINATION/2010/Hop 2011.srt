00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,969
Yeah, that's right.
I might be
a metaphorical sock.

173
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,209
I might not be
a good enough egg,

174
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,169
but I might be
the best sock ever.

175
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
I might not cut it
delivering Easter baskets,

176
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,481
but I might be
great at something else.

177
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,686
Oh, the drums!
Why, I think that's fine.

178
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,570
I think it's really
nice that you have a hobby.
Everyone should have a hobby.

179
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,642
It's not a hobby, Dad.

180
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,083
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.

181
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,601
E. B., the Easter
Bunny sees the world.

182
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,651
Every country in one night,
making people of
the world happy.

183
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,281
Really, Dad?
The whole world?

184
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,442
What about China?

Madam, please.

189
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,251
All right. So,
we haven't cracked China yet.

190
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,767
But, for all
those that do believe,
you will be there.

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,320
No, Dad. I don't want
to be the Easter Bunny.

192
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,885
Now, listen to me.

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,606
Four thousand years of
tradition doesn't end

194
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,968
just because one selfish bunny
doesn't feel like doing it.

195
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,087
Look. Dad...

196
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,286
No, E. B., you look!

197
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,522
You are going to
be the Easter Bunny!

198
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,281
Now you need to
get it together,
get rid of these drums,

199
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,124
and get your
priorities straight!

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,651
I'll see you out there!

201
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,161
No, I don't think you will.

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,805
I did it.

about this, Sam?

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,122
that I am not
supposed to help you, okay?

219
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,725
So you can't tell anyone
what I'm about to do.

220
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,167
No! I'm not going to
take money from you.

221
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,689
Wasn't going to
give you money.

222
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,164
We can call it a loan.
Fred, look,

223
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,886
I got you a job

at my friend's company.

224
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,201
I'm a little
slammed tomorrow.

I know you're not.

226
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,971
I'm pretty busy.
No.

227

Look, it's an
entry-level position.

228
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,849
Entry-level?
At a video game company!

229
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,120
Okay. That's kind of cool.
I know.

230
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,244
All right, look,
if it means that much to you,
I'll swing by.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,562
No, Fred.
You don't "swing by."
Okay?

232
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,167
You shower,
you shave, and you show up.
The three "shs."

233
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,562
Come on, Fred. You've
got to start your life.

234
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,449
Think of this
as a reboot.
Right!

235

It's time.

236
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,170
Yeah. You know what?
You're right.

In a couple of months,
couple of weeks,

238
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,528
you're gonna see
a whole new Fred.

239
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,446
Yeah. By Easter.
Easter is in two weeks.

240
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,888
By Easter,
I'm going to have a new job,
a new place, a new life.

241
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,041
Great!
Okay.

242
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,848
Now if you'll excuse me,

243
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,126
I'm going to go
sleep in my car.

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,166
Fred, listen.

245
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,881
My boss is on
vacation for a few weeks
and he asked me to house-sit.

246
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,684
Nobody ever asks
me to house-sit.

247
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,250
I know.
It's so weird.

248
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,965
Anyway, he has dogs,

249
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,123
and you know I'm
scared of dogs,
so take over for me.

250
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,604
Wait.
Your boss lives in
a big mansion, right?

251
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,961
Yes, in Beverly Hills.

252
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,963
And he loves his house
more than he loves his kids.

253
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,929
So you have
to behave. Okay?

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,968
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.

255
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,246
Do not go upstairs!

256
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,527
Wait, what's upstairs?

257
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,171
Fred.
Okay.

258
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,726
And do not forget
to feed the dogs.

259
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,887
Got it!

260
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,891

<i>Please step forward.</i>

that I am both a bunny,
and incredibly sexy.

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,643
(EXCLAIMS)
You're not getting it.

516
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,127
I don't mean special as in,
"everybody's special."

517
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,607
I mean, I'm really special.

518
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,487
(CLINKING)

519
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,166
What're you doing?

520
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,007
See?

521
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,206
FRED: Jelly beans?

522
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,327
E. B.: Mmm-hmm.

523
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,925
So what? So you talk
and you poop candy.

524
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,081
Could you do it in
someone else's life?

525
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,162
No, you're right.
It's not your concern.

526
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,086
And in two weeks,
maybe you can explain
to the children of the world

527
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,970
why they didn't get
their Easter baskets.

528
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,920
Easter?

529
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,365
What, Easter?

530
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,321
No way.

531
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,368
Yes, Fred.
I am the Easter Bunny.

532
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,161
(EXHALES)

533
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,841
Hop in.

534
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,883
Yes! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew you were real.
I knew it!

535
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,650
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm real.

536
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,801
No.

537
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,565
When I was a kid,
I saw you on Easter morning.

538
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,486
You did?
Yeah.

539
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,530
That was you,
right?

540
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,889
Absolutely. No question.

541
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,441
Okay. Because you do
look a little different.
Was it...

542
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,091
I don't know,
have you lost weight?
Or maybe it's the clothes.

543
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,248
You're talking
about the old guy.

544
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,364
Yeah. We got rid of him.
He didn't understand children.
Ah.

545
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,364
He didn't get that
children sometimes
just want to drum.

546
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,888
I mean, dream.
Sometimes they
just want to dream.

547
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,411
Children dream.

548
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,091
Yeah. So he had to go,
anyway, this guy.
Right.

549
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,607
Well, it's a good thing
you got rid of him, then.

550
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,801
Exactly.

551
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,451
So... Wait a minute.
Why are you here now?

552
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,491
Just doing
a little last minute recon
for Easter deliveries.

553
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,882
Finding ideal egg
hiding locations.
There is one. That's perfect!

554
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,367
Compiling a list of kids
with chocolate allergies.

555
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,927
That kind of thing.
It's all very technical.

556
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,246
I see.

557
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,401
Okay.

558
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,003
Oh, man. I'm really late.

559
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,162
Late for what?
What are we doing?

560
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,891
I have a job interview.
You're staying here.

561
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,804
But here is boring.
Let me come with you.
I could be a job reference.

562
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,161
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Look, I really need this job,

563
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,368
and I don't think anyone
there is going to be
able to handle you.

564
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,410
I'm not sure I can handle you.
So, just do me a favor?
Wait in the car.

565
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,287
Fred, I don't want
to get your hopes up,

566
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,886
but I think you're
definitely going
to get this job.

567
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,486
Be good.
Yes, sir.

568
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,961
I'll stay here and
guard the vehicle.

Yes, sir. I'll put
you through to Mr. Hill.

571
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,250
Hi, I'm Fred O'Hare.
I'm here for a 10:30 with

572
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,641
Mrs. Beck.

573
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,000
You're a half-hour late.

574
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,645
I know. I called.

575
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,410
That doesn't make
you any earlier.

576
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,561
Uh-huh.

577
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,526
You know, you're the first
impression people get when
they walk in here.

578
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,602
In many ways,
you are the face
of the company.

579
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,490
Fill this out.

580
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,285
Yes, ma'am.

What is that alarming noise?

586
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,651
Oh, no!

I'm sorry, sir.
Who did you
want to speak to?

592
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,686
Fred.

593
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,484
What are you doing here?
I told you to wait in the car!

594
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,050
This is serious.
I really need your help!

595
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,208
I need your help!
You can't be here.
You've got to go!

596
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,481
Fred?
Yes.

Mrs. Beck.

600
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,361
Yes.
How are you?

601
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,848
I'm well. I can't say that
I'm that impressed with your
punctuality, though.

602
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,888
Yeah, I have
half a dozen excuses.

603
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,923
But I'm just going to go
with a straight apology.

604
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,930
I'm really, really sorry.

605
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,042
Okay. Clean slate, then.
Thank you.

606
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,891
So, let's begin, Fred.
I'll show you inside.

(E. B. GRUNTING)

608
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,567
Whoa!

609
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,767
So, recent
employment history.

610
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,450
You haven't
worked in a year?

611
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,289
Yeah, my parents
have moved in with me.

612
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,966
That has sort of
been a full-time job.
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,401
It's fine.
It just gets in the way
of writing my novel, is all.

614
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,249
You're writing a novel?
What is that about?

615
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,649
It's about a crippled soldier
who, in the future,
goes to another planet

616
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,285
and he becomes
one of the indigenous people

617
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,926
who are blue and
live in the forest.

618
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,124
That's not <i>Avatar</i>?

619
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,411
Not really.

620
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,488
So, why don't
we take a walk

621
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,204
and I can tell
you a little bit
about the company?

622
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,406
Okay.

623
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,642
So, the good news is,
we tend to
promote from within.

624
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,001
But you'd be
starting in the mailroom.

625
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,082
Mailroom.
Is that a problem?

626
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,607
No, no, I love mail.
I get lots of mail.

627
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,286
E-mail,
snail mail, chain mail.

628
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,283
I am male.

629
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,161
Speaking of mail,
that's Cody. Let me
introduce you to him.

630
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,921
He is being promoted to
junior exec and you would
be replacing him.

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,490
Wow. Congratulations.

632
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,647
Question.

633
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,007
I need 30 copies
of something, collated,
stapled, bound

634
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,645
and on my desk
by yesterday.

635
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,290
What do you do?

636
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,327
I would make 30 copies,
and I would do what
you said with them.

(SNIFFS)

638
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,330
I smell potential.

639
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,803
Oh, Mrs. Beck, I was
wanting to talk
to you about my lunch.

642
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,803
This is
an extreme emergency.

643
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,769
You're ruining this for me.
You really need to go.

644
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,649
You're right.
I'll create a diversion

645
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,643
and we'll escape in
the ensuing chaos.

646
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,841
E. B., no! Get back here!

647
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,126
Fred?
Yeah.

648
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,170
I got a good
feeling about this place.
Where to next?

But where is Ricky?

651
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,607
We need to put
a back beat behind that.

652
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,727
A back beat.

653
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,569

went out for coffee.

guy off the street

684
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,489
with two sticks of
wood and a dream.

685
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,926
I understand if
you throw me out.

686
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,490
I get it if you don't
want to give me a break.

687
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,170
Hey, slow down, friend.

688
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,365
You know, we have a buddy
who is always on
the lookout for new talent.

689
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,849
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather
of entertainment.

690
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,490
And he's having
auditions tomorrow.

691
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,963
The Hoff?
You mean he can help me?

692
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,280
If he like you.

693
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,840
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.

694
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,730
Good luck, little rabbit.

695
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,126
Wait,
how did you know I was...

696
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,487
Mmm!

697
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,125
Clever gents.

698
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,129
E. B.:
So, Fred, how'd it go?

699
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,850
FRED:
Don't say a word.

700
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,401
(GRUNTING)

701
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,890
FRED: Can I get a little
clarification, here?

702
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,490
Is this what
the Easter Bunny does now?

703
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,688
He just goes house to house,
messing up people's lives?

704
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,370
Well, that
is just hurtful.

705
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,687
Besides, you're
selling yourself short.

706
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,007
They were going to
shove you in the mail room.

707
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,242
Well, excuse me,
but I happen to think
you're better than that.

708
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,567
You don't know me, okay?
We just met.

709
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,765
I can tell.
You give off this aura
of untapped potential.

710
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,846
I do?

711
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,051
Don't pull that
with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.

712
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,810
But, Fred, I'm serious.

713
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,565
You're destined to
do something great.
I just know it.

714
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,927
I've heard that one before.

715
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,088
You'll find an awesome job.

716
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,407
Hey. Look, what about this?

717
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,165
Dog walker?
No.

718
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,890
TSA Officer?
No.

719
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,481
What about this one?
It looks exciting.

720
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,370
Wind in your hair,
hot babe on your arm.

721
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,210
That's a car ad.

722
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,721
You should buy that car, then.

723
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,921
(SIGHING)

724
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,607
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

725
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,245
Ah! <i>Señor.</i>
How you doing, <i>jefe</i>?

726
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,565
Am I disturbing?

727
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,400
It's never been
this quiet in here.

728
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,171
Yeah, it's so depressing.

729
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,289
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.

730
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,085
Like a man-cave!
It'll be fun.

731
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,086
I called his
dreams ridiculous.

732
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,450
What kind of
father does that?

733
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
No, no, <i>señor</i>.

734
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,491
I will not permit you
to beat yourself up over this.

735
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,604
Anybody would be lucky
to have a father such as you.

736
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,967
Thank you, Carlos.
I miss him.

737
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,485
Me, too, <i>señor</i>.

738
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,251
A son is very
difficult to replace.

739
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,603
Difficult, but
not impossible.

740
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,006
Carlos...

741
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,162
What the...
What's that on your head?

742
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,442
What? My new earmuffs?

743
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,804
It's a cold spring
this year, you know? Brr!

744
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,687
Oh.

745
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,802
Anyway, what am I going to do?

746
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,649
I know,
how can you deliver Easter

747
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,764
with this tremendous burden
on your old, frail shoulders?

748
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,842
Hey, hey,
hey, easy
with the "old."

749
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,962
No, I'm just saying,
like, compared to me.

750
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,771
Surely you're not thinking
of making the trip yourself?

751
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,887
What choice
do we have?

752
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,008
We can improvise. I mean...

753
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,281
Does it even
have to be a bunny?
What?

754
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,523
I suppose,
given these troubled times,

755
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,288
even a humble
chick could do the job.

756
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,806
(LAUGHING)

757
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,641
Really, Carlos.

758
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,445
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

759
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,001
Wow. I mean,
that is funny.

760
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,322
Can you imagine that?
A chick delivering Easter?

761
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,686
That's ridiculous.

762
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,245
Oh, dear me.

763
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,766
But I appreciate
you trying to
cheer me up, though.

764
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,810
Please. It is my pleasure
to amuse you, <i>señor</i>.

765
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,962
(LAUGHING)
A chick delivering...

766
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,687
Fred, I was wondering if...

767
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,564
Are you doing
anything tomorrow?

768
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,726
Tomorrow I get to
start my new job
at the video game company.

769
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,527
Wait a second.
No, that didn't work out.

770
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,688
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about that.

771
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,202
But do you know what?
Every cloud has
a silver lining.

772
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,722
And behold this
silver lining, Fred!

773
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,967
The Hoff?

774
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,769
Yes, please.
I just need a ride.

775
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,881
Mmm.

776
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,610
No.
Come on, Fred.

777
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,724
This is my one big chance.
I'll do anything.

778
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,402
Even get out of your life.

779
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,722
I take you to
<i>Hoff Knows Talent</i>,
and that's it, we're done.

780
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,604
Bunny's honor.
(SPITS)

781
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,767
Right here, mate.

782
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,644
It's okay.
A verbal agreement is fine.

783
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,643
Now, you realize,
you can't talk.

784
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,245
No. I can.

785
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,447
No, what I mean is,
you shouldn't talk.

786
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,130
What? Like, ever?

787
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,446
Yeah,
"ever" would be wonderful.

788
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,562
But from now on,
especially not in
front of other people.

789
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,803
They might freak out
and want to
dissect your brain.

790
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,809
Dissect? That's
a bit extreme.

791
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,968
There's an easy explanation
as to why I can talk.

792
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,889
It's a simple combination
of cuteness and magic.

793
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,361
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.

794
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,371
And one order of
carrot cake a la mode,
topped with, quote,

795
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,444
Whatever candy you have
laying around back there.
Unquote.

796
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,965
Uh, excuse me.

797
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,126
Is that a cough drop?

798
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,443
Yeah. It's cherry.
It counts.

799
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,489
It's a peculiar garnish.

800
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,329
Can I get some
chocolate syrup?

801
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,731
Sure, doll.

802
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,765
E. B.:
Thanks, love.

803
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,610
It seems my brain is
still intact, Fred.

804
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,843
E. B.: Fred,
I've just had an idea.

805
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,362
When I'm a famous rock star,
I'm going to buy
a mansion just like this

806
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,808
and make you
sleep in the garage
in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.

807
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,645
What do you think?
Oh, man. My sister is here.

808
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,131
You never told me
you had a sister.

809
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,926
There's still so much
we don't know
about each other, Fred.

810
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,604
If she goes upstairs,
I'm dead.

811
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,966
Why?
Why?

812
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,121
Let me take you
back to this morning

813
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,964
when you flooded
the bathroom and
you trashed the bedroom.

814
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,087
You remember that?

815
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,209
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth it out with her.
Ow!

816
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,322
Hey!
Look at me.

817
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,327
One word out of you,
and it's rabbit season.
You got it?

818
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,324
Okay, I'm going to
run interference.

819
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,243
I need you to sneak upstairs
and clean up, quietly!

820
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,727
(DOOR CLOSES)

821
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,161
Sam!
Hi!

822
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,244
Hey, it's not a good
time for me right now.
I was just leaving.

823
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,685
But you just got here.

824
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,845
I know, right?

825
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,889
Hey, what are these?
Oh!

826
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,005
There you are.
(CHUCKLES) Mmm!

827
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,123
I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.

828
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,850
That is why they're
all over the house.

829
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,684
I was going to
clean them up, though.

830
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,526
Okay, Fred,
how did the interview go?
Yes?

831
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,080
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.

832
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,247
Really?
Yeah.

833
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,407
No way!

834
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,851
Why are you so surprised?

835
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,888
Fred, that's awesome!
Place could use me, too.

836
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,850
Don't get me wrong,
it was great.
It was good.

837
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,407
It was all right.

838
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,842
I just... I don't know
if it was for me, really.
It just didn't gel.

839
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,571
Something felt a little off
about the whole thing.

840
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,051
I didn't get it.

841
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,448
Oh! What? What happened?

842
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,127
It's kind of hard to pinpoint
any one specific thing.

843
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,084
Oh, Fred.

844
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,680
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

845
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,051
(WHIRRING)

846
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,761
What is that?

847
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,005
I wouldn't know
because I'm not
allowed to go up there.

848
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,481
And I haven't
been up there once.

849
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,689
Hmm. Okay.

850
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,442
Sam, no, you're not
allowed up there, either.
Don't go up there!

851
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,490
Sam, I'm begging you!

852

Wow! Yeah. Oh.

So cute!
Isn't he?

858
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,409
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't
be playing with him

859
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,051
because we're not really
supposed to be up here in
the first place. So...

860

Why don't we put him back
before things
get uncomfortable?

868
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,770
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

869
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,968
Well, I'm
uncomfortable because
I'm looking after the house

870
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,889
and it's my responsibility.

871
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,525

he might be broken.

want you to worry, okay?
I'll get something.

tomorrow night a lot easier

if you could tell Mom and Dad
that you had a job.

tomorrow night?

But it's what my
dad wants, not me.

but let him down?

just don't get it.

ever think of myself.

at the bus station.

makes it all happen.

all the roles are

Fred has been
studying ventriloquism.

1046

Yeah! I might
do it professionally.

nicer to your son.

Oh! Hey, Dad.
I was just leaving.

01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,405
Fred, seems like we made
quite an impression
on you the other night.

1086
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,641
Is this your new career?

1087
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,200
Upstaging grade-schoolers
with your
ventriloquist puppet?

1088
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,130
No, no, I got lots of
other stuff going on.

1089
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,327
Yeah.

1090
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,045
There it is.
What?

1091
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,482
That look.
The complete and
utterly disappointed look.

1092
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,800
Well, I'm sorry, Fred,

1093
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,724
but can you give me just,
I don't know,

1094
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,331
one reason not to
be disappointed?

1095
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,606
Well...

1096
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,007
Just one.
Yeah.

1097
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,966
Fred?

1098
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,727
Fred, where'd you go?

1099
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,604
Yeah, I'm right here.

1100
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,607
I just remembered
I have a really great
solid lead, actually.

1101
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,245
You do?
Yeah, a great job.

1102
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,765
Tell me about it.
I can't really
tell you about it.

1103
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,251
But it's big.
You're going to love it.

1104
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,650
It's really big!

1105
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,446
E. B.: Hey, what's with
the "Mr. Serious"
all of a sudden?

1106
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,648
Wait, is this where
you tell me you
want to see other rabbits?

1107
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,007
Because I'm
open-minded, Fred.

1108
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,888
E. B., I have
the most amazing idea.

1109
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,885
When I was a kid,
I told everyone

1110
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,451
that I saw
the Easter Bunny, right?

1111
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,045
No one believed me,

1112
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,565
even though

1113
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,365
he left me this.

1114
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,202
This chocolate bunny,
which I kept.

1115
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,166
Oh, dear.

1116
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,687
And tonight, it just hit me.

1117
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,840
I realized that it was
my destiny to see him.

1118
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,571
Just like it was my
destiny to meet you.

1119
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,649
It's all been
leading up to this.

1120
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,767
Up to what?

1121
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,963
You don't want to be
the Easter Bunny, right?

1122
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,570
I know who can
take your place.

1123
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,721
Who?

1124
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,727
Me!

1125
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,930
I'm sorry, Fred.
Would you mind repeating
that in my good ear?

1126
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,207
I want to be the Easter Bunny.

1127
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,841
What was that for?

1128
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,843
That is for people
who have gone loony!

1129
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,922
A human Easter Bunny?

1130
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,202
Come on, Fred!
It doesn't make sense.

1131
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,601
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.

1132
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,963
If you wanna get all logical,
bring logic into this,

1133
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,127
you should be
an Easter Chicken.

1134
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,406
What? Come on.

1135
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,484
People might resist it
at first. But, hey,
change can be a good thing.

1136
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,410
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!

1137
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,891
It did a number on me.

1138
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,849
Do you know there was
a period of roughly
nine months

1139
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,161
where the sight
of a colored egg
made me want to vomit?

1140
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,203
And rabbits are
physically unable to vomit.

1141
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,250
So it was just hours of...
(RETCHING)

1142
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,481
Nothing coming out.

1143
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,964
I don't care.
Imagine that, Fred.

1144
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,121
Don't care.

1145
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,407
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.

1146
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,290
Fred, you can't just
be the Easter Bunny.

1147
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,171
My dad has to give
you special powers.
Eh.

1148
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,681
Besides, the Easter
Bunny has got to be fit.
Ow!

1149
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,529
And you're a little scrawny.

1150
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,210
Finally, the Easter Bunny
has got to have

1151
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,770
lightning-fast reflexes.
Hi-ya!

1152
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,128
Knock it off.
I'm serious.
I can do this.

1153
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,564
I will be the Bunny.

1154
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,285
The stubborn old bunny
refuses to crown anyone else.

1155
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,489
This can only mean
one thing, my friends.

1156
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,043
We are going to
have to take matters
into our own hands.

Carlos? Carlos?

1159
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,641
Yes, Phil?

1160
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,331
(STAMMERING)
We don't have hands, per se.

1161
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,361
No, it's a figure
of speech, Phil.

1162
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,481
Right. Got it.

1163
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,809
Too long have we labored
under the yoke of
the bunnies' tyranny.

1164
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,530
Well, no more!

1165
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,968
It's time for
the Easter Chick to rise!

Um, um...
Yes, Phil?

1168
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,686
Just thinking out loud.

1169
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,287
But wouldn't it be
easier just to wait for E. B.?
I mean, he can fix this.

1170
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,966
Phil, if you love
E. B. so much,
why don't you marry him?

1171
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,451
E. B. is gone, okay?
Oh.

1172
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,885
There is a new boss.

1173
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,122
Really? Who is it?
Is it me?

1174
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,049
(HONKING)
Are you being serious?

1175
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,770
Yes. Hi.

1176
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,525
Just rehearsing
for the big
Easter sing-a-long.

1177
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,922
Okay, everybody,
this time sing
a lot more better.

1178
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,044
And one, and two.
And three and four.

1179
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,361
It's me.
Me, you idiot.
I'm taking over.

1180
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,771
Oh. I see.

1181
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,042
But first,
I must get in shape.

1182
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,089
I will be the Bunny.

1183
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,882
You know,
I've been thinking, Fred.

1184
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,281
Oh!

1185
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,565
Hey, E. B., what's up?

1186
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,881
Fred, listen.
You helped me
become a drummer.

1187
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,809
And how do I repay you?

1188
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,771
I jellybean all over
your dream. Well, no. No.

1189
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,406
I've changed me mind.
I've seen the light.

1190
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,563
We're going to do this.

1191
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,684
And nice job on the eggs.

1192
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,525
I told you I was serious.

1193
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,889
Seventy-two.

1366
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,930
Then, at last, <i>Señor</i> Bunny,

1367
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,765
I will be Easter's new king!

1368
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,490
Carlos, I'm
warning you!

1369
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,882
The Egg of Destiny
is too dangerous in
the hands of a chick.

1370
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,361
Its power can only
be wielded by a bunny.

1371
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,364
Oh, yes?
Well, look at me wielding.
I'm wielding!

1372
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,841
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding
it again. Okay?

1373
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,203
Oh, Carlos, can I wield
the Egg of Destiny? Please?

1374
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,327
No.

1375
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,606
Can I at least touch it?

1376
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,609
Ow!
There, you touched it.

1377
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,841
That was harsh.

1378
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,604
But, Carlos,
think of the children.

1379
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,523
Yes, but I am! The childrens.

1380
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,001
They don't want
candy and chocolate.

1381
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,366
From now on,

1382
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,843
their baskets will be filled
with clumps of bird seed,
dried crickets,

1383
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,730
and the world's finest worms!

1384
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,123
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

1385
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,686
ALL: Mmm!

1386
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,321
Have you
completely lost your mind?

1387
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,290
Silence! You see,
this is why he must go.

1388
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,524
It's this lousy attitude
of his. Well, no more!

1389
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,245
The more sensitive
chicks in the room
may want to avert their eyes.

1390
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,369
What about
a compromise, okay?

1391
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,205
The bunny gets Easter
one year and the chick
gets it the next.

1392
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,850
Enough of the chitty-chatty.

1393
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,651
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.

1394
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,285
Hello! Hey, everyone.

1395
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,887
I'm back. Yep,
it was all a big mistake,
but I'm alive.

1396
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,486
Hey, Larry, Kyle,
what are you doing in there?

1397
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,767
E. B.'S DAD:
E. B.! You're alive!

1398
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,080
E. B.!

1399
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,170
Dad? Fred? What's going on?

1400
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,883
Gummy cannons! In position.

That hurt!

1403
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,970
Put him on the belt, boys.

1404
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,647
Dice him, slice him,
and pulverize him!
(LAUGHING OMINOUSLY)

1405
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,330
That is a bit excessive.

1406
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,527
Oh, no! E. B.!
Son!

1407
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,291
The reign of
the bunny is over!

1408
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,927
Oh!

1409
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,527
Somebody help!
Help us!

1410
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,401
What are you doing?
Don't worry, Dad, Fred.
I'll be right there.

Yes, yes, they are.
Horrible stuff!

1415
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,081

I told you, no?

1542
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,281
(ALL CHEERING)

1543
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,967
Wow!

1544
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,205
(CHEERING)

1545
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,046
Now go forth and deliver!

1546
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,441
Woohoo!

1548
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,367
Wonderful brunch, Bonnie.

1549
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,567
Thank you, dear.

1550
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,244
It is delicious.

1551
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,645
Totally agree.
This is amazing, Mom.

1552
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,487
You should open a restaurant.
I'm serious.

1553
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,767
That is a very nice
thing to say, Fred.

1554
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,049
And can I say that
I love your costume?

1555
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,243
I think it is so cheerful.

1556
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,685
Thanks, Mom.

1557
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,206
But it's a uniform.

1559
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,401
I'm so tired.

1560
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,569
Yeah, you were up very late
delivering pizzas.

1561
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,131
Easter baskets.

1562
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,885
Every time you say
"Easter baskets,"
I hear "pizza."

1563
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,365
It just helps me cope.

1564
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,283
Guys,
can we not do this today?

1566
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,205
Oh, they're here.

1567
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,045
This is exciting.

1568
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,809
That is my
co-Easter Bunny.

1569
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,565
Hey, why don't you
guys come see me off?
It'll be fun.

1570
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,162
Well, that's weird.
Who do you think it is?

1571
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,045
I don't know.

1572
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,921
Wow.

1573
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,121
HENRY: Fred.

1574
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,201
Fred, wait.

1575
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,525
This is

1576
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,606
amazing!

1577
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,165
I know, right?

1578
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,284
It's pretty cool, huh?

1579
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,047
(SIGHS) I'm sorry I gave
you such a hard time.

1580
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,526
Aw, Dad, come on.
You don't have to...

1581
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,204
I'm proud of you.

1582
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,971
Thanks, Dad.

1583
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,365
Easter Bunny.

1584
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,686
Wow!

1585
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,525
The one who
makes it all happen.

1586
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,367
Say the words, Fred.
Bring it home.

1587
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,002
Happy Easter to all!
And to all,
a good mid-to-late morning.

On Biscuit and Buzzy!

On Feathers and Carlos.

1591
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,961
E. B.: Yeah, come on, Carlos.
Put your back into it.

1592
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,200
I've been flapping all night,
so just cut me
some slacks, okay?

1593
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,323
One little <i>coup</i>
and suddenly I'm
everybody's chump.

Was that about me?

1597

You speak Chinese?
Just when I think I
can't love you any more...
