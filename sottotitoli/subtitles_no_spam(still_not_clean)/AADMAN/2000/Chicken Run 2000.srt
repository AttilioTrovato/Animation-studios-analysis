2
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,500
l'm stuck.

3
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,300
Get back!

4
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,430
Mr. Tweedy!

5
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,650
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

6
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,860
l don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!

7
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,670
l'll teach you
to make a fool out of me.

8
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Let that be a lesson to you!

9
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,590
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

10
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,250
Morning, Ginger.

11
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,460
Back from holiday?
- l wasn't on holiday.

12
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,300
l was in solitary confinement.

13
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
lt's nice to get a bit of time
to yourself, isn't it?

14
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,810
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.

15
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,150
Pip, pip. Quick march.

16
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,650
Left right ...

17
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,690
Come on, smarten up!

18
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,650
Discipline! Order!

19
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,610
Back in my RAF days,
when an officer called for a scramble,

20
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,080
you'd hop in the old crate
and chocks away!

21
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,660
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

22
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,000
How dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer!

23
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,960
Back in my RAF days ...
- Fowler, they're coming.

24
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,300
Right, right!

25
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,300
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.

26
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,890
Attention!

27
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,980
Welcome back, hen.
ls there a new plan?

28
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,250
We've already tried going under.

29
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,670
Over. Right.

30
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,690
How's the egg count?
- l laid 5 eggs today.

31
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,310
Well chuffed with that, l was.

32
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,160
Oh no.

33
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,080
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.

34
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,080
She didn't tell anyone.

35
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,260
ls Edwina off on holiday?

36
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,030
We've got to get out of here.

37
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,410
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.

38
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,880
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.

39
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,110
You called?

40
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,030
Nick and ...
- Fetcher. - At your service.

41
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,250
Over here.

42
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,340
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.

43
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,720
How about this quality tea set?

44
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,630
A lovely necklace and pendant.

45
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,470
Or this number. All the rage in
the fashionable Paris chicken coops.

46
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,560
Simply pop it on,
and as the French say: "Voila!"

47
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,230
That is French.

48
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,940
lt's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.

49
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,740
Madame, you look like a vision,
like a dream.

50
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,780
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

51
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,580
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?

52
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,420
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.

53
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,590
This will cost.
- The usual: one bag of seed.

54
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,210
You call this pay?
- lt's chicken feed.

55
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,220
What could we give you?
- Eggs.

56
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,800
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.

57
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,600
So are we.

58
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,180
After you, Fetcher.

59
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
After l what?

60
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,730
Move!

61
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,800
Stupid, worthless creatures!

62
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,510
l'm sick and tired
of making minuscule profits.

63
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,040
Oh, yes.

64
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,830
Those chickens are up to something.

65
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,130
Quiet.
l'm onto something.

66
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,040
They're organized.

67
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,880
Quiet!
- That ginger one

68
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,470
is their leader.

69
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,640
l may have found a way
to make some real money.

70
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,930
What are you on about? Ridiculous
notions of escaping chickens.

71
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,060
lt's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.

72
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,570
lt's all in my head.

73
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,440
Now you keep telling yourself that,

74
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,870
because l won't hear another word
about it. ls that clear?

75
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,330
Yes, luv.

76
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,700
But the ginger one!

77
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,660
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you,

78
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,750
they're the most stupid creatures
on the planet!

79
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,630
They don't plot,
they don't scheme,

80
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,130
and they're not organized!

81
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,800
Order! Order!

82
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,100
Quiet, everyone.

83
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,010
Settle down.

84
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,270
l would like to call to order ...
- Quiet!

85
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,900
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!

86
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,110
Thank you, Fowler.
- ln my RAF days, we never wasted time

87
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,450
with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.

88
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,830
Right.

89
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,580
Carry on.

90
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,630
Our last escape attempt
was a bit of a fiasco,

91
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,340
but Mac and l have a new plan.

92
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,930
Show them, Mac. - We tried going
under that wire, and it didn't work.

93
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,600
So the plan is: we go

94
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,600
over it.

95
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,440
This is us, right?
We get in like this

96
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,190
and wind her up, and

97
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,320
let her go!

98
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,950
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.

99
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,290
Farmer's coming!

100
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,000
Operation Cover-Up!

101
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,660
Mr. Tweedy,

102
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,240
where are you?

103
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,080
lt's all in your head.

104
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,550
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?

105
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,300
We haven't tried
not trying to escape.

106
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,260
Might work.

107
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,060
What about Edwina?

108
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,940
How many more empty nests
will it take?

109
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,060
Maybe she should have spent more time
laying eggs

110
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,030
and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs,

111
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,700
then getting plucked and roasted
is good enough for you?

112
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,990
lt's a living.

113
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,950
The fences aren't just
around the farm.

114
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,080
They're up here in your heads.

115
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,670
There is a better place out there.

116
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,750
Somewhere beyond that hill,

117
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,590
it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees.

118
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,590
And grass. Can you imagine that?

119
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,220
Cool, green grass.

120
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,890
Who feeds us?

121
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,730
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?

122
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,270
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?

123
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,360
There is no farmer.
- ls he on holiday?

124
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,980
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?

125
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,610
No egg count,
no farmers, no dogs,

126
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,200
no coops and keys
and no fences!

127
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,750
ln all my life
l've never heard such a fantastic

128
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,870
load of tripe!

129
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,340
Face the facts, ducks.

130
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,210
The chance of us getting out
are a million to one.

131
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,090
Then there's still a chance!

132
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,700
Oh, no!

133
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,370
Who am l fooling?
l can't lead this bunch of ...

134
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,210
Heaven help us.

135
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,060
Freedom!

136
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a wonderful audience.

137
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,560
That's it.

138
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,520
lnside, quickly!

139
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,690
Here's our way out!

140
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,570
We'll make posters?

141
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,490
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.

142
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,620
Must be important to be on a poster.
l wonder what he does.

143
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,920
Obviously,
he's a professional flying rooster.

144
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,630
Flies around giving demonstrations.

145
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,170
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!

146
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,720
No, not in there!

147
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,590
Get out!

148
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,440
Who are you? Where am l?
What happened to my wing?

149
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,270
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon

150
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,360
connecting the radius to the humerus.
l wrapped it.

151
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,280
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.

152
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,450
l made the bandage.
- l carried you in.

153
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,370
Back up and start from the top.
Where am l?

154
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,800
How rude of us. We're just excited ...
This is a chicken farm.

155
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,880
And we're the chickens.

156
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,680
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.

157
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,050
l don't like his look.

158
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,310
His eyes are too close together.

159
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,560
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's
illegal where l come from.

160
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,610
Where is that? - A place l call
home of the free, land of the brave.

161
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,110
Scotland!

162
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,110
No! America.

163
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,700
Poppycock!

164
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,160
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.

165
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,750
Overpaid, oversexed
and over here.

166
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,880
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister ...

167
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,880
My name's Rocky, the Rhode lsland Red.
Rhodes for short.

168
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,670
Rocky Rhodes!

169
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,630
Catchy, ain't it?

170
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

171
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,100
Who wants to know?

172
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,100
A group of desperate chickens.
lf it's you,

173
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
you may be the answer to our prayers.

174
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,860
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.

175
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,990
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?

176
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,040
All the beautiful English chicks,
of course.

177
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,290
Give over!

178
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,590
l'm a traveler.
l did that barnyard thing for a while,

179
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,630
but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?

180
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,970
Nope!

181
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,640
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back

182
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,810
and point me where the wind blows.

183
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,890
Know what they call me back home?

184
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,900
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.

185
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,820
lsn't that great?

186
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,490
l knew it was possible.
- lt's possible!

187
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,280
The answer had to come!
- Amen!

188
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,950
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?

189
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,330
That's ri ... What?
Did you say "fly?"

190
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,290
You can teach us.
- No, l can't.

191
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,210
Listen! You hear that?

192
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,260
The open road's calling,
and l have to answer.

193
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
Bye.

194
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,220
He must have very good hearing.

195
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,970
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.

196
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,440
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps l didn't explain
our situation properly.

197
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,820
We lay eggs, day in, day out.

198
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,650
When we can't lay any more,
they kill us.

199
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,990
lt's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.

200
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,030
Which part of "they kill us"
don't you understand?

201
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,160
l got my own set of problems.

202
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,830
Besides, it can't be
that hard to bust out of here.

203
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,370
Watch me.

204
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,920
lt's not so hard for a chicken or two
to get out, but it's about all of us.

205
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,970
All of you? - l've been trying
to tell you. - Let's get it straight.

206
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,140
You want to get every chicken
out of here at once?

207
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,270
Of course.
- You're certifiable.

208
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,190
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

209
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,740
Couldn't agree more.
And l will be leaving. That way.

210
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,450
Mr. Rhodes, please!

211
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,760
So that's it.
You're from the circus.

212
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,730
You're on the run, aren't you?

213
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,400
Keep it down!
l'm trying to lay low here.

214
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,860
l should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.

215
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,070
Would you?
- Why not?

216
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,660
Because l'm cute?

217
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,200
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!

218
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,500
You know what'll happen
if he finds me? - lt's a cruel world.

219
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,250
l don't like you.
- l don't care.

220
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,380
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.

221
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,350
He's valuable, you say?

222
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,810
Sure.
- Get the torch.

223
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,980
Listen here, sister.
l'm not going back to that life.

224
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,980
l'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."

225
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,900
And that's what we want ...
freedom.

226
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,910
Fancy that, they're coming.

227
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,030
Oh, no! They're onto me!

228
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,120
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if l don't?

229
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,000
Was your father by any chance
a vulture?

230
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,790
Do we have a deal?

231
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,900
Time to make good on that deal,
dollface. - The name is Ginger.

232
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,500
Comfortable?
- Not really.

233
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,840
Maybe this will help.

234
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,300
Nice hideout.
l had more room in my egg.

235
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,930
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.

236
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,970
What deal?
- Flying.

237
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,810
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
l'll teach you everything l know.

238
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,190
Which bunk is mine?

239
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,280
Absolutely outrageous!

240
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,240
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters.

241
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,240
And with a non-commissioned Yank,
no less!

242
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,450
Why, back in my day ...

243
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,370
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

244
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,500
Scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

245
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,590
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!

246
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,840
What is that smell?
ls that your breath?

247
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,100
Absolutely outrageous!

248
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,610
So you want to fly, huh?

249
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,820
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And
it ain't going to happen overnight.

250
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,860
Flying takes three things:
hard work,

251
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,030
perseverance and

252
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,160
hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!

253
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,660
Because it takes twice as much
hard work as perseverance.

254
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,960
Codswallop!

255
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,630
Cocky Yanks
think they know it all.

256
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,880
The most important thing is
we have to work as a team.

257
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,010
Which means,
you do everything l tell you.

258
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,270
Let's rock 'n roll.

259
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,100
The chickens are ...

260
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,520
... pecking?

261
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,240
And left, two, three.

262
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,360
And right, two, three.

263
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,320
And stop right there.

264
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,950
Yes, down.

265
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,250
Make little circles.

266
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,160
Faster.

267
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,420
Oh, that's the spot!

268
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,930
l thought
you were going to teach us to fly.

269
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,520
That's what l'm doing.

270
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,650
lsn't there usually
some flapping involved?

271
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,730
Do l tell you how to lay eggs?

272
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,570
Relax.
We're making progress.

273
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,490
Really? l can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

274
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,080
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.

275
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,460
They're ready to fly now.

276
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,920
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.

277
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,210
Up and at 'em!

278
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,760
Let's flap.

279
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,100
Let's see if old Attila the Hen
has come to her senses.

280
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,900
lt's raining hen!

281
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,780
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.

282
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,080
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.

283
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,670
Want to watch?
- All right.

284
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,310
Careful of those eggs!

285
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,810
Sunny-side up.

286
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,320
Now over easy.

287
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,950
Definitely scrambled.

288
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,370
Poultry in motion.

289
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,720
Birds of a feather
flop together.

290
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,230
Great work, ladies.

291
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,690
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing.

292
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,530
Pain is your friend.

293
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,620
Just keep the faith ...
Agnes. You'll get there.

294
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,740
You flew four feet today.

295
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.

296
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,670
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little ...

297
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,840
That doesn't sound good.

298
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,470
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?

299
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,550
Are we worried?

300
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,020
The circus! Quick! Hide me!

301
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,270
Hide me!
- Come on.

302
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,070
One isn't awarded a medal

303
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,360
for flapping about like a lunatic.

304
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,410
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!

305
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,620
ln here!
- Get out of here now!

306
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,910
Give it a rest, Pops!

307
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,830
What? l shall have you
on charges within the week!

308
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Cheers, mate.

309
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,260
lt's all in your head.

310
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
What's all this?

311
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,310
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

312
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,270
No more wasting time
with petty egg collection

313
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,030
and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?

314
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,110
We've always been egg farmers.
My father,

315
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,990
his father and their fathers.
They were always ...

316
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,830
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!

317
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,910
But that's about to change.

318
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,420
This will take Tweedy's farm
out of the Dark Ages

319
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,510
and into full-scale
automated production.

320
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,470
Melisha Tweedy
will be poor no longer.

321
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,430
l'll put it together,
shall l?

322
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,860
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.

323
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,150
And l doubt it's softer than hay.

324
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,780
l hate to be the voice of doom,

325
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,620
but l've been calculating.
l don't think we're built for flying.

326
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,330
But l saw him!
He flew in over that fence!

327
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,460
l believe you,

328
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,800
but if we could see it for ourselves
it might answer some questions.

329
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,340
You're right. We've been at this
all week. We're getting nowhere.

330
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,050
lf his wing were better ...
l'll talk to him.

331
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,400
Where is he?

332
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,730
They didn't give me this medal
for being a Yank nanny.

333
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,150
"l don't know" would suffice.

334
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,780
Beware of that one,
young Ginger.

335
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,620
That Yank is not to be trusted.

336
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,580
That Yank
is our ticket out of here.

337
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"

338
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,510
Cocktail!

339
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,220
Give over!

340
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,310
So anyway ...

341
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,860
Remember those flying tips.

342
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,070
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.

343
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,030
They're swell chicks.

344
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,200
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
lsn't that cute?

345
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,920
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.

346
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,420
A problem?

347
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,210
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.

348
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,380
Good things come to those who wait.

349
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,230
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.

350
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,480
Apples and oranges.
l'm gifted, they're not.

351
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,110
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.

352
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,700
Which we're running out of. Why
haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.

353
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,330
l went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.

354
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,630
l didn't get a word of that.

355
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,130
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off,
what do they have?

356
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,680
She ain't using real words.

357
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,720
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!

358
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,810
Sure. Thrust and flying
are like this.

359
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,430
Flying and thrust.

360
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,770
Will you excuse us?

361
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,610
The wing!

362
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,110
No results by tomorrow,
and the deal's off.

363
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,280
No more hiding. The farmers'll find
you and back to the circus, fly boy.

364
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,870
You're the first chick l ever met
with the shell still on.

365
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,420
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

366
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,720
What? What?

367
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,180
A beaut. A fine piece of work.

368
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,940
lf l do say so myself.

369
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,020
l say so myself, too.
- Wish l'd seen it.

370
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,280
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.

371
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,860
And we ...

372
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,530
Like a fish?

373
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,330
You stupid idiot!

374
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,450
Anyway, here it is.

375
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,000
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.

376
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,290
What're these two crooks doing here?

377
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,460
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.

378
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,340
You guys are

379
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,260
the sneakiest,
thieving parasites l've ever met.

380
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,220
Don't. Stop it.
- l've gone bright red.

381
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,180
So, how about the eggs?

382
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,390
Eggs? You promised them ...

383
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,100
Yep, l promised them
every egg l lay this month.

384
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,440
When can we expect
the first one?

385
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,190
l'm brewing one up now.
l'll keep you posted.

386
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,360
A pleasure doing business
with you.

387
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,530
Sucker.

388
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,410
What?
- You lied to them.

389
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,250
l didn't lie, dollface.
l just omitted certain truths.

390
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,920
l'll give them what l promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.

391
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,510
And what will you give us?

392
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,260
Thrust.

393
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,510
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

394
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,600
Now this will get you going.
lt's a thrust exercise.

395
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,400
The tension's killing me.
- lt's gonna kill her.

396
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,900
Release!

397
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,580
Come on, flap!

398
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
You can do it. Flap!

399
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,640
ls that your first of-fence?

400
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,570
Roll call!

401
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,570
l haven't laid any eggs.

402
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,200
Three days, not one.

403
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,330
Why didn't you tell us?
- l was so busy flying ...

404
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,540
They're coming!
- Hide me!

405
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Hide yourself!

406
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,480
Double their food rations.

407
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,860
l want them all as fat as this one.

408
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,820
All of my life
flashed before my eyes.

409
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,790
lt was really boring.

410
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,620
Chicken feed!

411
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,960
My favorite!

412
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,790
Wait!

413
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,180
No, wait!

414
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,310
Babs, please! Bunty.

415
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,680
Stop it! Wait!

416
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,640
Stop!

417
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,190
Stop it!

418
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,030
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?

419
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,040
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying,

420
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,830
but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.

421
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,290
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.

422
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,250
They're going to kill us all!

423
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,760
Heavy alert!

424
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,720
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.

425
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,810
What are you doing?

426
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,850
Let go!

427
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,400
l've met some hard-boiled eggs before,
but you're about 20 minutes.

428
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,480
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.

429
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,950
ln America we have a rule:
To motivate someone,

430
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,820
don't mention death!

431
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,740
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!

432
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
lt's been working like a charm.

433
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,290
You want them to perform,
tell them what they want to hear.

434
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,420
You mean lie?

435
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,340
Here we go again.

436
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,220
Know what your problem is?
You're ... difficult.

437
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,510
Why? Because l'm honest?

438
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,640
l care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger

439
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,730
doesn't know about.
- Then l hope you never care about me.

440
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,480
l never will.
- Good. - Fine.

441
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,110
What's all this?

442
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,410
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.

443
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,870
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.

444
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,750
Solid as a rock.

445
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,040
lt's supposed to do that.

446
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,420
Perfect, guys.

447
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,470
How's that egg coming?

448
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,890
This is a double yolker.

449
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,810
l don't see what it has to do with ...
- You will.

450
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,280
We've been working hard. Let's relax
and shake those tail feathers.

451
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,860
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a ...

452
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Good heavens!

453
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,870
What's happening?

454
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,450
That's called a beat. Feel it

455
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,330
pulsing through your body?

456
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,580
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?

457
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,920
Then go with it, baby!

458
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,800
Look, l'm going with it!

459
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,260
Bunty, what's got into you?

460
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,810
Same thing that's got into you.

461
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,770
Just go with the flow.

462
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,200
l don't recall
authorizing a hop.

463
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,410
Shut up and dance.

464
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,000
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

465
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,130
Little moments like this ...

466
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,880
it's what makes the job
all worthwhile.

467
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,930
Want to dance?

468
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,470
Yeah, all right.

469
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,440
Did you see that? l flew!

470
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,070
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.

471
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,110
Your wing! lt's better!

472
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,240
How about that?
- Fantastic!

473
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,660
You can fly for us tomorrow.

474
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,040
Yeah, so it seems.

475
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,290
l flew!

476
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,830
l owe you an apology.

477
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,170
l didn't think you cared,
but after all this ...

478
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,090
Well, it seems l was wrong.

479
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,010
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

480
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,550
l might think you're turning soft.

481
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,270
Listen.
l have to tell you something.

482
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,820
No! You'd better wait.

483
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,440
That's champion ...
What is it?

484
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,440
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens

485
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,190
go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?

486
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,650
Apple.

487
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:22,950
My favorite.

488
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,160
Chicken pies, you lummox!
lmagine:

489
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,710
ln less than a fortnight, every grocer
will be stocked with boxes

490
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,920
of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.

491
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,720
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.

492
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,840
Oh, right. How does it work?

493
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,220
Get me a chicken,
and l'll show you.

494
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,060
l know just the one.

495
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,900
l've got a score to settle with you.

496
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,480
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

497
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,700
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!

498
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,630
Quiet, l say!
Let's have some discipline!

499
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,540
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls

500
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,260
for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?

501
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,350
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!

502
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,510
What are you waiting for, laddie?

503
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,350
Fly over there. Save her.

504
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,940
Of course! No!

505
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,400
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!

506
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,570
And catch Jerry
with his trousers down!

507
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,650
l like that. What's the plan?

508
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:48,110
The plan ...

509
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,120
The plan ... Babs!

510
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,450
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

511
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,010
Look at the size of that thing.

512
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,470
Oh, no.

513
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,100
Chickens go in,

514
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,360
pies come out.

515
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,070
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.

516
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,990
Chicken!

517
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,620
Great! Brilliant!

518
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,130
Yo! Baby doll!

519
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,920
l'm coming!
- Hurry!

520
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,130
l'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!

521
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,300
l'm getting there.

522
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,470
Shoot!

523
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,270
l'll be down before you can say ...

524
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,520
mixed vegetables?

525
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,840
D'oh! Get it?

526
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,960
Dough.
- l'm stuck!

527
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,760
Nothing to it.

528
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,650
Hang on.

529
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,160
Look out.

530
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,650
lt's like an oven in here.

531
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,080
Come on!

532
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,620
Wait!

533
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,080
Go over to the ...

534
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,680
The door! Come on!

535
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,250
She's gonna blow! Run!

536
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,300
What did you do,
you great pudding? - Nothing.

537
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,640
Turn it off!
- lt won't turn off!

538
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,210
We've got to show the others. Come on!

539
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,430
Look. l fixed it.

540
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,810
Chicken pies?

541
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,900
Yes, but ...

542
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,820
l don't want to be a pie!

543
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,160
l don't like gravy.

544
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,450
Ladies,
let's not lose our heads.

545
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,120
Lose our heads?

546
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:58,340
What l meant was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

547
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,510
And better still,
he's going to fly for us tomorrow.

548
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,720
Once we see how,
l know we'll get it.

549
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:11,060
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything
is going to go much smoother.

550
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,700
Alright, Pops,
what did l do now?

551
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,200
A very brave and honorable deed.

552
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,750
ln the light of your action today,

553
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,750
l dutifully admit
that l misjudged your character.

554
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,920
l present you
with this medal for bravery.

555
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,760
And l salute you.

556
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,020
ln honor of this occasion,

557
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,890
l surrender the bunk entirely.

558
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,360
l shall sleep under the stars.

559
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,280
l await tomorrow's flying
demonstration with great anticipation.

560
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,290
You and me both, Pops.

561
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,380
Oh, were you ...?
- ls this your ...?

562
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,970
Since you're here ...
- l'm glad you're here ...

563
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,890
You go first.
- You go ahead.

564
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:35,480
l just wanted to say, l may have been
a bit harsh at first ...

565
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,020
What l really mean is ...

566
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,780
thank you

567
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,450
for saving my life.

568
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,070
For saving our lives.

569
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:50,080
You know,
l come up here every night

570
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,660
and look at that hill, imagining
what it's like on the other side.

571
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,250
lt's funny ...

572
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,710
l've never actually felt grass
beneath my feet. l'm sorry.

573
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,130
l'm rambling on about grass,
and you had something to say.

574
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,810
lt's just that ...

575
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,190
life, as l've experienced it,
out there

576
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,020
lone free-ranging and stuff ...

577
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,110
lt's full of disappointments.

578
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,030
So grass isn't all
it's cracked up to be?

579
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:30,120
Grass! Exactly.
lt's always greener on the other side.

580
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,660
And then you get there,

581
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,790
and it's brown and prickly.
See what l'm saying?

582
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,960
What l'm trying to say is ...

583
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,760
you're welcome.

584
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:55,060
You know, that hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

585
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,780
Good night, Rocky.

586
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,440
Good night,

587
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,570
Ginger.

588
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,600
Company, attention!

589
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,070
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. l can feel it.

590
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,820
Finally, we get to see
a professional in action.

591
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,570
Start warming up. l'll go get him.

592
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,290
Rocky? Knock, knock.

593
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,040
Everyone's waiting, so l told them ...

594
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,610
A cannon.

595
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:54,570
That'd give you a thrust.
- l knew he was fake all along.

596
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,410
ln fact, l'm not even sure
if he was American.

597
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,830
What's the next plan?

598
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,750
Face it. The only way we get out
is wrapped in pastry.

599
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,630
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away

600
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,340
from your infernal knitting!

601
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,560
You always hit him.
See how you like it.

602
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,470
Don't push me, four-eyes!

603
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,640
Quiet!

604
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,560
Quiet, l say! Dissention

605
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,780
in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.

606
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,150
A proper squadron work together,

607
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,990
just like we did in my RAF days.

608
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,540
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map,
and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.

609
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,960
Wingco would give the call, hop in
the old crate, chocks away!

610
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,580
That's how you get medals!

611
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,840
Will you shut up
about your stupid bloomin' medals!

612
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,930
How dare you!

613
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,140
Forgive me.
As an officer ...

614
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,170
Everyone, shut up!

615
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,060
What exactly is the RAF?

616
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,230
What do you mean?

617
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,230
The Royal Air Force is what.

618
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,690
Then what's the "old crate"?

619
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,530
There she is!

620
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,410
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean,
you flew? ln one of these?

621
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:09,500
Beautifully built. ln fact,
there's a bit of a story there.

622
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:14,340
We were on a reconnaissance flight,
when the weather duffed up.

623
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,670
Yes ... of course.

624
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,420
We may be able to pull this off.

625
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,550
We're still flying out of here.

626
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,970
Fowler's provided the answer.
- l have?

627
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,430
Oh, yes. Of course l have.

628
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:32,850
How have l?

629
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,020
We'll make a crate.

630
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,230
Mac,

631
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,320
you'll handle engineering.

632
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,150
Babs, manufacturing.

633
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,780
Fowler is
chief aviation adviser.

634
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,530
Bunty, eggs.

635
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,200
Eggs?

636
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,210
Right. Like the ones
the rooster was going to lay.

637
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,380
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

638
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:59,050
Don't they? - lt's a lady thing,
apparently. Ask your mum.

639
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,590
One egg per item on the list.

640
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,720
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?

641
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,110
What the dickens?

642
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,910
Oh, gnomes now!

643
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,090
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.

644
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,200
ldiot!

645
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,500
That was close. Too close.

646
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,800
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.

647
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,130
Go, go!

648
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,470
Mac! We need the calculations quick.

649
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:12,140
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

650
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,850
Careful up there, Fowler!

651
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:19,190
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!

652
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,940
No problem, dollface.

653
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,070
Ah, boy.

654
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,080
Come on.

655
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,580
Please!

656
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,590
Oh, no.

657
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,170
He's fixed it.

658
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,350
Get the chickens.

659
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,100
Which ones?

660
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:39,810
All of them!

661
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,150
My tools!

662
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,360
Thieving little buggers.

663
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,870
What's the plan?

664
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,330
Attack!

665
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,370
Nice plan.

666
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,220
The chickens are revolting!

667
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,310
Finally, something we agree on.

668
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,770
Help!

669
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,190
Under the hut!

670
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,490
What have we done?
- This is it.

671
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,410
We're escaping!

672
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,870
What? Now?

673
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,290
Now!

674
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,040
But she's not ready.
- Listen!

675
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:48,630
We either die free chickens
or die trying.

676
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,090
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!

677
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,680
Scramble!

678
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,820
The exits are located here and here.

679
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:56,110
ln the likely event of an emergency,
put your head between your knees ...

680
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,700
... and kiss your bum goodbye.

681
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,950
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.

682
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,790
Behind you all the way.

683
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,420
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!

684
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,380
Don't be ridiculous.
l can't fly this contraption.

685
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,550
But back in your day ...
the Royal Air Force.

686
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:21,470
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.

687
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,140
You mean you never flew the plane?

688
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,640
Good heavens, no. l'm a chicken.

689
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:34,230
The Royal Air Force doesn't let
chickens fly a complex aircraft!

690
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:37,940
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.

691
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,530
You always talk about
"back in your day."

692
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,990
Well, today is your day.

693
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,700
You can do it, you old sausage.

694
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,710
Wing Commander T.l.Fowler,
reporting for duty.

695
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:01,840
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!

696
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,640
Fowler, now!

697
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,060
Roger! Contact!

698
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,950
Cleared for takeoff!

699
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,580
Chocks away!

700
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,760
Full throttle!

701
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,620
We need more power!

702
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,490
l can't work miracles.

703
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:11,040
We're givin' her all she's got!

704
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,010
Gotcha!

705
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,760
Hard right!

706
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,800
Oh, mother.

707
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,770
Turn her around.
l'll get the ramp.

708
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,990
Put the ramp down!

709
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,750
You are going to be a pie.

710
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,330
Look out!

711
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,000
Clear the runway!

712
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,730
Let's go!

713
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,070
We're flying!

714
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,250
That's for leaving.

715
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,540
And this is for coming back.

716
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,720
Great Scott! What was that?

717
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:31,470
A cling-on!

718
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:34,310
The engines can't take it!

719
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,390
My goodness!

720
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,270
Babs! Scissors!

721
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,360
Lower me down.
- But ... - Just do it.

722
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,450
lncrease velocity!

723
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:54,620
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!

724
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,880
Lower!
- l'm trying!

725
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,850
Look out!

726
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,830
Fire! Fire!

727
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,540
My eggs!

728
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,390
More ammo! Hurry!

729
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,720
We got no more eggs!

730
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,390
Look out!

731
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,030
No!

732
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,250
Bombs away!

733
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,130
Mr. Tweedy!

734
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,180
That was good! That was good!

735
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,010
The old bird bought it!

736
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,640
l told you they was organized.

737
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,730
We did it, everyone!

738
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:58,720
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.

739
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,060
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal.

740
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,690
Put your drumsticks into it.

741
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:20,280
That's what l told them. We were
losing altitude, heading for ...

742
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,240
A lovely holiday.
l'll be sad to go back.

743
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,210
Safety at all times is imperative.

744
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,040
Wind her up and let her go.

745
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,670
So ...

746
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:37,260
ls it as good as you imagined?
- No.

747
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,050
lt's better.

748
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,890
l'll show you how to play cricket.

749
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,690
Here's a thought.

750
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,860
Let's get an egg
and start our own chicken farm.

751
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:58,690
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.

752
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,450
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.

753
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,330
That's where the chicken comes from.

754
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,660
No. Without the chicken
where do you get the egg?

755
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,620
From a chicken ...
that comes from the egg.

756
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,880
But you need an egg to have a chicken.

757
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:18,010
You got to get the chicken first
to get the egg.

758
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,170
Then you get the chicken.

759
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,840
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

760
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:31,110
He gets everything. - Everything.
- You said it, mate! - l know.

761
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,390
The egg, obviously.

762
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,720
Rolling along happily, then crack!
lt hatches the first chicken.

763
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,230
But where'd the egg come from?

764
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:06,110
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling
along happily and wonders,

765
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:11,910
where'd it come from without
a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.

766
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:17,740
Without an egg to hatch the chicken
there'll be no chicken

767
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:23,580
to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.

768
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:27,340
What about the first chicken?
- lt's in the very first egg.

769
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,420
Guys!

770
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,880
l'm trying to enjoy paradise.

771
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:36,600
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.

772
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:38,100
Thanks.

773
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,560
Gitface.
- Pillock.

774
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,350
Thinks he's such a big shot,
'cause his name's on a poster.

775
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,570
They're all the same.
- The rats are the stars.

776
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,280
Yes, we do all the hard work,
and he gets all the credit.
