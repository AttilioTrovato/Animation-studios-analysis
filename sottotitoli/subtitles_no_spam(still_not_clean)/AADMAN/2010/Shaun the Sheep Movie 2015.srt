00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,983
<i>Time of our lives, wonder of surprise</i>

2
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,275
<i>The open blue skies</i>

3
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,650
<i>Reflecting in our eyes</i>

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,650
<i>In a perfect place, see the sunny days</i>

5
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,358
<i>Coming into view</i>

6
00:00:56,458 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>'Cause every day feels
like summer with you</i>

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,400
<i>Everything feels right starting anew</i>

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,108
<i>Every day feels like summer with you</i>

9
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,165
<i>Oh</i>

10
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,858
<i>Once you were here
my worries disappeared</i>

11
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,316
<i>It all became clear</i>

12
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,233
<i>Nothing left to fear</i>

13
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,124
<i>Beyond any price, pure as paradise</i>

14
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:28,441
<i>Coming into view</i>

15
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:32,441

17
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:40,108
<i>Every day feels like summer with you</i>

18
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,775
<i>Oh</i>

19
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:04,997
Baa!

20
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,290
Meeeh!

21
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,082
Meeeh!

22
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Baa!

23
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,150
<i>You're mine</i>

24
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,499
<i>Oh, baby</i>

25
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,082
Hey!

26
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,165
Meeeh!

27
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,415
Meeeh!

28
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,790
Baa?

29
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,401
Hey!

30
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,275
<i>Get your rocks off,
get your rocks off, honey</i>

31
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,707
<i>Shake it now now, get 'em off downtown</i>

32
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,457
<i>Get your rocks off...</i>

33
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,124
Ooh. Hey. Oh!

34
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,124
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,540
What?

36
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:01,456
Yeah.

37
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,790
Yeah?

38
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,374
Nah.

39
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,358
Yeah? Yeah?

40
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,749
No.

41
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,874
Hey!

42
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,957
<i>You've got to search
for the hero inside yourself</i>

43
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,665
<i>Search for the secrets you hide...</i>

44
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,707
Shall we?

45
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,082
<i>You're mine</i>

46
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,832
<i>Oh, baby</i>

47
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,233
<i>Yeah</i>

48
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,540
<i>Mine</i>

49
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,290
<i>Yeah</i>

50
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,874
<i>In a city this big
it's easy to not exist</i>

51
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,566
<i>But that's a problem
you don't seem to get</i>

52
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,691
<i>When you roll like this</i>

53
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:34,290
<i>You left home a short time ago
but it seems so long</i>

54
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:39,358
<i>We've only seen this in magazines
and it looked like fun</i>

55
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:43,316
<i>Every doubletake, every false start,
every wrong move we make</i>

56
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:47,650
<i>Start again, never at the end
It's a risk we take</i>

57
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,525
<i>Scary things happen right here
all day and night</i>

58
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,290
<i>But who cares when you look like us
you're gonna be all right</i>

59
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:59,316
<i>We won't come this far
to get nothing back</i>

60
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:03,733
<i>You can't stop us getting what we want</i>

61
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,358
<i>We will find what we want in the city</i>

62
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:11,858
<i>And we're really fitting in around here</i>

63
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:15,983
<i>We're feeling pretty hot in the city</i>

64
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:20,233
<i>From the way we walk
the walk is pretty clear</i>

65
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:24,775
<i>We're making it in the big city</i>

66
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,775
<i>And you know
it's always gonna throw it down</i>

67
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:32,775
<i>Down, down
So step aside, people, we're coming</i>

68
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,858
<i>'Cause we pretty much own this town</i>

69
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,816
<i>This, this, this town
Yeah</i>

70
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,499
<i>We're looking at you
but it's like you're with someone else</i>

71
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,983
<i>In the heart of the city
we could easily lose ourselves</i>

72
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:52,358
<i>In between making us sing,
we gotta see this through</i>

73
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:55,483
<i>We can't stop to make it to the top,
got a job to do</i>

74
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,691
<i>We won't come this far
to get nothing back</i>

75
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,415
<i>You can't stop us getting what we want</i>

76
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,525
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

77
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,108
<i>We're making it in the big city</i>

78
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,332
<i>And we're really fitting in around here</i>

79
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,707
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

80
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,124
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

81
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,707
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

82
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:52,231
No, no, no!

83
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,150
Hey!

84
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,249
No. No!

85
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,749
Hey.

86
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,040
Hey!

87
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,165
Ruff?

88
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:32,374
<i>She could tell right away
that I was bad to the bone</i>

89
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,749
<i>Bad to the bone</i>

90
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,082
- <i>Bad to the bone</i>
- Got you.

91
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,400
<i>B-b-b-b-bad</i>

92
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,691
<i>B-b-b-b-bad</i>

93
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,608
<i>B-b-b-b-bad</i>

94
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,858
<i>Bad to the bone</i>

95
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,233
<i>I broke a thousand hearts</i>

96
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,316
<i>Before I met you</i>

97
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,858
<i>I'll break a thousand more, baby...</i>

98
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:38,332
That one?

99
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,457
<i>I'm a wonderful thing, baby</i>

100
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,082
<i>Such a, such a</i>

101
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,874
<i>Wonderful</i>

102
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,165
<i>I'm a wonderful thing, baby</i>

103
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:14,332
<i>Such a, such a</i>

104
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:30,290
<i>I'm a wonderful thing, baby</i>

105
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:55,941
Baa!

106
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,457
Baa.

107
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:57,915
Baa?

108
00:52:11,544 --> 00:52:12,976
Shoo! Shoo!

109
00:52:21,395 --> 00:52:22,522
Shoo! Shoo!

110
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:36,247
Shoo!

111
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,566
<i>Wish I were with you</i>

112
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,207
<i>But I couldn't stay</i>

113
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:36,457
<i>Every direction leads me away</i>

114
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:46,790
<i>All I want</i>

115
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,749
<i>Is to be home</i>

116
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,874
<i>Stand in the mirror</i>

117
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:09,415
<i>You look the same</i>

118
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:17,858
<i>Just looking for shelter</i>

119
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:21,207
<i>From the cold and the pain</i>

120
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:31,582
<i>And all I want</i>

121
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:36,275
<i>Is to be home</i>

122
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,832
