WE'RE OKAY.
EVERYONE'S OKAY.
WEWE'RE OKAY. FINE.
ISN'T IT CUTE?
MY NEW JOB IS JUST
TEN MINUTES AWAY.
DID I TELL YOU THAT THE FERNFIELD NAPKIN FACTORY...
IS THE THIRD LARGEST MANUFACTURER
OF NAPKINS IN ALL NORTH AMERICA?
WHOOP, HERE WE ARE.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HIM STARTING
THREE MONTHS INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR.
HE DOESN'T MAKE FRIENDS
VERY EASILY.
NOT THAT HE'S NOT FRIENDLY.
IT'S JUST__ WELL, HE
DOESN'T TALK MUCH THESE DAYS.
YOU SEE, WHEN HIS DAD
PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR__
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT.
SO, ANYWAY...
I USED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AROUND
HERE BECAUSE MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED HERE.
SO I THOUGHT THAT THE MOVE WOULD REALLY BE
THE BEST THING FOR US, ESPECIALLY FOR JOSH.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M SURE HE'S GOING
TO DO VERY WELL HERE.
BUT TELL ME ABOUT
EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAMS.
DOES JOSH HAVE ANY INTERESTS
OR HOBBIES?
WELL, HE USED TO LIKE TO PLAY
BASKETBALL WITH HIS DAD,
BUT HE'S LOST INTEREST
IN THAT TOO.
WELL, LET'S SEE.
WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT BAND.
OH, I USED TO PLAY THE FLUTE WHEN I WAS HIS AGE.
THAT WAS FUN.
I THINK AN INSTRUMENT
WOULD BE JUST THE THING!
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T BLOW SO HARD.
OKAY, BLOW A LITTLE HARDER.
HEY, MIKE, PASS!
PICK UP. COME ON.
COME ON.
GO! COME ON, SHOOT!
SHOOT!
I KNOW, MOM.
IT'S NOT CALLED MOONLIGHTING.
OH, I FOUND IT.
YEAH, IT'S__

WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN THIS LAST YEAR.
BUT I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH IT.
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE.

YOUR DAD WOULD'VE WANTED IT
THAT WAY.
I GUESS.
SURE. HE WOULDN'T HAVE
WANTED YOU BEING ALL MOPEY.
I LOVE YOU.

HE'S NOT HUMAN.
HE'S A STRAY.

I'D TAKE CARE OF HIM.
JOSH, WE DON'T KNOW

HE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE POUND.
THREE WEEKS?

I GUESS I JUST LIKE
BASKETBALL.
WHOA!

A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY, CHILDREN.
WE'LL SEE YOU ALL

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

FRAMM, WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?
IT WAS IN MY LOCKER.
WELL,
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.
WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE
IF I TRIED OUT ANYWAY?
COACH, JUST LET HIM.

BUT IF YOU SLOW DOWN
MY TRYOUT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PULL YOU OUT.
FAST BREAK, FAST BREAK!
YES!
LOOK AT

A GREAT MASCOT?
IT WOULD BE GREAT
FOR SCHOOL SPIRIT!
BUDDY?
BUDDY.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA DROP
ANOTHER BALL AGAIN, STEWART.
YOU COULD DO THAT.
JUST MEET THE BALL.

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
JUST RUNNING TOM THROUGH A LITTLE DRILL.
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH, JOE.
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH.
GOOD BOY.

UHOH. FUMBLE.
THIS IS STUPID. LET'S

'CAUSE HE'S PLAYIN'

THIS BOY IS THE TEAM.
MAYBE HE IS TO A WORKEDUP FATHER,

SEE THAT DOG?
TOSS HIM THE BALL.
YEAH.
OKAY.
THAT DOG COULDN'T GIVE
A RAT'S BEHIND...

HE JUST LOVES TO PLAY
THE GAME.
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PLAYERS
IN THE PROS...
LIKE THAT GUY CHANEY,
FOR INSTANCE,
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
YOU MADE.
IF YOU'RE JUST OUT THERE
FOR YOURSELF, YOU LOSE.
IT'S ALL IN HERE, JOSH.
YOU GOTTA PLAY
FROM THE HEART.
THAT'S IT.
CONCENTRATE ON THE BALL.
GOOD. GOOD!
NOW YOU'RE GETTIN' IT.
YEAH!
THAT'S GREAT!
GO, BUDDY!
WE'RE HERE
AT FERNFIELD SCHOOL...

EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN THE TIMBERWOLVES'
MIRACULOUS MIDSEASON TURNAROUND...
IS THEIR MASCOT'S
INCREDIBLE ABILITIES.

I'LL TAKE
MY DOG BACK NOW.
HE DOESN'T WANNA GO WITH YOU.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THERE'S NO PROBLEM,
MS. FRAMM.
YOUR SON'S HAD
HIS LITTLE FUN.
NOW I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE ME BACK WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. SNIVELY,
I BELIEVE MY SON IS RIGHT.
THAT DOG DOESN'T LIKE YOU.
SO THE ANSWER IS NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHOICE, LADY.
I GOT PAPERS.
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.
SNIVELY VERSUS FRAMM.
THIS ONE OF YOUR
HIGHPROFILE DIVORCE CASES?
NO, SIR.
CUSTODY. OH, CUSTODY.
HOLY TOLEDO, WHAT IS THAT DOG
DOING IN THE COURTHOUSE?
THAT'S THE, UH, CHILD, SIR.
THAT'S A PRETTY UGLY KID.
IT'S A DOG.
WHAT?
THE CASE IS ABOUT
CUSTODY OF A DOG.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT,
BUT WE HAVE TO DO THIS SERIOUSLY.
I WILL NOT HAVE MY COURTROOM
TURNED INTO SOME KIND OF A CIRCUS.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
MR. NORMAN F. SNIVELY,
YOUR HONOR.
I'M THE PLAINTIFF.
YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.
WHY, THANK YOU, SIR.
SEE,
I'M A CLOWN BY PROFESSION.
HAPPY SLAPPY'S THE NAME.
CLOWN AND THE HOUND.
BEGGING YOUR HUMBLEST PARDON,
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOUR HONOR...
IF I APPEARED HERE TODAY IN THE GUISE MOST PERTINENT...
TO THE COGENT AND UNEQUIVOCAL
STATING OF MY CASE.
WHATEVER, WHATEVER.
YYYOU GO FIRST, CLOWN.
WELL,
THE FACT IS, YOUR HONOR,
THAT DOG'S MY PROPERTY, AND
I HAVE PAPERS TO PROVE IT.
WELL, WOULD YOU SHOW THEM
TO ME, PLEASE?
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOUR HONOR,
II HAD PAPERS TO PROVE IT.
BUT THAT BOY__
THAT YOUNG HOOLIGAN__
BECAUSE OF HIS IRRESPONSIBLE AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY,
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU SEE.
ORDER!
YOU SEE, SIR, WHEN I LOST
MY DOG FOR THE FIRST TIME,
IT BROKE ME UP REAL BAD.
WHEN I LOST HIM THE SECOND TIME,
IT DARN NEAR KILLED ME.
HELL'S BELLS, YOUR HONOR,
ALL I WANNA DO IS GET OLD BLUE BACK.
SO IT CAN BE HIM AND ME TOGETHER JUST LIKE IT ALWAYS WAS.
WHY? SO YOU CAN ABUSE HIM
SOME MORE?
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH,
YOUNG MAN. 
I RAISED THAT
DOG FROM A PUPPY.
I WOULDN'T HARM
A HAIR ON HIS HEAD!
BAILIFF, WHAT IS THAT?
THE DOG, YOUR HONOR.
ORDER!
QUIET!
IT'S THE GAVEL, SIR.
WHAT?
SPEAK UP! 
BAILIFF!
YOU SAID "SPEAK."
SPEAK!
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE
SUPPRESS THAT DOG?
SHH!
OH, WHAT A DAY.
WHAT A DAY.
NOW THEN__
YOUNG MAN,
HAVE YOU ANY EVIDENCE...
THAT THIS MAN
ABUSED YOUR DOG?
DID YOU EVER SEE HIM
HIT THE DOG?
WELL... NO.
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW
THE DOG WAS ABUSED?
BECAUSE BUDDY
DOESN'T LIKE HIM.
BUDDY'S MY FRIEND.
I KNOW WHAT HE'S FEELING,
SO HE KNOWS WHAT I'M FEELING.
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH,
YOUR HONOR. WHO'S THAT?
THE BOY'S MOTHER.
OH,
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YOU MAY SP__
YOU MAY ADDRESS THE COURT.
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED
TO THIS TOWN,
UH, MY SON...
WAS VERY UNHAPPY.
AND THEN HE FOUND BUDDY HERE.
BUDDY'S GIVEN HIM SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T TAKE BUDDY AWAY FROM MY SON.
MRS. FRAMM, AS FAR AS
THIS COURT IS CONCERNED,
THE DOG IS PROPERTY UNLESS YOU HAVE EVIDENCE__ YOUR HONOR.
ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE DID NOT COME
HERE BECAUSE OF A PIECE OF PROPERTY.
THEY CAME HERE BECAUSE OF BUDDY.
HE'S PART OF THIS TOWN.
HE'S PART OF THE TEAM,
AND HE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW, YOUR HONOR.
WELL, HE'S PART
OF MY FAMILY TOO!
HE'S LIKE A SON TO ME!
SHUT UP!
WHY NOT LET THE DOG CHOOSE,
YOUR HONOR?
THEY SAY A DOG
IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
SHOULDN'T THE DOG BE ABLE TO CHOOSE
WHO HE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH?
WHO ARE YOU,
BARNUM OR BAILEY?
ARTHUR CHANEY, YOUR HONOR.
MR. CHANEY, DO YOU REALI__
ARTHUR CHANEY?
NEW YORK KNICKS, '56?
HUH.
I WAS AT THAT CELTICS GAME
WHERE YOU DID THE TURNAROUND JUMPER AT THE BUZZER.
I SPILLED BEER
ALL OVER MY WIFE.
YOUR HONOR.
WHAT?
OH, YES, YES, YES.
MR. CHANEY.
WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING.
THIS DOG'S WHAT,
THREE, FOUR YEARS OLD.
THAT MAKES HIM AN ADULT
IN OUR YEARS.
I SAY LET BUDDY DECIDE.
MR.
CHANEY, DURING MY 40 YEARS ON THE BENCH,
I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF LAMEBRAIN COCKAMAMIE PROPOSALS,
BUT THIS ONE, I LIKE.
MOVE BACK, EVERYBODY!
WAY BACK.
COME ALONG NOW. WAY BACK.
GENTLEMEN,
STAY ON YOUR SPOTS.
IF YOU'LL TAKE JUST ONE SINGLE STEP TOWARD THAT DOG,
YOU LOSE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NOW, BEGIN CALLING THE DOG.

WILL SOMEBODY SUPPRESS
THAT CLOWN?
HEY,
BUDDY, DO YOU WANNA PLAY?
YEAH, JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.
