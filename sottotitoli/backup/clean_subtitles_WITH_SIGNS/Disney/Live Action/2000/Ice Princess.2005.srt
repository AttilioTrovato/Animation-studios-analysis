Casey?
Something wrong, Mr. Bast?
No, not at all.
I was curious if you'd started
weighing your college options.
Options? Uh...
Heard of the Helen Stoller
Physics Scholarship?
No.
It's given to a student
in this part of the state
who shows the most promise
in the sciences.
Wouldn't that be
Ann or... Wyatt?
No, it's you.
You have a calling, Casey.
I do?
What is it?
Physics.
Toast?
Uh... sure.
You're very lucky.
Most people search their
whole lives for their calling.
How do you know
if you have a calling?
Your brilliant teacher
tells you so.
And of course your 11 straight
Apluses on exams is a hint.
You'll need a letter from me
for the scholarship
and think about a special
physics project over the summer.
Something unusual but personal.
Let them know you a little.
He says it's my calling.
QED.
How is this "quite easily
demonstrated"? You're as good
in physics as I am.
Not even close.
I grind, you glide.
Event horizon.
One day that guy
is gonna wake up and
realize he needs a math tutor.
And that tutor will be me.
Figure out how to get us
invited to even one party
and you win the Nobel.
Hey, you're Casey, right?
Uhhuh.
Here's an invite
to my boyfriend's party.
Wow.
You're in chem lab
with Julian Wilson, right?
Mmhm.
Can you give that to him?
Thanks.
That was way inconsiderate.
I love Mr. Bast.
If he uncovered a scholarship
I didn't know about,
he's a genius.
And to think they pay him
almost nothing.
The devaluation of teachers
in our society, it just...
It blows my mind.
Mom.
I'm back. Sorry.
I have to figure out
what he wants from me.
I mean, what is
a personal science project?
Isn't the nature of science
supposed to be completely
unbiased and factual?
Now he wants the inner me, too?
The whole secret
of the study of nature
lies in learning
how to use one's eyes.
You know who said that?
I'm guessing it was a woman.
That was written by George Sand,
a woman forced
to use a man's name
because she
couldn't get published.
Mom.
Okay.
Anyway,
I always tell my students,
"You'll know your topic when
you learn how to use your eyes."

Oh! Oh, no...
She had it locked up.
I need to eat ice cream
and all your mother
has is leftover tofu.
Can we go?
Sh! Sh!
Look at that recovery! Amazing.
She'll still place.
She's so precise.
I mean, down to the last...
You know...
I bet there is an exact
aerodynamic formula.

What do you think
you're doing?
II'm...
Why are you filming
my skaters?
For my physics project.
You're scoping
her triple loop. Why?
No, I'm analyzing her movement.
Who are you working for?
Nobody.
Teddy, will you come over here?
I'm gonna call the cops.
No, I didn't think
it would be a problem.
I thought this was
a public rink...
Private practice only
from six to ten.
These girls are training
for the regional championships,
which I think
you perfectly well know.
No, I'm a student.
I have an ID.
I have a notebook.
Whoa, yeah.
Definitely spy code.
What are you doing here?
You know her?
She's a science geek.
Look, I'm sorry,
but when the CIA
wants to learn new dirty tricks,
they observe figure skaters
and their moms.
Tina, can I have a word?
Frank, not now.
I want to digitize
some images into my computer
to see if any kind of
unified theory emerges.
Okay, if Gen knows you
and you wanna
press your nose up against
the glass and take a few notes,
I don't really care.
But you're gonna have
a hard sell with the parents.
Absolutely not.
But no one outside of
the scholarship committee
will ever see this program.
Here's the letter
from my teacher
explaining the assignment.
And my driver's license.
Um... I've also got
some letters of references
from people I babysat for.
Let's keep
it moving, girls.
It's possible.
We'll have the Team Nikki
legal team check this out.
Beautiful, sweetie.
Thanks, Mom!
No talking to my daughter.
She's training.
No distraction.
Not a word. No.
Look, I don't care
if you're here.
If you post me on the school
website falling on my butt,
you'd better transfer
to another school.
Okay, Nikki.
Let's try that again.
Keep it moving.
A little wider,
that's it.
Hey! No street shoes
on the ice!
I'm sorry... Sorry.
Gen!
Hello, hon.
Gen!
Gen! Brian, she's training.
You know the rules.
I brought a burger, Mrs. H.
Gen can't eat that.
Come on, Mom,
I'm burning tons of calories.
Not enough.
A halfhour break?
Not if you wanna win.
You should coach
our basketball team.
We could use a kick in the butt.
If you don't leave this instant,
that's exactly what you'll get.
Bye.
I do not want him coming here
during practice.
But I never get to see him.
Every other girl I know...
You're not like the other girls.
Winners make sacrifices.
Maybe they just cheat.
Turn that off!
Sorry.
Take it from the layback.
The conclusion's too simplistic.
The kinetic energy in a jump
equals half the skater's mass
times velocity squared, minus...
No, I could barely
understand it.
But...?
I don't know if they'll care
but it's just a little bit...
dry.
Mr. Bast said
I have to make it personal.
How do I do that?
I don't know.
Put more you in it.
Oh, excuse me, Tina.
Is there any way that I could
take a few lessons?
I think I might
be able to write better
about the physics principles
if I'm the one
actually applying them.
If there's any way I could...
Fine.
We're starting a novice class
for the summer.
Three afternoons a week.
Popcorn! I want popcorn!
Where are my Gummi Bears?
I gave them to you.
Four hot dogs!
Oh, I'm sorry...
You touched that
with your fingers.
Oh, fine. You don't want
any more? I'll eat it.
Oh, you breathed on it!
You shouldn't work here.
You're here again?
Um... I'm working.
It's for my science project.
Aren't you going a little
overboard with this project?
No, I'm totally committed to it,
like you're committed
to skating.
Whatever. I'm starving.
BLT here.
Hold the B, heavy on the L.
Um... sure.
Beef patty. Squish it
till it's dry. No bun.
Salad for me.
Coming up.
Just iceberg lettuce,
half a cup of garbanzos
and a lemon wedge.
Oh, and a quarter cup of cheese.
Ooh, cheese!
It's Saturday.
I can pig out if I want to.
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm popping my Lutz.
It's all that cheese.
Would you shut up?
I've gotta focus.
I heard Zoey Bloch's
been sticking a quad.
That is a rumor. Which she
probably started herself.
Early in the season
for stupid head games.
Not for Zoey.
Food's ready!
That is way more
than a quarter cup.
Um... It's $1.65,
$2.35 and $3.35.
That's $7.30 total. Or if you
split it the other way,
it's $1.75 and $5.55.
Whoa. You can keep it all
if you just stop doing that.

You're welcome.
All right, everybody.
Welcome to our
Snowplow Sam class.
Let's line up.
Lookin' good.
Class, can you tell our
teacher's assistant the most
important rule for this class?
Mom...
Never be late.
Right. We have a lot to do
if we are going to be ready
for our recital in August.
We are going to
work on our toe loop.
Our Lutz.

But first, all of you
have to get comfortable
with throwing
your bodies into the air.
Casey, you're the physics whiz.
What's that rule
about what goes up?
Well, technically, it's that
every particle attracts...
Casey.
Must come down.
This... is your new best friend.
Oh! Oh...
Look, could you try
not to, like, squish me?
I'm sorry.
Casey.
Pull your arms in tighter.
They're throwing you
off balance.
Arms in.
Okay.
Now try that
about 5,000 more times.
Right.
Push over
on your right leg.
Don't look at your feet.
Look straight ahead.
Jeremy! That toe pick
is there for a reason!
You dig it in.
Or no friends over for a week.
This is a lot of pressure
for a recital.
It's not only a recital.
It's a U.S.F.S.A.J.S.T.
Earth speak, please?
It's the first step in
qualifying for the regionals.
I mean for us kids.
Oh.
You don't have to do it.
That's good.
Because it's not
humanly possible.

No skating when
the Zamboni's out.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you.
Oh, you're fine?
Okay.
I'm sorry.

Look, you wanna tell me
what was in your head?
I've never skated on
such a smooth surface before.
I wanted to see
what it was like.
Lake skater?
Pond. Near my house.
Look, you need a hand.
No! I'm good to go.
Oh!

You must really want that A.
Wow, that's a lot of Styrofoam.
It's not for an A.
It's for a physics scholarship.
What, like, uh... inertia and
drag and velocity and all that?
How do you know about that?
I'm into cars.
Get this baby out on the road,
I can open her up to...
seven miles an hour.
Blow the doors off any
streetsweeper in town.
Um... I should get home.
Yeah, you should.
Can't do the ice
until you're off.
Right.
Sure.
Well...
How's it coming?
It's coming.
It takes incredible
training and effort
and there's artistry involved
but I'm sorry,
I just can't get past
the twinky little outfits.
Mom, they're actually
very aerodynamically sound.
It sets us back 50 years.
If I ever saw you squeezed
into one of those things,
I'd probably start crying.
Believe me, you never will.

Will you get some sleep?
Please?
Hello.
This is my video presentation.
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.
Cut a second.
I sound like
a driver's ed movie.
Relax. Do it just
like you're talking to me.
Hey, there. I'm Casey.
Oh, my God.
I forgot my last name.
Can I start over?
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.
I decided to see
if I could make myself prove
my own hypothesis
on the application of physics
to the required elements
of competitive figure skating.
Now, I'm going to increase
the centripetal force
by tucking in my arms.
This will increase
my moment of inertia,
so I will spin...
faster.
I'll increase
the height of my jump
by applying more force
to my toe pick.
You know, you look kinda hot.
Shut up.
I'm gonna start off
with a bad one.
For the before shot.
Yeah, that pretty much blew.
Okay.
Now you're making me mad.
Good.
When you sign with Nike,
remember I wear
size six and a half.
I want to do the recital.
For science.
Be here tonight, 5:30.
Okay.
Mm! Tina...
I have this Harvard
alumni tea thing at three.
Then, what are we talking about?
No, it's okay. I'll make it.
Um...
You have nothing to wear.
Come by my house at noon.
Maybe one of my old things
will work for you.
Wow. Okay.
What?
Thanks!

Sweetie?
Just a second!

Hold on!
Almost ready?
Uhhuh.
I have a surprise for you.
That does it.
Perfect.
I think the whole effect
is very grown up,
with a nod to femininity.
We've evolved past flaunting it,
but we don't have to deny it.
I mean, you are
going to be mingling
with your future prospective
classmates and professors,
and I really wanted
the look to say,
"We are serious."
Well, it definitely succeeds.
Mom, we don't have to stay
at this thing for more
than an hour, right?
Um, because... there's
something I have to tell you.
Oh... Oh, honey.
What was that?
I've been so worried.
You've been living at that rink,
but you're here, now.
And you're excited,
because you understand
what's really important.
Look, I've got goose bumps.
I'm sorry, that was so
type A of me. Mom disease.
Just relax.
Just be yourself.
Your normal, poised,
charming, articulate...
Mom...
Do you wanna go over it
one more time?
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle,
and I'm attracted to
the physics program because...
Physics rocks.
In sophomore year, you can join
the Quantum Club and that rocks
because we compete against
Cal Tech, MIT and Stanford.
Last year, our ion particle
accelerator took first place.
It rocked.
Sounds really, um... rockin'.
It is, it really is.
Do you know
what I think is great?
If everything works out
with Casey's scholarship,
I'm sensing that you two will be
spending scads of time together.
Hors d'oeuvre?
Oh, how wonderful, bruschetta.
If you have some time right now,
I'll take you through the entire
physical sciences syllabus.
We have got nothing but time!
Don't we, Case?
Great!
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.
That's the first rule.
All right,
let's get ready. Come on.
That's what she said...
I have to do two turns...
Really?
Yeah.
We're supposed to go round
the side, remember?
Oh...
It's right there.
Right there, is that better?
Yeah...
Deep breath.
And then you let it out.
It didn't work.
Come on.
Okay, everybody.
I'll take that.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Nice and slow.
Lily, no talking.

Bravo!
Yes!
Whoo!
What's my score?
How did I do?
How did I do?
"Novice pass." Yes!
Casey, how did you do?
Fine, I guess.
It says... "Junior pass."

What?
You skipped two levels.

Why didn't I skip two levels?
Because you're six, Lily.
Junior level is where Gen
and Nikki and Tiff are at.
Is that true, Tina?
That I'm on a junior level?
Yes, it's true.
Okay, everybody,
let's get changed.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go.
So, if I...
If I wanted to compete?
You can't.
Why not?
What happened tonight was,
the judges saw the same thing
I've been seeing all summer.
You got some raw talent.
That's not enough
for a shot at the regionals.
You need a coach, a valet,
a choreographer,
private ice time.
Nikki's parents took out
a second mortgage to do this.
And Tiffany's dad
works two jobs.
Oh.
Where d'you get those skates?
Garage sale.
They're falling off your feet.
You need custom boots,
$600 minimum,
and the blades need to be
sharpened every six weeks.
You get it? I'm sorry.
It is what it is.
You have to want it. You have to
want it more than anything else.
It's not something
you do on a whim.


You know what I was thinking,
Miss Senior?
This the last
first day of school.
Because the next first day,
you'll be in a dorm.
So I went a little nuts.
I made pancakes
with white flour.
Can you believe
summer's over?
We're wasting our lives here.

Heard you landed a double.
Tiff!
Well? That took me two years.
Really?
So I guess we'll see you then?
No, you won't.
Not at the rink.
I can't train with you guys.
Why not?
Um, I can't afford it.
Oh!
Yeah.
But, um, it's been fun.
Look, Casey. I'll tell you
something, all right.
You don't know
how lucky you are.
For what?
To have a life.
You think I have a life?
I know you do.
You have TV time,
and friend time...
But you get to skate
all you want.
More than I want.
I'd love to be you.
Have a Saturday night,
see your boyfriend...
Yeah...
Eat what you want.
Like bread.
Buckets and buckets of bread.
Oh, boohoohoo! Who cares?
Who cares about all that stuff?
Don't you just wanna skate
all the time?
No.
No.
What's the matter with
you people? Are you insane?
The Jumping Shrimp
is a skating machine.
The Jumping Shrimp?
My mom copyrighted it.
See ya.
Scary.
We must learn from her.
This is exactly what the
scholarship committee
is looking for.
Your enthusiasm for the project
just leaps off the page.
In fact, it's so good,
you could probably sell it.
Thanks.
Tiffany.
Hey.
What if I told you
I could fix your spread eagle?
Would you like to learn
how to stop traveling
on your sit spin?
I don't!
Well, maybe I do.
You could land your double Axel.

doesn't make the jumps.

just this one time.
I'll be back by eleven.
You have a 5:30 am practice
tomorrow.
Think you're gonna be
all sparkly for that

Mom, I landed my Axel.
Can't I just have
one Saturday night, please?
Who are you going with?
Hi, um...
D'you wanna hang out tonight?
With you?
Yeah, you know,
get something to eat.
Maybe do a movie or something.
Um... yeah.

But...
Here we are...
This doesn't look like a movie.
Gen!
Gen!
Gen!
Gen!
I, um...
I'm not dressed for a party.
Shake it.
Your hair.
Now, no one will notice.
Work the hair.
Hi.
Hi.

I don't know
any of these people.
Sure, you do.
They're all in your class.
There's... Jason, football.
And Luke, soccer.
Well, I know them but I...
I don't actually talk to them.
I don't talk to guys
or... people.
Well, now would be
the perfect time to start.
Hey, Kyle.
Hey.
Casey.
Casey, Kyle.
Kyle plays hockey.
Casey skates.
Hey.
You guys have a lot
in common. Have fun.
But... I...
Brian!
So you skate, huh?
Figure, uh... skate.
Figure skate.
Oh.
I wouldn't let the rest
of the team hear this but, uh,
you guys could probably
skate circles around us.
But not pushing a puck.
Hey, why don't you
come to our next game?
Whoohoo!
Go! Go! Go!
Uhoh.
What?
Well, assuming his weight
to be about 150 pounds,
at that rate of descent,
his estimated trajectory
would bring him...
directly through the window.
Oooh!
I mean, it's a simple V times M
equals A miscalculation.
You know, velocity times
momentum equals acceleration.
Physics.
Yeah, I have to, um...
Yeah, later.
Do you know who that was?
That was Kyle Dayton.
Way hot.
Word of advice.
Don't ever speak again.
When I get nervous,
I kind of babble a little.
It's like this gear
gets loose in my head.
Like one of those Planck
diagrams, where...
You're doing
that babbling thing again.
I think babbling is cool.
Come on, Casey.
Thanks.

So you're Gen's cover
tonight, huh?
It's usually my job.
She could've warned me
we were going to a party.
You know, my sister
has her own problems.
Your sister?
Yeah.
You're Tina's son?
Is that so hard to believe?
No, no, wow, I just, um...
I just thought...
I was the help?
I mean, I kinda am.
Gen skates and I fix stuff.
Well, most stuff.
An object is only as strong
as its weakest point.
Physics.
Thanks.
Right, so...
Tell me about, um...
fixing stuff.
Well, I mean the rink
was a pit when my mom bought it.

Mostly with her divorce money.
I helped bring it back. I did
the repair work, the painting...
The Zamboni.
That was my favorite part.
So, um, for you
it's the science stuff?
Um... right.
Sorry.


Yeah, nice one!
Klutz!
Dork.

Hi.
Where have you been?
Stayed late at school.
No, where have you been
all week?
This tutoring thing has got me
totally stretched out.
Why are you doing this? This kid
is obviously the dumbest
ninthgrader on the planet.
Mom, it looks good
on my application.
Ann's doing it too.
Ann was with you just now?
Yeah. Five minutes ago.
Ann just phoned for you.
What's going on?
Nothing.
And since when
do you get a C on a test?
I saw it in your room.
I was not snooping.
I mean, you and As are like
peanut butter and jelly.
Is it belated rebellion?
What?
Is it...
...a boy?
Mom, no!
I'm sorry.
You do realize what is at stake
with your grades right now?
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I feel bad about the C, okay?
Can you just give it a rest?
Sweetie!
Mom, I just want
to compete at regionals.
Why? What do you
have to gain by this?
I'm good.
So, what are you saying?
You wanna just blow off
our whole plan for you,
chuck the scholarship and
become a professional athlete?
Case, what is the shelf life
on an iceskater?
Eight years?
And then a few years
touring with HasBeens On Ice.
And that's it?
That's the end of your life?
I love it, Mom.
Case, there's no
shelf life on your mind.
If I'd learned to use mine
a little sooner,
if I'd gone to college
when I was your age,
maybe we wouldn't
be living like this.
There's nothing wrong
with the way we live.
I've not been able to give
you a quarter of the things
I've wanted to.
You've given me everything.
Then you need to
give me something now.
Attention, skaters!
We will be playing
classical music the entire ride.
Oh, Mom!
Unless, of course,
someone wins a trophy.
And then its Outkast for you.
Yeah!
And earplugs for me.

So, we're picking up a stray.
Hey.
Isn't your mom coming?
She's not really into skating.
Guess what? Slonski Toyota
sponsorship, it's a done deal.

We're way behind on marketing.
I'm working two jobs
for you, sweetie,
because you're worth it.
And you'll be even more
worth it when you win.
Très harsh.
You think?
Hey, watch this.
Hey, Nik.
Everyone says
you and I are gonna take
first and second today.
Nice try.
What was that about?
Classic psychout.
Softens up the competition
so they don't go allout to win.
Don't ever fall for it.
Got it.
And no matter what happens
in the short program,
even if you tank,
just tell yourself it's only
one third of the score.
Never freak till after the long.
Freak after the long. Okay.
Hey, slowpoke!
You're coming too?
Well, I don't have to
if you don't want me to.
Well, I guess if the van
breaks down or something.


Hey, that's Zoey Bloch,
aka Skate Thief.
Well, well.
If it isn't the leaping dwarf.
It's The Jumping Shrimp,
actually.
Like that's a step up?
Don't talk to her, Nikki.
And don't get any closer.
You don't wanna lose
your skates.
Like I'd need to steal
her skates to win this thing?
Or some lame computer program?
How'd she know about that?
She's got eyes
in the back of her horns.
Beat it, Harwood.
Make me, Bloch.
Don't engage, Gennifer. You
should know better than that.
Zoey, come on.
Imagine you are in...
A bubble. I know, Mom.
And remember, don't...
Deviate from my program.
Even if you do nothing
but fall, it's not...
Even an option. I know, Mom.
Look at me.
So you're the one trying
to make it without a coach.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
It's not easy going out
there your first time.
Thanks.
You just gotta keep focused.
And be impressive. Set the
groundwork for next year.
Next year?
Because no way are you gonna
place this year.
The judges have already ranked
this thing in their minds.
Nice skates.
Hey, come on.
It's just another
classic psychout.
It's the old, "You've already
lost so why bother trying?"
Come on.
Don't get offended.
Just one little question.
What?
Haven't you heard of eyeliner?
Not yet. Casey!
Stop. Not yet.
I really appreciate the effort,
but I don't think
there's a lot to work with.
I'm...
You're hot.
But stay away from Brian.
He's mine.
Teddy...
Teddy you can have.
Oh, um, but I don't...
You know, I may not
be as smart as you are,
but I'm not an idiot.
Ladies and gentlemen, 
welcome to 54th Annual 
New England Regional 
Figure Skating Competition. 
Our first skater 
for the short program 
is Zoey Bloch 
from Worcester, Massachusetts. 





We love skating
and we love gold!

Yes!
Okay, we're in.
Definitely top four.
You're going to the sectionals!
Unless Sasha Cohen
makes a guest appearance.
Good job.
Good luck.
Our final skater 
is Casey Carlyle 
from Millbrook, Connecticut.

Yeah!
You crushed, baby!
It's only the short, shorty.
Fourth.
We'll take it.
Fifth, that's great!
Yeah, but fifth
doesn't go to sectionals.
Listen, skate a clean program
tonight, you can move up.
Knock me out of fourth.
Casey, you almost
lost a boot out there.
I know, it's giving out.
I think you'd better
come with me.
How do they feel?
I really can't accept these.
Just show me you deserve them.
And we'll need a pair of blades.
I'll have them
sharpened for you right away.
Tina, I can't believe
that you would help...
No fawning.
No.
Just...
Thank you.
And the next performer 
in the Junior Ladies Free Skate 
is Casey Carlyle 
from Millbrook, Connecticut. 


Oh!

Who is it?
And that's how it's done, dwarf.
Shut up, pincushion.
Come on, sweetie.
Excuse me.
I'm going to sectionals!
Good girl!
Congratulations!
Are those new?
Yeah.
Are you crazy?
You can't compete on new skates.
They take, like, a minimum
of ten days to break in.
Everybody knows that.
But Tina didn't tell me.
You mean Tina,
whose robot daughter
almost didn't make sectionals
because of you?
Typical Tina Harwood.
Just like Sarajevo.
You don't know anything, do you?
They kicked her out.
You might wanna reconsider
that nocoach thing.
Bye, new girl.
See you at the van
in 40 minutes.
Okay, sure thing.
There she is.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
You were awesome.
I am so happy that it's over.
Are you happy about my feet?
What?
I'm sorry, Casey,
but your old skates were a mess.
You bought her new skates?
Please, like you didn't know.
Casey, I didn't!
How can you lie to my face?
You're just as bad as she is.
Hey, ease up, Casey.
Oh, just defend her!
Like you weren't part of it.
How could you think that?
Because it's true.
You set me up. All of you.
What kind of people are you?
Come on, let's go.
Mom?
Can you come and get me?
I'm at the skating rink
at Westerly.
I want to come home.
Honey, get in the car.
Just get in the car, honey.
How dare you?
Just hang on, kids.
You think you can just waltz
away after injuring my daughter?
It's Joan, right?
Pulling her away from
her studies behind my back?
Filling her head with some
fantasy that she can skate and
sabotaging any chance she had?
I did you a favor. You didn't
want this for Casey and you're
right. She's not cut our for it.
Is she gifted?
I'll give her that.
But Casey will never fight
for it. She's too polite
to do what you have to do.
To push past everyone and
everything and just take it.
So that's the example
you set for your daughter.
To lie and to sneak around
and to cheat.
I made my daughter strong,
and you made Casey at home
in a lecture hall.
And she'll do very well there.
So you see, we agree.
My daughter's brilliant and will
succeed at whatever she does.
But she will do it the right way
despite people like you trying
to convince her otherwise.
Casey!
I'm in good shape.
I can keep up with you.
Go away.
Casey, I didn't know!
Right!
Where have you been?
You are aware you had practice
half an hour ago?
Yes, I'm aware.
And?
And I'm done.
Done?
I'm quitting.
You've got to be kidding.
That's ridiculous.
No, I was ridiculous for putting
myself through this for so long.
We both know
I don't have the talent.
Perseverance is nine tenths
of mastering any sport.
Do you know what I want?
No, you don't know what I want.
Because you never cared.
If you have any sense of self
preservation, you'll scatter.

I'm listening.
I wanna stop missing school.
I like school.
You know, it's stupid and the
band will probably be horrible,
but I wanna go to
the homecoming dance.
And I wanna go with Brian.
I want to stop feeling an idiot
for flunking math because
I don't have time to learn it.
And I want...
All right. All right.
I can see that
maybe we've overdone it.
Overdone it?
Just a little.
Casey's skates, Mom.

We'll continue this discussion
at home.
You heard the whole thing?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
It's your slot, Casey.
If I drop out, you're next.
You'll go to sectionals.
No.
Thanks.
Tomorrow's my Harvard interview.
That's my slot.
That's what I should be doing.
You sure about that?
It's a nice little experiment.
In what way do you think
a triple loop jump entitles you
to a physics scholarship?
Dr. Healey, the proof of the
experiment isn't in the mumbo
jumbo of the calculations.
It's in the improvement
in the skating
of three junior champions.
I also applied the findings
to my own skating and...
and actually managed to
implement the experiment
in a very rewarding
and entirely personal way.
Well, good, because
passion is a key component
of what we look for in students.
Passion makes people go on
to do exceptional things.
So, Casey, why are you
passionate about Harvard?
Dr. Healey, my mom and I
have been imagining Harvard
practically my whole life.
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but what I need to be doing,
I can't do here.
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.
I'm so sorry.
Miss Carlyle,
we won't reschedule.
I know.
You can't do this, Case.
You're giving up your dream.
No, Mom,
I'm giving up your dream.
I'm going after mine.

How did you know?
Didn't think you'd give up.
Which meant you'd be out here
bumping it out.
Teddy, I've been trying to find
some way to apologize.
I've got some ideas about that.
Medium smooth or glassy?
I can't have a conversation
with anybody I haven't known
since kindergarten,
so how come I can do that
in front of you?
Because you let people see you
when you skate.
But, Casey,
you can't win going it alone.
You're gonna need some help.

What do you want?
Five minutes.
You owe me that much.
If you're here for an apology,
you won't get one.
I'm not here for an apology.
Tell me what happened
in Sarajevo.
Why didn't you win?
I had an unfortunate warmup
before my short program.
I collided with another skater
and she got hurt.
Are you sorry?
Look, I paid my dues.
I was suspended.
By the time
they considered reinstating me,
I was 26 and it was too late.
But there isn't a day goes by
that I don't wish
I could relive that moment
and do it differently.
I want you to coach me
for sectionals.
Why on earth would I do that?
Because you don't have a skater
and I don't have a coach.
We're a perfect match.
I don't think
you have what it takes.
Tina, I have to do this.
I want this more than
I've ever wanted anything.
I said no to Harvard.
I will work harder than any
skater you have ever trained.
And if I fail, I fail,
but because I wasn't good
enough, not because
I didn't have the guts.
I want to know
what I can do in this sport,
and I'm going to find out.
The rink. Tomorrow, 5:30 am,
and get a good night's sleep.
You're gonna need it.
That you'd even consider letting
that woman back into your head!
I don't have to like her
or trust her.
No, you just wanna spend
all your time with her.
I'm not gonna turn into her.
She's already rubbed off
on you.
That's not true.
Where did this hair come from?
And the makeup? And that shirt?
I did not buy you that shirt.
That has nothing to do with it.
I think you wanna be
exactly like her,
and if you happen to
lie now and again,
well, hey,
at least you'll be glamorous.
You think this is about glamour?
It is a sport, Mom. It is a
thrilling and beautiful sport.
Are you sure it doesn't
just make you feel beautiful?
So what if it does?
What is so horrible about that?
About feeling strong and
graceful and beautiful
for once in my life?
Why are you jealous of her?
Well, I guess
no matter how old we get,
the rest of us will still
always hate the prom queen.
You know it'll always be
the Casey and Mom show.
Do I?
But if you could just
come to the rink and see me.
Don't ask me! I can't!
Come with me right now. Mom.
Just come watch me skate, and
then tell me that I should stop.
You know what,
I have a class, all right?
Welcome to ESPN
at the Eastern Sectional
Junior Ladies' Short Program.
I have to say, from the
practice sessions I've seen,
these ladies are fired up.
That's right, Brian,
every skater has worked
unbelievably hard to get here.
And every one of them
is ready to compete.

So, are you a science geek too?
Math geek.
Really? If I could pass math,
maybe I could get into college.
Do you tutor?
Do you know any cute guys?


First up in the Ladies'
Short Program is Zoey Bloch.
This girl skates
all out all the time
and this crowd
is just rocking out.
Tiffany is probably
the most graceful, artistic
skater in this competition,
and she's definitely on today.
I thought
Chantal was showing
signs of nerves earlier.
Not any more. She's in total
command out there.
Fans call her
the Jumping Shrimp
but remember that name
because this little dynamo
has been landing massive jumps.


The word "newcomer"
doesn't even being to cover
Casey Carlyle.
She's never
performed in a skating
competition until this season.

Definitely one
to keep your eye on.
The standings are 
Zoey Bloch in first place, 
Nikki Fletcher in second, 
followed by Chantal DeGroat 
and Casey Carlyle. 
4.8s to 4.9s! One 5.0!
And one 4.6.
Oh, come on!
No "good job" or "way to go"?
At least I landed the jumps.
You're in the game, no more.
I'm not seeing much fluidity
coming out of your jumps
and that hurt you artistically.
Remember...
Your next movement is always
part of the previous one.
Rub your feet for at least five
minutes and drink lots of water.
You pulled it out, girl!
"Only the short.
It's only the short."
I lied. You mess up the short,
you can never win.

Hey, did you work things out
with your mum?
Um, we've hardly spoken
in two months.
I think I broke her heart.
If we want to,
we can trace that plot line
from Euripides
through Shakespeare
crossing the pond to Mark Twain,
finding contemporary echoes
in John Cheever or...
Janet Jackson.
Don't you mean Shirley Jackson?
You've done your reading.

All right. Next week, I want
an essay on your candidate
for the "lessismore feminist
writer of the 20th Century".

From New York 
City, New York, Emma Flanders. 
This is it. You can lose the
long program just sitting here
if you don't prepare properly.
Put these in.
Why?
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.
If they fall, you'll get cocky,
if they bring the crowd to
its feet, you'll feel pressure.
No one else exists.
Go into the bubble.




Forget it.
I just need to hear her voice.

You've reached the Carlyles. 
We're not here right now... 
It's not about her.
This is about you.
Our final skater 
is Casey Carlyle 
from Millbrook, Connecticut. 

One more thing.
What?

Casey Carlyle
waiting for marks.
Nikki and Zoey first and second
in the ordinals, DeGroat third.
Will that fall cost her,
or will that incredible rally,
not to mention
the added technical difficulty
push her past the others?
High! 5.1s and 5.2s.
They're almost dead
even with Nikki Fletcher's.
That's my daughter.
That's my daughter.
And here's
her artistic set of marks.
Hold on. Hold on.
Those are
almost even with Nikki's.
Did she do it?
No, it's not enough. She'll
have to settle for silver.
This takes her to nationals
and who knows,
maybe the 2006 Olympics.
With this skater,
anything is possible.
Thank you.
Case?
Mom?
If I'd known.
If I'd just taken ten minutes
and gone to the rink with you,
I never would have...
Mom.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
How could I not see?
You see me better than anybody.
Come on.
Casey.
Congratulations.
And you can drive the Zamboni
any time you want.
I was this close,
this close to losing!
Where did all of those triples
come from?!
Sweetheart, you...
Don't you know what'll happen
after six months with Tina?
What?
She's gonna whip my butt!
Someone is gonna pay big time.
Nikki. Can we have a word?
Hello, Peter.
Just wanted to say congrats.
We look forward to seeing the
Jumping Shrimp at the Nationals.
That is so sweet. I just went
out there and skated my best.
And today, I guess
my best was good enough.
Love you.

You know I can't afford this.
We'll need to find a sponsor.
I'm on it.
Burger Blast is interested.
Burger Blast? Oh no, I am sorry.
I'm sorry, no.
Why not?
Well, if she can't eat it,
she can't endorse it.
We'll need something healthier.
How about GrapeNuts?
GrapeNuts?
What about cod liver oil?
Guys.
You know, I am her mother.
What I say goes.
She is my daughter.
She is my skater.
Well, daughter trumps skater.
Well, ask any professional
athlete, coach trumps mother
every time.
Guys!
And that boy, we'll need to
nip that in the bud.
I can't go through all this
and a boy too.
That is a huge distraction.
It's unacceptable.
I don't believe this!
You will be busy training.
And four college courses.
Four? Are you out of your mind,
with everything she's doing?
All right, two.
But then four in the fall.
Only if she wins sectionals.
Oh, she will.
