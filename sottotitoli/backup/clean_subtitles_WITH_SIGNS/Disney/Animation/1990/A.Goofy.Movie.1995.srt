Aah! Oh!
Argh! No!

Ayuk! OOOh!
Uh... Ahh! Hello?
Ahem. Hello.
Max, where the heck are you, man? 
P.J.?
You should've been here an hour ago. 
What? What are... Hold on.
Oh, no!
Look, maybe we should just
call the whole thing off. 
No way, man.
It's now or never. Oooh!
You better get a move on.
I'll meet you at my locker. 
Ayuk! Mornin', son!
Dad!
Oops! I forgot.
Ayuk! Mornin', son!
Came to see if you had any...
dirty clothes.
Well, there they are. Help yourself.
Max, I thought we talked about this.
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
II'll take care of it later. Ow!
What's the big rush?
I'm running late.
I could drive ya on my way to work.
Uh, no. No, thanks.
I, uh, need the exercise.
Aw, come on, Max. Huh?
Dad! No, don't do it!
Don't... No!
Oh, Dad, you ruined it.
Sorry 'bout that.
Who was he, anyway?
It's only Powerline, Dad.
The biggest rock star on the planet.
Ooh, not bigger than
Xavier Cugat, the Mambo King.
Everybody mambo!
Boomboomboom, boomboomboom 
Dad, there's no time for this.
What if the neighbors see us?
Boomboomboom' 
Maxie, wait up!
You forgot your lunch.
Have a good day!
Duh... Ah!
Huh.
They've been laughin'
Since I can remember 
But they're not gonna laugh any more 
No more "Maxie the Geek" 
No more "Goof of the Week" 
Like before' 
No more algebra tests 'til September 
No more lookin' at losers like him' 
No more havin' to cheat
No more mystery meat 
No more gym
No more gym 
No more gym
No more gym 
Gonna move to the mall
Gonna live in the pool 
Oh!
Gonna talk to Roxanne 
And not feel like a fool' 
'Cause after today
I'm gonna be cruisin' 
After today, she'll be mine 
After today, my brains'll be snoozin' 
If I don't faint, I'll be fine 
I've got 40 more minutes
Of home economics 
Then down with the textbooks
And up with the comics 
Just think of all
The time I've been losin' 
Finding the right thing to say' 
But things'll be goin' my way
After today 
She looked right through me 
And who could blame her' 
I need a new me' 
Plus some positive proof
That I'm not just a goof 
And after today, I'm gonna be cruisin' 
No more pep rallies to cut 
Yuck!
After today, our brains'll be snoozin' 
I'm gonna sit on my butt 
I've got less than an hour 
And when this is ended' 
I'll either be famous
Or you'll be suspended 
Just think of all the time
I've been losin' 
Waiting until I could say 
Gonna be on my own
Kiss the parents goodbye 
Gonna party from now
'til the end of July 
Things'll be going my way 
After today 
I wish that this was the day... 
After today 
Whoa! Dah! Argh!
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.
I just, uh... Dah...
Ayuk!
Oh.
Argh!
I can't believe I did that!
Urgh! She finally says
"Hi" to me, and what do I do?
I... choke! Urgh!
Ayuk!
Like a big spaz!
Where have you been, buddy?
Uh. Hi, Peej. Did you get the camera?
Look, Max, if my dad catches me
with this, he'll kill me!
Are you sure we gotta do this?
It's my only chance, Peej.
To Roxanne, I'm... I'm just a nobody.
But after today...
Bobby!
Wow, look! All this is for us?
Mmm, slurpage!
Oh, this is gonna be so great, man!
Dude. Need fundage, bro.
Oh, your fee. Yeah, yeah. Right here.
Ahhh!
Cheddar! Aahooh!
Cheddar whizzy!
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm. It's pretty scrumptious.
Haha! Let's do it, ladies!
As student body president,
I just wanna say like "yea"...
To all of us for a really neat year.
Yo, Stacey!
Talk to me, talk to me,
talk to me, baby!
And also that I hope you can all attend
my totally amazing endofschool party
next Saturday
to watch the Powerline
concert live on payperview.
Thank you, thank you very much.
And now, without further ado,
Principal Mazur.
Thank you, Stacey.
And good morning, boys and girls.
You know, every year
on the last day of school
I have several youngsters
approach me and say,
"Principal Mazur, what can we do
to not waste our summer vacation?"
"We don't want to waste our free time"
"sleeping or visiting friends.”
Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party.
How you, uh...
How you doin' down there, Bobby?
Don't give me that attitude, you guys.
I'm doin' it all for you.
This is nuts.
I don't know why
I let you guys talk me into this.
If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke
my entire existence... Ah!
...of the element, or...
Hehhehheh.
I hope this works.
How about... science slumber parties?
Huh?
Wha...
Hey!
I'm not gonna just... Aaah!
Hahahahahah!
Some people settle
For the typical things 
Livin' all their lives
Waitin' in the wings 
It ain't a question of "if"
It's just a matter of time 
Before I move to the front of the line' 
Once you're watchin'
Every move that I make 
You gotta believe
That I got what it takes 
Whaaa!
To stand out above the crowd 
Even if I've gotta shout out loud' 
'Til mine is the only face you'll see 
Gonna stand out
'Til you notice me, yeah 
A little smokeage!
If I can make you stop and
Take a look at me instead of just 
Walkin' by 
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice 
I'm alive 
All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance 
To prove I've got whatever it takes 
It's a piece of cake.
To stand out above the crowd' 
Wow! Who's that guy?
'Til mine is the only face you'll see 
Gonna stand out... 
Hey, it's the Goof boy!
We're busted!
Hmph.
Gagaboojaboo
boobooboo.
Ayuk! Come on, smile!
SmileyWiley!
Blaaaaaa.
Ayuk!
Oh, come on, Kimmie.
Gimme a big...
Ahh!
Whee!
Ahh! Whee!
Ahh.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Stop goofin' around!
We got work to do!
Okay, Kimmie, back to Mommy now.
Ayuk! BIaaaaaa.
Ahh.
You're such a cute little girlie.
Mmm.
Oh, come back and see me.
Oh, you have such a way with children.
"You have such a way with children."
Pah!
Okay, now. Who's next over here?
Step aside, Goof.
Let a pro Show you how it's done.
Okay. Who's next over here?
Hahahaha.
Ooh, hello, precious...
Oooh! Oooh!
You lucky woman. Heh.
Now, now, you come on here, honey.
It's picture time. Come on.
Peekaboo!
She's so cute.
Peekaboo!
Gosh, Pete, you sure are good with kids.
Oh, yeah. Well, they love me.
Argh!
Haha. Why P.J., he's been beggin' me
to take him on vacation this summer.
Really? Where ya goin'?
Campin'!
Nothing like the great outdoors
to strengthen the bond
between a father and a son.
Argh!
Max'd never go for anything like that.
I don't know, Goof.
Ooh! Gimme, gimme.
Somethin's wrong when a kid won't
spend time with his parents.
Well, for all you know,
he's runnin' around with some gang,
and stealin' stuff,
and causin' riots and...
Waaa! Gimme!
Oh, Max is a good kid.
He'd never get mixed up
in somethin' like that.
I'm a failure.
Complete loser.
My one chance to impress Roxanne
and I blew it.
Uhhuh!
Max, look.
It's the Leaning Tower of Cheesea. Huh.
Oh, man.
My dad is gonna smash me like a bug.
Hey, P.J., detention!
Robert Zimuruski.
Okay. I'm comin'.
Max, here.
Guard this with your life, dude.
Hey, Mazuur!
What's up, bro? All right.
Then my parents' air conditioner
went on the fritz.
I figured with all those kids in my house,
the place a be like a sauna.
So I'm all freaked out,
but then I thought, like, use it.
So my theme's gonna be,
"Powerline Goes Rain Forest."
Too much?
Roxanne, are you listening?
Oh!
Stacey, no! I don't wanna...
Talk to him.
Ahem!
AAAhem'.
Hmm. 
Tap him.
Gosh, I'm sorry.
It's okay... really.
Um, I liked your dance.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, it's from Powerline's new video.
I know. HHe's totally a genius.
Yeah. He's doing a concert
next week in LA.
Oh, yeah.
Stacey's showing it at her party.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Um, uh, Roxanne...
I was, uh, sorta, kinda
thinkin' that maybe I'd, um,
ask you to, uh, go with me,
that is to the... party.
Of course if you don't want to,
I'd completely understand.
Well, I was sorta, kind of
thinkin' that... I'd love to.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Good.
Great.
Terrific.
Wonderful.
All right.
Okay.
C'mon, Roxanne. We don't want
to belabor the moment now, do we?
Well, I'd better be going.
I'll, uh, call you later.
Okay.
Bye. Oh.
Bye.
See, that wasn't so bad.
I told you men are easy to deal with.
Yes! She said yes!
Yahahahoo!
Everybody mambo!
Rumbumbumbumdah 
Oooh!
Rumbumbumbumdah 
It's not my break yet! Ooh!
Oooh!
Rumbumbumbumdah 
Yeah! Dance with her!
Groove with her.
Rumbumbumbumdah' 
Miss Maple!
Yes, sir?
Get that boy's father
on the phone at once!
Right away, sir!
Whoo!
Hello.
Ah, yes. Mr. Goof.
This is Principal Mazur.
I'm calling in regard
to your son Maximilian.
Max? Oh, my gosh! Is he hurt?
No, Mr. Goof.
He's in trouble!
Trouble? What kind of trouble?
Dressed like a gang member...
{Sang member? 
your son caused
the entire student body 
to break into a riotous frenzy! 
Riot? Couldn't be my...
If I were you, Mr. Goof, 
I'd seriously reevaluate the way
you're raising your child 
before he ends up in the electric chair!
The electric chair?
Oh!
What am I gonna do?
Blue light special on aisle three. 
Blue light special on aisle three. 
Lake Destiny.
Okay, kiddo. Now, smile!
Lake Destiny, Idaho!
Lake whodidho?
You were right, Pete.
Nothin' like the great outdoors
to strengthen the bond
between father and son.
You said so yourself.
Well, yeah, but...
I'm goin' fishin'! Ayuk!
I'm goin' fishin' with my boy!
Yeah.
Okay, precious, gimme a big smi...
Fishing! Fishing!
Cool concert, lad.
What?
You wailed, bud!
Hey, Max, wicked dance.
Thanks.
Forget it, girl. He's Roxanne's.
Way to go, man!
I just heard about you and Roxanne.
Oh, Pete! OW!
See, see? I told you
our plan would work!
Max! Max! Max!
Peej, knock it off. Come on. Shh.
Maximum! Maximuum!
Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max! Yeah!
All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance 
To prove I've got whatever it takes 
It's a piece of cake.
To stand out above the crowd' 
Even if! gotta shout out loud 
'Til mine is the only face you'll see 
Gonna stand out
Stand out, heh 
Stand out' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Stand out' 
'Til mine is the only face you'll see 
Gonna stand out' 
'Til you notice me 
Goin' somewhere, Pop?
Sure are, palaroony.
Cool. Have a good time, Dad.
If you're gonna be gone
more than a month, drop me a line.
But, Max, this isn't just my vacation.
It's a vacation with me
and my best buddy.
Oh, Donald Duck?
No, silly. With you!
Are you okay, Maxie?
WhWhat did you say?
That's right!
A vacation, son!
We'll spend some
real quality time together!
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hey, got a present for ya!
Dad, stop that!
What are you doing?
You look just like I did at your age.
Please don't say that, Dad.
Wait! I saved the best for last. Ayuk!
It's been handed down
from Goof to Goof to Goof.
And now, it's yours, son.
A stick?
No, silly.
A fishin' pole!
Fishing? We're going fishing?
Yep. Just like my dad and me did.
Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny.
Away from it all!
I don't wanna be
"away" from it all, Dad.
I like "it all"!
Look, Maxie, we're using
the same map me and my dad used.
We'll take the same route,
and make the same stops...
And see the same sights.
Ahh!
But that trip would take weeks, Dad!
Exactly!
Gettin' there is half the fun.
Put the map away, Dad.
It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya.
Careful, son. You'll wrinkle my past.
Ayuk! And our future.
What the map says, Max,
we will follow.
That's very mystical
and everything, Dad,
but, uh, seriously, there's this party
I have to go to. And there's this girl...
There'll be plenty of time
for parties when you're older.
Why, when I was your age
I'd never even been invited to a party.
Look at me now!
Great, Dad.
Hop in, Maxie.
No.
All right, then.
Guess I'll just have to go...
all alone.
That's all.
Just sit in the boat all alone...
and talk to myself.
All alone.
I guess so.
Oh, come on! Hop in!
No, Dad.
Just hop right in there.
No.
Come on, Maxie. Go for it!
Argh! No.
Let's buckle you up!
And we're ready for takeoff! Ayuk.
Set for adventure, Maxie?
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?
'Cause I don't want ya
to end up in the electric chair.
Electric chair? What are you...
I'm not givin' up on ya, son.
Together, we're gonna work this out.
Work this out? But, Dad!
No buts about it, Maxie boy.
Your ol' pop knows best.
But...
Goodbye, house.
Goodbye, mailbox.
Goodbye, pile of broken wood.
Goodbye, hopes.
Goodbye, dreams.
Goodbye, Roxanne.
Roxanne!
Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first.
I have to talk to someone.
Well...
Turn here!
DDad, watch out! Aaah!
Stop here. Here! Pull over!
Now, make it quick, Maxie boy.
We gotta put some road behind us.
You get and cancel your first date
in less than an hour.
Must be some kind of lameo record.
Hi. Is Roxanne home?
MMMy name's Max.
Does Roxanne live here?
Does she even live on this block? Haha.
Wait!
It's okay, Daddy.
Max is a friend from school.
Oh.
Go on. Go on.
Good Daddy.
Hey, Max.
Hi, there.
You wanna... uh, have a seat?
Hey. Uh... oh.
Daddy!
I promise, he'll be better behaved
when you pick me up for the party.
Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came by.
I'm really looking forward to it, Max.
Yeah. I was too.
Was?
You see, my dad's on this
stupid fatherson kick and...
Don't worry about it, Max.
It's just a dumb party.
No, it's not. Roxanne,
I really wanted to go with you.
Max, I understand. Really, it's okay.
But my dad surprised me.
I don't wanna go, but I have no choice.
I'm sure I can find someone else.
Someone else?
I'll just talk to you later.
Uh, uh, Roxanne!
Uh, my dad is, uh...
My dad's taking me
to the Powerline concert in LA.
Your dad's taking you clear across
the country just to see a concert?
Uh, well, you see, uh,
my dad...
uh, knew... knows... knows Powerline.
They used to play together, in a band!
Yeah!
Come on, son!
Let's get this Show on the road!
Uh...
Just a minute!
You... party animal, you.
You're really serious.
Absolutely.
So, uh...
you aren't still thinkin'
of goin' with someone else, are you?
Well, I guess...
Because I was hopin'...
I could, uh, wave to you onstage
when we join Powerline
for the final number.
This is incredible.
Well, I wouldn't miss
our date for anything
that wasn't incredible, Roxanne.
Mwa.
Have a great time at the concert, Max.
I'll see you on TV!
Ah. I'm in deep sludge.
Day one.
Well, here we are,
out on the open road,
retracin' the steps of my boyhood. 
And here's Maxie! A yuk! 
Say hi, Max. 
Well, how 'bout a wave?
Not now, Dad. 
Ayuk! What a kidder!
Hmm.
Fun games I used to play with my dad.
Road bingo. Twenty ques...
Hey, Maxie.
Let's play a game.
You think of a name,
and I'll try and guess who it is.
Uh, man or woman?
Oh, man.
A man, huh?
Hmm, that's a toughie.
Uh, let's see.
Walt Disney!
Right.
I'm good at this.
Now, uh, I'll think of one.
Hmm.
Oh! You wanna sing a song, huh?
Me and my dad used to sing
this one all the time.
High hopes 
He's got high hopes 
He's got high apple pie 
kin the sky hopes' 
Oops, there goes another... 
Oops, there goes... 
Oops, there goes... 
Oops... 
Oh, ggreat, Dad.
Now we don't have any music!
Oh, Maxie. It's not so bad.
We'll just have to entertain ourselves!
Puttputtpoof!
Puttputtpoof!
Pingpingping.
Puttputtpoof!
Pingpingping. Pingpingping.
Pingpingping.
Puttputtpoof.
Pingpingping.
Puttputtpoof.
Do ya need a break from modern livin'? 
Do you long to shed your weary load? 
If your nerves are raw
And your brain is fried 
Just grab a friend
And take a ride together 
On the open road 
Come on, Maxie! Ayuk!
All in all, I'd rather have detention 
An in all, I'd rather eat a toad' 
Yuck!
Old man drives like such a klutz' 
That I'm about to hurl my guts
Directly... 
Upon the open road 
There's nothin' can upset me 
'Cause now we're on our way 
Our trusty map will guide us
Straight and true 
Roxanne, please don't forget me 
I will return someday' 
Though I may be in traction when I do 
Me and Max relaxin' like the old days
This is worse... 
... Than dragon breath and acne
In a buddybuddy kind of way 
I'm so mad I think I may explode 
When I see that highway I could cry
That's funny, so could! 
Just bein' out on the open road 
Howdy, boys 
Is this the way to Nashville? 
Watch it, Mac!
Or you'll be gettin' towed 
I'm in no hurry to arrive 
'Cause I'll be turnin' sixtyfive 
The next time I sees the open road 
Just a week of rest and relaxation
Yeah! 
And the odd romantic episode 
Very odd!
And it's California or bust
Look out, you dirtbags, eat my dust 
From now on, I own the open road' 
It's me and little Maxie' 
My pipsqueak pioneer 
They're partners forever, westward ho 
Yeehaw!
Yeehaw!
Could someone call a taxi
And get me outta here? 
To Beverly Hills 90210 
Oh, every day, another new adventure 
Every mile, another new ZIP Code 
And the cares we had are gone for good 
And I'd go with them if! could 
I got no strings on me' 
I'm feelin' fancy free 
How wonderful to be' 
On the open rooad 
Recad ' 
You'll all dodododo' 
Dododo bumbumbum 
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Dad, you're gonna get us killed!
Why don't you just give me the map?
Oh, no thanks, son.
Navigating's a big responsibility.
Besides, you wouldn't wanna
spoil the big surprise!
I'm takin' you someplace pretty special.
Gosh! It's even better than I remembered.
No, Mommy! I don't wanna go!
Yeah, fun. Tell you what...
I'm just gonna wait here in the car.
Ayuk!
You party pooper! Come on.
This is gonna be fun!
Oh, howdy there, folks.

My life's a living...
Hello, little buddy!
Who's your favorite possum?
Don't touch me.
Aww. Why such a long face?
You're so sad.
I know! You need a big hug from Lester.
Don't even think about it! No!
See?
Now you feel all good inside.
Beat it, doofus!
Oh, no. No, Dad. Not that. Please.
Here you go, sport.
What say we get our picture taken?
You have got to be kidding.
Oh, all right.
But you're missin' out.
Urgh. Huh?
Hiya, son!
Hey, everyone!
Check out the dork!
Say "sassafras."
Sassyfrass!
Argh!
Ahh! Get it! Get it!
That's the spirit, Maxie!
Whoa! No!
Dad, stop! Please! No!
Dad, look, this is embarrassing.
No, no, no!
Let go! Dad!
Tada! Ayuk.
It's Dork and Dork Junior!
Hahhahhah!
Argh!
Max!
Hey, what the heck you tryin' to do?
Trying to get away from you!
Me?
What'd I do?
Forget it!
I thought we was having fun.
What's the matter?
Nothin'. Let's just go.
Well, come on!
Hey, you dropped your hat.
Ah! This is the stupidest vacation!
You drag me from home,
you jam me in this dumb car,
then drive me a million miles away
to see some stupid rat Show!
Call me when the trip's over.
Hey, Max.
You wanna get in some fishin' practice?
Just a couple of days
'til we get to Lake Destiny.
Maybe later.
Whoa!
Now that's camping.
Did you say somethin', Max? Ow!
Pete?
Goofy?
Ohho! What a serendipity doodah!
Who'd've thunk it, huh? 
Is P.J. here?
Who? Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's loafin'
around here somewhere.
It ain't a question of how 
Just a matter of when' 
You get the message
That I'm trying to sing 
I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head 
And you know I'm goin'
All of the way to the end 
What a goob!
To stand out above the crowd 
Even if you got to shout out loud 
No matter what the look is
It's Max, I get... 
Max!
HHHey!
Whoa! Small wilderness, dude.
Didn't expect to run into you.
Apparently not.
You're just jealous, man,
'cause you ain't got the moves!
Yeah, you can keep the moves.
But I wouldn't mind havin' this RV. Oh!
You are so lucky, man.
Me? Oh, come on. You're the star.
WhWhat do you...
Going to the Powerline concert.
Ah! It's unbelievable, man.
Who told you about that?
Hey, come on. Everybody in town
knows about it, Max.
You are gonna be famous, buddy.
Especially with Roxanne.
There's, uh, only one person
who doesn't know about it yet, Peej.
Who?
My dad.
So tell me, Goof.
Is that kid of yours
still givin' you guff?
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.
Just seems like everything I try
only drives Max further away.
Maybe I oughta just back off,
I don't know.
Wrong, Goof.
Look, if you keep 'em
under your thumb,
they'll never end up in the gutter.
Too bad, Pete. Almost.
Almost? Hah!
Watch this.
PAH! 
Here, sir. Comin', sir. Yes, sir.
Whoohoo! StrikeOla!
Yeehaw! Thank you.
Thank you. Yes!
And the crowd goes wild!
Ahhhahaha!
High five, son!
Psych!
Hahahaha!
Say, Goof, why don't
you two stay for dinner?
Cool!
Oh, no thanks, Pete.
Max and I have some fish to catch.
Dad, we can do that tomorrow.
So, uh, what're we havin'?
But, Max, I thought...
Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof.
Maximilian!
What?
Get your gear, little man.
We're goin' fishin'!
And I mean now!
Dad, I don't even know how to fish.
Oh, now come on.
That never stopped me!
Let me Show you a little family secret,
handed down through
about 12 or 13 Goof generations.
The perfect cast!
The perfect what?
The perfect cast.
My dad taught it to me
when I was about your age.
Okay now, watch carefully.
You gotta be llloose.
Relaxed, with your feet apart.
And... ten o'clock, two o'clock...
Quarter to three, tour jeté. 
Twist, over, pas de deux. 
I'm a little teapot
And the windup!
Huh?
And let her fly!
The perfect cast.
And now we reel her in.
Grrr. Ah! Ooh!
Oof! Grrr!
Whoa!
Grrr!
Quick, get the camera!
Must be over three pounds.
I don't wanna miss this!
Look, Max!
A... duh, DDad?
It's Bigfoot!
Could you back up a bit, Mr. Foot?
You're out of focus.
What's the idea?
Bigfoot!
Behold the legendary Bigfoot!
Fabled, but seldom...
Yeowhoohoo!
It's locked!
Quick! The sunroof!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Huh?
Whoa!
I can't believe it!
Bigfoot!
And I got the only video!
We're gonna be famous!
Huh? Grrr.
Let's just get outta here.
Haha!
Ooh.
Is he gone yet?
Mmmmmmmm?
Nnn. Bbfftt.
Bbbbbbbb.
Hahahaha!
Nope. He's still here.
Hahahaha!
Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot
or your stomach?
Man, I'm starving.
Ayuk! Alphabet Soup comin' up.
Huh?
Uh, Dad?
Dad!
Stop playing around! He's coming!
You can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man 
No time to talk' 
I've been kicked around
Since I was born 
But then it's all right, it's okay 
Well, it's nice to know
this thing's good for somethin'.
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive... 
What's so funny?
"Hi, Dad" Soup.
Huh?
Don't tell me you don't remember
"Hi, Dad" Soup!
Oh, come on. Sure you do.
You used to spell things out
using the letters, like, uh, "Hi, Dad,"
Or Maxie, or...
Ambidextrous?
Yeah! That's... Huh?
No! Little words like...
Hasta la vista?
Like "Byebye."
Or "I pledge allegiance"...
Ayukayuk. Or "I love you."
Is, uh... is it soup yet?
Oh, oh. I almost forgot.
Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?
Your granddad taught me that
when we went to Yosemite.
You two did a lot together, huh?
Yep.
Max, you and I...
Dad, I'm sorry...
Um, um...
how's the soup?
Not bad. Um, not... Ahem.
What?
Nnothin'.
Well, we might as well
get some shuteye.
I don't think we're goin'
anywhere tonight.
Hi, Maxie.
"Dear Roxanne, 
"I couldn't sleep... 
"so I thought I'd drop you a line. 
"Dad and I are having a great time!
We're only days away from LA. 
"and I can hardly wait
for the big concert.” 
More "Hi, Dad" Soup, please.
"Dear Roxanne, sorry I lied, 
"but I'm not really going
to the Powerline concert. 
"You may never want
to see me again... ” 
Oh, man.
I'm dead no matter what I do!
How many cups of sugar
does it take to get to the moon?
Ah... three and a half?
Pickup!
Hold your horses.
Short stack?
Right here.
Here you go, hun. Eggs?
Eggs?
Eggs!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right here. Sorry.
Here you go, cutie.
Max, I think we need to talk about this.
Huh?
Seems to me you need to start
taking some responsibility around here.
Excuse me. Can I have
your attention, please?
I, Goofy, hereby dub my son
Maximilian...
Official Navigator and Head "WhichWayer“
of this here road trip.
Isn't that nice?
Heehaw!
Seriously?
I'm not even lookin'
at the map any more.
As a matter of fact, you can pick all
the stops from here to Lake Destiny.
I trust you wholeheartedly, son.
To the open road!
To the... open road!
Whahoo! Whahoo!
Ooh!
Ow!
Yahoo!
Woohoo!
Oh boy!
Whoa!
Oooowaah!
Wahhahoo!
Oof!
Gosh!
Whoahoho!
Check out the bed!
Check out the dresser!
Coral!
Nice lamp.
Classy choice there, Navigator.
This is the police!
Huh?
We've got the place surrounded, see?
You Goofs come out with your hands up.
You should've seen the look on your face!
Ayuk! You really had him fooled, Pete!
Me?
You jumped outta your skin!
I was just pretendin' for your sake.
All right, sure!
Did too!
Did not!
Oh, ain't this sweet?
Don't let him fool you with that
buddybuddy act now.
Under your thumb!
So... since we're all bein'
palsywalsy here,
how 'bout lettin' me hook up the RV?
Well...
Oh, it's just a tiny extension cord.
You'll hardly even notice it.
Okay.
Great! P.J.!
' 
Hey, Goof, why don't you order us a pizza?
This might take a while.
No, I mean it... Ahh!
Here you go, kids.
I'm gonna check out the hot tub.
Okay, sir.
All right.
I can't believe you, man.
Whatever made you think your dad
would fall for a stupid idea like that?
It wasn't stupid!
Come on! It was really stupid.
Changing the map?
I didn't know what I was doin',
all right? II was panicked.
Oofoofoof.
Ohohahah!
Ah!
Taking a break from
the MTV generation, huh?
Can't say I blame ya.
People are always puttin'
too much water in these things.
80, um...
you and your son seem to be, uh,
gettin' along just hunkydory, huh?
Yeah, it's been great!
You know, it's funny, but none
of your techniques worked for me.
The harder I tried, the worse it got.
Once I eased up, things just clicked!
Oh, that's swell.
So, there's no problems then, huh?
Not a one!
That's, uh...
I just hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but uh...
What is it, Pete?
Your kid's dupin' ya.
What do you mean?
Well, I heard the little mutant tellin'
P.J. that he changed the map,
so you're headin' straight to LA, pal.
What?
Oh, you tried, Goof.
He's just a bad kid, that's all.
I don't believe you.
What?
I don't believe ya, Pete!
Well, hey, don't take my word for it.
Check your map.
I don't need to check the map.
I trust my son.
You know, maybe Max isn't all the things
that you think a son should be.
But... he loves me.
Hey, my son respects me!
Yeah.
Check the map, Goof!
Hi, Dad.
Sorry about the mess.
II'll clean it up.
Me think I better go.
See ya, Peej.
Don't forget... Powerline!
Shh!
Well, here you go, Navigator.
Just follow my route on the map, son.
Okay.
Um, huh...
Here comes our junction.
Okay, Max, now this is it.
Left or right?
Uh...
Come on, Max!
Uh, left!
Uh... how 'bout a song, Dad?
Uh... a game?
A game. Yeah!
Yeah, a game. Okay.
Uh... a man or woman?
A man? Man, okay.
Uh... Walt Disney!
Dad...
Listen, about my directions...
Will you listen to me?
I gotta tell you somethin', Dad.
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid
to understand anyway.
Right?
Ah, forget it.
HHHey, the car!
What? Now you want to drive, too?
No, Dad.
The car! Look!
The car!
What'd you do now, Max?
I didn't do anything, Dad.
I only touched it.
WWWhoa“! 
You looked it!
I looked it? It's your door.
You looked it.
Well, you distracted me.
Whoa!
You should've put the brake on.
Why don't you just put it on yourself?
See? You ruin everything.
Wwell, yyou rruined the vacation.
I ruined it?
I never... wanted to go...
on this stupid...
vacation!
Ah! Ah!
Now look where you've got us, Dad!
Where I got us?
You should've let me stay at home.
Why?
So you'd end up in prison?
Prison? What are you talkin' about?
Your principal called me.
It's not what you think.
You even lied to me!
I had to! You were ruining my life.
I was only tryin'
to take my boy fishin', okay?
I'm not your little boy any more, Dad!
I've grown up.
I've got my own life now.
I know that!
I just wanted to be part of it.
You're my son, Max.
No matter how big you get,
you'll always be my son.
There are times you drive me
Shall we say, bananas 
And your mind is missin'
No offense, a screw 
None taken.
Still, whatever mess I land in 
Who is always understandin'? 
Nobody else but you 
Oh, your moodiness is
Now and then bewilderin' 
And your values may be
Soto speak, askew 
Gesundheit.
Thanks. 
Who deserves a hero's trophy 
As we face each catastrophee? 
Nobody else but you 
Nobody else but you
kit's just our luck' 
We're stuck together 
Nobody else but you 
It's crazy enough to believe
We'll come through 
So your jokes are all
Let's face it, prehistoric 
And your music sounds
Like monkeys in a zoo 
But when life becomes distressin" 
Who will 1 be SOSin'? 
If you're havin' trouble guessing 
Here's a clue' 
Though he seems intoxicated 
He's just highly animated 
And he's nobody else but 
Nobody else but you 
We've turned into' 
A trueblue duo 
Hard times, we've had a few' 
Like we're thrown in the drink' 
Like we're tossed out of town' 
But when I start to sink' 
Hey, I'd rather go down 
With nobody else 
But YOU 
Aw, Dad!
Anyway, I figure she's never
gonna want to talk to me again,
much less go out with me.
What a dumb lie, huh?
What do you know?
My Maxie... in love.
Gosh, you're really growin' up.
It happened so fast...
I guess I sort of missed it.
Well, I think the only thing
for us to do now
is to get you up onstage
with this Powerline feller.
Uh, how are we gonna do that?
Well, you just leave that up to me.
No, Dad, really,
II think we should just,
you know, forget it.
Now how come you always think I'm gonna
lead you into some sort of calamity?
Uh, uh, Dad? Dad?
What's wrong now?
Look!
Ayuk! A waterfall.
Waterfall!
Dad!
Max!
Grab ahold, Max!
No!
No! Ah!
Whoa!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Dad!
Aaaaaaah!
Ten o'clock, two o'clock,
quarter to three. Tour jeté. 
Twist.
I'm a little teapot 
Let her fly!
Huh?
Aaah! Aah! Aah!
The perfect cast.
Boy, this has been one crazy vacation.
And it's not over yet!
Dad.
Oof. We made it!
Come on, Max.
Let's get you onstage.
Uh, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Yeah, yeah 
Oh, then again...
Dad? Dad!
Hey yeah 
I got myself a notion 
One I know that you'll understand 
We set the world in motion' 
By reaching out for each other's hand 
Dad?
Maybe we'll discover 
What we should have known all along 
What are you doin' here? Hey!
Yeah 
One way or another 
Max? Max?
Together's where we both belong 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever' 
We're seein' it 121' 
That Goof kid ain't there.
Don't worry, he'll be there.
Seein' it 121
Seein' it 121' 
Excuse me. Uh...
Seein' it 121' 
I think we're seein' it 
Max?
Yeowee! Yeowee!
Hey, Dad. Dad!
Do the perfect cast!
If you're ever lonely 
Stop, you don't have to be 
Whoa! Whoaaa!
After all, it's only a beat away 
From you to me 
Take a look inside to see
Yeah 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
Yeah! Max is on the tube!
That's Max. I know him...
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever
We're seein' it 121 
He did it!
Seein' it 121' 
Seein' it 121, baby' 
For the first time
For the first time 
Seein' it, seein' it, baby 
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah 
For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Come on, baby 
121
121 
Uzfl 
Yeah 121' 
You're doin' the right thing, son.
Yeah, I know.
But she'll probably
never talk to me again.
Well, if she doesn't...
maybe she's just not the one for you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Ah, hi! Remember me?
Daddy! 
Max, I saw you on TV.
You were great!
Yeah? I mean, no, no.
I mean, uh...
Roxanne, I lied to you.
I don't even know Powerline.
What are you talking about?
A billion people saw you dance with him.
Yeah, well...
I never met him before...
the concert, that is.
You mean that story
about Powerline and your dad...
Why would you make up something like that?
I don't know.
I guess I just...
wanted you to like me.
I already liked you, Max.
From the very first time
I heard you laugh.
"Ayuk."
So, you wanna do something tonight?
Definitely! Oh! Oh, no, I can't. I can't.
What?
Well, I'm kinda doin'
somethin' with my dad.
Honest!
How 'bout tomorrow?
Deal.
Ayuk! Hahahahayuk!
Yeowhoohoohooee!
Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad.
Enchanté, mademoiselle. 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
I got myself a notion' 
And one I know that you'll understand 
We'll set the world in motion' 
By reaching out for each other's hand 
Maybe we'll discover 
What we should have known all along 
Yeah' 
One way or another
Together's where we both belong 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever
We're seein' it 121 
If a wall should come between us' 
Too high to climb
Too hard to break through 
I know that love will lead us' 
And find a way to bring me to you 
So don't be in a hurry 
Think before you count us out 
Oh, you don't have to worry 
I will never let you down
Nothin's gonna stop us now 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever
We're seein' it 121 
Wes, we're seein' it 121' 
Wes, we are' 
Seein' it 121' 
Seein' it 121' 
Seein' it 121' 
I guess we're seein' it 121, yeah' 
Uzfl 
If you're ever lonely, stop 
You don't have to be' 
After all it's only
A beat away from you to me 
Fake a look inside to see, yeah' 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever
We're seein' it 121 
If we listen to each other's heart' 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever
We're seein' it 121 
Seein' it 121' 
Seein' it 121, baby' 
For the first time 
For the first time 
Seein' it, seein' it, baby 
Seein' it 121, yeah' 
For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Seein' it, baby, we're seein' it 121 
121, yeah 
Come on, baby, 121' 
121, 121

Yeah 121' 
Yeowhoohoohooee!
