'bout de behind feet of a mule
den gettin' kicked by 'em.
Sure as I'm named Remus.
An' Jes' cause dese yer tales 'bout
critters like Brer Rabbit, an' Brer Fox...
Dat don' mean dey ain't de
same like kin happen to folks...
So dem what can't learn
from a tale 'bout critters,

ears tuned fer lis'nin.
Like as not dey too busy goin' along
all mixt up wid dey own troubles, uh...
Uh... Like de time dat
Miss Sally an' Mister John
was comin' down
to de plantation.
Mama?
Yes Johnny?
Why are we going to Grandma's?
Well, I told you dear, for a visit.
Why don't she come to see us,
like she did last spring?
Well, Because it __ I thought
you'd enjoy seeing the plantation.
Is Grandma mad at us?
But of course not, Johnny.
What ever gave you that idea?
Well, Georgie says everybody's mad
at what Daddy writes in the newspaper.
Don't Grandma read the newspaper?
Don't she?
She does. And she likes what's in it.
John, please.
Are you mad at each other too?
Why no, dear. Of course not.
Gracious goodness, Johnny...
We's almost dar! Lissen!
You ain't never heer'd no
frogs like dem in Atlanta.
You know what they're saying?
Kneedeep! Kneedeep!
Honest?
Honest.
Kneedeep! Kneedeep!
You know, when I was your age,
I used to catch lots of 'em.
I remember one time I
ah hid a whole box of 'em
over in your
grandma's milk house
and they got loose.
Yes, an' I 'members what
you got for doin' it too.
Well, it was old Uncle
Remus' fault, you know.
He told me that story
about Brer Frog.
De tale 'bout his
havin' a tail an' losin' it?
That's it. Only uh...
How can there be a tale...
Tempy and John: When dey ain't no tail.
Aunt Tempy?
What is it, child?
Is Uncle Remus real?
Real? 'Corse he's real.
You jes' wait 'til you hears him
tell a tale 'bout Brer Rabbit.
Den you'll know he's real.
Welcome home, my daughter.
And you too, sir. Oh, it's
good to have a man in the house again.
Turn around here, young man.
Let me have
a look at you.
You favor your grandfather
more every time I see you.
Toby!
Yassum, Miss Doshy.
This is my grandson Johnny..
And he's the apple of my eye.
Now, you take good care
of him and show him our plantation.
And if he gets into trouble,
you see that he gets out of it.
Yassum.
I hope you're a noisy boy.
I love noisy children.
It makes it so much easier to tell
where they are and what they're up to.
Aunt Tempy, is that Uncle Remus?
Uncle Remus? Lawzy no, honey.
Dat's jes' Ned.
Come on,
I'll show you the big grandpa clock.
I've been hearing about the
clatter you've raised in Atlanta.
Thumping for cotton mills, railways,
and... heaven knows what.
Miss Doshy?
Where do you want me to put dishyer trunk?
Put it in the..
Oh well, never mind.
Perhaps I'd better show him myself.
Come along.
Now be careful you
don't bump into things.
Sally...
Well? What are you going to tell her?
Have you changed your mind,
or are you still going to stay?
Oh, I have to stay John.
It wouldn't be fair to mama.
She has enough responsibility __
I'm not going to saddle her with ours.
But it's only for a short time. She's
be only too glad to take care of Johnny.
When dat big han' gits straight up,
watch out!
What I tell you!
Oh, Miss Doshy, Sally wants Johnny
to stay here for awhile... with you.
What will you do?
Oh, I'm going back.
And I want Sally to go with me.
It's no use, John.
I'm not going back.
Then...
I'll have to go without you.
And I'd better hurry,
or I'll miss my train.
Miss it! You won't regret it.
Daddy? You're going back?
Yes, son.
Why?
I have to.
But __ You __ You've
never left mama and me before.
No, I know. But I've got a job
to do, and you've got one too.
Taking care of
mother and grandmother.
You'll do that now for
me, won't you?
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye Miss Doshy.
Goodbye John.
Goodbye Sally.
Goodbye.
Daddy! Don't! Don't go!
Please Daddy! Please!
I won't stay here!
If you go, I'm going too!

The mos' bodacious

Straight back to his briar patch.
Where's Brer Rabbit's briar patch?
Whar?
Well now, lemme see..
Dat I can't zackly say,
'cause I ain't been keepin close
track as I uster, but..
Do you think we could find it?
Find it? Co'se we could!
But what's the use o' speculatin'

Do you think we

Not go?
After I done fixed all dis grub?
But you said it

Well..

Oh nemmine, honey. Nemmine.

Unc' Remus.
Unc' Remus,
I can't find Johnny no place.
An' I'se s'posed
to take keer o'him.
Well,
whadda you know 'bout dat?
I reckon he done
for, Unc' Remus.
He mighter
got hisse'f los'..
He mighter fell in de mill pon'..
He mighter got et up.
Why, it's him! It sho is!
Tain't nobody else!
How you like dat, Unc' Remus!
It's Him.
Mebbe it's jes his ghost.
Is you? Naw, suh! Dat's him!
Dat's him awright! Oh, oh!
What's the matter, Toby?
I'se jes' thinkin..
He's sho' gonna
ketch it when he gits home.
I guess I better take my foot in
my hand, Uncle Remus, an' git agoin.
Hol' on dar! I reckon you better
let ol' Unc' Remus go 'long wid you.
Tempy.
Yessum.
Tempy, go and find Uncle Remus
and see if Johnny is with him.
Never mind, Tempy!
Now, maybe I can get some sleep.
You think they're waiting for me?
Dey ain't passin' de time o' day.
Son! Where have you been?
Lawzy, Miss Sally, didn't sis
Tempy tell you he was wid me?
Yes, she told me..
but it's so long past Johnny's bedtime.
Tooby sho, Miss Sally.
I was tellin' him a tale 'bout Brer Rabbit.
An' I plum
forgot de time.
Well, I don't mind your
telling him stories, Uncle Remus.
But you know perfectly well,
it's too late for him to be up.
Yessum.
'Twon't happen again, Miss Sally.
I'm sure it won't. Well, son, let's
run along upstairs and get ready for bed.
Miss Doshy, Johnny forget de bundle.
Didn't I tell you to run along
home befo' yo' maw takes a stick after you?
You and your stories!
Miss Doshy..
What us gonna do 'bout dat child?
I wish I knew. A grandmother
doesn't count for much these days.
Yassum, it's a pity, too.
What dat child needs is his paw.
And that's what his mother needs..
But I'm afraid it's going to take
a little while
for her to find that out.
Might cut de time down a piece,
Miss Doshy, if you jes' draps a word.
If I want your
advice I'll ask for it.
I'm a stubborn old
woman Uncle Remus
Yassum, Miss Doshy,
I knows dat. Well, goodnight.
Goodnight.
You ain't mad wid
me, is you, Miss Doshy?
You meddling old rascal!
Of course I'm not mad with you.

Looka here! I brung you sumpin!
Oh, he's beautiful!
Mawnin', Brer Frog!
How do you do?
'kneedeep', Brer Frog,
'kneedeep', 'kneedeep'.
He got to be in de
water befo' he say dat.
Where'd you get him?
At the mill pond?
Yea!
How come you know dat?
My daddy, he told me.
He's caught lots of 'em.

Let's go down after
breakfast and get some more.
Yea, maybe Uncle
Remus'll let us use his frog box.
Come on, Brer Frog!
Say it.
Johnny! Are you awake?
Good morning, dear.
Toby and Johnny: Mawnin!
Did you have a nice sleep?
Yes'm.

Come on! Take him!


Here we are now.
Let's hurry up and get dressed.
Do I have to wear THAT suit?
Yes, dear. Daddy's
mother is coming to see us today.
And the collar, too?
Yes, dear, of course.
She made it for you herself.
She'll want to see
how nice it looks on you.
But Toby and I
were goin frog huntin'.
Well that's all right, darling.
You can go another day.
Now get dressed
and come on down to breakfast.
Jes' lookin' at de
mill pon' won't hurt yo' clothes none.
It's no fun just to look.
Sho 'tis! 'Sides, us
gotter take Brer Frog back, ain't we?
We leave him 'round here,
he liable to get stomped on..
or runned over.. or lost.
You look mighty sad.
Like yo' miss yo' fambly.
S'pose you never
saw yo' maw or paw ag'in.
Well, I guess just
taking him back ain't frog huntin'!
'Cose 'tain't! Come on!
If you take dishyer horse,
we kin git dar a heap quicker. Here!
How far is it?
Jes' a li'l piece.
Over dar, 'roun' de bend.
Come on! I'll beat you.
Whoa! Stay away from dar!
You can't cut 'cross dar!
Why not?
Dat's why!
Sho is lucky I was wid you.
What's that for?
Test whether de
wind blowin' good or bad.
An' if it's blowin' towards de
bull, dat ain't good.
'Cause den he smell you
comin' an ketch you on his horns sho!
De best way is to
don't cut 'cross dar 'tall.
Giddyap! Giddayap!
We oughta drown him.
Sure, he's the runt.
Yeah.
This here's my puppy!
You leave 'im 'lone.
Aw, go on, Ginny.
Ha ha ha.

Ol' Brer Possum, got a trick

Now who wants to live like dat.

Well I do, I shorly

But he's mine!
Ginny gave him to me!
What yo' maw gonna say

But I...
An' fuddermo', he'd be hollerin' an' squallin'

Co'se, don't 'speck a li'l dawg

Matter of factly I
'spected you zackly then,
cuz sooner or later I know
you'll be hangingn aroun',
and want my cookin' again.
But you ain't gonna get it.
Al'ays manage to
come callin' on bakin' day,
and totin' in three or four
measley little piece of fire wood. Humph!
Some folks does de work,
while others jest visits.
Sit around whiddlin' and tellin'
stories... like Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit.
Stick his nose in dish here
kitchen and we have Brer Rabbit stew.
Sis Tempy,
I said it befo', I says it now
and I says it again' there
never was a better cook
in these here
parts nor nowhere else.
Humph! Ya ain't pullin' no
wool over my eyes. Here!
What you all doin' 'roun'
here, anyhow?
We wants to see Miss Sally.
Yeah.
What you want to see her about.
'Bout our dog.
Yeah.
Why, 'tain't dey dawg.
It's Johnny's.
No 'tain't.
What's dat?
When he brung it
here, Miss Sally tol' him
to take it right straight
back what he got it.
Why dat li'l scamp.
Where you goin'?
To git Miss Sally.
Uh...oh.
Ain't i done tol'
you to stop pesterin' folks
'bout dat mangy ol' puppy?
Now go on home. Go on,
befo' i gits fractious!
We ain't goin'
'til we sees Miss Sally.
Yeah.
Miss Sally ain't got no
time to be bothered wid you.
An' she don't wanter hear no
talk about dat dawg, neither.
What's this all about?
Johnny's got our dawg
__ An' we we wants it back!
Your dog? You don't
mean that little puppy?
Yassum. Johnny took it down to
ol' Remus's so's you wouldn't know.
Is that right, uncle remus?
Well, you see
miss sally, I had..
I see. Uncle remus'll get your
dog back to you. Now run along, please.
You gonna whup johnny?
Ya oughta!
Johnny said he didn't
care if we told you....
...but not to tell our maw.
and when we told her,
she giv'd us a whuppin'.
Lawzy, Miss
Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.
He was jes' trying
to be like Brer Rabbit.
I told him a tale 'bout de tar baby
an' he just got a
li'l bit too bodacious,
and outreached
hisse'f, dat's all.
Uncle Remus,
i'm trying my best to bring up Johnny
to be obedient and truthful.
But you and your stories
are making
that very difficult.
I think maybe it would be better if
he didn't hear any more for awhile.
Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no....
They only confuse him.
Now I know you mean well, Uncle
Remus, but Johnny's too young.
Miss Sally.....
I'll have to ask you
not to tell him any more.
Yassum, Miss Sally......
But what else
could I have done, mama?
I can't just overlook it,
he has to learn to mind.
That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,
the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.
Well, he has his
mother....and his grandmother.
We're not enough, sally.
The boy must have friends.
And if it's not Uncle
Remus, or the Favers children
then it must be someone else....
someone of his own age.
That's just good common sense.
What you trackin'
through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout
messin' 'roun' my kitchen?
Johnny!
Yes, mama.
Do you know what next tuesday is?
Uh...of course. My birthday.
That's right, dear.
And what happens then?
I get presents.
And a birthday
party. Would you like that?
A party? Sure!
With lots of nice
little boys and girls.
Can i ask Ginny?
Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...
...That one more
won't make any difference.
Gee! Thanks!
Will daddy come?
Well, dear...uh...I'll
write and ask him.
Oh boy.
Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?
Uncle Remus?
A present for Teenchy!
Where's Teenchy?
He's gone.
Gone?
Then we gotta find him.
Sump'n might happen to him...
if he runs around loose.
He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.
Then, where is he?
He's back at de Favers. Dat's
where he b'longs an' you knows it.
But teenchy's
my dog. He's mine.
Ginny gave him
to me, and you said...
Nemmine what I said! Yo' maw
tol' you to take dat dawg back whar he
come from an' you ain't done it.
She don't like dat, an' I don't blame her.
But he wasn't
botherin' anybody.
She yo' maw an' she
know what's bes' for you!
But...but...I...I
love him.
He...he loves me.
You should'na done it, Uncle Remus.
Jake'll drown
him! I know he will.
Ain't no use o' you carryin'
on. Puppy's gone an' dat's dat.
You don't even care! Teenchy's
gone...and you don't care at all.
Don't make no difference
whether I does or whether I don't.
I'm jes a wo' out ol'
man what ain't no good to nobody.
But uncle remus,
you're...the best friend i have.
Mebbe so, but i'm dat pestered I
don't know whether i'm endupperds or
enddownerds.
But I does know dis...
I ain't goin' ter be
tellin' you no mo' stories.
Chickama,

I went to the
well to wash my toe!
When I got
there, the well was bare!
What time is it, old witch!
Hurry, maw, hurry!
Maw Favers: I'm doin' the best I can.
Please, maw!
The party'll be over.
Maw Favers: If you don't quit bobbin' up
and down I'll never get this collar on.
I'm just doin' like you told me.
Maw Favers: Well, don't forgit

I'll clean off your dress.
You're just makin' it worse.
