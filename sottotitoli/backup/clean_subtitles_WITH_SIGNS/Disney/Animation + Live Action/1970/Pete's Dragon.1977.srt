Petey. 

Where'd he go? 

He must have went thataway. 
Oh, Petey... 

I'll wring his neck! 

Petey! 
Petey. 

Elliott, put me down.

Look around. 
Spread out! 
They're getting closer.
We'd better hide.

Stop swingin' your tail.
You almost knocked me down.
Here they come.
# He's gone thataway #
# He's went thisaway #
# He's up a tree I think! #
# Oh Petey, Oh Petey...
Where are you? Please come back #
# Oh Petey, Oh Petey...
You're like a son to us #
# We miss you, We miss you
# If I get near him you can bet I won't miss him with this. #
# I'll cook you cake and gingerbread,
Bring you tea in bed on a tray, #
# We'll slave while you go fishing
You'll get permission to run and play #
# These tears oughta show you I care
Come back, by cracky we'll share #
# The happiest home in these hills...in these hills! #
# Gonna snag him, gag him, drag him through town
Put his head in the river, let the pup drown, #
# Trap him, strap him, wrap him in a sack. Yeah! #
# Tie him screaming to a railroad track. #
# We'll have you sing in chapel
You'll be the apple of Momma's eye #
# I'll tend to all your sowing and do your mowing
So just rely on me #
# Dang, we know you're out there
It's late, we're waiting to share #
# The happiest home in these hills...in these hills! #
# Gonna paw him, claw him, saw him in half,
When he cries out for mercy we'll just laugh, #
# Beat him, heat him, eat him for dessert. Yeah! #
# Roast him gently so the flames won't hurt. #
Squish down!

Petey.
No, don't!



Somethin' hit me!

What somethin'?
If I knowed what somethin',
I wouldn't call it "somethin',"
I'd call it by its name.
I told you not
to swing your tail.
No, no, don't!





You done it! 

Dumb polecats!
Fightin' it out while that little
snake of a kid gets further away!

Why are y'all playing in the mud...
when you know we gotta
find that boy?
He's gotta be around
here somewhere. Find him!
Aw, Ma!
Why don't we...
just go on back home
and do some eatin'?
I'll tell ya... 'cause you
ain't gonna do no eatin'...
until you find 
that little brat! 

Who done that?

Hey, Ma, why don't we just get
ourselves another orphan, huh?
Because I done paid
our last $50 for Pete,
plus 50 cents legal fees.
And we ain't got another
$50 plus legal, that's why!
Do ya understand? Well, here's 
somethin' you will understand. 
You're gonna have to start workin'
the farm with your own two hands...
less'n you spot
that little twerp.

And get me out of
this here mud hole, Merle.
Come on. I'm stuck. 
Don't just sit around in it. 
Come on. 
Get me out of here. 


Petey! Petey!

Petey! Petey, Petey, Petey! 
# You'll swim and you'll go camping
You'll be a champ in your own backyard #
# Our love is overflowing, it keeps on growin'
You'll sleep good knowing you're home... #
# In these hills
We're gonna string him from a tree #
# In these hills
We're gonna sting him like a bee #
# In these hills
We're gonna spill him on his head #
# In these hills
We're gonna fill him full of lead #
# In these hills... #
We better stay here.
I'm tired, aren't you?

Good night, Elliott.






Hi, Elliott.
Oh, boy.
Those look good.
## 

I'm starved.
You sure changed my life.
I didn't think I'd ever
be happy until I met you.
Ooh. 
Mm.
Whoops. One left.
You can have it.
Thanks!

Mm. You're
a good cook, Elliott.


# I look in your eyes
and you whisper sweetly #
## 
# We don't match in size
but we fit so neatly #
## 
# It's nice waking up
when you're close beside me #
# Humming in my ear #
## 
You're joking!
I can't believe it. You do?
## 
## 
# I love you too #
# Remember the night
when you first confided #
## 
# And things went so right
that we both decided #
## 
# Now we're together
and life is perfect #
# Don't ever disappear #
## 
Oh, really?
## 
Oh, you're just saying that.
## 
Is it true?
## 
# I love you too #
# We're walking down
a road of our own #
# Where rain can never fall # 

# I'm glad I don't
have to be alone #
## 
# You know what to say
when I want direction #
## 
# You don't turn away
when I need protection #


# Your voice is the sound
of an angel singing #
# Music I wait to hear #
## 
Say it again! 
## 
And again!
## 
Everything seems so new!
## 
# I love you too #

"Pazamuhquoddy."
Passamaquoddy.
Sounds like a nice place.

Now, Elliott, we want the people
of Passamaquoddy to like us.
Don't we?

I mean, you're kind of big, and
we don't want to scare anyone.
Do we? 

So you better not 
show yourself, understand? 

I know how ya feel, but you'll
have to make yourself invisible.
## 
Nope.

Uhuh. 
Nope. 

Nope. 


I'm sorry, but
the whole thing has to go.
Behave yourself, Elliott.




Hi!



I told ya
not to fool around.
Get on the sidewalk
and stay next to me.


Look out, Elliott!
Oops. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

I'm sorry, real sorry.
I was telling my dragon
not to bump his head on the sign.
All right, smarties.
Into your classroom.
March, march, march
march, march!

March! March! 
March! March!
How dare you?
I mean, how dare you lie and try to
embarrass me in front of my students.
I wasn't lying.
That's a lie on top of a lie.
Ugh! You're not
one of my pupils.
What school are you
playing hooky from?
II don't go to school.
Ah! I knew it.
That's just
what this town needs.

Another ignoramus. 
No, Elliott.


You disgusting
little street urchin!
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?
Please! I didn't do anything
Your skirt got caught in the nail
Yes!
Your finger nail
Gentlemen,
I propose to say...
Passamaquoddy's
a beautiful community...
where the sun always rises
and the sun always sets.
That's very deep and profound. 
Don't you think?
Elliott...
It's a place of serenity
and security,
where the unexpected 
never happens. 
Ow!

It's okay, Elliott.

It seems to say,
"Welcome!"
YouYou absolute oaf.
YouYou idiot!
No, come, come.
It was that kid that pushed me.
He pulled off 
Miss Taylor's petticoat. 
He walked through my cement
with his big feet.
He scared my horse, Victoria.
Let's get out
of here, Elliott.
WeWell, where is this person?
ThThere he goes!
Well, detain him. Detain him.


Elliott...
Uhoh.
You spoiled everything. 

Darn you, Elliott.
I told you to behave. 


Scallops.
And some oysters.
And...
Oh, hello there,
little boy.
Hi.

Hi.

Hey! Hey, you look terrible.
Whoopee!
Hey, your friend's...
turned green.

If I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was a dragon.
A dragdrag...

Dragon!
Elliott, didn't I tell you that...




Oh! Gentlemen...
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# A green and seething
firebreathing monster is in sight #
# With eyes of red a lion's head
and wings as dark as night #
# He has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He's 50 feet in height #
# It's true, it's true
Oh, what are we to do #
# It's true, it's true
He'll break us all in two #
# Oh, he's comin' in
His great big fin
is right against the door #
# So board up all the windows #
# And get down on the floor #
Has anybody seen my dad?
Nora, please,
my child, come in.
Get off that street.
What's the matter?
Worst thing I ever saw
in my life out on the street.
What was it?
I don't want to tell you for
fear it'll scare you to death!
Scare me.
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# His tail lashing, he'll be
smashing every shop in town #
# With scaly feet he'll crack the
street and tear the steeple down #
# It's not some loony dream I heard
a scream from Sheriff Brown #
# It's true, it's true
Oh, what are we to do #
# It's true, it's true #
# Old Lampie's in a stew #
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear there was a dragon #
# You're off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze #
# You crazy fools
It's all your doggone fault
he's in a daze #
# Let go of me, let go of me
and mend your wicked ways #

Aah!
# What makes you think there
ever was, there never was #
# There never, never, ever was
a dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon
dragon, dragon, dragon ##


Why don't you just calm down?
I seen his face.
If you wanna
call it a face.
It was this close to me.
Why don't you
lie down, Dad? Come on.
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.
Well, did you smile back?
I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.
And you know...
And you know what else?
There was this boy with it.
And he wasn't afraid.
This boy...
Lie down.



## 
We're in a lot of trouble,
and it's all your fault.




I don't wanna play.
You did everything wrong
is Passamaquoddy.
Now everybody hates us.
I don't know whether
you're good for me...
or bad.

I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.
It's just
I don't know what to do,
and I'm scared.


Hello in there! 

Get back!

Hi.
What are you doing here?
Oh, just playing tictactoe.
This isn't exactly
the best place for tictactoe.
The tide's coming in. High water
reaches this cave sometimes.
You better
head for home.
You're not from
Passamaquoddy, are you?
Nope.
Just sort of... traveling.
Where are your parents?
Where are you staying? 
What's your name?
Pete.
I'm Nora, and I have to get back
on watch, up in the lighthouse.
There's chowder on the stove,
if you'd like some.
WhWhat's the matter?
It's a hand, not a shark.
You can finish that chowder...
if you'd like.

Oh, I forgot something.
Be right back.
I forgive you, Elliott.


Stay here till I see what
it's like up in the lighthouse.
Woowoowoowoo!
The Gogans own me,
I guess.
They said it was against the law
for me to ever leave them.
Where did you get
that bruise?
Mr. Gogan. I was milking the cow,
and I missed the bucket.
Had he done that before?
All the time.
The first time I ran away,
the orphan home sent me back.
This time,
I'll just keep running.
Well, you'll be safe here.
Nora, no one's ever been this nice
to me. I'll always remember it.
Pete, why don't you
sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out
what to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.
Are you anybody's mother?
I'm not even anybody's wife.
But you're gonna get
married now, aren't you?
I'm already married
to this lighthouse.
Who's that?
Paul.
Is he part of your family?
He almost was.
How can someone almost 
be part of a family?
We were going to be married. 
How come you weren't?
Well, as far as we know,
his ship was headed for a storm.
They were never heard from
again. That was a year ago.
He'll come back.
I tell myself
the same thing every day,
standing up there
watching for ships on the horizon.
Time I should be thinking
of other things, so they tell me.
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.
He has a way
of knowing things.
Who's Elliott?
My dragon.
Dragon?
So you're
the boy with the dragon.
Yup.
Where is he?
Down in the cave.
That's interesting.
I've never known anyone with
a dragon. What does he look like?
Just a plain,
ordinary dragon.
How plain?
How ordinary?
# He has the head of a camel #
# The neck
of a crocodile #
It sounds rather strange.
# He's both
a fish and a mammal #
# And I hope
he'll never change #
# 'Cause it's not easy
to find someone who cares #
# It's not easy
to find magic in pairs #
# I'm glad I found him
I love him #
# I won't let him
get away #
# 'Cause it's not easy #
# You say
the head of a camel #
# The neck of a crocodile #
And the ears of a cow!
# It's clear that friends
can be different #
# Yes, I understand you now #
# It's not easy
to find someone who cares #
# It's not easy
to find magic in pairs #
# Now that you have him
Hold him #
# Treasure him
from day to day #
# It's so easy #
# Life is lollipops
and raindrops #
# With the one
you love #
# Someone you can 
always be with # 
# Argue and agree with #
# Climb the highest tree with #

# It's not easy #
# To share somebody's dream #
# It gets easy
when you work as a team #
# You've got to tend it
Fan it #
# That's what
I plan to do #
# Oh, I had one friend
by my side #
# Now I have two #
# Him and you #
# Him and me #

# And it's so easy ##
## 
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, son.
Nice to see you again.
Ah. Thank you.
Aah!
It's you!
What's the matter?
It's you. 
The boy with the dragon. 
Yes, sir.

Dad! Dad, what is it?
The boy with the dragon. 
I know. Now, just take it easy.
You saw it.
You saw it?
I didn't actually see it, 
but I know what it looks like. 
But wha...
We'll talk about it later.
OOne thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?
No, Elliott's down in the cave.
Oh, Ellio...
Elliott? It... It even has a name.
There's nothing
to get upset about.
You're right. Right, there's
nothing to get upset about.
Nothing. No, why should I
get upset? I should be happy.
I... I should be happy! I'll go down
to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.
I'll say, "Boys, here it is." Then
hear the apologies. 
Elliott'll be happy
to do it for you, sir.
Good boy. Good lad.
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.
Oh. Elliott...
He won't... won't start
to scratch or...
or fight, or set anything
on fire, will he?
Well, he's sort of...
Sort of what?
Unpredictable.
Don't do anything with Elliott.
WhWhy don't you
leave him where he is?
It's too dangerous
to take him into town.
It's dangerous.
I don't want either one of you
to say a word about Elliott...
to anyone, do you understand,
No. No. Yes!
Until we've 
talked this over. 
Let's all have breakfast. The lamp
has to be polished, the lens cleaned,
and I want to take Pete
to buy new clothes.
Yes, well, clean Elliott
and eat the lamp.
I mean, we'll...
cleaclean the lamp.
Elliott! The name's
Elliott. Did you hear that?
Doc Terminus is comin'!
Are they still after us?
We lost 'em.
Good.
Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
What?
Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy! 
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. 

Slow down!
My fence!
WET! WET!
It's still wet
Throw out the anchor!
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.


When did I start losing control of my town!
You dummy!
You told me to drop the anchor, I dropped the anchor.
Watch Bones.
Get him off of me! Get him off!
I think they remember us.
Uhoh. I think 
I remember them. 
Just act normal.
I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.
Quick, what's the name 
of this town again? 
Passamaquoddy.
"Quassama" what?
Passamaquoddy!
Got it. How wonderful to see
your smiling faces again.
All of you. 
II've never known
such warmth,
such welcome,
such loving hospitality.
Get out, ya quack!
And don't bring those
phony remedies here again.
Go on back where
you belong: Jail.

Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
I sense enthusiasm,
I sense loving response,
and that's why I feel
that this is my home...
away from home.

I know.
Pete, if you bring up the oil can,
we'll be ready for the night.
Sure. Before that, I'd like
to show Elliott my new suit.
No! No, no.
You can't bring Elliott up here.
Government regulation 302
states that...
no dragons
shall be allowed...
on the premises of
the United States' lighthouses.
Now, go on down and get 
the oil so I can mark it up 
in the log that you did that. 
Okay. Nora, first can I bring
Paul's picture down to Elliott?
Then he can start
looking for Paul.
All right.


Thanks, Dad.
For what? 
For making believe about the
dragon and going along with it.
Making...
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.
I'm not making believe.
I actually saw it.
And I haven't been
the same since!
Go to the cave; you'd see
it too, and your eyes would...
pop right out!

I was there.
I saw nothing!
Dad, be realistic.
Oh, you wanna be realistic. Let's
talk about how realistic you are.
Here you are, waiting for
someone to come back that just
ain't gonna come back, Nora.
And if waitin' for over
a year hasn't told ya nothin',
then you're not the one to talk
about being realistic, are you?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I'm going down
to the hardware store.

Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?
Wow!


And new shoes too.
Look at the way they shine!

Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.
I want you to concentrate
on finding Paul for Nora.
This is what he looks like.

Remember his face.
Try real hard.
Hmm.

Better go now.

Aww.
See ya tomorrow.


I've had nothing,
nothing but bad luck in this burg.
Hey! Ooh...
I'm sorry, Doc.
You see what I mean, hmm?
Doc, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, Hoagy.
Can I buy everybody a round?
Yeah.
Huh? Well... Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I gotta talk to you. Okay?
Sit down.
May I? Thank you.
Hey, you're a ma... You're
a man of science, ain't you?
A man of science, yes.
Yes, I am.
With degrees from
the Royal Medical College, London.
Huh?
The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
Oh!
And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
Oh. You know
anything about dragons?
Of course I do. I see them in all
the big cities going down the streets,
with that funny little walk, wearing
bright colors, fluttering around...
No, no, no. I'm talkin'
about a real dragon.
Real dragon. With fire...
fire coming out of his mouth.
And he's got real wings. 
Uh, you need
a veterinarian. Hmm?
Why do you ask?
I saw one.
Is it sitting at the next table?
Hmm? 
I tell ya, I saw a real dragon
yesterday afternoon.
He's owned... owned
by a young boy...
by the name of Pete.
You are trying to tell me
that there is a dragon here...
In Passamacracka? Yeah.
"Quoddy."
Yes.
I told you this was a rotten town.
Well, in my educated
opinion, sir,
I think you've been up
in your lighthouse too long.
Huh?
Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?
In my scientific opinion,
the existence of a dragon...
would have an impact
of gigantic proportions.
Mythology and legend would
become history and science.
One could really make
a quick buck with it.
Well, I can prove it.
I can prove it!
HHis name is Elliott.
HHe's downstairs.
You could go and see him right now.
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.
I have an appointment with a young lady
who's interested in a nursing career.
Oh. Oh.
I wanna see it.
You wanna see it?
Well, see it you shall!
Okay.
But first
first let's have a quick one
Because...
of the rocks we have to climb
And the dragon
the dragon is scary
Ok! We'll have one for your rocks
And one for the scary
"Quoddy."
hmm..??
I tell you
that he's in there.


Are you convinced?
Absolutely.
Well, let's get outta here.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a mi...
II want to pet him.
Huh? You wa...
You want to pet him?
Are you crazy?
I know you ain't drunk.
No matter what 
you see in here, 
don't get scared. 

Hey, I might as well 
tell you straight off, 
you're gonna see
a hideous monster.
Oh, no. 
Oh, yes. 
And it's big.
Fifty feet of terror!
Claws! Claws so sharp
they could tear a man to shreds.

Eyes, evil eyes... 
that can see 
right through ya. 
And a tail that's
so big and powerful,
it could destroy
the hull of a frigate!
It can wipe out
an entire crew...
with one swish
of his tail.
Face... Face so terrible,
it could turn 
a man to stone, 
a hero into a coward.
A flame so hot,
it could roast
a turkey!
And a mouth
so terrible,
it could devour a man and...
spit him 20 leagues.
Stay close.

It's ggggot mme.


Look at it!



Them eyes are lookin'
right through us.
Look, don't ever let a dragon
know you're... you're afraid of him.


StopStop shaking,
andand smile.
Can't stop shaking,
and I am smiling.

Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.

Aah! Hey,
see how smart he is?

He said hello to me.
Yeah! He likes me!
You do somethin' so he'll like you.
LLike me?
Yeah. Do somethin'
to make him like you.
Huh?
You think?
Elliott, would you...
would you like
a little bbelt, huh?



Hmm?







## 

Is it... Is it two parts fish oil
and three parts seawater...
and six parts
potato squeezings,
or is it only
two parts seawater, hmm?
Ten parts seawater, hmm? That much.
No wonder they love it.
Ssssss...
Saw it.
Saw what?
ElElEl...
DraDraDra...
What is an "elelel
dradradra," hmm?
DrDrDragon.

II saw the dragon.
LLampie wasn't lying.
It's real. It belched flame at me.
Belched?
You saw a belching dragon?
You sure you weren't belching
yourself in front of the mirror?
NNever saw anything
so horrible in my life.
ThThought
I was a goner.
There was no need
for him to do that.
I only offered him
a sociable drink.
Hoagy, I can't stand you
when you're drunk.
Doc, look at me.
I'm not drunk.
What I saw tonight
sobered me in a second.
I swear... I swear to you,
there's a big, horrible dragon...
up in that cave, I swear.
I just realized, I can't
stand you when you're sober!
Now, get out of here. Get yourself
a good, stiff drink. Out!
I swear.
A vicious dragon.
Out!
Dragon.
## 
9 and 9 are 18
Really!!
9 x 9 are 81
Amazing!!
2000 pounds make a ton
wow!
That sign says "Passamaquoddy"
You still have to go to school
Do I have to like it??
Like it or hate it, you have to go.
Do you wanna be stupid when you grow up?
Like the gogans?
Ok! I like it, I like it.
Isn't that the boy with the dragon?
I think so.
Let's go see.
Common
Are you the boy with the dragon?
Yup!
Is it he dragon or she dragon?
You don't name girls "Elliott".
Where is he?
Following me
Elliott the dragon is walking right there.
I can't seem to make out his color.
Mostly green.
He's not too big, is he?
Regular dragon size.
Wow!
Pete! School
I ain't got hardly
nothin' to sell.
So? I pulled my nets in,
and there weren't a fish in 'em.
I just docked. There ain't nothin'
out in that ocean but water.
It's real strange,
I'm tellin' ya.
It's like every fish
sorta disappeared.
Just suddenly
up and disappeared.
There's the cause of it. 
That kid Pete. 
From the day he come to town,
the fishing turned sour.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's that crazy dragon talk of his.
That kid's been nothin'
but bad luck wherever he goes.
You're a bunch of
superstitious dingdongs.
You know that fishing grounds
shift from time to time.
Elliott'll make
the fish come back.
There he goes,
talkin' dragons again.
Hey, kid! There ain't no room
in this town for a dragon,
and there ain't no room in this town
for jinxes like you, neither!
Well, if there's enough room
for a chowderhead like you,
then there's more than
enough room for a dragon.
# There's room for everyone

You're late. You're late. 
Late. Late. Late. 
Why is every body late?
We were playing with Nora, Pete, and his dragon.
His wagon!!
NO! " Dragon "
Dragon, wagon! That's no excuse for being late.
Get inside.
Good morning Miss Tailor.
Goodmorning.
Thank you for making my students late
and for disrupting my entire schedule.
You have a new student.
I have?
This is Pete.
Oh! him.
Well! if he's a transfer, I'll have to have his records.
Unfortionately, his old school burnt down
and his records were destroyed.
Pete! Give her 9 x 9.
Then I'll have to have his birth certificate
Tragically, flames from the school house set fire at the city hall
and his birht certificat went up with it.
Pete! give her a ton.
2000 pounds.
Do you want him to spell "Passamaquoddy" ?
No, no no.
This is irregular irregular irregular.
But he needs an education, educatin. education.
Surely you can't disagree with that.
I would if I could.
But I can't

Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.
I'll stop it.
Elliott, stop it!

The bell isn't supposed
to ring till recess!
Stop that!
I'm not doing it.
Liar. Liar, liar.
It's the knuckle cracker
for you.
Three for lying and three...
for whom the bell tolls. Come.
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.
One. Two.
Three! Four! 
It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
Elliott!
Whom?
My dragon.

Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!
Three more
for your imagination!
Seven! Eight! 
And a great big nine! 
Go stand in the corner.

Work, work, work, everyone. 
All this nonsense
about a dragon.
## 
No, Elliott!
You did it! You pulled
the chair out from under me.
It was Elliott.
That does it.
You've had a taste
of the knuckle cracker.
Now you'll have a dose
of the behind breaker.
Bend over. 


No, no, Elliott.
Get out!



No, Elliott, you're going
about this the wrong way.
Go back to the cave. Go on!

Jehoshaphat! 
Would you look at that! 
Why do I hear a bell ringing?
School must be out.
It's too early, stupid.
See, I told you.
School is out.
Wait! What's happening?
Pete's dragon wrecked the school!
I told you.
I told you!
What's happened 
over there? Something crashed 
right through the school. 
Look at it, I'm telling you.
It's a big hole in the side of the wall.
And a dragon 
came in through one wall... 
and went out the other wall. 
Now do you believe me?

You think this kid Pete
would sell it?
Money talks.
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.
Will miracles never cease?
Dragons, dragons, dragons.
Dragons.

Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?
At last we've seen the light.

I tell you, you've got to have
a sense of humor these days.
And you must be Pete.
Yes, sir!
I'm Dr. Terminus,
and this is Hoagy,
who's doing
his internship with me.
I heard about the incident
at school yesterday.
I'd rather not discuss it.
I realize you must be
disturbed about it, and, uh,
up to here in dragons.
You know, Pete, I have
always loved dragons.
They're such
wonderful creatures.
When they're not busy
destroying things, of course.
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...
I would have
my very own dragon.
I would consider my life 
to be fulfilled... 
and would be most grateful
if you would sell me your dragon.
You wanna buy Elliott?
Sight unseen. As is.
We'll give him
a good home. Bless him.
I couldn't sell him.
Sure you could! That's what life
is all about: Buying and selling.
I'll give ya three dollars.
Offer him four!
I'll offer him five.
It'll make his head swim.
Five... dollars.
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.
Well, what did ya do, rent him?
Well, who owns him?
Well, nobody, I guess.
He just came to me. He only
goes to those who need him.
I need him.
Listen Doc, I don't know what you're up to,
but you better forget about this.
He's not for sale.
Nora, go paint your lighthouse.
Pete, my boy,
you're conversant with Elliott.
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.
Look, deliver Elliott to me
and the fiver is yours,
plus a bottle of my medicine
that's guaranteed to bring on
puberty two years ahead of time,
and that's better than
a dragon, hmm? 
Doc, maybe you should
talk to Elliott yourself.
Mmhmm.
WhWhere is he?
Does he speak English?
Down the beach.
Where?
Right there, by the water.
Right. I still don't see...
That's because he's invisible today.

They know they're sitting
on a gold mine.
Well, they've had their chance
to make a few dollars.
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!
# We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up #
# Can't you hear
that jinglejangle sound #
# Oh yeah #

# It's money, money, money
by the pound ##

Ahh!

Uh! Ahahah!

Fog! Fog! 
Where's the fog?
There's not much fog.
We were just using the horn
to chase off a few buzzards.
Few buzzards. Nora,
how many times must I...
Oh, started already, huh?
Look, if you're
gonna whitewash, son,
let your brush
go up and down, up...
that's a boy...
and down.
Up and down. Up and down.
That's right.

This is fun.
If it's so much fun, I'm gonna leave
it to you and Nora to finish up...
while I go in and take
a nice little nap.
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.
It is? 
Yeah.
Tell him, Nora.
Pete, Lampie and I
have talked it over.
We feel the time has come
for you to stop running.
Yes, it's true.
If it's all right with you, 
we'd like you to live here with us. 
Oh Nora, Lampie, do you mean this
could be my real home?
It certainly does.
And Elliott too?
Well, I...
Sure, and Elliott too.
But Elliott has to live
in the cave.
All right, he will.
Oh.

No, no, no!
Not on me! Not on me!
On the side of the building,
please, huh?
Now up... Up and down.
And down. Up and down.
You know what?

Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen
anything of a mean, fresh kid...
'bout yea big?
Answers to the name of Pete.
Half of the kids in this town
answer to the name of Pete.
Other half don't answer.
Let me break his bones, Pa!
Just a minute!
This particular Pete,
he's always talkin'...
to his big, hokeypokey,
uh, whatchamacallit, uh...
Dragon.
Dragon?
Merle, this here's
the place.
Come on, Willie.
It would be unethical of me to
leave my patient at a time like this.
It's important. 
About the dragon. 
Put your foot on there.
Now, don't move, stay tense,
or that weight will fall,
that clamp will break your jaw,
tear your gums apart
and go through your cheek.
Tense. Tense!


See that wagonload of worms? They're
lookin' for the kid and the dragon.
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.

Careful as you bring 'em aside.
I got one!
I got one!
Ugh! It's ugly!
Well! If it ain't 
our own little Petey! 

The Gogans!
Well, you look so nice and clean,
and those new clothes.
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.
Who's that pretty lady
you're with, little Pete?
Yeah. Introduce us.
Yeah. Introduce us.
I'm Nora, and Pete
is staying with me.
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin'
to break up our happy little family.
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.
I guess we're gonna
take him back now, miss,
to his own home, sweet home.
Come on, Pete.
You won't be taking him anywhere!
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him
whether you like it or not.
Right, boys?
Right, Pa.
Willie, you grab onto Pete,
while I hold onto her.
You grab Pete.
I wanna hold her.
I wanna hold her!
Well, I'm gonna hold her!

All right!
I'll settle this.
You two grab the brat.
I'll hold her.
lf'n you think you're gonna hold her
like my boys wanna hold her,
you're gonna be holdin' your head,
ya understand?
Lady, that boy is ours!

It's downright dangerous,
getting all wet like this.
We done had
our bath in May!
Ahhahhahh...

Bless you, Ma. 

Excuse me, folks.
I witnessed what happened today, and
I'm completely sympathetic with you.
What's sympathetic mean?
I'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.
Oh, Doc, I got
this here "poomonia."
Sit down.
Ahhahhahh...

Bless you, Ma.
Bless you, Ma.

I got this terrible ache in my back!
Good. What's rightfully yours
is rightfully yours.
Now, you want Pete, right?
Right!
Right!
I want... the dragon.
The dragon?
The dragon?

WWWait a minute.
Now I got
a stitch in my side.
You really want
the dragon?
Very much. Mmhmm.
Well, then, what are you willing
to give for it?
The help you need
getting Pete.
I'll need the same kind
of help getting the dragon.


NNow I think the pain's
in my head!
Have we got a deal?
Sure.
We scratch your back,
you scratch ours.
The boathouse,
sunset, hmm?
Uh, Doc.
What you gonna do
with a dragon?
Oh, maybe put him on a ranch,
breed him. Hmm?
Big stud fees.
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.
How would you like to make
the fishing good again?
How do we do that?
Catch that dragon!
Set a trap for him, throw a net
over him, drag him away.
Goodbye, Elliott.
Hello, fish. Hmm?
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word, hmm?


Get back!
Get back!
Dr. Terminus! Here's that 
there harpoon you wanted! 
Good! Put it
right over there!
Now you just
remember our bargain!
Okay, I want separate trip lines
on the primary tarp,
the secondary net
and on the tertiary.
TTertiary?
What's that?
Dragon medicine.

Okay, fix it.
We've done it!
Don't signal
till you're re...

Get this net up off of me!
Will you get this... Will you
get this net up! Up! Up!
Now, I've gotta go
and get that kid.
You rehearse this and make it run
like clockwork or else.
Elliott!
Elliott, you were terrific the way
you saved us from the Gogans.

What?

Do you mean it?

Wow! That's great.
You're the most wonderful dragon
in the whole world.


Wait till I tell Nora!
## 
Nora! Nora! Good news!
Elliott found Paul,
and he's on his way home!
Pete... 
I wouldn't say anything
like that if I were you.
But it's true.
Elliott said.
Please.
There's been enough
talk about Paul,
and Elliott too.

Both of us have to be...
realistic.
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.
And I have to adjust 
my life to it. 
You have to make
a big adjustment too.
You have us now.
You don't have to make believe
your only friend is a dragon.
But I'm not making believe.
That's what I mean
by "realistic."
There are no dragons. 
Except for Elliott.
He's real.
Lampie, you've seen him,
haven't you?
Well, I...
I thought I saw him.
Wait till Paul gets here. Then you'll
know how realistic Elliott is.
Okay.
Until that time, let's try
not to talk about it.
How about filling
the reserve oil can?
Sure.
Well, at least one of us
is entitled to have illusions.


Pete! Pete, it's Elliott!
What's the matter?
Elliott's in Passapaka... Pakadaka...
He's in town, and he's
tearing the place apart.
You've gotta do something.
Oh, no!

We should be
in the channel.
We should've made
Passamaquoddy Light by now.
There it is
It's my home port
I didn't think I'll ever see it again
It's a welcome sign
Looks great to me
I know the light keepers
personally.
He's in there! Come on!
Elliott! Elliott!
Did I say the primary
was really the tertiary?

Never!
Where's Elliott?
Nowhere!
Your hokeypokey dragon's
out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!
Boys!
Let me go!
Now you're never
gonna get away again!
We're gonna put chains
on you when you're workin'!
And when you're not workin'.
And when you're sleepin'!
Okay, okay. Tear him to pieces
in your own time.
Right now he is
the bait for the trap.
Take him where that thing can see
him when he comes through the door.
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal,
and you fire the harpoon 
right into the middle. 
No! No!
Yes! Yes! Got it?
Got it!
But what I don't got is,
hhhow you gonna get that monster,
that hideous beast, that nightmare
sent by the devil, to come here?
Easy. We get someone he knows
to bring him here.
Well, who'd be crazy enough
to do that?
No! No! 
He knows you.
He trusts you.
He scares me!
He hates me!
Hoagy.
We are all on this earth
for a purpose,
and the time
for your purpose is now.
I know that inside this pale, frail,
pathetic shell of a man...
there is a Vesuvius
ready to erupt.
Now, I've known you,
man and beast,
since, since you
were nothing.
But now, Hoagy, now,
you're still nothing,
but you could be
something!
You can be a somebody.
A legend, Hoagy. A legend in
your own lifetime, not a joke!
The moment's here, Hoagy.
Grab it. Grab it!
Today the jester.
Tomorrow the king!
No!
Get out!


EElliott.

Hands...
Elliott, don't let 'em take me!



Wait! Wait!



Huh? Pete!
Thanks, Elliott.

You just listen to me! 
That there boy belongs to me! 
I paid fifty dollars for him,
plus legals, and I got a bill
of sale right here to prove it.

Boo.

Merle, help!

That dragon's gonna get away!

Where is he, where's he?
Elliott! wait wait, Eliott.
I wanna make a deal with you.

You know! like a hangnail or if you shed your skin
Or if your hair falls out
I'll pay you
Top dollar
What's the matter with you?
Don't you have any business sense?
Don't you?
Elliott! Elliott!


He's gonna eat us up!

Oh!


... in the street. 
Quite a storm here. 
Wait a minute.
Watch those stairs.


Oh, look!
ThThThere really
is a dragon!
Yes, and he saved us!
Dragon!
A dragon! A real dragon!
Attaboy, Elliott.


That ship's headed
for the reef!
Go down and sound
the foghorn!

Elliott, quick! Quick!


Nora, let me have the light
so I can see what I'm doing.

Come on, Elliott.
You can do it.

I got it!
Come on, Elliott.

Come on, Elliott!


Hurry! 
What's the matter?
Everything is wet in here,
that's what's the matter!
Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
Elliott?
That's all I need is
a dragon in here. Ah!
Get him outta here!

Start your burner, Elliott.
Light the wick.


All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.

Now, Elliott! Now! 
All right.
Where's the fire?

What's the matter?

He's all squished up in the stairs.



ElElliott?

He's real.
He's really real.


Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.
Can he do it?
Can he? He can throw a flame
clear across to Bar Harbor...
if he can get 
his own burner goin'! 

Come on, Elliott!

Go on!
Come on, Elliott!

Blow, Elliott! 

Wow! 
Elliott, you did it! 


Look there!
That means the harbor
is dead ahead, Captain!
Hard right rudder!
Elliott, I could give you
a great big kiss.

# A dragon, a dragon
You bet we saw a dragon #
# So big and brave, he came to
save a village in distress #
# He kept the ship from crashing
when he heard the S.O.S. #
# He faced a group of villains
and he fought them with success #
# He's great
He's great #
# A chum #
# A pal #
# A mate #
# A dragon, a dragon
We're proud to love a dragon #
# Before he came to fight the storm
the night was dark and dim #
# Now everyone in town is
safe again because of him #
# He filled the ocean full of fish
He packed it to the brim #
# We want it known
that he's our very own ##
Nora! Nora!
Paul!
What happened?
We sank in a storm off Cape patterson
I was the only survivor
When I woke up in the hospital, I had...
I had lost my memory
Then the other day a...
a strange thing happened
My bed suddenly tipped over
I dunno how but..
I knocked my head and everything came back to me
It's a miracle!
It's Elliott
Gather around, everyone. I'm gonna have 
a few appropriate words to say. 
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.
There you are, yes.
It's nice to see you.
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon...
for the council here
and all the townspeople.
You do that?
Well, he's right here.
He'd appreciate it
if you'd thank him yourself.

You mean I can talk right to him?
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign...
No, he's over here.
Oh! Oh, over that side.
So, uh, Elliott, on behalf of...


Thank you.
# It's a brazzle dazzle day #
# So throw off the past
and everything in it #

# That's the brazzle 
dazzle way # 
# Enjoying your time 
from minute to minute ## 
Hi!
Oh, Elliott,
you're the greatest.
You've made everybody happy,
especially me.
I'm very proud of you.

We've got a real family now
and a place to live.


You've gotta go?
When will you be back?


You... You won't be back?

But why?
Did I do something wrong?


There's another kid
in trouble?



Well, if anyone can get him
out of it, you can.
Ohh...


I won't see you again, will I?
Ever.


What are you sniffing for? 



Now, remember,
don't scare people.

Goodbye, Elliott.
Goodbye.

It is a dragon!
It's Elliott!
And remember,
you're supposed to be invisible!
