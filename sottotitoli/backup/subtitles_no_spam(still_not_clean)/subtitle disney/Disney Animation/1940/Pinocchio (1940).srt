my way from hearth to hearth,

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,348
but let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

24
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,862
One night a long time... ahem.

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,365

26
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,658

27
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,287
One night a long time ago,

28
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,373
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.

29
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,458
It was a beautiful night.

30
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,711
The stars were shining like diamonds,

31
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,881
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,675
Pretty as a picture.

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,848
As I wandered along the crooked streets,

34
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,184
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

35
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,895
The only sign of life
was a lighted window

36
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,565
in the shop of a wood-carver
named, uh, Geppetto.

37
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,568
So I hopped over...

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,949
...and looked in.

39
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:25,829
It was a shame to see a nice
cheerful fire like that going to waste.

40
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,456
So what do I do?

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,251
I go in!

42
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,382
I looked around.

43
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,762
Of course, being in
a strange place like that,

44
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,097
I didn't know what to expect.

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,142
A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,441
Soon as I saw there was no one
about, I made myself at home.

47
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,256
As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.

48

53

54
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,318

01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:02,157
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!

873
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,202
Owww! You're comin' right home
with me this minute!

874
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,080
Hey, who's the beetle?

875
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,040
Let go! Put me down!

876
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,792
(MUFFLED) Let me out.

877
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,960
My conscience!
Tells me what's right and wrong.

878
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,587
What?

879
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,298
You mean to tell me you take
orders from a grasshopper?

880
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,885
Grasshopper? Look here,
you impudent young pup!

881
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,888
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshop...

882
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,765
...your conscience, if you have one.

883
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:30,060
Yeah-yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

884
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,230
(YELLS)

885
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,275
Woo-hoo-hoo!

886
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,070
(LAUGHING)

887
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,491
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!

888
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,911
I'll knock your block off!

889
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,708
(LAUGHING)

890
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,085
I'll take you apart
and put you back together!

891
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,087
Don't hurt him. He's my best friend.

892
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:01,091
Why, I'll... Your best friend?

893
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:05,345
And what am I? Just your conscience!

894
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,932
OK, that settles it!

895
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:13,395
- But, Jiminy...
- You buttered your bread. Sleep in it!

896
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,440
(YELLS)

897
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,902
(LAUGHING)

898
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,196
Ha-ha-ha! Go on, laugh.

899
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,991
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through!

900
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,410
- This is the end.
- PINOCCHIO: But Jiminy...

901
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:32,873
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
- Lampwick... Hmph!

902
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,960
Come on, come on. Let him go.

903
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,925
Lampwick... Hmph! Lampwick!

904
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,221
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.

905
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:52,392
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?

906
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,729
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.

907
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:59,316
Open up that door! I wanna go home.

908
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,568
(BRAYING)

909
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,074
COACHMAN: Come on, you blokes,
keep 'em moving!

910
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:12,037
COACHMAN: Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

911
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,748
(BRAYING CONTINUES)

912
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,084
Where'd all the donkeys come from?

913
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,754
COACHMAN: Come on, come on.
Let's have another.

914
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,926
- And what's your name?
- Hee-haw!

915
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,221
OK, you'll do! In you go!

916
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,307
COACHMAN:
You boys'll bring a nice price.

917
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,935
(LAUGHS) All right, next!

918
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,688
And what might your name be?

919
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,440
- Alexander.
- Hmm.

920
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,609
So you can talk!

921
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:47,280
Yes, sir. I wanna go home to my mama!

922
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:50,116
Take him back! He can still talk!

923
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,746
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.

924
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,166
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

925
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,128
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!

926
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:06,800
Boys? So that's what... Pinocchio!

927
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,679
Huh! To hear that beetle talk...

928
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,598
you'd think somethin''
was gonna happen to us.

929
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,939
Conscience! Aw, phooey!

930
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,906
Where's he get that stuff?

931
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,242
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?

932
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,078
What's he think I look like?

933
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,290
- A jackass?
- You sure do!

934
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,416
(LAUGHS)

935
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,085
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

936
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,504
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

(GUFFAWS)

938
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,759
Hee-haw! Did that come outta me?

939
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,473
Oh!

940
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,851
Huh?

941
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,271
What the... What's going on?

942
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,442
Aaah! I've been double-crossed!

943
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,778
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

944
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,281
I've been framed! Help!

945
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:14,492
Please, you gotta help me. Be a pal.

946
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,120
Call that beetle. Call anybody.

947
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,166
Mama?

948
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,461
Mama!

949
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:29,049
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw!

950
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,812
Oh! What's happened?

951
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,981
I hope I'm not too late.

952
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,818
What'll I do?

953
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,281
Pinocchio!

954
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,283
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

955
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,662
Pinoke, the kids, the boys,
they're all donkeys!

956
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,956
Oh! You too.

957
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,876
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

958
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,837
This way, Pinoke. It's the only way out.

959
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,516
Hurry up before they see us.

960
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,895
You gotta jump!

961
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,584
Jiminy? Jiminy?

962
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,920
You all right?

963
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,381
Sure! (COUGH)

964
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:54,217
I thought we'd never make it.

965
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,555
Certainly feels good
to be back on dry land.

966
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,518
Come on, let's get home.

967
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:07,939
- Father, Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto.

968
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:11,109
- It's me, Pinocchio! I'm home to stay.
- (BELL RINGING)

969
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,738
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto. Home at last.

970
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,907
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

971
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,286
PINOCCHIO: Father?

972
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,080
Father, it's me.

973
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,624
Pinoke, come here.

974
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,626
Look.

975
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,879
He ain't here.

976
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,631
PINOCCHIO: He... He's gone.

977
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,967
JIMINY: Yeah, and Figaro.

978
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,928
PINOCCHIO: And Cleo too.

979
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,977
Maybe something awful happened to him.

980
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:49,314
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

981
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:00,575
Hey! It's a message.

982
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,994
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.

983
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,331
- Where is he?
- Why, uh, uh. It says here

984
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:10,251
he went looking for you
and was swallowed by a whale.

985
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,296
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

986
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:17,300
A whale? A whale named Monstro.

987
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,970
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive? Where?

988
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,265
Why, inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.

989
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,267
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh.

990
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,271
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to find him.

991
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,732
Pinoke, are you crazy?

992
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:36,945
- Don't you realize he's in a whale?
- I've gotta go to him.

993
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:41,032
Hey, Pinoke, wait! Listen here, son...

994
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,663
But this Monstro, I've heard of him.

995
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:51,167
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!

996
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,130
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.

997
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,007
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Good-bye?

998
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,802
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya.

999
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,805
Come on... let's go.

1000
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:07,100

1001
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,569

Gee! What a big place.

1003
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,218
Come on, Jiminy.

1004
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:46,222
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.

1005
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,808
One side, sister.

1006
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,316
Well... so long.

1007
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,865
Hmm. Put it in the wrong end.

1008
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:12,415
Hmm! No more privacy than a goldfish.

1009
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,001
Ooo! Chilly.

1010
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:34,103

Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,406
Father?

1013
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,408
Father!

1014
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,661
Huh! He ain't my father.

01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,539

Hey! What the...

Hey, let go! Run along,
you little... squirt.

1018

What's the matter?
Can't a fellow... I was only...

1019
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:09,305
We were only looking for Monstro.

1020
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,557
That got 'em.

1021
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:26,239

Can you tell me where we
can find Monstro, the whale?

Gee! They're scared.

Uh, pardon me, pearl,

1028
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:55,184
are you acquainted
with Monstro, the whale?

Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

where to find Monstro?

01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:05,171
Father?

1046
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:10,968
- Father?
- Mr. Geppetto?

1047
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,636
Not a bite for days.

1048
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:02,478
GEPPETTO:
We can't hold out much longer.

1049
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,484
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

1050
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,778
Ah-choo!

1051
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,323
I never thought... (SNIFFS)

1052
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:18,286
...it would end this way, Figaro.

1053
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,955
Starving to death

1054
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:25,042
in the belly of a whale.

1055
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,130
My poor little Pinocchio.

1056
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,842
He was such a good boy.

1057
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,721
It's hopeless, Figaro.

1058
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,812
There isn't a fish left.

1059
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,732
If the monster doesn't wake up soon,

1060
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,194
I'm afraid we... we are done for.

1061
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:15,009
Here they come!

1062
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,638
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

1063
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:25,353
Food! We'll eat! Here's a big one.

1064
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,359
Keep them in there, Figaro.

1065
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:36,405
Wait! Wait a minute! Have you seen...

1066
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,994
Monstro!

1067
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,622
Ohh! We gotta get outta here.

1068
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,716
Woo-hoo-hoo! Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me!

1069
01:15:57,302 --> 01:16:00,096
Never saw so many!

1070
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:08,729
Whoops! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Here's another one.

1071
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,732
Enough for weeks!

1072
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:15,278
Here's a big one.

1073
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,995
Keep them in there, Figaro!

1074
01:16:57,404 --> 01:17:01,198
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.

1075
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:04,035
Looks like the last of them.

1076
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,666
Here's a big one. Only a few left.

1077
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:15,004
We gotta work fast.

1078
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,506
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

1079
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,884
Hey, Father!

1080
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:23,012
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.

1081
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:25,640
Pinocchio?

1082
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:30,645
- Father!
- Pinocchio, my son!

1083
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:34,857
- Hey, Father, here I am.
- Huh? Oh, oh, yes!

1084
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:39,654
Pinocchio, my boy!
I'm so happy to see you.

1085
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,864
Me too, Father.

1086
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,910
- Whoops.
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.

1087
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,913
PINOCCHIO: Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

1088
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,458
- You're here too.
- Yes!

1089
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,544
- We're all together again.
- Ah-choo.

1090
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,422
- Oh, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

1091
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:01,926
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.

1092
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:04,345
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.

1093
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:08,140
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.

1094
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:11,268
Let me take your hat. Oh!

1095
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,646
Pinocchio!

1096
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,024
Wha... What's the matter?

1097
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,776
Those ears!

1098
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,987
Huh? Ears? Oh, these!

1099
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:26,867
(CHUCKLE) Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too!

1100
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,786
Hee-haw!

1101
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,205
Pinocchio!

1102
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:34,875
What's happened to you?

1103
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,585
Well, I...

1104
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,881
- I, I...
- Oh, never mind now.

1105
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,384
Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.

1106
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,970
Nothing else matters!

1107
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,973
JIMINY: I gotta get in!
My pal's in there.

1108
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:51,559
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!

1109
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,936
- Hey! Cut it out.
- (SQUAWKING)

1110
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,526
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!

1111
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:03,487
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.

1112
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:08,659
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.

1113
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,871
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?

1114
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,665
We'll take the raft and when
the whale opens his mouth...

1115
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,126
No, no, no, no. Now, listen, son.

1116
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:21,005
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

1117
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:25,217
Then everything comes in,
nothing goes out.

1118
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,970
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

1119
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:31,557
Come, we make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

1120
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,309
A fire! That's it!

1121
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:35,686
Yes! And then we'll all eat again.

1122
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:40,149
- A great big fire! Lots of smoke.
- Smoke? Oh, yes, sure.

1123
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:43,569
- Smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.

1124
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:46,155
Pinocchio, not the chair.

1125
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,867
- Hurry, Father, more wood!
- What'll we sit on?

1126
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:53,913
We won't need it. We're getting out!

1127
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,207
Getting out? But how?

1128
01:19:56,333 --> 01:20:01,712
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze? Oh!

1129
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:05,174
GEPPETTO: That will make him mad!

1130
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,685

1131
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,400
Ah...

1132
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,569
Ah... Ah...

1133
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:29,824
Well, it's about time!

1134
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:36,205
- It won't work.
- Hurry, Father.

1135
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,207
Climb aboard.

1136
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,210
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!

1137
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:45,214
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!

1138
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:48,217
Hang on. Here we go!

Gesundheit.

01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,274
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it. Faster, faster.

01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,237

01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:26,839
Look! Now he is mad!

1147
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,847
I told you he'd be furious!

1148
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,151
- He's gone.
- Where'd he go?

1149
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,945
Look out!

1150
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,447

He's trying to kill us! Paddle, son!

Oh, Father!

Swim for shore.

Hang on, Father.

Yes, yes you are. Now lie down.
