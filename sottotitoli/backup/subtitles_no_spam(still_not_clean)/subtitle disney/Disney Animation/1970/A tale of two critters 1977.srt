00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,765
PREVIOUSLY ON "KODIAK"...

2
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,232
GET DOWN, GET DOWN,
GET DOWN!

3
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,765
THE SEASON IS COMING TO AN END.

4
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,326
THIS BEAR
IS TWICE AS AGGRESSIVE.

5
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,002
THESE BEARS EAT RED MEAT,
AND WE'RE RED MEAT.

6
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,130
AND THE FAMILIES ON THE ISLAND

7
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,632
HAVE BEEN PUSHED
TO THEIR LIMITS.

8
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:38,832
I'M SORRY.

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,471
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
EVER IN MY LIFE

10
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:41,726
I'VE HAD TO SIT DOWN
WITH MY DAD.

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,302
I NEARLY
GOT KILLED TODAY.

12
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:45,030
SURE YOU STILL
WANT TO DO THIS?

13
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,802
THE HOLLAND BOYS GET
THEIR FIRST TASTE OF GUIDING.

14
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:50,130
He should be right on the edge
of that forest.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,832
You got him now.

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,132
BUT AS THE SEASON WINDS
DOWN, THE PRESSURE RAMPS UP.

17
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,732
LATER, KYLE.

18
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,473
EITHER YOU **** GET
IT WRAPPED AROUND THAT MOTOR,

19
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,496
OR WE'RE GONNA RIP
THAT WHOLE **** DEAL OFF.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,799
YEAH, I DON'T GIVE A ****
IF YOU GOT TO CHEW A TREE DOWN

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,199
WITH YOUR **** TEETH
TOMORROW.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,999
YOU NEED TO GET
SOME ****DAMN WOOD IN HERE.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,330
YOU'RE SURE
YOU WANT TO DO IT?

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,433
'CAUSE ONCE YOU TAKE A LIFE,
YOU TAKE A LIFE.

25
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,970
DO I WANT TO BECOME A GUIDE?

26
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,696
SOMETIMES I THINK YES,
AND OTHER TIMES, NO.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,330
MY GOD!

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,999
THERE'S A **** WHALE
RIGHT THERE.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,099
That bear saw us.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,299
Get down, get down, get down!

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,130
OH! I'M JAMMED.

34
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,496
PUDDLES ARE FREEZING.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,665
IT'S COLD.

36
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,065
ICE ON THE BEACH THIS MORNING.

37
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,365
WE GOT TO START
WINTERIZING THIS PLACE.

38
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,696
WINTER IS COMING
TO KODIAK ISLAND, ALASKA.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,530
BEAR SEASON IS OVER,

40
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,573
AND ALL OF THE HUNTERS
HAVE LEFT THE CAMP.

41
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,596
FROZEN SOLID.

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,868
THE WEATHER COULD GET BAD.

43
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:20,165
IT COULD FREEZE UP IN HERE,

44
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,926
AND I MIGHT NOT SEE THIS PLACE
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

45
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,773
BOB MAY AND HIS CREW HAVE
ONLY DAYS TO PREPARE THEIR LODGE

46
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:29,426
BEFORE THE ENTIRE ISLAND
IS ENTOMBED IN SNOW AND ICE.

47
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,899
FROM THIS DAY ON,

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,830
WE'RE GONNA LOSE RUNNING WATER
TO THE BUILDING AND EVERYTHING.

49
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:40,565
THERE'S PLENTY OF RUNNING WATER,
YOU JUST GOT TO RUN AND GET IT.

50
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,496
AND WHAT'S WORSE,

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,999
THE ISLAND'S NAMESAKE,
KODIAK BROWN BEARS,

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,130
ARE STILL
ON THE HUNT FOR RED MEAT

53
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,465
AS THEY BULK UP FOR HIBERNATION.

54
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,526
TROY.
YEAH?

55
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,370
SEE WHAT THE BEAR DID?
OH **** YEAH.

56
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,026
YEAH,
HE DIDN'T QUITE GET IN,

57
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,903
BUT THEN
HE BROKE OUT THIS WINDOW,

58
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:00,530
TRIED TO GET IN THERE,
AND THEN DECIDED BETTER OF IT,

59
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:01,870
BUT WE GOT TO COVER IT UP.

60
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,696
SEASON'S COMING TO AN END,

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,230
AND TROY AND KYLE
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

62
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,770
THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT
TO BE GUIDES,

63
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,426
AND I'M STILL A LITTLE
ON THE FENCE,

64
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,703
BUT THEY'RE STRONGER TOGETHER
THAN THEY ARE APART.

65
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,365
WE GOT TO GET THIS PLACE
SHUT DOWN.

66
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,796
HOW MANY MORE WINDOWS
DO WE GOT TO DO?

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,999
A LOT.
WINTER'S HERE.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,199
GOT TO GET THIS DONE BEFORE
THERE'S THREE FEET OF SNOW.

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,299
BUT NEXT YEAR, HOPEFULLY,

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,599
I WON'T BE
AN APPRENTICE DOING IT.

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
THAT ONE'S IN.

72
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:28,199
GO HANDLE
YOUR **** COMPASS.

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,899
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
ALL RIGHT.

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,230
THANKS, BUD.
YEP.

75
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,302
I'M ABOUT TO BE A GUIDE -

76
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,130
ME AND KYLE, YOU KNOW,
SIDE BY SIDE.

77
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,670
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER.

78
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,796
I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,230
WE'RE AT THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

80
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,732
CUT THESE SLICES SO THIN
IT'S LIKE I'M MAKING PAPER.

81
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,902
I KNOW IF TROY AND I GET
OUR SHOT AS GUIDES,

82
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,968
WE ARE GONNA BE AS GOOD
AS BOB CUSACK, BOB MAY,

83
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,926
AND MY DAD, ERNIE,
TAUGHT US TO BE.

84
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,273
AND THEY'LL MAKE UP
THEIR MINDS

85
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,096
BEFORE WE CLOSE THIS CAMP
FOR THE WINTER.

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,030
WE BETTER HURRY.
THE TIDE'S FALLING.

87
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,932
IF WE CAN GET THIS THING TOWED
A LITTLE WAY, THAT'D BE GOOD.

88
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,103
COME ON, DOGS. OUT.

89
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,730
COME ON, ABBY.

90
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:03,432
I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF REAL CLOSE FRIENDS,

91
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,632
BUT THE FRIENDS I HAVE

92
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,065
LIKE ERNIE AND BOB,
I CHERISH THEM.

93
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,326
YEAH, LET'S TRY AND GET THIS UP
HERE JUST A LITTLE WAYS.

94
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,865
GET IT STARTED.

95
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,896
TO BE A BEAR GUIDE HERE
ON KODIAK,

96
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,930
YOU BETTER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

97
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,602
AND WE'RE ALL
PRETTY DAMN GOOD AT IT.

98
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:21,368
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOREVER.

99
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,796
YOU CAN'T FIND BETTER PEOPLE.
THEY'RE AWESOME.

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,999
IT'S LIKE HAVING FAMILY HERE
ALL THE TIME.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,399
PROBABLY WOULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE EASIER

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,630
IF WE TOOK THE MOTOR OFF,
BUT...

103
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,633
YEAH.

104
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,302
...WE'LL LET THEM YOUNGINS
DO THAT.

105
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:34,268
LISTEN, SO, HOW ARE KYLE
AND TROY DOING OUT THERE?

106
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,326
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

107
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,902
ARE THEY READY
TO BECOME GUIDES?

108
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,399
GOT A NEW YEAR COMING UP
NEXT YEAR.

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,970
I THINK
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.

110
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,196
YEAH.

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,530
I THINK THEY'RE PICKING UP
THINGS PRETTY FAST.

112
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,870
THINK THEY NEED
MORE EXPERIENCE.

113
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,796
IS THAT BECAUSE
THEY'RE YOUR KIDS?

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,130
PROBABLY.

115
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,973
KYLE AND TROY WERE KIDS,
ALL THEY WANTED TO DO

116
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,465
WAS BE LIKE DAD
AND BE A BEAR GUIDE.

117
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,426
<i>YEAH, SEE YOU LATER, TROY.</i>
<i>GOOD LUCK HUNTING.</i>

118
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,602
THE SCARIEST THING -

119
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,430
SCARIER THAN ANY BROWN BEAR
OR ANYTHING -

120
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,870
IS LOSING ONE OF MY KIDS.

121
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,196
EVERY TIME
YOU STEP INTO THESE WOODS,

122
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,299
THERE IS A PROBABILITY
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

123
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,499
THEY NEED TO...
BE TOUGHER.

124
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,199
WHY DON'T WE JUST SEND THEM OUT
WITH ROBERT,

125
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,268
HUNTING THAT DAMN ELK?

126
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,196
SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T HURT
FOR THEM

127
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,830
TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME

128
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,432
DOING SOME
OF THE NON-DANGEROUS GAME.

129
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,102
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT -
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

130
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,199
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
IT'S MORE EXPERIENCE.

131
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,899
I CAN SEE THAT ERNIE
LOVES HIS BOYS AND THAT

132
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,830
AND CONCERNED ABOUT THEM,
BUT JUST SEEMED

133
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,999
TO COME AROUND A LITTLE BIT,
YOU KNOW?

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,968
WELL, LET'S JUST PLAY
A LITTLE GAME HERE

135
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,426
AND HAVE ROBERT BE THE CLIENT
AND THEY'RE THE GUIDES,

136
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,965
AND THEN AT THE END
OF THE HUNT,

137
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,796
WE'LL HAVE ROBERT
ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,170
AS IF HE WAS A CLIENT.

139
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,926
I'D FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

140
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,532
LET'S FINISH GETTING
THIS THING UP

141
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,533
SO WE CAN HAVE A BEER.

142
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,865
SOUNDS GOOD.

143
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,426
CRANK AWAY.

144
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,965
COME HERE.

145
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,165
PUT THIS BAD BOY ON.

146
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,396
WE'RE GONNA SEE IF YOU CAN
PACK OUT SOME MEAT.

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,799
WE'LL MAKE SURE
YOU'RE WORTHY.

148
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,065
NEW PACK?

149
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:04,265
I'LL TEST THE STRUCTURAL
INTEGRITY OF THIS THING.

150
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,326
THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA LOAD IT UP
WITH SOME WOOD OR SOMETHING.

151
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,870
NO, ME,
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,496
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE
PACKING OUT.

153
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,999
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WEIGH?

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,265
180.

155
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:15,765
TROY AND I HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO TAKE ROB OUT

156
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:19,326
AND GUIDE HIM ON AN ELK HUNT,
AND I AM BEYOND EXCITED.

157
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,999
WE BECOME ONE.

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,130
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

159
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,265
OKAY, YOU READY?

160
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:27,396
YEAH, ARE YOU IN THERE?
I'M ALL ON THE PACK.

161
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,199
ALL RIGHT.
HOLD ON TIGHT.

162
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,968
MY FIRST DEAR HUNT,
I WAS PROBABLY 11 YEARS OLD.

163
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,526
BOB BROUGHT ROBERT OUT,
MY DAD BROUGHT ME OUT,

164
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,165
AND WE WERE KIDS
GOING OUT HUNTING,

165
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,196
NOT REALLY TAKING THINGS
THAT SERIOUS.

166
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,999
BUT, YOU KNOW, OUR DADS,
BOB AND ERNIE,

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,030
DEFINITELY PROBABLY KEPT
A WATCHFUL EYE ON US BACK THEN.

168
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,602
BUT NOW, WE CAN GO OUT
AND HUNT ON OUR OWN.

169
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:49,270
I GOTCHA.
YOU'RE IN THERE.

170
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:52,365
BEAR SEASON'S OVER NOW,
AND MY DAD,

171
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,396
HE ASKED ME TO GO ELK HUNTING
WITH KYLE AND TROY,

172
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,130
AND I'M GONNA PUT 'EM
TO THE TEST,

173
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,132
YOU KNOW, SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO
AND WHAT THEY CAN'T DO.

174
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,399
OKAY, SET ME DOWN.

175
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,199
YEP.

176
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,530
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

177
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,673
YEAH,
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD.

178
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,699
JUST HOPE
EVERYTHING GOES ALL RIGHT

179
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,399
AND WE MAKE IT BACK SAFE.

180
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,570
BOYS HAVE BEEN WORKING
PRETTY HARD AROUND CAMP, YOU KNOW?

181
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,226
AND I DON'T THINK
I HAVE A BETTER WAY

182
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,870
TO TEST THE METTLE OF THESE BOYS
OTHER THAN SENDING THEM OUT

183
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,065
ON AN ELK HUNT WITH ROBERT,
AND BESIDES THAT,

184
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,996
WE CAN GET SOME MEAT
IN THE FREEZER, YOU KNOW?

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,665
GRAB ME SIX ROUNDS,
KYLE.

186
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,426
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO PROVE OURSELVES

187
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,903
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HANG
IN THIS BUSINESS.

188
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,268
I'M A LITTLE BIT EXCITED,
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

189
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,565
I'M READY FOR THE CHALLENGE.
I'M READY TO STEP UP.

190
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,868
HEY, MOM. HOW ARE YOU?

191
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,565
BEFORE HEADING OUT
ON THIS ELK HUNT,

192
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,096
I DECIDED TO CHECK IN
WITH MY MOM

193
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,630
ON THE EMERGENCY
SATELLITE PHONE.

194
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,799
YEAH, WHAT DID THEY SAY?

195
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,199
STARTING WHEN?

196
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,668
SHE TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF ME,

197
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,326
BEEN E-MAILING ME FOR THE LAST
- I DON'T KNOW - FEW WEEKS,

198
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,432
AND WONDERING IF I HAD FALLEN
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

199
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,432
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY CONTACT.

200
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:19,732
AND I GUESS I HAVE
A JOB OFFER COACHING SOCCER.

201
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,899
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE WORKED FOR
ALMOST MY WHOLE LIFE

202
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,630
PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY,
IN SOCCER,

203
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,202
KIND OF CULMINATING
IN THIS ONE OPPORTUNITY.

204
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,330
BUT I ENJOY BEING OUT HERE
SO MUCH

205
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,532
WITH MY DAD AND MY BROTHER
THAT I...

206
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,032
MAN.

207
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,665
IT'S...

208
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,826
WELL, MY DAD AND MY BROTHER
WOULD BE PRETTY HEARTBROKEN

209
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,670
IF I WERE TO TAKE OFF,
AND, YEAH,

210
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:46,826
I'M REALLY CONFLICTED
IN WHAT TO DO.

211
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,903
AND I NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

212
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,465
AH.

213
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,496
WAITING ON KYLE.

214
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,499
I KNOW THAT THERE'S,
WHAT, ABOUT TWO OR THREE BEAR

215
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,999
THAT ALWAYS HUNT
THAT HERD UP THERE,

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,999
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE OUT
ON STEEP CAPE.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,099
YEAH.
SO...

218
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,399
THEY'RE GOING UP TO A PLACE

219
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,230
WHERE THE BEARS
FOLLOW THE ELK HERD,

220
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,732
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE EATING,

221
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,070
AND SO IT CAN BE
DANGEROUS BEAR-WISE,

222
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,965
BE DANGEROUS WEATHER-WISE -
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

223
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,326
THAT CAN HAPPEN
THAT ARE BAD MOSTLY.

224
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,765
YOU MADE IT.

225
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,326
WE ALMOST LEFT WITHOUT YOU.

226
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,932
WITH THIS ELK HUNT,
I JUST AM HOPING FOR THE BEST.

227
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,599
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

228
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,970
WE'LL BE BACK.

229
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,265
KYLE, TROY, AND ROB
ARE TRAVELING

230
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:35,896
15 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE LODGE
TO UPPER MALINA LAKE.

231
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,330
HERE, THE REMOTE FERTILE VALLEYS

232
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,999
SUPPORT LARGE HERDS
OF ROOSEVELT ELK.

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,899
FINE WEATHER.

234
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,365
LIQUID SUNSHINE.

235
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,926
THE GROUP WILL BE CUT OFF

236
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,932
FROM ALL UTILITIES
AND COMMUNICATION

237
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,165
UNTIL THE PLANE RETURNS.

238
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,496
WHOO-HOO!

239
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,070
WE'RE GOING ELK HUNTING!

240
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,665
THEY'LL HAVE
TWO FULL DAYS TO HUNT AN ELK.

241
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,996
WELL, LET THE HUNT BEGIN.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,830
BUT WHERE THE ELK RUN,

243
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,165
THE KODIAK BROWN BEARS
LIE IN WAIT.

244
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,996
THIS SPOT IS AWESOME.

245
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,268
WELL, THERE'S DEFINITELY
ALWAYS A DANGER OF BEAR.

246
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,796
BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN
SETTING UP CAMP,

247
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,768
THEY KNOW YOU'RE THERE -
THEY'RE SMELLING YOU.

248
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,096
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A BEAR
HAS BEEN DIGGING IN HERE?

249
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,430
YEAH.
REALLY?

250
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,903
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
HE JUST KIND OF SWEPT OUT

251
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,230
ALL THE CONES
AND THEN JUST

252
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,132
DUG HIMSELF OUT
A NICE, LITTLE BED IN HERE.

253
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,202
SLEEPING
OUT IN THE WOODS WITH TROY,

254
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,499
WHEN WE'RE IN BEAR COUNTRY,

255
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,468
WE KEEP OUR .500 PISTOLS
JUST RIGHT ABOVE OUR PILLOWS

256
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:36,965
JUST IN CASE WE NEED TO REACH UP
AND SQUEEZE OFF A SHOT,

257
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,126
BUT A BEAR CAN BE ON TOP OF YOU

258
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,432
BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE TIME
TO BLINK YOUR EYES.

259
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,332
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
IN THE MORNING.

260
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,703
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

261
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,070
WE'RE GONNA HIKE
TO THE TOP OF THAT RIDGE

262
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:55,365
AND LOOK IN THE VALLEYS
FOR THOSE BIG HERDS OF ELK.

263
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,826
YOU'RE THE GUIDES.
YOU TELL ME.

264
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,503
I'M KIND OF LIKE THE
CLIENT, AND THEY'RE GONNA BE GUIDES.

265
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,170
THERE'S NO TIME FOR ERROR.

266
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:06,396
AND THESE BOYS
BETTER PROVE THEMSELVES TO ME,

267
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,670
OTHERWISE I'LL GIVE THEM
A BAD REPORT.

268
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:08,965
HURRY UP, TROY.

269
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,626
WE GOT TO STAY WITH ROB.

270
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:14,003
ELK UP HERE IN KODIAK,
THEY'RE ROOSEVELT ELK,

271
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,165
AND THEY MOVE SO QUICKLY.

272
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,026
THEY CAN BE
IN THESE DRAINAGES FORAGING,

273
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,232
AND THEN THEY CAN BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A RIDGELINE

274
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,999
IN PROBABLY ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,868
SO HUNTING THEM UP HERE
IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT.

276
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,126
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR BEARS.

277
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,926
THE IDEA IS .500-GRAIN BULLET

278
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:42,332
WITH A SOLID COPPER
POINT HOLLOW TIP,

279
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,665
WILL STOP A BEAR, HOPEFULLY.

280
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,766
DOESN'T ALWAYS TURN OUT
THAT WAY.

281
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,333
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S RIGHT, LET'S GO.

282
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,902
THE ROLE OF A GUIDE
IS TO TAKE CARE OF THE CLIENT.

283
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,570
YOU KNOW, SAFETY'S NUMBER ONE.

284
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,496
TRACKING DOWN THE ANIMAL,

285
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,968
GETTING OUR CLIENT
INTO POSITION,

286
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,826
AND MAKING SURE
HE LEAVES HAPPY -

287
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,803
ALL OF THOSE THINGS
ARE KYLE AND MY PROBLEM.

288
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,730
SEE ANYTHING MOVING?

289
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,065
NO, NOTHING.

290
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,096
WE SHOULD MOVE ON.

291
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,626
LOOK AT THAT!

292
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,632
WHAT IS THAT?

293
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,102
THAT WAS A BIG BUCK.

294
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,100
A BIG BUCK WOULD BE NICE,
BUT WE CAME HERE FOR SOME ELK.

295
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,565
WHICH WAY SHOULD WE GO?

296
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:53,165
We need to look
for a game trail.

297
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,396
Makes the hiking way easier.

298
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,470
WITH KODIAK, IT ALWAYS MAKES YOU
WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT.

299
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:09,026
**** DAMN IT.

300
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,100
Holy ****

301
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,396
Holy ****

302
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,830
RIGHT THERE -
THE ONE SINGLE.

303
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,773
YEP.
I GOT EYES ON IT.

304
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,499
COME ON, STOP.
IT'S A TOUGH SHOT, MAN.

305
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,830
YOU'RE GOING UPHILL
AT 300-PLUS.

306
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,365
OH, FORWARD COW.

307
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,796
FORWARD COW.

308
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,230
YOU GOT HIM, MAN.
YOU **** GOT HIM.

309
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,565
THAT'S A HIT.

310
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,526
THERE SHE GOES.

311
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,603
ROB'S AN ANIMAL, MAN.

312
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,330
HE TOOK A SHOT, GOT IT DOWN,

313
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,632
BUT I THINK HE GOT
THE BIGGEST ELK OF THE HERD.

314
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,573
WE'VE GOT ELK MEAT.

315
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,226
OHO-HO-HO!

316
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,232
THAT THING IS HUGE!

317
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,299
HOLY ****

318
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,299
**** HEY!

319
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,330
- HUH?
- GOOD SHOT, MAN.

320
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,632
NICE.

321
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,099
YOU SAY YOUR THANKS?

322
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,165
NOT YET.

323
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,666
- NO?
- LET'S DO IT.

324
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,026
THANKS FOR THE EXPERIENCE.

325
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,632
THANKS FOR GIVING LIFE
TO CREATE LIFE.

326
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,003
WE APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'LL FEED MANY MOUTHS.

327
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,365
THANK YOU.

328
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,665
GOOD HUNTIN'.

329
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,296
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DIG INTO THIS,

330
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,299
GET IT SKINNED OUT,
GET THE MEAT OFF OF IT.

331
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,970
WE NEED TO GET ON THE BALL
AND GET THIS THING

332
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,465
IN OUR PACKS AND ON THE ROAD,

333
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:36,926
SO OUR GUIDE SKILLS ARE
REALLY GONNA BE PUT TO THE TEST.

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,170
SUN'S GOING DOWN. WE'RE LOSING
DAYLIGHT BY THE MINUTE.

335
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,096
WE STILL GOT A LOT
OF GROUND TO COVER.

336
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,199
THERE'S BEARS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

337
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,599
THERE'S BEARS
THAT FOLLOW THESE HERDS

338
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,100
THAT HUNT THEM YEAR 'ROUND,
AND WE GOT TO GET GOING FAST.

339
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,596
YOU GOT AN EYE
UP THE HILL?

340
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,830
YEAH.

341
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,065
WIND'S STARTING TO PICK UP.

342
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,926
HOW LONG HAVE BEEN HERE
ON THIS?

343
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,665
I DON'T KNOW.

344
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,626
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF BLOOD
IN THE AIR.

345
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,132
SCENT OF THIS GUT PILE

346
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:15,132
HAS PROBABLY TRAVELED
QUITE A DISTANCE.

347
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,070
ONCE BEARS COME ON A CARCASS

348
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,126
AND THEY ESTABLISH
THAT'S THEIR MEAT,

349
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,432
IT'S OVER THEIR DEAD BODY
IS BASICALLY THE ONLY WAY

350
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,832
THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THERE.

351
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,365
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

352
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:26,565
YOU HEAR A STICK, BRANCH SMACK,

353
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,365
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE CHECKING THAT OUT.

354
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,826
YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT DID THAT.

355
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,726
BOB SAID THAT WE NEED
TO BEAR-PROOF THIS PLACE.

356
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,073
SO IF YOU WANT
TO GRAB SOME WOOD,

357
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,865
I'LL GRAB THE DRILLS
AND SOME SCREWS,

358
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,265
AND THEN
WE CAN WORK ON IT.

359
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,665
YEP.
GOOD?

360
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,065
IT'S THE END
OF THE HUNTING SEASON,

361
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,696
SO THERE ARE A LOT
OF CHORES THAT NEED TO GET DONE.

362
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,199
AND ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS

363
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,968
WITH LEAVING THE HUNTING CAMP
EMPTY FOR THE SEASON

364
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,496
IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD,
AND YOU NEED TO BEAR-PROOF IT,

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,899
MAKE SURE THE ANIMALS
AREN'T GETTING INTO IT.

366
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,699
THERE YOU GO.

367
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,030
SO, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
IS GET THESE SCREWED IN,

368
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,732
AND THEN WHEN THE SCREWS STICK
OUT THE OTHER SIDE,

369
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,802
AND THEN WE FLIP IT OVER,
AND IT'LL BE A LITTLE WARNING

370
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:24,399
TO ANY BEARS
THAT TRY TO GET IN THE CABIN.

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,268
I THINK
I'VE REALIZED THAT I NEED

372
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:28,465
TO MAKE ALASKA
A BIGGER PART OF MY LIFE,

373
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:32,465
AND I THINK THAT MAY MEAN
LEAVING MY FARM,

374
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,565
LEAVING SAN DIEGO,
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

375
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,326
HOW I CAN
SPEND MORE TIME UP HERE.

376
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,073
I MEAN, I REALLY DON'T EVEN
WANT TO LEAVE.

377
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,799
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

378
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,365
I CAN'T GIVE UP ALASKA.

379
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:46,526
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME HERE
EVERY YEAR OF MY LIFE,

380
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,173
THAT IF I DON'T COME HERE,
I FEEL OUT OF BALANCE.

381
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:52,196
PERFECT FIT.

382
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:56,426
NICE. WE DID A GOOD JOB.
WAS THAT FUN?

383
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,373
OKAY. CAREFUL.

384
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,232
FALSE ALARM.

385
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,602
THOUGHT I HAD A BEAR.

386
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:19,500
WE GOT TO GET THIS **** DONE
AND GET GOING QUICK.

387
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,465
THERE YOU ARE.

388
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,196
HOLY ****

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,730
THAT WEIGHS A LOT.

390
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,532
SIT IT
SO THAT SIDE'S UP.

391
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,270
THIS IS GONNA FEED
BOTH OF OUR FAMILIES

392
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,596
PROBABLY
THE WHOLE WINTER,

393
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,699
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS
WELL INTO THE SPRING.

394
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,965
EACH TIME WE LOAD SOME
MEAT INTO ONE OF THOSE GAME BAGS

395
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,465
AND LIFT IT UP THE HILL
AND SET IT DOWN,

396
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,796
ALL I'M THINKING IS,

397
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,099
"HOLY ****
THAT IS A HEAVY BAG."

398
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,430
AND JUST LIFTING IT LIKE THAT
AND DROPPING IT DOWN,

399
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,570
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S GONNA FEEL LIKE

400
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,826
WHEN YOU GET IT
LOADED UP ON YOUR BACK.

401
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,065
NOW WE HAVE THE ARDUOUS PROCESS
OF FIGURING OUT

402
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,165
HOW THREE OF US ARE GONNA
PACK OUT AN ANIMAL

403
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,365
THAT'S FAR TOO LARGE

404
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,096
FOR THE THREE OF US TO PACK OUT
IN ONE TRIP.

405
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,399
WE HAD 10 GAME BAGS,

406
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,299
AND I'M JUST LOOKING
AT THIS LIKE,

407
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,168
"**** THAT'S A LOT OF MEAT."

408
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,926
I'M NOT TOO STOKED ON THIS PACK.

409
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,732
THIS PACK'S GONNA BE A ****

410
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,370
THERE AIN'T NOTHING ELSE
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

411
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,865
SO, ROBERT SHOOTS
AN 800-POUND ANIMAL.

412
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:33,426
THAT'S ABOUT
600 POUNDS PACKED OUT.

413
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,132
THERE'S THREE OF US.

414
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,003
THERE'S GONNA BE 200 POUNDS
OF ANIMAL ON MY BACK.

415
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,330
OKAY.

416
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,999
I WEIGH ABOUT 155.

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,130
TROY WEIGHS LESS THAN I DO.

418
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,399
AND HE'S A STRONG KID,
BUT WE'RE NOT ANTS.

419
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,599
HE'S UP.

420
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE WOBBLY.

421
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,730
HE'S GOOD TO GO.

422
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,099
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
ALL RIGHT.

423
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,965
THERE'S NOT TRAINING SYSTEM
IN THE WORLD

424
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,926
THAT IS GONNA PREPARE YOU
FOR DOING A HAUL LIKE THIS.

425
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,803
AW ****

426
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,965
AAH! ****

427
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,296
TRY AND STAY ON YOUR FEET
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

428
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,299
DUDE, THIS THING'S WOBBLING
ALL OVER THE **** PLACE.

429
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,499
****

430
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,230
WE REEK LIKE ELK MEAT.

431
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,602
YOU'RE COVERED IN BLOOD.

432
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:31,999
AND IF WE DO RUN INTO A BEAR,

433
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,999
IT'S MINE AND KYLE'S JOB
TO PROTECT ROB.

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,299
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE HUNTER.

435
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,599
IF WE GOT TO TAKE A BEAR DOWN,
WE GOT TO TAKE ONE DOWN.

436
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,630
DAMN, THIS IS THE MOST
UNCOMFORTABLE **** PACK.

437
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,270
WHOA. THIS SUCKS.

438
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,232
WE'RE PACKING OUT THIS MEAT.

439
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:07,165
IT IS JUST
THE MOST GRUELING THING

440
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,426
THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.

441
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,532
THIS IS PART
OF THE GUIDING BUSINESS.

442
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,899
BUT THIS IS PAINFUL,
AND THIS SUCKS.

443
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,899
****

444
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,599
****

445
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,130
YOU ALL RIGHT?

446
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,133
YEAH.

447
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,870
I WAS JUST
COMING DOWN THAT HILL,

448
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,826
SLIPPED, LOST MY FOOTING,
TURNED MY ANKLE OVER.

449
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,503
IT'S THE SAME ANKLE
I HAD SURGERY ON.

450
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,900
I NEED TO
SIT DOWN AGAIN.

451
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,399
WHEW,
I'M **** CRAMPING UP.

452
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,196
TELL YOU WHAT, MAN,

453
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,030
THOSE HILLS
ARE PUSHING ME TO MY MAX.

454
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,230
OH, MY.

455
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,465
****

456
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:54,926
OHH!

457
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:57,732
GUYS, WE ARE NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT AT THIS PACE.

458
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,732
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT,

459
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,670
AND IF WE GET STUCK OUT HERE
IN THE DARK, WE'RE SCREWED.

460
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,126
LET'S LEAVE
HALF THE MEAT UP HERE.

461
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,802
HAVE TO COME BACK FOR IT
IN THE MORNING.

462
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,699
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK IS BEST, ALL RIGHT.

463
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,630
IF WE LOSE HALF THE MEAT,

464
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,932
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN LOSING OUR LIVES.

465
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,302
THE SAFER THING TO DO IS THROW
HALF THIS MEAT UP IN THE TREES.

466
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,868
THAT WAY, IF WE DO
RUN INTO SOMETHING,

467
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,526
WE'RE NOT OVERWEIGHTED
WITH SO MUCH WEIGHT.

468
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,699
BLACK BEARS CAN CLIMB TREES,

469
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,630
BUT KODIAK BROWN BEAR,
THEY'RE JUST TOO DAMN BIG.

470
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:28,903
THEY CAN'T GET UP THOSE TREES.

471
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,899
YOU GOT THAT?

472
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,830
YEAH, JUST TIE IT OFF
RIGHT THERE.

473
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:47,165
LET'S KEEP EYES OUT
FOR BEARS.

474
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,996
WHAT WAS THAT?

475
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:09,165
LET'S KEEP EYES OUT
FOR BEARS.

476
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,696
WHAT WAS THAT?

477
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,230
IT'S NOTHING.

478
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,233
YOU GOT THAT?

479
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:19,102
YEAH, JUST TIE IT OFF
RIGHT THERE.

480
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:20,399
COME BACK IN THE MORNING

481
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,030
AND THERE'S A BEAR
UNDERNEATH THE TREE,

482
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,699
IT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION.

483
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,030
YOU KNOW, THAT'S HIS TERRITORY,
THAT'S HIS MEAT,

484
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,170
HE'S DETERMINED THAT,

485
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:30,065
AND HE'S GONNA DIE
TRYING TO PROTECT IT.

486
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,326
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

487
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,632
HOPEFULLY, THAT MEAT'S
STILL THERE IN THE MORNING.

488
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,402
WORKED TOO **** HARD

489
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:37,970
TO GET IT THAT FAR
TO LOSE IT.

490
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:56,832
IT'S TWO MORE RAVINES.
COME ON. JUST KEEP MOVING.

491
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,302
THE DROPPING
TEMPERATURES OF LATE FALL

492
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,730
TRIGGER A SURVIVAL INSTINCT
IN KODIAK BROWN BEARS

493
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,873
THAT MAKES THEM RAVENOUS
FOR RED MEAT.

494
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:06,265
THEY HUNT BOTH DAY AND NIGHT

495
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,626
TO FATTEN THEMSELVES
FOR HIBERNATION.

496
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,032
WHEN A KODIAK BROWN BEAR
SMELLS BLOOD IN THE AIR,

497
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,103
THEY'RE COMING FOR IT.

498
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,630
THEY SMELL FRESH KILL,
THEY WANT IT.

499
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,730
I'LL FEEL BETTER
ONCE WE GET BACK INTO CAMP.

500
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:28,465
OH! LAST HURRAH.

501
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,626
WE MADE IT, BOYS.

502
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:32,770
YES, WE DID.

503
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,065
HEY, TROY,
WILL YOU HELP ME HANG THIS MEAT?

504
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,696
THEN WE GOT TO
START A FIRE.

505
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,399
YOU KNOW, WE'RE PRETTY HAPPY
TO GET BACK INTO CAMP

506
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,899
WITHOUT ANY BEAR INCIDENTS,

507
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,068
BUT WE STILL HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

508
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,996
YOU CAN'T
LEAVE THAT MEAT SITTING DOWN.

509
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,268
ROBERT'S
GONNA HOP UP IN THE TREE

510
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,796
AND THEN START HEAVING THOSE
120-PLUS-POUND HIND QUARTERS

511
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,599
30 YARDS UP JUST TO MAKE SURE

512
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,170
THAT THE BEARS
AREN'T GETTING INTO IT.

513
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,403
WITH ALL OF THAT MEAT
UP IN THE TREE,

514
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:58,665
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH BEAR BAIT.

515
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,565
THERE'S EVERY SINGLE WORRY
GOING THROUGH MY HEAD.

516
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,665
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

517
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,796
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.

518
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,932
IS THAT THE LAST ONE?

519
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,232
YEP, THAT'S IT.

520
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:12,399
CALL IT GOOD.

521
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,365
I'M **** EXHAUSTED.

522
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:21,265
YOU'RE A DIFFICULT
FIRST CLIENT -

523
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:25,526
TRYING TO REIN YOU IN
AND KEEP YOU CORRALLED,

524
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:26,899
SO TO SPEAK.

525
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,030
I LOVE DOING THIS
ALMOST AS MUCH

526
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:33,365
OR IF NOT MORE
THAN COACHING SOCCER.

527
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,396
BEFORE NOW,
I WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY EXCITED

528
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,830
AND JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY,

529
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,032
AND RIGHT NOW I'M JUST HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

530
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:41,132
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT TROY.

531
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:45,599
I KNOW THAT HE WOULD RELY ON
HAVING ME OUT HERE TO HELP HIM,

532
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,965
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO,

533
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,626
AND I'M REALLY TORN UP INSIDE.

534
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,132
BUT RIGHT NOW
ALL I'M THINKING IS,

535
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,732
"WE'RE GONNA BE GOING OUT AGAIN
IN THE MORNING

536
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,670
TO GO AND GET THAT SECOND LOAD."

537
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:03,096
SO I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
MY HEAD'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

538
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,068
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE CHANCES ARE

539
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,196
THAT WE'RE GONNA COME ACROSS
A BEAR SITTING ON THAT MEAT?

540
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,130
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD
CHANCE.

541
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,996
ABBY, WANT TO GO DUCK HUNTING?

542
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,168
WANT TO GO DUCK HUNTING?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

543
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,065
WITH ALL THE CLIENTS
GONE, BOB, ERNIE, AND CUSACK

544
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,365
HAVE TIME TO GET IN
ONE LAST HUNT

545
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,296
BEFORE WINTER SHUTS THEM DOWN.

546
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,630
THIS TIME OF YEAR,

547
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,970
IT'S TIME TO PUT SOME MEAT
IN THE FREEZER.

548
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,396
THE BOYS ARE OUT HUNTING,

549
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,368
SO GO OUT WITH ERNIE AND CUSACK
AND SHOOT A FEW DUCKS.

550
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,396
KIND OF LIKE OLD TIMES,
YOU KNOW?

551
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,226
THAT'S A DOGGONE FINE DECOY

552
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,232
THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW,
MISTER.

553
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:58,473
NOW WE JUST GOT TO WAIT
FOR THE DUCKS.

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,099
- HERE'S A DUCK.
- HERE WE GO.

555
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,699
ALL RIGHT, BOB.

556
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,965
WONDER HOW THE BOYS
ARE DOING.

557
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,196
TROY AND KYLE,
THEY'VE GOT THE BEST MENTORS

558
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,030
THAT YOU COULD EVER HAVE
IN GUIDING -

559
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,265
BOB MAY AND BOB CUSACK.

560
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,396
HERE THEY ARE COMING IN.

561
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:27,796
YOU CAN'T MEET
A MORE INTERESTING PERSON

562
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,830
THAN BOB CUSACK.

563
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,232
HIS GUIDE'S LICENSE
IS NUMBER 72, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

564
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:37,402
I MEAN, HE WAS THE 72nd GUIDE
LICENSED IN THE STATE OF ALASKA.

565
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:39,770
WHAT, THIS GUY
DID 45 YEARS UP HERE.

566
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:43,726
HERE WE GO.
SOMETHING COMING UP.

567
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:48,465
BOBBY MAY HAS MENTORED ME
IN THE GUIDE BUSINESS.

568
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,996
I APPRENTICED UNDER HIM
FOR THREE YEARS HERE IN KODIAK,

569
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,468
AND THEN I STAYED
FOR ANOTHER 10.

570
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,565
AND TO THE LADIES.

571
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,465
THAT'S NOT ALL RIGHT
TO SAY THAT.

572
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,965
COOKED
THIS WONDERFUL MEAL.

573
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,896
I HAVE TO REALLY GIVE HIM CREDIT

574
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,330
FOR A LOT OF THE SKILLS
THAT I HAVE NOW IN THE WOODS

575
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,970
AND THE SKILLS THAT I HAVE,
YOU KNOW, BROWN BEAR HUNTING.

576
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,070
WELL, I HEAR A DUCK.
I HEAR A DUCK.

577
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:08,965
HERE'S A DUCK.

578
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,126
TAKE HIM.

579
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,465
TOUGH SHOT.

580
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:20,165
I GOT MY GUIDE'S LICENSE
UNDER BOB.

581
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,496
KYLE AND TROY ARE GOING THROUGH
THAT SAME APPRENTICESHIP.

582
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,470
AS LONG AS YOU GOT ENOUGH DUCKS
TO EAT, I'LL BE HAPPY.

583
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:31,265
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ROBERT'S
GONNA SAY ABOUT IT.

584
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,966
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE.

585
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:47,065
KYLE, TROY, AND ROB
ARE TRAVERSING

586
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,496
THE THREE MILES BACK
TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY LEFT

587
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,968
300 POUNDS OF ELK MEAT
HANGING IN A TREE.

588
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:55,496
THEY MUST GET THE MEAT AND
HURRY TO THE RENDEZVOUS POINT

589
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,730
WITHIN TWO HOURS,

590
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,703
OR RISK MISSING THEIR PLANE
BACK TO THE LODGE.

591
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,799
JUST GOT TO KEEP MOVING.

592
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,299
FOR THE PAST EIGHT HOURS,

593
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,468
THE SCENT OF THE HANGING MEAT

594
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:07,626
COULD'VE DRAWN IN
EVERY BROWN BEAR

595
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:09,932
WHO HAS BEEN STALKING
THE ELK HERDS IN THIS AREA.

596
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:13,270
WE GOT A BIG TASK - WE GOT TO
GO BACK OUT IN THE FIELD,

597
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:16,126
POTENTIALLY CHASE OFF A BEAR
FROM THE PRIZED MEAT

598
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,373
THAT WE JUST WORKED SO HARD
GETTING.

599
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:38,273
SCARY.

600
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:47,665
ARE THOSE THEM -

601
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,065
THESE TWO JUST RIGHT ABOVE
THE HORIZON?

602
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:52,396
YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

603
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,630
THAT MEAT'S BEEN UP IN THAT TREE
ALL NIGHT.

604
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:57,270
PLENTY OF TIME FOR A BEAR
TO COME AND THINK IT'S HIS.

605
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:58,565
WE MAKE IT BACK TO THE MEAT.

606
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:00,126
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S A BEAR THERE,

607
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,899
SO WE GOT TO APPROACH IT
REALLY CALMLY.

608
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,370
YOU KNOW, THERE COULD BE
A SLEEPING BEAR

609
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,496
UNDERNEATH THE TREE.

610
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,032
GUYS, LET'S MAKE A BUNCH
OF NOISE AS WE GET CLOSER.

611
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,033
WE DON'T WANT TO SNEAK UP
ON A BEAR.

612
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,465
HEY! HEY!

613
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,626
HEY, BEAR!

614
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:25,332
HEY! HEY!

615
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,299
COO!

616
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,499
NICE. THERE'S THE MEAT.

617
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,530
IT'S STILL HANGING.

618
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:31,173
NO **** BEARS
GOT INTO IT.

619
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:35,065
DROP YOUR PACKS,
TRY TO GET UP THERE.

620
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,265
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING UP TO GET IT.

621
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,496
COVER MY ASS.

622
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,670
WATCH OUT FOR BEARS.

623
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,200
HURRY UP, TROY.

624
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,730
THERE YOU GO.

625
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,099
THOSE BEARS CAN BE ULTRA-SILENT.
THEY'LL SIT THERE.

626
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,530
THEY COULD AMBUSH YOU
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO.

627
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,630
GOOD TOSS.

628
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,596
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
LET'S GO.

629
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,430
LET'S DO IT.

630
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,365
LET'S ROLL.

631
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,902
IT'S NOT HEALTHY
TO BE OUT IN THE FIELD

632
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:43,399
WITH BAIT ON YOUR BACK
IN BEAR COUNTRY.

633
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,030
THEY CAN SEE US,
AND WE CAN'T SEE THEM,

634
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,803
SO THEY HAVE EVERY ADVANTAGE.

635
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,626
THAT PLANE
HAS A SMALL WINDOW TO GET US,

636
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,303
SO WE GOT TO HAUL ASS.

637
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,030
I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED
ABOUT GETTING LEFT ON THIS ISLAND.

638
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,232
WE'RE BASICALLY
AT THE PILOT'S MERCY.

639
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,473
WE'RE NOT CELEBRATING YET.

640
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,596
SOMETIMES -
I KNOW THOSE FLOAT PILOTS -

641
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,830
THEY DON'T LIKE LANDING
IN WHITE-CAPPED WATERS,

642
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,203
AND THERE'S SOME CAPS
THAT ARE CAPPING OUT THERE.

643
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:29,132
CAN YOU HEAR IT?

644
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,632
THERE'S THE PLANE.

645
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,865
YEAH, HERE HE COMES.
THAT'S HIM.

646
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:35,296
LET'S GO, BIG BOY.

647
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:40,826
FEELS GREAT, YOU KNOW?
FINALLY, THE HUNT IS A SUCCESS.

648
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,703
AND THE FACT THAT ME AND KYLE
MADE IT TOGETHER -

649
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:43,865
I'M THRILLED.

650
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:47,426
I'M PUMPED.
I'M EXHAUSTED, BUT I'M PUMPED.

651
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:51,332
FINALLY. IT'S HERE.

652
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,899
OH, MAN, THAT'S A SWEET SIGHT
RIGHT THERE.

653
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,465
OH, BOY,
AM I GONNA BE HAPPY

654
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,465
WHEN WE GET ALL THIS
BACK TO CAMP.

655
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:13,065
I KNOW OUR DADS
ARE GONNA BE REALLY PROUD OF US

656
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,326
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO
GET THIS ELK OUT SUCCESSFULLY -

657
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,632
NO INJURIES, NO MISHAPS.

658
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:18,803
NOW I NEED TO MAKE A DECISION

659
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:22,165
WHETHER I'M GONNA TAKE
THE JOB COACHING OR STAY

660
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,926
AND DO THE GUIDING BUSINESS
WITH MY BROTHER.

661
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,400
HERE THEY COME.

662
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,996
YEAH.
YOU DID.

663
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,399
HEY, BUD.
WHAT'S UP, DAD?

664
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,199
HOW'S IT GOING?
IT'S GOING GOOD.

665
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,099
HOW'D IT GO, ROBERT?
GOOD.

666
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,130
DID YOU GET ANYTHING?

667
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,603
GOT A COW, YEAH.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

668
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,965
OH, MAN. AWESOME!
THERE YOU GO.

669
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:50,826
KYLE AND TROY ARE BACK,
AND THEY HAD A GREAT HUNT,

670
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,370
BUT I'M MOST HAPPY
TO SEE THEM WALK OFF THE PLANE

671
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:54,566
AND BE SAFE AND SOUND.

672
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,299
WELL, GOOD JOB.

673
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,170
ALL RIGHT,
I'M PROUD OF YOU GUYS. GOOD JOB.

674
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,596
GOOD JOB, ROBERT.

675
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,268
I HOPE BECAUSE
OF THE SUCCESS WITH THE HUNT

676
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,326
THAT THE BOBS AND MY DAD,
YOU KNOW, SEE THIS AND THEY SAY,

677
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,902
"HO, DAMN. THOSE GUYS
CAN HOLD THEIR OWN, YOU KNOW?

678
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:13,330
I'D HIRE THOSE GUYS ANY DAY."

679
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,030
WELL, THE ELK HUNT
WENT PRETTY GOOD.

680
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,932
KYLE AND TROY ARE BACK,
AND THEY HAD A GREAT HUNT.

681
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,003
NOW WE GOT TO SEE
WHAT ROBERT HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.

682
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,499
SO, HOW'D THE BOYS DO?

683
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,230
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT.
THEY DID GOOD, YOU KNOW?

684
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:39,673
I THINK TROY'S GONNA BE
A HELL OF A GUIDE SOMEDAY.

685
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:40,926
COOL.

686
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,332
KYLE - HE SEEMED LIKE HE HAD
A LOT ON HIS MIND,

687
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:47,032
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE DID WELL IN MY OPINION.

688
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:50,332
WELL, THANKS
FOR TAKING THEM HUNTING.

689
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,199
YEP.

690
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,630
THAT'S MY REPORT TO YOU
GENTLEMEN.

691
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,033
YOU GUYS
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

692
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,130
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

693
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,299
WELL,
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

694
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,368
WHETHER OR NOT TO GIVE
BOTH MY BOYS THE GREEN LIGHT

695
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,066
IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE HARDEST
THINGS I'VE EVER DONE.

696
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,296
WELL, WE GOT TO WORK
ON THE BOAT HERE.

697
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,830
HAD SOME FUEL PROBLEMS.

698
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,732
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

699
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:27,632
THERE AIN'T NO FUEL IN THIS.

700
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,630
HOPE THE FUEL LINES
AREN'T FROZEN.

701
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:36,832
LIVING HERE ON KODIAK,
YOU GOT TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT.

702
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,932
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
YOUR OWN SET OF SKILLS

703
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:41,732
AND BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEM.

704
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:44,199
RUNNING.
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

705
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,168
YOU'RE A MECHANIC ONE DAY,
FIXING MOTORS.

706
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,065
THEN THE NEXT DAY,
YOU'RE BUILDING A CABIN,

707
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,165
INSULATING IT, PUTTING UP WALLS.

708
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,265
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE
TO FLY AN AIRPLANE.

709
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:56,265
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO SET UP
A SHELTER WITH NOTHING.

710
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,726
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX A GUN,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE.

711
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:00,673
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO CATCH FISH,

712
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:02,896
YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE.

713
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,330
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

714
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,703
YOU BETTER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON KODIAK,

715
00:36:07,704 --> 00:36:10,100
OR YOU'RE GONNA BECOME A VICTIM.

716
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,999
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE IN HERE.

717
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,468
I'VE BEEN ON THE FENCE

718
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,826
ABOUT WHETHER
I'M GONNA TAKE THE JOB COACHING

719
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,873
OR BECOME A GUIDE,
AND I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

720
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:33,996
I HAVE A JOB OFFER
TO GO COACH SOCCER.

721
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,270
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING

722
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:38,365
A REALLY LONG TIME TOWARDS,
AND I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

723
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:43,126
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I NEED TO
DO AND I WANT TO DO AND...

724
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:46,270
AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T
WANT TO LET YOU DOWN, YOU KNOW,

725
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,096
'CAUSE I KNOW DAD WANTS US
TO GUIDE TOGETHER AND...

726
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,465
YEAH. SORRY TO KIND OF JUMP YOU
WITH THIS NEWS, BUT...

727
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,296
SO, WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

728
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,999
UH, SOON ACTUALLY.

729
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,499
SOON? HOW SOON?

730
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,570
TOMORROW.

731
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,165
TOMORROW?

732
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,196
THAT'S A SURPRISE.

733
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,365
IT'S A MIXED BAG.

734
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:11,596
KYLE -
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR HIM.

735
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,299
BUT NOW I GOT TO DEAL
WITH TROY OUT THERE BY HIMSELF.

736
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,865
HE'S CAPABLE, HE'S READY TO GO,
BUT IT'S TOUGH FOR ME.

737
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:23,826
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH IT,
BUT BOB AND I MAKE THE DECISION,

738
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,799
AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

739
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:52,132
YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF
MAKING A SELFISH DECISION

740
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:57,165
TO HEAD OFF TO GO COACH
AND PURSUE MY DREAM, BUT...

741
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:01,296
IT'S THE JOB OF A LIFETIME,
AND I HAVE TO GO TAKE IT.

742
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,870
ALL RIGHT, PUT THAT DOWN
AND GIVE ME A HUG.

743
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,426
HE'S GONNA LEAVE?

744
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,932
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
YEP.

745
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:10,265
IT'S BEEN AWESOME.

746
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:11,726
TAKE CARE.
OKAY.

747
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,265
TROY.
LATER, BROTHER.

748
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,065
BE SAFE, ALL RIGHT?
I WILL.

749
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,026
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SUPPORT HIM.

750
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,332
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

751
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,432
BUT I HOPE
IT DOESN'T AFFECT, YOU KNOW,

752
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,002
MY CHANCES OF BECOMING A GUIDE.

753
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:23,530
MAN, THANKS, BOB.
ALL RIGHT.

754
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:25,765
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

755
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:27,096
THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A LOT.

756
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,830
OH, I GOT TO GO.

757
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,732
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE CARE.

758
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,003
SEE YOU, KYLE.

759
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,899
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

760
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:16,065
LET ME SHOW YOU GENTLEMEN
HOW US KODIAK BOYS LIGHT A FIRE.

761
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,066
OKAY.

762
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:18,066
WHAT'S THAT?

763
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,196
DON'T MISS.

764
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,730
OH ****
BE CAREFUL, BOB.

765
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,332
WHOO!

766
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,503
HEY, THERE WE GO! YEAH!
HO! HEY!

767
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:25,999

768
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,930
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

769
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,299
WHOO!
LAST NIGHT FIRE, BABY.

770
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,830
WELL, TROY, MY BOY,
EVERYBODY LISTEN UP HERE.

771
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,665
EVERYBODY LISTEN UP.

772
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,326
PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY CHEST HAIR.

773
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,799
WE GOT A LITTLE CEREMONY
TO DO HERE.

774
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,570
BEEN DOING PRETTY GOOD GUIDING,
BEEN DOING YOUR CHORES,

775
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,796

776
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,530
WE DECIDED IT'S TIME

777
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:51,765
THAT YOU BE ACCEPTED INTO
THE BROTHERHOOD OF GUIDES.

778
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:52,796
ALL RIGHT.

779
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,730
YOUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY

780
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,732
IS TO A CLEAN KILL
OF THAT ANIMAL.

781
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,799
RESPECT THE LAND.

782
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,430
RESPECT THE HUNT.

783
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,202
NEVER FORGET
THE RESPONSIBILITY

784
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:06,330

785
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,970

00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:09,796
AND THIS
IS SO YOU DON'T FORGET.

787
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,799
I WON'T FORGET THAT.

788
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,268
NOW YOU GOT TO WEAR
THIS SILLY ****DAMN HAT

789
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:18,465
THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

790
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,932
AW. I DID NOT THINK
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

791
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,570
GOOD JOB, MAN.
THANKS, BOB.

792
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:24,726
YOU BEEN DOING GOOD.

793
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:27,199
AWW!

794
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
THANKS, DAD.

795
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,399
YOU'RE WELCOME, BUD.
LOVE YOU.

I GOT MY GUIDE HAT.

00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,926
PRETTY PROUD OF THIS.

798
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,132
THANK YOU, BOB.

799
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,273
WE'LL TURN YOU LOOSE
ON A FEW BEARS HERE.

800
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:39,896
I HOPE.

801
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,868
YOU KNOW, KYLE'S NOT HERE,
AND IT'S TOUGH.

802
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,496
BUT HE DID THE RIGHT THING,
AND IT'S JUST GREAT TO SEE TROY,

803
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,868
YOU KNOW, GROW INTO A MAN
AND GET HIS DUE.

804
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:49,665
RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MISS YOU BOYS.

805
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,565
YEAH, BUBBA!

806
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:52,826
KIND OF HATE TO SEE IT END.

807
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,132
WE'VE ALL HAD A DAMN GOOD TIME,

808
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:57,899
BUT THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS,
YOU KNOW?

809
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,768
I'M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS
BROUGHT US OUT HERE,

810
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:01,896
SHOW US THE ROPES.

811
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,430
EASY DOES IT NOW.

812
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:05,402
YOU KNOW, ANYMORE,
IT'S HARD TO FIND YOUNG GUYS

813
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,130
THAT REALLY WANT TO
GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY

814
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,303
AND BE ASSISTANT GUIDES.

815
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,465
IT'S NOT EASY.

816
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,396
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET RICH AT IT.

817
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,730
AS HARD AS IT IS,
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE A BROTHERHOOD.

818
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,565
THANKS.
OKAY.

819
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,596
THANKS.
THANKS, BOB.

820
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,099
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW?

821
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,999
SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN LIFE,

822
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,730
THINGS GO SMOOTH.

823
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,899
I MEAN, WITHOUT ERNIE, BOB,
AND THE BOYS, I'M NOTHING.

824
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,799
YOU CAN'T REPLACE PEOPLE
LIKE THAT.

825
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,730
YOU KNOW, I'M WAITING
FOR THE NEXT BEAR SEASON NOW.

826
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,503
MAKES ME WANT TO JUST GET OUT
THERE AND KICK ASS.
