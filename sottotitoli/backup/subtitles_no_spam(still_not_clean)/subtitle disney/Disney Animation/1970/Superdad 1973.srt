00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,331
She's just a young girl.
She's having fun.

178
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,833
We should have sent her
to Europe this summer.

179
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,636
Anything to get her
away from Bart

180
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,938
and that crazy bunch
she runs around with.

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,240
She's been running around
with that bunch all her life.

182
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,912
Yeah, and where
are they goin'? Nowhere!

183
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,181
Not one of them has a job

184
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,379
except maybe
that nitwit Stanley,

185
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,852
and the only reason he does

186
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,951
is so he can cart the rest
of them around.

187
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,293
Not one of them has an idea
what to do with his life.

188
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,988
Charlie,
you have a short memory.

189
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,960
Neither did you
when you were their age.

190
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,889
They'll get along.
You'll see.

191
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,364
I will, huh?
Well, let me tell you --

192
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,933
one of these days,

193
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,131
Wendy's gonna start thinking
about getting married.

194
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,695
And when she does,

195
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,843
I hope she has more
to choose from

196
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,268
than that bunch
of birdbrains.

197
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,984
Charlie,
stop shaking that at me.

198
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,407
[ Tires screeching,
distant laughter ]

199
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,960
Hey! Hi, Mr. mccready!

200
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,958
Hi, Mr. mccready.

201
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,702
Hi, Mr. mccready.

202
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,444
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

203
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,067
Hey, did anyone call?

204
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,213
Who would call?
You're<i> with</i> all of them.

205
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,839
Did you kids have a good time
at the beach?

206
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,845
It was great,
really great.
We had a great
time at the beach.

207
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,278
Stanley,
what are you doing

208
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,253
with Mr. beezly's
ambulance?

209
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,151
Mr. and Mrs. beezly went
to the lake for a few days,

210
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,824
and while he's away,
he left me in charge.

211
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,094
That's your way
of taking care of it --

212
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,163
using the ambulance
to go to the beach.

213
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,461
What if there should be
a call for it?

214
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,964
I don't know.
We never had a call for it.

215
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,266
But if somebody did call,

216
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,227
they'd have to call
over to Collins.

217
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,736
They have all
the new equipment anyway.

218
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,169
It doesn't sound like you're
very loyal to Mr. beezly.

219
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,174
You have to think
of the public, too.

220
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,376
When that thing goes over 40,
it really shakes.

221
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,048
I'd hate to be
in the back of it

222
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,407
during a real emergency.

223
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,745
Man:
Car one, come in!
I see.

224
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,121
They're calling car one!
Is that this thing?

225
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,121
It has to be!
It's the only one we have!

226
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,964
Stanley!!

227
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,889
I said, come in car one!
Where are ya?!

228
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,895
Yes, sir.
This is Stanley.

229
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,157
Well, where are ya?

230
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,195
Well, I stopped to get
a bite to eat, sir.

231
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,871
Get in here quick!

232
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,070
Yes, sir.
I'm on my way, sir.

233
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,872
And make it quick!

234
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,039
Hey, gang,
I've got to go right now.

235
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,475
Is there an emergency?

236
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,010
You're darn right, there is.
Old man beezly's back.

237
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,916
This could be the end
of a beautiful relationship.

238
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,319
Look, Randy, please --

239
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,790
sweep the sand out of the back
of the ambulance.

240
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,120
The rest of you guys --
you get your things.

241
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,825
We've got to straighten up.
Come on, let's move.

242
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,158
Mr. mccready...

243
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,103
Thank you for your broom,
and I'll bring it back.

244
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,899
Some of you guys are gonna
have to go with Larry,

245
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,842
and I'm gonna drop Randy off.
You come with me.

246
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:29,108
Bye-bye.
See you later.
Bye-bye. See you later.

247
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,979
[ Engine turns over,

248
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:42,247
See ya! Bye!
Bye!
Bye!

249
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,955
That's the end of<i> that</i> job,
that's for sure.

250
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,089
I don't think Stanley
was too interested

251
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,134
in Mr. beezly's business
anyway.

252
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,260
But you do admit people should
be interested in something?

253
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,126
Oh, yeah. Sure.

254
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,165
Good. Tell me, Bart,
what are<i> you</i> interested in?

255
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,101
Well, a lot of things.

256
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,206
Like what?

257
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,008
You know -- music, movies,

258
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,479
the beach, football --
all kinds of stuff.

259
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,108
Is that all, Bart?

260
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:11,283
Oh, well, no, Mr. mccready.
Wendy, too.

261
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,354
[ Sighs ]

262
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,193
Why don't we all
go inside?

263
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,118
I think everyone should be
ready for something cold.

264
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,994
Yeah, sounds great.

265
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,427
Would you care
for some iced tea, Charlie?

266
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,374
No, I wouldn't care
for some iced tea.

267
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Darling,
if you want some coffee,

268
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,012
there's plenty in the kitchen.

269
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,411
Mm-hmm, that's nice.

270
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,012
Look!
There's that Dr. Skinner!

271
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,015
He wrote that book
I gave you last Christmas!

272
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,617
The one you never read.

273
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,989
The ball game will be on
in a couple of minutes.

274
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,588
Great.
I'm going shopping,

275

00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,634
you're such an interesting
person to be around.

Mm-hmm.

Man:<i> Dr. Skinner,</i>
<i> let's begin with you...</i>

281
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,345
What did you say?

00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,273
<i> What is the difference</i>
<i> between the teenager</i>

nothing. Nothing.

<i> loose generation</i>

<i> And the one</i>
<i> that preceded it?</i>

285
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,009
<i> Right off, I'd like to say</i>
<i> that in my opinion,</i>

286
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,915
<i> there's no difference</i>
<i> between the teenager today</i>

287

<i> and the teenager</i>
<i> 20 years ago.</i>

<i> In many ways,</i>
<i> they're</i> better.

289

You don't know
the teenagers<i> I</i> know.

291

<i> Yes, of course.</i>
<i> But who creates all that?</i>

292
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,096
<i> I think the parent.</i>

293
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,697
<i> I find that hard to believe.</i>

294
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,299
<i> Not when you analyze it,</i>
<i> Mr. Michaels --</i>

295
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,972
<i> you take the typical parent</i>
<i> of a teenage daughter.</i>

296
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,142
<i> Does he try</i>
<i> to involve himself</i>

<i> with his daughter</i>
<i> and her friends,</i>

298
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,084
<i> or does he just sit around</i>
<i> and criticize them?</i>

299
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,950
<i> Does he really care?</i>

300
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,419
<i> Parents, why don't you ask</i>
<i> yourself this question.</i>

301

<i> When was the last time</i>

<i> Have you ever gone</i>

<i> Have you joined your daughter</i>

305
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,070
<i> These are questions</i>
<i> we may all ask ourselves.</i>

<i> a part</i>
<i> of your teenager's life?</i>

308
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,982
<i> It's up to you to answer</i>
<i> that question honestly.</i>

I can explain it.

to figure out.
