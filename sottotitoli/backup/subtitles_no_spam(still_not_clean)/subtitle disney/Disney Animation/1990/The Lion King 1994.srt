I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

64
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,816
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

Oh, look, Zazu.

00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,889
You've made me lose my lunch.

67

You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

- Scar?
- Mm-hmm?

00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:46,041
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:53,279
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,379

00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,617

at the presentation of Simba.

Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

83
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,471
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

84
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,542
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

85
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:23,607
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,380
I shall practice my curtsy!

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,052
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

88
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,488
Oh, no, Mufasa.

89
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,390
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

(ROARS)

91
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,392

Temper, temper.

93
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:41,232
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

But when it comes to brute strength,

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,308
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

98
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,680
There's one in every family, sire.

99
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,317
Two in mine, actually,

100
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,519
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

101
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,587
What am I going to do with him?

102
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,424
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

Zazu!

104
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,098
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

105
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,260
you could take him out and beat him.

Wow.

124
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:11,584
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

125
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,610
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

126
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,147
and will rise with you as the new king.

127
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,923
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

128
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,862
Everything the light touches.

129
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,124
What about that shadowy place?

130
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,324
That's beyond our borders.

131
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,801
You must never go there, Simba.

132
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,965
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

133
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,408
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

134
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,810
- There's more?
-(LAUGHS) Simba...

135
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,986
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

136
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,012
As king, you need to
understand that balance

137
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,820
and respect all the creatures,

138
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,759
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

139
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,694
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

140
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,323
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

141
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,366
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

142
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,161
and the antelope eat the grass.

143
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:10,541
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

144
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,841
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

145
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,813
Checking in with the morning report.

146
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,906
Fire away.

147
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,678
Well! The buzz from the bees

148
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,651
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

149
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,812
Really?

150
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,213
What are you doing, son?

151
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,881
Pouncing.

152
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,256
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

153
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,327
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,297
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

155
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,356
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

156
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,128
Stay low to the ground.

157
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,532
Cheetahs never prosper...

158
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,663
(WHISPERING) Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

159
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,968
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

160
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,236
Very good. Pouncing.

161
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,744
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

162
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,578
This is so humiliating.

163
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,242
Try not to make a sound.

164
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,547
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

165
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,883
Mufasa? Simba?

166
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,317
(MUFASA LAUGHS)

167
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,988
That's very good.

168
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,925
- Zazu!
- Yes!

169
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,624
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

170
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,999
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

171
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,560
Zazu, take Simba home.

172
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,798
Aw, dad, can't I come?

173
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,964
No, son.

174
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,237
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

175
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,440
Oh, young master,
one day, you will be king.

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,383
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

177
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,476
from dawn until dusk.

178
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,961
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

179
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,124
I despise guessing games.

180
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,293
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

181
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,564
Oh, goody!

182
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,469
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

183
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,531
and I'm gonna rule it all!

184
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:52,102
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

185
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,477
Bad back, you know.

186
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,676
Hey, Uncle Scar.

187
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,151
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

188
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,483
A monkey's uncle.

189
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,355
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

190
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,656
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

191
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,753
Everything.

192
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,424
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

193
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,963
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

194
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,062
And he's absolutely right.

195
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,504
It's far too dangerous.

196
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,009
Only the bravest lions go there.

197
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,739
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

198
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,213
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

199
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,340
Why not?

200
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,852
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favorite nephew.

201
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

202
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,415
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

203
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,688
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

204
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,432
An elephant what? Whoa!

205
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,628
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

206
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,536
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

207
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,640
you being so clever and all.

208
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,439
Just do me one favor.

209
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:02,108
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

210
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,616
No problem.

211
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,311
There's a good lad.

212
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,150
You run along now and have fun.

213
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,712
And remember,

214
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,315
it's our little secret.

215
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,461
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

216
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,663
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

217
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,297
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

218
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,398
SARABI: And it's time for yours.

219
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,575
Mom!

220
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,512
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

221
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,375
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

222
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,782
So, where are we going?

223
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,378
It better not be anyplace dumb.

224
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,321
No, it's really cool.

225
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,916
So, where is this really cool place?

226
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,426
Oh.

227
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,157
- Uh, around the water hole.
- The water hole?

228
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,028
What's so great about the water hole?

229
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,261
I'll show you when we get there.

230
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,529
Oh.

231
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,434
Uh, mom, can I go with Simba?

232
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,771
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

233
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,864
Well...

234
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,405
BOTH: Please?

235
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,603
It's all right with me.

236
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,769
- Yeah!
- All right!

237
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,802
As long as Zazu goes with you.

238
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,712
No, not Zazu.

239
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,039
ZAZU: Step lively.

240
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,111
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

241
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,087
So, where are we really going?

242
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,589
An elephant graveyard.

243
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,681
Wow!

244
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,250
Shh! Zazu.

245
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,024
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

246
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,958
Oh, just look at you two.

247
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,161
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

248
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,465
Your parents will be thrilled,

249
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,938
what with your being betrothed and all.

250
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,030
Be-what?

251
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,837
Betrothed. Intended.

252
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,876
Affianced.

253
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,969
Meaning...

254
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,105
One day, you two are
going to be married.

255
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,173
- Yuck!
- Eww!

256
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,515
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

257
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,782
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

258
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,789
Sorry to bust your bubble,

259
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,518
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

260
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,051
It's a tradition going back generations.

261
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,689
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

262
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,598
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

263
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,102
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

264
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,730
Well, he's the future king.

265
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,205
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

266
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,775
Not yet, I don't.

267
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,299
And with an attitude like that,

268
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:15,178
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

269
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,841
Not the way I see it.

270
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,052
(SINGING) <i>I'm gonna be</i> a <i>mighty king</i>

271

<i>- No one sayin', "Do this"

<i>- No one sayin', "Stop that"

286
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,155

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,045

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,214

I beg your pardon, madam, but

311
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,196
get off!

312
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,860
Simba?

313
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,166
Nala!

315
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,970
All right! It worked!

316
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,531
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

317
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,673
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

318
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,940
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

319
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,970
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

320
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,280
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

321
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,054
(LAUGHING)

322
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,153
Pinned ya again.

323
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,875
This is it. We made it.

324
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,672
Whoa!

325
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,115
NALA: It's really creepy.

326
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,244
Yeah.

327
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,583
Isn't it great?

328
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,818
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

329
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,024
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

330
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,995
There's only one way to know.

331
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,861
Come on, let's go check it out.

332
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,630
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

333
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,966
Oh, man!

334
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,496
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

335
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,199
Look, banana beak is scared.

336
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,108
It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,

337
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,580
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

338
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,082
Danger? Ha!

339
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,210
I walk on the wild side.

340
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,548
I laugh in the face of danger.

341
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,118
Ha ha ha ha!

(CACKLING)

343
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,694
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

344
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,700
I don't know, Shenzi.

345
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,096
What do you think, Ed?

346
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,627
(CRAZY LAUGHTER)

347
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,136
Just what I was thinking.

348
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,234
A trio of trespassers!

349
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,540
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

350
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,478
A simple navigational error.

351
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,505
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

352
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,577
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

353
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,952
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

354
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,650
And that would make you...

355
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,022
The future king.

356
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,689
Do you know what we do to kings

00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,273
Is it really you?

882
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:19,507
- Who are you?
- It's me. Simba.

883
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,613
Simba?

884
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,419
Whoa! How did you...

885
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,624
- Wow!
- Where did you come from?

886
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,686
This is gr... It's great to see you!

887

- Hey, what's goin' on here?
- What are you doing here?

888

What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

889
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,335
Hey! What's goin' on here?

890
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,432
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

891
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:48,468
- Friend?
- Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

892
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,637
Huh?

893
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,047
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

894
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,812
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure is all mine.

895
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:59,016
How do you... Whoa, whoa!
Time out! Let me get this straight.

896
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,052
You know her, she knows you.

897
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,722
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's okay with this?

898
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,458
- Did I miss something?
- Relax, Timon.

899
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,490
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

900
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:15,072
And your mother, what will she think?

901
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,507
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

902
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,873
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

903
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,139
They do?

904
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,410
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

905
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,008
He did? What else did he tell you?

906
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,455
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.

907
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:39,826
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!

908
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,092
King?

909
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:45,261
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

910
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,270
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.

911
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:51,866
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

912
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,501
- No.
- Simba!

913
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,103
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

914
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,478
but that was a long time ago.

915
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:02,315
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

916
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:05,151
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

917
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,123
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

918
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:10,089
Hey, whatever she has to say,

919
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,323
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

920
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,091
Mm...

921
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,125
Maybe you'd better go.

922
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,397

927
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,317
It's like you're back from the dead.

this will mean to everyone.

929

What it means to me.

930
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,194
- Hey, it's okay.
- I've really missed you.

931
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,995
I've missed you, too.

932
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:55,165

This stinks.

Oh, sorry.

00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,236
Not you! Them!

935

come back to Pride Rock?

Well, I just needed to get out

And I did, and it's great.

We've really needed you at home.

- Yes, we do. You're the king.

I'm not the king. Scar is.

Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

There's no food, no water.

Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

- I can't go back.
- Why?

Simba...

995
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,772
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:57,371
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

- No. Just disappointed.

01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,048
Would you slow down?

1051
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,014
(RAFIKI LAUGHS)

1052
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,428
Stop!

1053
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,764
(WHISPERS) Look down there.

1054
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,925
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

1055
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,664
No.

1056
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,605
Look harder.

1057
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,179
You see?

1058
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,976
He lives in you.

1059
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,820
MUFASA: Simba.

1060
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,521
Father?

1061
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,201
Simba, you have forgotten me.

1062
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,400
No. How could I?

1063
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:56,241
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

1064
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,576
Look inside yourself, Simba.

1065
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:02,782
You are more than
what you have become.

1066
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,153
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1067
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:10,181
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

1068
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:14,161
Remember who you are.

1069
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:18,167
You are my son and the one true king.

1070
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,700
Remember who you are.

1071
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,641
No! Please, don't leave me!

1072
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:27,871
MUFASA: Remember.

1073
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:29,504
- Father!
- Remember!

1074
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,570
Don't leave me.

1075
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,582
Remember.

1076
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,219
What was that? Ha ha!

1077
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,989
The weather. (SPLUTTERS)

1078
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,760
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

1079
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,859
Looks like the winds are changing.

1080
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,461
Ahh, change is good.

1081
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,737
Yeah, but it's not easy.

1082
01:07:56,773 --> 01:08:01,802
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

1083
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,973
I've been running from it
for so long.

1084
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:08,249
Ow! Jeez! What was that for?

1085
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,185
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

1086
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,279
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1087
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,655
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

1088
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:19,322
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

1089
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:22,229
or learn from it.

1090
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,131
Ah! You see?
So what are you going to do?

1091
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,793
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1092
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,135
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1093
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:33,803
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

1094
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,813
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1095
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,277
(LAUGHS)

1096
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,747
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1097
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,846
Whoooo! Whoooo!

1098
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,593
(SNORES)

1099
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:54,858
Grubs! Grubs!

1100
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,361
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1101
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:09,801
It's okay! Whoa, whoa!
It's okay! It's me!

1102
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:13,339
Don't ever do that again.

1103
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,347
Carnivores! Oy!

1104
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:18,082
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

1105
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,783
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

1106
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,848
Ho ho! You won't find him here!

1107
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:26,255
Ha ha! The king has returned.

1108
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:29,559
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

1109
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,465
Gone back? What do you mean?

1110
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,569
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1111
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:37,073
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1112
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,164
- Who?
- Scar.

1113
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,107
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

1114
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,907
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

1115
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,574
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1116
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,946
BOTH: Oh.

1117
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,232
NALA: Simba, wait up!

1118
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:54,114
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

1119
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,115
What made you come back?

1120
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:59,079
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1121
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,449
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1122
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,226
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1123
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:07,360
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1124
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,463
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1125
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,994
Danger? Ha!
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!

1126
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,869
I see nothing funny about this.

1127
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,932
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1128
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,205
At your service, my liege.

1129
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:25,909
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?

1130
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,717
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1131
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,119
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1132
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:36,688
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1133
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:59,348
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1134
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,874
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1135
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:05,347
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1136
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:08,221
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1137
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,916
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1138
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,118
-(DRUMS)
- Luau!

1139
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,926
(SINGING) <i>If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat</i>

1140
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,728
<i>Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
because he is a treat</i>

1141
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,790
<i>Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine</i>

1142
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,860
<i>All you have to do is get in line</i>

1143
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,803
- <i>Are you achin'</i>
- Yep, yep, yep.

1144
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,739
- <i>For some bacon?</i>
- Yep, yep, yep.

1145
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,435
- <i>He's a big pig</i>
- Yep, yep.

1146
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,569
<i>You could be a big pig, too! Oi!</i>

1147
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,917
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1148
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,081
I'll look for Scar.

1149
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,121
(THUNDER)

1150
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:44,054
Sarabi!

1151
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,569
(THUNDER)

1152
01:12:58,708 --> 01:12:59,937
Yes, Scar?

1153
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:03,502
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1154
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,447
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1155
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,208
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1156
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:13,280
It's over. There is nothing left.

1157
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:17,259
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1158
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,785
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1159
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,059
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1160
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,431
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1161
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,937
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1162
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,598
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1163
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,538
(ROARS)

1164
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,011
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1165
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,713
(GROANS)

1166
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,947
Mufasa?

1167
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,350
No. It's me.

1168
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:54,120
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1169
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:57,997
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1170
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,432
Simba?

1171
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:04,065
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

1172
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,630
alive.

1173
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,804
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1174
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,837
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1175
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:15,317
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1176
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:18,651
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1177
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:21,157
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1178
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,193
However, there is one little problem.

1179
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,050
You see them?

1180
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,062
They think I'm king.

1181
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,898
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1182
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,904
The choice is yours, Scar.

1183
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,502
Either step down or fight.

1184
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,010
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1185
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:45,311
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1186
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:48,648
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1187
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,280
I've put it behind me.

1188
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,185
But what about your faithful subjects?

1189
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,246
Have they put it behind them?

1190
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,384
Simba, what is he talking about?

1191
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,726
Ah, so you haven't told them
your little secret.

1192
01:15:00,763 --> 01:15:04,199
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1193
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:08,431
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1194
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,669
I am.

1195
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,573
It's not true.

1196
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:22,350
Tell me it's not true.

1197
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:27,050
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1198
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:30,115
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1199
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,924
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1200
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,624
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1201
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:39,794
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1202
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,234
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1203
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,330
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1204
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,674
and now everyone knows why!

1205
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:50,871
Simba!

1206
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:59,286
Now, this looks familiar.

1207
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:01,056
Hmm.

1208
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:05,084
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.

1209
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,789
Oh, yes. I remember.

1210
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:12,028
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1211
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:17,635
And here's my little secret.

1212
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,203
(WHISPERING) I killed Mufasa.

1213
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:25,941
No! Murderer!

1214
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,208
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1215
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,983
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1216
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,480
All right.

1217
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,791
(GAGS) All right.

1218
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,318
