1
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,932
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

2
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,102
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,981
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,582
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,670
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,390
So, we meet again,

7
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,477
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

8
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,936
Not today, Zurg!

9
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,416
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you almost had him.

10
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,544
- I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
- Sure, you will, Rex.

11
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,087
In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.

12
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,756
But look at my little arms!

13
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,927
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

14
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,013
Where is it? Where is it?

15
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,973
Woody?

16
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,354
Hang on, cowboy!

17
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,444
- Woody, are you all right?
- Yeah.

18
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,281
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

19
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,658
Batteries need to be changed.

20
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,660
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

21
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,120
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar

22
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,164
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

23
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,916
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

24
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,210
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

25
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,796
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

26
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,130
and I can't find it anywhere!

27
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,216
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

28
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:46,054
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

29
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,807
- They're called s'mores, Buzz.
- Right. Right. Of course.

30
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,976
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

31
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,729
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

32
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,317
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

33
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,030
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

34
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,991
- I found it.
- You found my hat?

35
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,286
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

36
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,081
- Oh, my little sweet potato!
- Oh, you found it!

37
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,458
Oh, it's so nice

38
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,087
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

39
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,673
Oh, great. That's just great.

40
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,885
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

41
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,220
- Woody, look under your boot.
- Don't be silly.

42
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,765
- My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look?

43
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,935
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

44
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,979
And the boy who wrote that

45
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,441
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

46
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,193
I'm sorry, Bo.

47
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,071
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

48
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,324
It's my one time with just me and Andy.

49
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
You're cute when you care.

50
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,580
- Bo, not in front of Buzz.
- Let him look.

51
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,584
Miss Peep, your sheep!

52
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,880
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

53
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,423
<i>- and I'm sittin' on good deals.
- Whoa!</i>

54
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,176
! think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

55
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,305
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

56
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,724
<i>- Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
- Which one is off?</i>

57
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,935
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

58
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,061
So hurry on down...

59
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,604
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

60
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,442
- I despise that chicken.
- Fellas! Fellas!

61
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,695
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

62
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,364
What news?

63
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,699
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

64
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,370
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,164
- Where'd you find it?
- Well, that's the bad news.

66
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,334
Oh, it's Buster!

67
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,920
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!

68
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,506
Let's move, move, move!

69
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,175
Woody! Hide! Quick!

70
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,949
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

71
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,077
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

72
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,039
- Looks like a new record.
- Okay, boy. Sit.

73
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,583
Reach for the sky.

74
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,460
Gotchal!

75
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,588
Great job, boy.

76
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,091
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

77
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
Who's gonna miss me?

78
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,302
Who's gonna miss me?

79
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,971
Andy, you got all your stuff?

80
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,806
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

81
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,683
It's in my room.

82
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,688
Stick 'em up.

83
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,816
I guess we'll work on that later.

84
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,027
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

85
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,405
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

86
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,407
Five minutes.

87
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,910
Help, help! Somebody help me!

88
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,288
Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop!

89
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,497
Never!

90
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,334
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

91
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,880
Shark, or death by monkeys?

92
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,591
Choose!

93
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,926
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

94
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,345
What? That's not a choice!

95
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,556
To infinity and beyond!

96
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,478
- I'll save you, Miss Peep.
- My hero.

97
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,065
- Thanks, Buzz.
- No problem, buddy.

98
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,108
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

99
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,861
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

100
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,447
Oh, no.

101
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,159
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

102
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,746
- But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
- Oh, no.

103
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,541
- Maybe we can fix him on the way.
- No, just leave him.

104
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,421
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

105
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,436
- What happened?
- Woody's been shelved.

106
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,529
Andy!

107
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,384
- Woody?
- Woody? Honey, are you okay?

108
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,156
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

109
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,075
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

110
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,827
He's back early from cowboy camp!

111
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,454
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

112
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,999
Yeah!

113
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,838
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

114
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,300
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

115
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,721
I forgot. You're broken.

116
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,849
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

117
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,788
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

118
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,208
Andy. Andy.

119
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,794
Bye, Woody.

120
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,839
No! No! Andy!

121
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,939
Wheezy, is that you?

122
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,233
- Hey, Woody.
- What are you doing up here?

123
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,611
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

124
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,988
- Andy was so upset.
- Nah.

125
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,157
She just told him that
to calm him down

126
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,368
and then put me on the shelf.

127
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,621
- Why didn't you yell for help?
- Well, I tried squeakin'.

128
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,333
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

129
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,381
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

130
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,346
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

131
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,475
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

132
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,688
Yard sale? Yard sale!

133
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,858
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

134
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,986
- Yard sale?
- Sarge, emergency roll call!

135
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,071
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

136
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,367
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

137
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
- Hamm?
- Here.

138
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,911
- Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
- Here.

139
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,830
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

140
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,832
I hate yard sales!

141
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,542
Someone's coming!

142
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,382
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

143
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,401
Bye, Woody.

144
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,744
Wheezy! Think, think, WWoody.
Think, think, think.

145
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,249
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

146
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,170
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

147
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,173
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!

148
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,091
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

149
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,259
His arm ain't that bad.

150
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,762
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

151
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,514
Careful on the steps, now.

152
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,991
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

153
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,666
Not that casual.

154
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,130
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

155
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,674
- Is he out there?
- There he is.

156
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,645
He's getting in the box!

157
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,939
He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

158
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,649
Woody, you're worth more than that.

159
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,110
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

160
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,820
- It's Wheezy!
- Wheezy?

161
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,031
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

162
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,830
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

163
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,499
- Bless you, Woody.
- All right, now.

164
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,209
Back to Andy's room.

165
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,837
Way to go, cowboy.

166
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,674
- Golly bob howdy!
- Woody, I'm slipping!

167
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,058
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

168
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,603
- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!

169
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,522
<i>What's that little gal
think she's don'?</i>

170
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,400
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

171
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,111
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

172
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,530
There's a snake in my boot.

173
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,580
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

174
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,585
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

175
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,922
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!

176
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,718
Buster! Quiet down!

177
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,636
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Yes.

178
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,930
You can help take his paws off my pal.

179
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,600
I'll give you 50 cents
for all this junk.

180
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,269
- Oh, now, how did this get down here?
- Hand her the sheriff.

181
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,937
Nice and easy.

182
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,815
- $5.
- I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

183
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
Now just walk away.

184
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,903
- Wait.
- The other way.

185
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,780
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
- 50 bucks ain't bad.

186
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,408
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

187
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,161
- Or trade. You like my watch?
- Sorry.

188
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,873
- He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
- She showed him!

189
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,292
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

190
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,961
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

191
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,631
- Hold on.
- What's up?

192
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,424
What is it, Buzz?

193
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,511
What's happening?

194
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,595
What's he doing?

195
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,389
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

196
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,184
- He's stealin' Woody!
- What? He can't take Woody.

197
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,310
It's illegal.

198
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,103
- Where's he going?
- Do something.

199
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,480
Buzz!

200
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,900
Get him, Buzz.

201
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,195
Where's the red jacket?

202
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,315
Why would someone steal Woody?

203
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,024
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

204
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,526
At precisely 8:32-ish,

205
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,654
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

206
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,116
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

207
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,537
- He didn't have a beard like that.
- Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

208
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,332
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

209
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,877
- Oh, picky, picky, picky.
- Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

210
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,253
The kidnapper's vehicle.

211
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,130
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

212
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,424
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

213
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,550
Hey. Put a cork in it.

214
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,886
- How do you spell FBI?
- My crime scene!

215
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,096
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

216
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,849
- Didn't know there was a crime scene.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

217
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,477
A little quiet, please. Thank you.

218
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,024
Lazy toy brain.

219
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,237
- Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, Buzz?

220
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,282
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.

221
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,576
- Liz try bran.
- It's just a license plate.

222
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,411
- It's just a jumble of letters.
- Yeah, and there are about

223
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,582
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

224
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,251
Lou's thigh burn.

225
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,172
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

226
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,258
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

227
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,349
- Al's Toy Barn.
- Al's Toy Barn!

228
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,062
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

229
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,775
It's the chicken man!

230
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,068
That's our guy.

231
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,238
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

232
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,281
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

233
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,701
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

234
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,704
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

235
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,457
You, my little cowboy friend,

236
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,211
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

237
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,616
Andy!

238
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,540
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

239
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,667
All the way to work!

240
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,439
What? Whoal!

241
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,278
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

242
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,364
Stop it! Sit, I said!

243
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,867
Whoa! Whoa.

244
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,705
Yee-haw!

245
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,958
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

246
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,669
- It's really you!
- What's me?

247
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,049
There's a snake in my boot.

248
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,009
- It is you!
- Please stop saying that.

249
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,637
Prospector said someday you'd come.

250
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,597
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!

251
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,142
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet yal

252
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,194
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

253
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,240
- It... It's a box.
- He's mint in the box.

254
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,158
Never been opened.

255
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,162
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

256
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,168
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

257
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,003
Yee-haw!

258
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,296
It's you! It's you!

259
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,091
You're here! It's you!
It's you! It's you!

260
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,718
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.

261
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,681
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

262
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,268
- It's good to see you, Woody.
- Listen. I don't know...

263
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:37,189
- Hey, how do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

264
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:43,237
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

265
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,546
That's me.

266
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,529
Wow.

267
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,744
Holy cow.

268
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,126
Cowboy Crunchies,

269
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,837
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

270
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,255
proudly presents...

271
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,176
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

272
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,261
There's Jessie
the yodeling cowgirl

273
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,139
Look it! That's me!

274
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:56,602
- Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
- He's a smart one

275
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,354
Pete the old Prospector

276
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,813
Has anyone seen my pick?

277
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,275
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

278
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,611
He's the very best

279
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,905
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy

280
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,366
In the wild, wild west

281
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,119
Woody's Roundup

282
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,833
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

283
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,543
- Keep looking.
- You're going too slow.

284
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,379
Let me take the wheel.

285
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,339
It's too fast.

286
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,133
- How can you even tell what's on?
- I can tell.

287
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,970
Stop! Back, back, back!

288
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,014
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

289
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:38,227
- Back, back! Stop!
- And look for the giant chicken!

290
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,645
Now, Etch!

291
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,857
That's where I need to go.

292
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,402
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

293
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,779
Woody once risked his life to save me.

294
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:53,200
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

295
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,994
So who's with me?

296
00:24:55,077 --> 00:25:00,749
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

297
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,421
This is for Woody when you find him.

298
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,425
All right,

299
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,969
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

300
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:17,016
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

301
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,144
I'll do my best, son.

302
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,230
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

303
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,404
Geronimo!

304
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,825
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

305
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,244
I'd be feeling more prepared.

306
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,041
The idea is to let go.

307
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,252
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

308
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,630
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

309
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,508
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

310
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,147
They don't call this

311
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,316
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.

312
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,151
I reckon we oughta get outta here.

313
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,988
Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.

314
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,907
This sure is a fast-burnin" wick.

315
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,910
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

316
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,412
- Holy tarnation.
- I'll call for help.

317
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,376
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

318
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,921
Good job, Bullseye.

319
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,049
! reckon the new schoolhouse
Is finally done.

320
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,342
What's that?

321
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,385
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,

322
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,763
and Prospector just lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

323
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,849
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

324
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,435
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

325
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:51,401
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.

326
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,570
My biscuits are burnin'!

327
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,286
Will Woody
and Bullseye land to safety?

328
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,747
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

329
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,127
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."

330
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,629
All right! All right! Next tape!

331
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,590
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

332
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,468
- Come on! Let's see the next episode!
- That's it.

333
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,472
- What?
- The show was canceled after that.

334
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,600
Wait. What about the gold mine

335
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,185
and the cute little critters
and the dynamite?

336
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,063
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

337
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,566
Two words, Sput-nik.

338
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,529
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

339
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,116
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

340
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,869
- I mean, look at all this stuff!
- Didn't you know?

341
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,246
Why, you're valuable property!

342
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,416
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,168
I'm on a yo-yo.

344
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:54,590
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

345
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,262
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

346
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,557
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

347
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,935
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

348
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,521
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

349
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,275
I get it.

350
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,360
"There's a snake in my boot."

351
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,988
Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

352
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,577
A record player!

353
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,662
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

354
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,292
Okay, now. Slow.

355
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,629
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye.

356
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,256
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

357
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,093
Not bad.

358
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,929
It's time for Woody's Roundup

359
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,931
He's the very best

360
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,351
He's the rootin'-est
tootin-est cowboy...

361
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,646
Look at us! We're a complete set!

362
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,815
- Now it's on to the museum.
- Museum?

363
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,695
- What museum?
- THE museum.

364
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,616
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

365
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,910
- That's in Japan!
- Japan?

366
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,746
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

367
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,165
What do you mean?

368
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,919
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

369
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,089
- He still has an owner.
- Oh, my goodness.

370
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,425
No. Can't go.

371
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,053
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

372
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,847
- Jessie. Jessie.
- I won't go back in the dark!

373
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,391
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

374
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,352
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

375
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,895
waiting for you.

376
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,605
- Why me?
- The museum's

377
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,734
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

378
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,487
Without you, we go back into storage.

379
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,615
- It's that simple.
- It's not fair!

380
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,284
How can you do this to us?

381
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,995
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

382
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,206
- You see, I was in this yard sale...
- Yard sale?

383
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,667
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

384
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,670
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

385
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,340
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

386
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,219
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

387
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,055
- I mean...
- Sounds like he really loves you.

388
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,600
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

389
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,437
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

390
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,815
Al's coming!

391
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,067
Go! Go on, Jessie.

392
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,193
Jessie, look at me.

393
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,947
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

394
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,497
It's show time!

395
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,752
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

396
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,796
And now

397
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,506
the main attraction.

398
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,687
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

399
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,566
No. No, no, no, no!

400
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,361
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

401
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,073
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

402
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,574
- Hello?
- It's me. It's Al

403
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,825
I got an emergency.

404
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,619
- I'm busy.
- Yes, we're all busy.

405
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,538
Look. It has to be tonight.

406
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,874
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

407
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,709
It's gone!

408
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,086
I can't believe it!

409
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,838
- My arm is completely gone!
- All right. Come here. Let me see that.

410
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,840
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

411
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,050
easily repaired.

412
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,177
- You should consider yourself lucky.
- Lucky?

413
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,389
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

414
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,848
Big deal.

415
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,187
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

416
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,941
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

417
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,903
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

418
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,532
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

419
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,099
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

420
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,477
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.

421
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,770
- What?
- Nineteen?

422
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,356
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

423
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,524
Come on, fellas.

424
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,986
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

425
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,696
- No.
- No.

426
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,699
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

427
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,951
- Oh, you had to bring that up.
- No, he didn't!

428
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:38,540
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

429
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,459
Now let's move out!

430
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,217
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

431
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,765
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

432
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,309
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

433
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,979
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

434
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,107
Bullseye... All right. All right.

435
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,819
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

436
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,287
Over here. Attaboy.

437
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,831
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

438
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,598
Bullseye. Cut it out.

439
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,643
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

440
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,978
Stop it.

441
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,052
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

442
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,640
No, Officer! I swear. What?

443
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,068
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

444
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,945
Where is the remote?

445
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,948
Where is the remote?

446
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,412
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.

447
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,759
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

448
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,803
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

449
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,722
What? You think I did that?

450
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,224
Oh, right, right.
The TV just happened to turn on,

451
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,685
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

452
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,980
- You calling me a liar?
- Well, if the boot fits...

453
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,232
Say that again.

454
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,569
If the boot fits.

455
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay, cowboy.

456
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,456
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

457
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,459
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

458
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,212
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

459
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,384
I don't know
how that television turned on,

460
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,594
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

461
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,056
- If I had both my arms...
- The fact is, you don't, Woody,

462
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,475
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

463
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,853
- The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
- And then I'm outta here!

464
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,275
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

465
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,945
- It's just that Andy...
- Andy, Andy, Andy.

466
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,531
That's all he ever talks about.

467
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,126
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

468
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,088
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

469
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,133
Losing health units. Must rest.

470
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,968
Is everyone present and accounted for?

471
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,386
Not quite everyone.

472
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,555
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

473
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,938
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

474
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,983
- Not now, Hamm.
- Oh, I love riddles. Why?

475
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,737
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

476
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,740
The chicken!

477
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,913
- Oh, well. We tried.
- We'll have to cross.

478
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:29,998
What the...

479
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,875
You're not turning me
into @ mashed potato.

480
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:36,254
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

481
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,965
There must be a safe way.

482
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,555
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

483
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,484
Drop!

484
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,907
Go!

485
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,953
Drop! I said "drop"!

486
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,457
Go!

487
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,466
Drop.

488
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,934
Go.

489
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,710
That went well.

490
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,762
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

491
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,601
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

492
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,354
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

493
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,305
So, how long is this gonna take?

494
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,265
You can't rush art.

495
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,366
Oh, no. It's closed.

496
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,536
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

497
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,460
Hey, Joe, you're late.

498
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

499
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,005
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

500
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,174
All right. Let's go.

501
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,509
But the sign says it's closed.

502
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,391
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

503
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,082
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

504
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,961
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

505
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,464
- Woody?
- Woody.

506
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,367
There you go.

507
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,080
He's for display only.

508
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,624
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

509
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,919
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

510
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,401
Wow.

511
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,709
I could use one of those.

512
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,433
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

513
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,435
It's extortion. That's what it is.

514
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,688
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

515
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,108
I thought we could search in style.

516
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:35,071
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

517
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,542
Am I really that fat?

518
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,425
- What are you doing?
- You're in direct violation

519
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,761
of Code 6404 .5,

520
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,389
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

521
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,307
until awakened
by authorized personnel.

522
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,433
Oh, no.

523
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,854
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.

524
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,564
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

525
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,401
- I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

526
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,696
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

527
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,282
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

528
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,495
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.

529
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,039
Or should I say "traitor"?

530
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,959
- I don't have time for this.
- Halt!

531
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,878
I order you to halt!

532
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,886
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

533
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,016
- We've been down this aisle already.
- We've never been down this aisle.

534
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,185
- It's pink.
- Face it. We're lost.

535
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,353
Back it up. Back it up.

536
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,318
What a great party!

537
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,281
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

538
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,451
Excuse me, ladies.

539
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,621
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al of Al's Toy Barn?

540
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,080
I can help.

541
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

542
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,171
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

543
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,006
and no flash photography.

544
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,425
- Thank you.
- I'm a married spud.

545
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,262
- I'm a married spud.
- Then make room for the single fellas.

546
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,515
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1967,

547
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,060
the original series had 16 cars,
including the Corvette.

548
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,312
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

549
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,482
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

550
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,984
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

551
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,820
- Excuse me, sir.
- Get this outta here, geekosaur.

552
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,989
- Look out!
- Stop, stop, stop!

553
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,249
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

554
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,543
My source of power!

555
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:58,547
No! Come back! Hey!

556
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,134
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

557
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,346
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

558
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,890
Remain seated, please.

559
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,689
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.

560
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,483
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

561
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,111
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

562
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,948
Let me go! You don't realize
what you're doing!

563
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,909
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

564
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:32,123
In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

565
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,333
- Hey, Buzz!
- Halt! Who goes there?

566
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,919
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

567
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,630
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

568
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,717
- You do?
- Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

569
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,347
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

570
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,558
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, Buzz?

571
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,227
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

572
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,938
No!

573
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,659
It's like printing my own money.

574
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,245
Yeah? What?

575
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,541
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

576
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:20,254
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

577
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,299
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

578
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,136
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

579
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,515
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

580
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,642
Hi! Hello!

581
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,811
Great. Now you can go.

582
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,108
Well, what a good idea.

583
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,371
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

584
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,956
She's been through
more than you know.

585
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,334
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

586
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,379
It's the least you can do.

587
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,723
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

588
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,315
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

589
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:26,112
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

590
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,698
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

591
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,118
but I have to go back.

592
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,203
I'm still Andy's toy.

593
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,665
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

594
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,544
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

595
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,088
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

596
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:49,552
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

597
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,639
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

598
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,225
How did you know that?

599
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,270
Because Emily was just the same.

600
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,814
She was my whole world.

601
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,362
When somebody loved me

602
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,907
Everything was beautiful

603
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:15,578
Every hour we spent together

604
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,664
Lives within my heart

605
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,793
And when she was sad

606
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:26,547
! was there to dry her tears

607
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,927
And when she was happy, so was I

608
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:37,308
When she loved me

609
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,731
Through the Summer and the Fall

610
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:48,068
We had each other
That was all

611
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,238
Just she and I together

612
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:55,159
Like it was meant to be

613
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,371
And when she was lonely

614
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,791
! was there to comfort her

615
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,253
And I knew that

616
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:11,634
She loved me

617
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,936
So the years went by

618
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,605
I stayed the same

619
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,442
But she began to drift away

620
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:32,071
! was left alone

621
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,033
Still I waited for the day

622
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,244
When she'd say

623
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:45,209
! will always love you

624
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,839
Lonely and forgotten

625
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:54,510
I never thought she'd look my way

626
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,972
She smiled at me and held me

627
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:02,059
Just like she used to do

628
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,980
Like she loved me

629
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,900
When she loved me

630
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,989
When somebody loved me

631
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,076
Everything was beautiful

632
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,830
Every hour we spent together

633
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,667
Lives within my heart

634
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:33,674
When she loved me

635
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:51,442
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

636
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,071
But they forget you.

637
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,783
- Jessie, I didn't know.
- Just go.

638
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,142
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

639
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,063
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

640
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,819
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

641
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,531
It's your choice, Woody.

642
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,744
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

643
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:49,249
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

644
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,644
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

645
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,996
- Hey, Woody, are you in here?
- Nah. This one's empty too.

646
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,958
- Woody! Woody!
- Woody!

647
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,042
Pardon me, gentlemen,

648
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,545
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

649
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,964
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Hey! He was talkin' to me!

650
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,758
- No! He was talkin' to me!
- Why, you...

651
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,136
You see, all along,

652
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,847
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

653
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,935
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

654
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,895
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

655
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,483
- Someone's coming.
- Everyone, take cover.

656
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,986
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

657
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,530
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

658
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,656
- 011...
- 011. Wait.

659
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,658
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

660
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,410
- It's him.
- The chicken man.

661
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,203
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

662
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,539
That's the kidnapper, all right.

663
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:14,293
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

664
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,345
<i>And the piece de résistance!</i>

665
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,766
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

666
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,934
- It's Woody!
- Now that I have your attention,

667
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,271
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

668
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,817
- I'll pay anything you want.
- Yes! Yes!

669
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:42,029
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

670
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,739
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

671
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,617
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

672
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,162
Don't touch my moustache!

673
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,128
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

674
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,623
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

675
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:20,252
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

676
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,552
- He didn't take the bag!
- No time to lose!

677
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,813
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

678
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,066
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

679
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,029
- Buzz?
- To infinity and beyond!

680
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,619
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

681
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,872
I don't understand.

682
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,583
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

683
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,186
Blast. He's on level 23.

684
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,188
How are we gonna get up there?

685
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,149
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

686
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,735
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

687
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,321
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

688
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,658
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

689
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,742
What about me?

690
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,702
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

691
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,788
Troops! Over here.

692
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,420
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

693
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,297
Okay. Let's move!

694
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,219
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

695
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,263
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

696
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,724
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

697
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,937
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

698
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,064
- This way!
- What makes you so sure?

699
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,817
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

700
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,737
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

701
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,906
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

702
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,658
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

703
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,286
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

704
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:28,880
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

705
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,132
What?

706
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,011
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

707
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,221
They'll be expecting that.

708
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,362
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

709
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,322
Slow down!

710
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,952
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

711
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,204
That's in yen, right?

712
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,583
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

713
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,710
of people in a hurry, you know that?

714
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,755
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

715
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,966
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

716
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,969
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

717
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,558
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

718
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,810
That's custom-fitted

719
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,812
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

720
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,065
First class all the way!

721
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,693
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

722
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,570
I mean it. I really am!

723
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,323
- And why shouldn't you be?
- Yee-haw!

724
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,700
Swing your partner do-si-do

725
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:43,205
- Look at you, dancing cowboy!
- Look! I'm doin' the box step!

726
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:55,801
Hey, heads up down there!

727
00:59:55,884 --> 01:00:00,764
- Whoal! Pork bellies are fallin'.
- Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

728
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,600
Halfway there.

729
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,270
My arms can't hold on much longer!

730
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,777
Too heavy.

731
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,403
What was I thinking?

732
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,447
My antigravity servos!

733
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,327
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

734
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,787
- What?
- He wouldn't.

735
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,580
- One...
- He would.

736
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,957
Two...

737
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,292
Three!

738
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,299
To infinity and beyond!

739
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,346
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

740
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,773
Area secure.

741
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,733
It's okay, troops.

742
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:58,238
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

743
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:02,159
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

744
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,336
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

745
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,048
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

746
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,092
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

747
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:23,096
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

748
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,265
Sheriff Woody!

749
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:37,903
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

750
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,697
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

751
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,699
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

752
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,452
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

753
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,537
Help us! The barn's on fire!

754
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,873
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

755
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,292
Woody saves the day again!

756
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,543
Yee-haw!

757
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,587
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

758
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,215
I have to ride off into the sunset...

759
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,592
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

760
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,683
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

761
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,352
Oh, you are?

762
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,646
No, no, no.
Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

763
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,606
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

764
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,035
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

765
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,746
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

766
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,415
- Please, no!
- That's Woody!

767
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,876
This way!

768
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,798
Please, please, no!

769
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,384
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

770
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,263
- Take that!
- To the left.

771
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,722
No, your left.

772
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,016
- Take it up higher.
- What's happening?

773
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,520
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.

774
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,064
- What are we gonna do, Buzz?
- Use your head!

775
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,109
But I don't wanna use my head!

776
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,032
What's going on here?

777
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,326
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

778
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,494
Watch yourself!

779
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,288
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

780
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
You heard of kung fu?

781
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,375
Well, get ready for pork chop.

782
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,628
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

783
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,340
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

784
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,425
These are my friends!

785
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,678
- Yeah, we're his friends!
- No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

786
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,929
Hey, stop it!

787
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,890
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

788
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,477
- Grab Woody, and let's go!
- Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

789
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,813
- Quick! To the vent!
- They're stealing him.

790
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,064
No!

791
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,525
Hold it right there!

792
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,277
- Buzz?
- You again?

793
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,280
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- Buzz, what is going on?

794
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,950
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

795
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,410
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

796
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,162
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!

797
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,122
So, who's the real Buzz?

798
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,708
- I am!
- Don't let this impostor fool you!

799
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,420
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

800
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,011
Buzz!

801
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,721
I had a feelin' it was you.

802
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:13,141
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

803
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,019
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

804
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,189
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.

805
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,900
- You mean it's a...
- Yes.

806
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,069
- And he's a...
- Oh, yeah.

807
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,614
Your Majesty.

808
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,575
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

809
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,452
Al's selling you to a toy museum

810
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,412
- in Japan!
- I know.

811
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:37,582
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

812
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,084
- What?
- Are you crazy?

813
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,253
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

814
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:44,464
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

815
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:48,051
- What are you talking about?
- Woody's Roundup!

816
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,971
On, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

817
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,599
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

818
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:58,019
- This is weirdin' me out.
- Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

819
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,854
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

820
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,980
You should have seen it.

821
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:04,317
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

822
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,278
- "Was"?
- Stop this nonsense and let's go.

823
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:08,780
Nah, Buzz.

824
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,119
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

825
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,746
They need me to get into this museum.

826
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,417
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

827
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,337
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

828
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,881
You are a toy!

829
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,552
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

830
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,012
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.

831
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,349
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

832
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,686
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

833
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:43,189
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

834
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,233
because I believed him.

835
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,570
Well, you wasted your time.

836
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,786
- Let's go, everyone.
- What about Woody?

837
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,123
He's not coming with us.

838
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,669
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

839
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:08,339
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

840
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,060
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

841
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,604
To do what, Woody?

842
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:26,024
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

843
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,901
Some life.

844
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,824
- Is everybody okay?
- Sheriff Woody!

845
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,536
- Knew you'd make it!
- Now, remember, deputies,

846
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,331
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

847
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,918
Before I go, kids, I want to share
somethin' special with you,

848
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,046
- for the times I'm not around.
- Good going, Woody!

849
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,589
I thought they'd never leave.

850
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,509
You've got a friend in me

851
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,011
You've got a friend in me

852
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,596
Woody?

853
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,722
You've got troubles

854
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,767
Well, I've got "em too

855
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,812
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

856
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,899
We stick together
and see it through

857
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,361
'Cause you've got a friend in me

858
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:17,325
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

859
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:21,329
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

860
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,958
But none of them will ever love you

861
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:29,754
The way I do
It's me and you, boy

862
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,382
And as the years go by

863
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,678
Our friendship will never die

864
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,264
You're gonna see it's our destiny

865
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,890
What am I doing?

866
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,727
- Buzz! Wait! Wait!
- Woody, where are you going?

867
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:48,022
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

868
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,358
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

869
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,152
- No!
- Buzz!

870
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,279
- Yes?
- Yes?

871
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,281
I'm coming with you!

872
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,325
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

873
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,743
Way to go, cowboy!

874
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,747
- Hey, you guys... Come with me.
- What?

875
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,166
Andy will play with all of us.
I know it!

876
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,210
Woody, I don't know. I...

877
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,964
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

878
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:17,510
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

879
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,763
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

880
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,391
Okay, good boy.

881
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,602
Prospector, how 'bout you?

882
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,400
- Prospector?
- You're outta your box!

883
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,778
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

884
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,490
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

885
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,329
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

886
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:48,166
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

887
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,252
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

888
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,379
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

889
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,089
Prospector, this isn't fair.

890
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:58,217
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

891
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:04,098
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

892
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,100
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

893
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:10,688
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

894
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,777
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

895
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,989
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

896
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,949
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

897
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:25,828
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

898
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,915
It's stuck! What do we do?

899
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,500
Should I use my head?

900
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,003
It's All

901
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,257
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

902
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,802
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

903
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,763
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

904
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,015
passport, beef jerky,
very expensive over there.

905
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,184
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

906
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,812
I just gotta get outta here now!

907
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,108
Quick! To the elevator!

908
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,366
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

909
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,581
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

910
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,250
for the last time.

911
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:16,212
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

912
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,853
Quick! Get on!

913
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,192
The emergency hatch! Come on!

914
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,088
Come on! Hurry!

915
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,008
But Buzz is in peril!

916
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,844
Buzz Buzz Buzz...

917
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:18,858
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

918
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,903
I'll never give in.
You killed my father!

919
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,865
No, Buzz. I AM your father.

920
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,660
No!

921
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,498
Come on! Come on! Come on!

922
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,421
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

923
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,591
You just need to believe in yourself!

924
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,803
- Prepare to die!
- I can't look!

925
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,972
<i>Whoa!</i>

926
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:58,523
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

927
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,608
Father.

928
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,535
Finally!

929
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,728
How are we gonna get him now?

930
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,355
Pizza, anyone?

931
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,650
- Go, go, go!
- I got it!

932
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,776
Buzz, are you coming?

933
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,363
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

934
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:53,119
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

935
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,205
- Oh, you're a great dad.
- Farewell.

936
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,791
Does anyone know how to drive?

937
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,294
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

938
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,130
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

939
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,132
Whoa.

940
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,720
- Strangers.
- From the outside.

941
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,681
- Oh, no.
- He's at a red light! We can catch him!

942
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,641
Maximum power, Slink!

943
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,854
It turned green! Hurry!

944
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,648
- Why won't it go?
- Use the Wand of Power.

945
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:33,200
- Rex, which way?
- Left! No, no! I mean right!

946
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:36,162
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

947
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,165
Buzz, he's turning left!
He's turning left!

948
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,252
Oh, boy!

949
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,504
<i>Whoa!</i>

950
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,174
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

951
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,885
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

952
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:53,763
<i>Whoa!</i>

953
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,850
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

954
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,435
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

955
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:11,697
The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

956
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,659
No parking.

957
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,747
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

958
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:23,209
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

959
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,794
- Final boarding call...
- There he is!

960
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,213
For Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

961
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,465
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

962
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,592
must board at this time.

963
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:36,639
Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...

964
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,392
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

965
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,228
- Will you leave me alone?
- Someone's coming!

966
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,897
- A puppy!
- Bark, bark, bark, bark.

967
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,315
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

968
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,484
Listen, fly boy.

969
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,487
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

970
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,906
- You got that, sport? You be careful!
- I understand, sir.

971
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,784
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

972
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,953
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

973
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,081
The Mystic Portal!

974
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:06,002
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

975
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,978
- There's the case!
- No, there's the case!

976
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,314
You take that one! We'll take this one!

977
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,328
Whoa! Buzz!

978
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:44,206
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

979
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:46,083
Slinky!

980
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,047
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

981
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,549
Nice flash, though.

982
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,023
Okay, Woody, let's go!

983
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,984
Take that, space toy.

984
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,737
Hey! No one does that to my friend!

985
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,537
Your choice, Woody.

986
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,998
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

987
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:29,794
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

988
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,962
<i>- Never!
- Fine!</i>

989
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,304
- No!
- Gotcha!

990
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,932
Idiots! Children destroy toys!

991
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,226
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

992
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,312
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

993
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:53,526
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

994
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:57,738
- Right over there, guys!
- No. No! No!

995
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:02,535
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

996
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,246
is now arriving at Gate 3.

997
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,499
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.

998
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,918
He needs a makeover.

999
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,339
Hi! You'll like Amy.

1000
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,425
She's an artist!

1001
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,179
Come on, hon!

1002
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,684
Happy trails, Prospector.

1003
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,769
- Buzz! Woody!
- Help us out here!

1004
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:30,729
Hurry!

1005
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,233
- Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
- Oh, Woody!

1006
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:44,660
<i>Jessie!</i>

1007
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,997
Come on, Buzz.

1008
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,541
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

1009
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,553
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1010
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,763
Come on, Bullseye!

1011
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,310
Buzz, give me a boost!

1012
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,196
Woody!

1013
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,231
Here's the rest!

1014
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,588
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1015
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,507
- Woody!
- Come on, Jess.

1016
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,467
- It's time to take you home.
- But

1017
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,678
- what if Andy doesn't like me?
- Nonsense!

1018
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,805
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1019
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,140
- he's got a little sister.
- He does?

1020
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,726
<i>- Why didn't you say so? Letl's go!
- Whoa!</i>

1021
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,858
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1022
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,819
Okay. On three.

1023
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,530
- One, two...
- Too late!

1024
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,532
Put 'em on the next flight!

1025
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,041
- This is bad.
- How are we gonna get outta here?

1026
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,920
Over there! Come on!

1027
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,811
- You sure about this?
- No! Let's go!

1028
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,834
Hold on, Woody!

1029
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:46,342
- What's a cowboy without his hat?
- Buzz!

1030
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,858
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tires!

1031
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,574
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1032
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:11,992
What? Are you crazy?

1033
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,287
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1034
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,707
But it was canceled!
We never saw if you made it!

1035
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,418
Well, then, let's find out together!

1036
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:37,851
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1037
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:39,269
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1038
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,981
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1039
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,733
Your hat, partner.

1040
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,658
Let's go home.

1041
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:00,791
Yee-haw!

1042
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,676
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1043
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,643
Oh, wow! New toys!

1044
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,645
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1045
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:25,524
It's Bazooka Jane
and her jet-propelled horse!

1046
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:30,237
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1047
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,665
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1048
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,460
- Hey, you fixed Woody!
- Yeah.

1049
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:49,089
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1050
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,305
Well, what do you know?

1051
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,599
Yee-haw!

1052
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,058
Oh, Bullseye,

1053
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,728
we're part of a family again!

1054
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,318
Ma'am, ll...

1055
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,904
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1056
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,864
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1057
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,116
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1058
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,285
I must go.

1059
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:22,122
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1060
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,210
What's that? Bark, bark?

1061
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:30,130
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1062
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,216
That critter needs help!

1063
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,729
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1064
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,649
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1065
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,859
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1066
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,487
<i>Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.</i>

1067
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,365
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1068
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,118
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1069
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:04,456
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1070
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,834
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1071
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,546
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1072
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,759
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1073
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:19,805
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1074
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:23,433
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1075
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,643
Daddy!

1076
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,270
Oh, no.

1077
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,648
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1078
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:34,152
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1079
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,322
- And how do you feel?
- Oh, I feel swell.

1080
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:41,368
In fact, I think
I feel a song comin' on.

1081
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:48,500
You've got a friend in me

1082
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,378
You've got a friend in me

1083
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,132
You just remember
what your old pal said

1084
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:58,844
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1085
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,513
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1086
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:05,017
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1087
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,185
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1088
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,021
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1089
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,940
- You still worried?
- About Andy?

1090
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:16,403
- Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
- I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1091
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:21,116
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company

1092
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,827
for infinity and beyond.

1093
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,957
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1094
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:34,212
- You've got a friend in me
- Yes, you do

1095
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:37,883
- You've got a friend in me
- That's the truth

1096
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,344
You've got a friend

1097
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:45,599
In me

1098
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:48,310
Yeah!

1099
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,521
- Speed.
- Marker.

1100
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:52,981
And action.

1101
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,950
Okay. A little help here, please.

1102
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,500
- What are we gonna do, Buzz?
- Use your head!

1103
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,044
But I don't wanna use my head!

1104
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,883
- Speed.
- Marker.

1105
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,593
Okay, and pull back.

1106
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,433
- I don't remember eating that.
- Cut.

1107
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,394
- I can't believe this.
- That's the fifth time.

1108
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,354
- What row is that guy in?
- Sorry.

1109
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:36,024
I had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry.

1110
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,068
And action.

1111
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:43,115
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

1112
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:47,536
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.

1113
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,830
I don't know what it's for,
but you never know.

1114
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,790
- Speed.
- Marker.

1115
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,291
And action.

1116
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,967
Could...? Should we just...?

1117
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,635
Should that just be part
of the movie now?

1118
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,513
He lost... He lost his string.

1119
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:12,310
And the golf ball,
if you have time for golf.

1120
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:17,232
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.

1121
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,484
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

1122
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,198
All right, cut. Good take.

1123
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:27,826
What good acting.
That was a good take.

1124
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,579
You're such a cute little bottom.

1125
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,748
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.

1126
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,419
In fact, I think
I feel a song comin' on.

1127
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,257
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?

1128
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,426
You gotta aim it
right here at my flipper.

1129
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,094
I'm not a very good catch.

1130
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,764
- Okay, I'm ready for another take.
- Let's go again.

1131
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,978
Oh, no! Oh, no,
I think I swallowed my squeaker!

1132
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:59,608
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.

1133
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,111
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.

1134
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,529
<i>Whoa!</i>

1135
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:07,616
- Marker.
- And action.

1136
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,709
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

1137
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,920
What? What're you laughing about?

1138
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,298
Real funny, Woody.

1139
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,801
We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.

1140
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,386
Golly bob howdy.

1141
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:32,682
What? What's so funny? Woody!

1142
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,815
- Darn it, Woody!
- Okay, let's go again.

1143
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,443
And crayons, in case you get bored.

1144
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,487
And some blue Play-Doh.

1145
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,619
Isn't this exciting, Heimlich?
Ouir first day of shooting.

1146
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:55,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!

1147
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:58,375
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making A Bug's Life 2.

1148
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,211
Yeah, I can hardly believe it also.

1149
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:05,215
But there's a little baby tiny thing
I forgot to tell you.

1150
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:06,299
What's that, Heimlich?

1151
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:11,429
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not A Bug's Life 2.

1152
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,099
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?

1153
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,600
And action.

1154
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,856
- Speed.
- Let me check focus.

1155
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,774
Did you make it
into the first Toy Story?

1156
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,236
In the letterbox copy, you can see
my arm grabbing Woody's ankle.

1157
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,320
What will you do next?

1158
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,698
I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.

1159
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,116
Wow, that's great.

1160
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:35,120
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.

1161
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,913
Monkey chow? For what?

1162
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,291
Well, for the monkeys, of course.

1163
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,834
Come on, monkeys.

1164
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,754
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!

1165
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,466
- Marker.
- And action.

1166
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,093
It's your choice, Woody.

1167
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:54,556
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

1168
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:59,144
Good heavens. Was that me?

1169
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:04,065
Oh, my. I am so sorry.

1170
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,360
I guess that's why they call me
Stinky Pete.

1171
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,862
Okay, let's cut.

1172
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:11,072
We are so glad you came.

1173
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,909
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1174
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,244
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.

1175
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:20,248
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers

1176
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:23,501
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.

1177
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:27,005
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.

1178
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,091
Okay.

1179
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,676
Are they all gone?

1180
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,763
Is everybody gone?

1181
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,431
Huh?

1182
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:40,268
Good. Oh, my gosh,
my cheeks are killing me.

1183
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:44,356
I can't keep smiling like this anymore.
I am exhausted.

1184
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:46,524
I think I need a break.

1185
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,652
A little break? Okay.
