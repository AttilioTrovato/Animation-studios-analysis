1
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,479
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,189
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,317
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,489
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,866
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,995
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,205
Help! Baal
Help us!

8
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,792
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,260
Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,554
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,348
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,851
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,644
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,895
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,316
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,532
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,452
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,379
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,007
You're my favorite deputy.

21
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,551
You've got a friend in me

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,555
You've got a friend in me

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,432
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,602
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,564
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,857
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,735
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,696
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,864
Yee-haw!

30
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,784
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,869
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,539
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,750
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,793
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,919
Maybe

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,882
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,760
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,095
And as the years go by

39
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,930
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,933
Our friendship will never die

41
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,063
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,566
You've got a friend in me

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,776
All right!

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,278
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,738
Score!

46
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,074
You got a friend in me

47
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,283
Wow! Cool!

48
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,495
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,122
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,040
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,209
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,877
- One, two... Four.
- Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,630
- Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
- Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,632
- Well, sure! We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

55
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,801
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,679
Okay. It's party time, Woody.

57
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,641
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,773
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,113
<i>Somebody's poisoned the water hole.</i>

60
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,823
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,991
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,243
See you later, Woody.

63
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,421
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

64
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,342
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

65
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,602
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

66
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,606
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

67
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,744
Hey, Hamm.

68
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,955
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

69
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,543
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

70
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,759
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

71
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,762
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

72
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,473
Hey, uh, Slinky?

73
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,392
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

74
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,686
- No. Slink...
- Oh, well, all right.

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,938
You can be red if you want.

76
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,107
- Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?

77
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,445
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

78
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,530
Got it.

79
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,906
Be happy!

80
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,701
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

81
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,703
Hey.

82
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
Hey, Etch. Draw!

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,796
Oh! Got me again.

84
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,550
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

85
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,594
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

86
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,347
Now, where is that... Oh.

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,933
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

88
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,605
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

89
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,566
I was close to being scared
that time.

90
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,236
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

91
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,613
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

92
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,325
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

93
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,995
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

94
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,789
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

95
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:17,168
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

96
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,421
Oh, yeah!

97
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,843
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

98
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,720
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.

99
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,096
Smaller toys up front.

100
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,975
Hey, Woody, come on.

101
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,482
Oh, thanks, Mike.

102
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,651
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

103
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,279
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,658
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

105
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,786
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

106
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,956
Okay. First item today...

107
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,335
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

108
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,004
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

109
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,340
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

110
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,800
Do we have to hold hands?

111
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,136
You guys think this is a big joke.

112
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,639
We've only got one week
left before the move.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,725
! don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

114
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,353
If you don't have one, get one!

115
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,397
All right, next. Oh, yes.

116
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,776
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

117
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,236
was, I think, a big success.

118
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,490
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

119
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,201
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.

120
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,704
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

121
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,415
<i>Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.</i>

122
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,209
Wait a minute here!

123
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,420
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

124
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,131
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

125
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,969
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

126
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,804
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

127
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,389
Of course Woody ain't worried.

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,516
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

129
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,893
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

130
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,522
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

131
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,857
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

132
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,569
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

133
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,656
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

134
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,742
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

135
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,120
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

136
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,123
This is Andy
we're talking about.

137
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,251
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

138
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,590
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

139
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,718
That's what we're made for, right?

140
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,555
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

141
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,390
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

142
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,600
Stay calm, everyone!

143
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,102
Hey!

144
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,188
Meeting adjourned.

145
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,691
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

146
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,152
I can't see a thing.

147
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,408
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

148
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,327
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

149
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,539
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger.

150
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,916
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

151
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,001
Hi!

152
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,214
- Spell, trash can.
- We're doomed!

153
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,008
All right! All right!

154
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,803
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

155
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,724
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

156
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

157
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,399
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

158
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,943
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

159
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,863
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

160
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,325
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

161
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,494
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

162
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,597
Yeah!

163
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,851
Okay, come on, kids.

164
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,854
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

165
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,670
All right, gangway, gangway.

166
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,923
And this is how we find out

167
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,217
what is in those presents.

168
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,932
Okay, who's hungry?

169
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,017
Here come the chips!

170
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,520
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

171
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,564
What in the world... Oh!

172
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,067
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

173
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,778
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

174
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,948
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

175
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,993
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

176
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,214
Go on without me!
Just go!

177
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,092
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

178
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,029
Okay, everybody, come on.

179
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,073
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

180
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,952
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

181
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:47,040
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

182
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,126
- Mine!
- There they are.

183
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,004
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

184
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,381
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

185
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,551
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

186
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,471
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

187
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,015
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

188
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,601
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

189
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,187
It's a... If's...
It's a... a lunch box.

190
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,481
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

191
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,358
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

192
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,944
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

193
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,863
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

194
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,204
Oh! Only one left.

195
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,040
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

196
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,501
It's a big one. It's a...

197
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,128
- It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

198
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,422
Hallelujah!

199
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,383
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

200
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,218
Sorry there, old spud head.

201
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,055
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

202
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,474
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

203
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,978
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

204
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,355
Wait a minute. Oh!

205
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,526
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

206
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,403
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

207
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,197
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

208
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,700
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

209
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,702
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

210
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,705
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

211
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,749
- It's a...
- Wow!

212
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,296
It's a what? What is it?

213
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,215
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

214
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,926
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

215
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,970
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

216
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,556
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

217
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,726
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

218
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,354
Let's go to my room, guys!

219
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,232
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

220
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,318
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

221
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,194
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

222
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,905
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

223
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,033
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

224
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,410
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

225
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,580
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

226
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,510
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

227
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,889
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

228
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,099
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

229
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,102
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

230
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,229
We've got prizes!

231
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,576
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

232
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,497
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

233
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,792
Woody?

234
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,753
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

235
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,464
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

236
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,300
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

237
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,179
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

238
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,474
- Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

239
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,351
No one is getting replaced.

240
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,146
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

241
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,900
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

242
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,677
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

243
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,679
Come in, Star Command.

244
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,640
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

245
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,977
Why don't they answer? My ship!

246
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,024
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

247
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,695
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

248
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,073
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

249
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,659
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

250
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,245
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

251
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,083
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

252
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,253
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

253
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,423
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

254
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,507
Hello!

255
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,886
<i>Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

256
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,221
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

257
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,724
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

258
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,686
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

259
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,522
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

260
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,900
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

261
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,277
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

262
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,405
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

263
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,657
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

264
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,578
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

265
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,246
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

266
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,416
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

267
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,418
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

268
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,921
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

269
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,423
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

270
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,260
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

271
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,679
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

272
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,390
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

273
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,810
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

274
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,146
Wh-why, thank you!

275
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,941
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

276
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,777
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

277
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,488
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

278
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,699
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

279
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,993
- Only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

280
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,789
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

281
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,457
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

282
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,794
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

283
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,297
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

284
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,093
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

285
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,594
of the Space Ranger Corps,

286
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,347
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

287
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,518
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

288
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,020
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

289
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,606
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

290
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,233
I'm actually from a smaller company

291
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,776
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

292
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,362
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

293
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,155
Well, sure. Look at him.

294
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,992
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

295
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,828
Please be careful.

296
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,454
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

297
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

298
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,044
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

299
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,838
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

300
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,172
All right, that's enough!

301
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,634
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

302
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,095
<i>- Toy?
- T-O-Y. Toy!</i>

303
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,141
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

304
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,687
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

305
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,272
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

306
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,400
Mr. Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

307
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,111
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

308
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,238
He's not a Space Ranger!

309
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,992
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

310
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,493
Excuse me.

311
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,040
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

312
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,878
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

313
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,423
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

314
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,801
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

315
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,886
- You can't.
- Can.

316
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,679
Can't. Can't. Can't!

317
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,223
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

318
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,436
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

319
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,438
Stand back, everyone!

320
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,907
To infinity and beyond!

321
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,936
- Can!
- Whoal!

322
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,272
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

323
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,443
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

324
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,406
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

325
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,617
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

326
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,663
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

327
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,747
You know, in a couple of days,

328
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,125
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

329
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,876
They'll see.

330
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,338
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

331
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,633
I was on top of the world
livin' high

332
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,677
It was right in my pocket

333
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,806
! was livin" the life

334
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,268
Things were just the way
they should be

335
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,814
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

336
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,150
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

337
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,864
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

338
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,907
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

339
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,328
Strange

340
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,789
Things are happening to me

341
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,295
Strange

342
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,590
Things

343
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,678
Strange things are happening to me

344
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,806
Ain't no doubt about it

345
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,940
! had friends
! had lots of friends

346
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,486
Now all my friends are gone

347
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,822
And I'm doin' the best I can

348
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,699
To carry on

349
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,203
- had power
- Power

350
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,663
- I was respected
- Respected

351
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,792
But not anymore

352
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,586
And I've lost the love of the one

353
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,422
Whom I adore

354
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,885
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

355
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,721
Things are happenin'to me

356
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,893
Strange

357
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,978
Things

358
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,107
Strange

359
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,944
Things are happenin'to me

360
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,404
Ain't no doubt about it

361
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,744
Strange

362
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,247
Things

363
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,584
Strange

364
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,711
Things

365
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,507
Finally!

366
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,468
Hey, who's got my hat?

367
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,346
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

368
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,558
Gimme that!

369
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,310
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

370
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,313
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

371
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,316
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

372
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,442
Wow!

373
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,486
With permanent ink too!

374
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,197
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

375
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,953
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

376
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,414
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

377
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,542
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

378
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,004
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

379
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,966
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

380
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,011
Unidirectional bonding strip.

381
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,471
Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.

382
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,311
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

383
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,148
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

384
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,733
What are you talking about?

385
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,360
Where's that bonding strip?

386
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,988
And another thing,

387
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,242
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

388
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,661
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

389
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,707
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

390
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,669
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

391
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,724
The air isn't... toxic.

392
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,853
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

393
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,231
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

394
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,362
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

395
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,490
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

396
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,369
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

397
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,703
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

398
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,539
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

399
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,999
Where?

400
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,217
Yes!

401
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,763
It's Sid!

402
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,556
Don't move!

403
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,350
I thought he was at summer camp.

404
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,519
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

405
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,854
Oh, no, not Sid!

406
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,523
Incoming!

407
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,695
- Who is it this time?
- I... I can't... I can't tell.

408
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,905
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

409
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,867
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

410
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,079
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

411
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,163
What's going on?

412
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,917
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

413
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,502
I'd better take a look anyway.

414
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,089
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

415
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,425
That's why, Sid.

416
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,927
Sure is a hairy fellow.

417
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,054
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

418
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,515
That is Sid.

419
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,561
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

420
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,856
He tortures toys, just for fun!

421
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,570
Well, then we've got
to do something.

422
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,447
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

423
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,783
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

424
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,202
Melt him with your scary laser.

425
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,289
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

426
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,083
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

427
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,961
Look out!

428
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,760
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

429
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,929
I could've stopped him.

430
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,183
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

431
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,769
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

432
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,272
The sooner we move, the better.

433
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,316
Yeah!

434
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,365
To infinity and beyond!

435
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,702
All this packing
makes me hungry.

436
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,705
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

437
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,708
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

438
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,544
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

439
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,923
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

440
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,967
- Just one?
- One toy?

441
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,433
Will Andy pick me?

442
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,022
"Don't count on it"?

443
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,754
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

444
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,173
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

445
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,926
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

446
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,762
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

447
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,265
Then we've no time to lose.

448
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,230
I don't see anything!

449
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,566
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

450
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,900
What kind of toy...

451
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,587
Buzz!

452
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,880
Buzz!

453
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,091
I don't see him in the driveway.

454
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,803
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

455
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:06,101
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

456
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,938
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

457
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,441
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
- No!

458
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,775
By Woody!

459
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,652
- What?
- Wait a minute.

460
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:20,032
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

461
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,160
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

462
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,329
Now, it was an accident, guys.

463
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,248
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

464
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,793
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

465
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,338
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

466
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,133
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

467
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,801
You don't deserve to... Hey!

468
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,180
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

469
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:47,351
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

470
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,769
So you got rid of him.

471
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,521
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

472
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,565
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

473
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,734
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

474
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,861
There he is, men. Frag him!

475
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,488
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

476
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,949
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

477
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,033
Tackle him!

478
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,744
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

479
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,705
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

480
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,915
Retreat!

481
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,797
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

482
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,340
No, I haven't seen him.

483
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,429
- Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!

484
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,974
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

485
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,017
Oh, okay.

486
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,526
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

487
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,570
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

488
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,337
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

489
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,507
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

490
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,885
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

491
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,889
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

492
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,891
Oh, where could he be?

493
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,781
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

494
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,867
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

495
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,869
Funny, Mom.

496
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,373
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

497
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,004
Buzz!

498
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,383
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

499
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,720
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

500
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,306
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

501
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:54,603
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

502
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,272
Huh? Right? Buddy?

503
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,942
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

504
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,945
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

505
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:08,033
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

506
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
No.

507
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,709
Okay, come on!

508
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,961
You want a piece of me?

509
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,554
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

510
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,557
- Next stop.
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!

511
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,353
Andy!

512
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,656
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

513
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm lost!

514
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,704
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

515
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,336
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

516
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,798
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

517
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,924
Youl

518
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,322
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

519
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,742
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

520
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,371
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

521
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,665
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

522
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,877
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

523
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh, yeah?

524
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,214
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

525
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,425
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

526
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,885
Don't talk to me
about importance!

527
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,013
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

528
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,557
What? What are
you talkin' about?

529
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,351
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

530
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,061
has been secretly building
a weapon

531
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,398
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

532
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,736
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

533
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,030
And you, my friend,
are responsible

534
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,492
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

535
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:17,078
You... are... a... toy!

536
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,414
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

537
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:24,252
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

538
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,924
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

539
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,175
Farewell.

540
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,303
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

541
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,764
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

542
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,392
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?

543
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,937
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

544
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,980
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

545
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,440
Oh, no!

546
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,401
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

547
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,404
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

548
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,824
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! ll...

549
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,079
I found a spaceship!

550
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,832
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

551
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,921
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

552
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,633
- Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

553
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,636
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

554
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,138
once it jettisons its food supply?

555
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,643
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

556
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,272
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

557
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,399
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

558
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,652
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

559
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,988
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu...

560
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,323
Buzz! Buzz!

561
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,908
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

562
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,911
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid...

563
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,371
Buzz!

564
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,678
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

565
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,288
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

566
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,750
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

567
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,380
You are clear to enter.

568
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,215
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

569
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,053
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

570
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,596
Sheriff!

571
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,766
There you are.

572
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,144
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

573
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,439
Great idea, Woody.

574
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,650
I like your thinkin'.

575
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,654
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

576
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,405
Now!

577
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,283
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

578
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,036
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

579
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,080
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

580
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
Watch where you're going!

581
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,292
Sorry.

582
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:19,552
Nine, eight, seven, six,

583
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,722
five, four, three,

584
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,766
two, one.

585
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,353
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

586
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,989
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

587
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,991
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship

588
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,495
- that's headed for Sector 12.
- Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

589
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,957
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

590
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,626
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

591
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,629
And Astro... turf!

592
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,215
- Where is it? I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

593
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,675
Spaceship!

594
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,763
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

595
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,640
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

596
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,393
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

597
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,147
- No!
- Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

598
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,690
can I have some alien slime?

599
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,443
This cannot be happening to me.

600
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,079
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

601
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,584
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

602
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,086
I come in peace.

603
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,675
Before your space journey,
re-energize yourself

604
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,345
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

605
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,348
This is an intergalactic emergency.

606
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,851
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

607
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,353
Who's in charge here?

608
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,231
The claw!

609
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,526
The claw is our master.

610
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,862
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

611
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,365
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

612
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,868
Take that!

613
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,205
Oh, no! Sid!

614
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,873
Get down!

615
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,543
What's gotten into you? I was...

616
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,837
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

617
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,340
The claw, it moves.

618
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,180
I have been chosen!

619
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,892
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

620
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,269
Gotchal!

621
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,066
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

622
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,084
Yes!

623
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,961
Buzz! No!

624
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,713
Hey!

625
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,259
He has been chosen!

626
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,969
- He must go.
- Hey!

627
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,595
- What are you doing?
- Do not fight the claw.

628
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,764
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

629
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,104
All right!
Double prizes!

630
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,401
Let's go home and... play.

631
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,792
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

632
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,003
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.

633
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,672
- The mystic portal awaits.
- Will you be quiet?

634
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,215
You guys don't get it, do you?

635
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,594
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

636
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,138
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

637
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,307
Sit! Good boy.

638
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,143
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

639
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,814
Ready, set, now!

640
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,693
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

641
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,945
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

642
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,406
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

643
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,283
I don't know!

644
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,120
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

645
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,955
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

646
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,499
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

647
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,210
- No!
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.

648
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,171
Hey, give her back!

649
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,089
Sid! Sid!

650
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,344
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

651
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,346
Prepare the OR, stat!

652
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,683
Patient is... prepped.

653
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,272
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

654
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,151
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

655
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,029
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

656
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,617
Doctor, you've done it!

657
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,286
Hannah!

658
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,372
Janie's all better now.

659
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,085
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

660
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,796
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

661
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,978
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

662
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,275
Locked.

663
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,569
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

664
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,042
Buzz? Was that you?

665
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,096
Hey, hi there, little fella.

666
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,599
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

667
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,381
Buzz!

668
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,811
They're cannibals.

669
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,149
Mayday, mayday.

670
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,485
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

671
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,904
Star Command, do you copy?

672
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,782
I've set my laser from stun to Kill.

673
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,994
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

674
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,541
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

675
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,336
Buzz, is that you?

676
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,463
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

677
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,382
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

678
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,677
Look, they're home.

679
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,476
Mom, have you seen Woody?

680
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,144
Where was the last place
you left him?

681
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,479
Right here in the van.

682
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,232
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

683
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,776
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

684
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,237
Woody's gone?

685
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,280
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

686
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,491
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

687
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:42,787
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

688
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,041
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

689
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:55,133
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

690
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,096
I can see your will is strong.

691
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,892
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

692
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,822
Where are your rebel friends now?

693
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,867
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

694
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,535
All right!

695
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,841
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

696
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,594
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

697
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,680
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

698
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,017
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

699
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,519
The door. It's open!
We're free!

700
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,770
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

701
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,105
I'll tell you what?

702
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,610
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

703
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,486
Shield your eyes.

704
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,283
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

705
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,995
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

706
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,789
- Get away!
- Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

707
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,709
- Stop that.
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!

708
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,504
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

709
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,424
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

710
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,968
There's no place like home.

711
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,526
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

712
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,987
Don't tell me what to do.

713
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,843
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

714
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,680
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

715
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,809
Split up!

716
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,333
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

717
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,544
- This is Star Command.
- Star Command!

718
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,171
- Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Buzz Lightyear responding.

719
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,298
Read you loud and clear.

720
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,883
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

721
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,136
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!

722
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,724
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

723
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,768
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

724
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,313
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate chop action!

725
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,398
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!

726
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,901
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phrase voice simulator!

727
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,070
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

728
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,989
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,326
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

730
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,079
- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.

731
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,873
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

732
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,168
- and save a galaxy near you!
- Buzz Lightyear!

733
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,755
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

734
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,134
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

735
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,600
Out among the stars I sail

736
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,353
Way beyond the moon

737
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:41,442
In my silver ship I sailed

738
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:45,613
To a dream
that ended too soon

739
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,532
Now I know exactly

740
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,119
Who I am and what I'm here for

741
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,623
You are a toy! You can't fly!

742
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,962
And I will go sailing

743
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,674
No more

744
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:14,308
But no, it can't be true

745
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,561
I could fly if I wanted to

746
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,356
Like a bird in the sky

747
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,317
If I believed I could fly

748
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,986
Why, I'd fly

749
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,864
To infinity and beyond!

750
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,426
Clearly, I

751
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:53,222
Will go sailing

752
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,891
No more

753
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:12,450
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

754
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,369
What, dear? What was that?

755
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,080
Never mind!

756
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,215
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

757
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,802
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

758
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:35,222
Really?
That is so interesting.

759
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,934
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

760
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,561
Buzz!

761
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,564
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

762
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:47,234
- Oh, no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

763
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,445
It goes quite well with your head.

764
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,865
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

765
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,659
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

766
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,536
I'll be right back.

767
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:04,335
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

768
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,921
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

769
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,216
Gonel! It's all gone.

770
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,135
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

771
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,261
What happened to you?

772
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,014
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

773
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:21,101
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darjeeling with

774
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,313
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

775
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,567
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

776
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,402
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

777
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,447
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

778
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,452
- I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

779
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,583
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

780
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,503
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

781
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,630
I can get through this.

782
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,507
Oh, I'm a sham!

783
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,883
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

784
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,844
I can't even fly out of a window.

785
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,181
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

786
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,059
- The apron is a bit much.
- "Out the window"!

787
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,478
Buzz, you're a genius!

788
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,854
Come on, come on. This way.

789
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,108
Years of academy, training, wasted!

790
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,569
B-3.

791
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,779
Miss! G-6.

792
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,031
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

793
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,451
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

794
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,954
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

795
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,333
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

796
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,087
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

797
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,590
- Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

798
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,716
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

799
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,844
- Woody?
- We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

800
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,596
Buzz?

801
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,060
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

802
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,313
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

803
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,024
- Knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

804
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,568
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

805
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,653
Here! Catch this!

806
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,240
- Whoal! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

807
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,201
Good goin', Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

808
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,787
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

809
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,205
- Hey!
- Potato Head.

810
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,249
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

811
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,335
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

812
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,919
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

813
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:15,424
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

814
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,885
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

815
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,221
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

816
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:25,059
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

817
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,979
Just a sec!

818
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,191
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

819
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,736
That's very funny, Buzz.

820
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,906
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

821
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,033
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

822
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,827
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

823
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,997
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

824
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,793
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

825
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,711
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

826
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:57,675
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

827
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,093
Give me five, man!

828
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,386
Something's screwy here.

829
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,305
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

830
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,307
You bet. Give me a hug.

831
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,851
Boy, I love you too.

832
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,561
See? It is Buzz.

833
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,271
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

834
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,773
Wait just a minute.

835
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,401
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

836
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,448
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

837
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,617
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

838
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,078
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

839
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,747
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

840
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,749
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

841
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,794
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

842
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,170
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

843
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,881
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

844
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,551
Come back! Slink!

845
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,596
<i>Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!</i>

846
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,933
No! No! Come back!

847
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,477
Slinky!

848
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,739
Buzz! Go away!

849
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,532
You disgusting freaks!

850
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,286
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

851
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,711
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

852
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,588
<i>What are you don'?</i>

853
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,593
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

854
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,723
But they're cannibals.

855
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,350
We saw them eat
those other toys.

856
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,236
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

857
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,906
You know, you know, eat my friend.

858
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,074
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

859
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,576
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

860
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,369
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

861
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,872
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

862
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:56,335
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

863
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,882
It came!
It finally came!

864
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,720
"The Big One."

865
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,142
"Extremely dangerous.

866
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,937
"Keep out of reach of children."

867
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,483
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

868
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,444
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

869
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:41,755
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

870
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,684
Now. Yes.

871
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,065
Oh, no!

872
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,278
Oh, man!

873
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,703
Sid Phillips reporting.

874
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,329
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

875
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,124
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

876
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,043
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

877
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,255
Sweet dreams.

878
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,139
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

879
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,391
But what if we
leave them behind?

880
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,226
Oh, don't worry, honey.

881
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,730
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

882
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,323
I need air!

883
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,491
Will you quit movin' around?

884
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,203
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
l get so nervous before I travel.

885
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,706
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

886
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,958
Everyone else was picked.

887
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,050
Oh, Woody.

888
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,971
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

889
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,612
Hey, Buzz!

890
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:39,039
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

891
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,586
Oh, come on, Buzz, ll...

892
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,799
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

893
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,720
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

894
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,640
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

895
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,060
Then [I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

896
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,689
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

897
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,818
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

898
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,405
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

899
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,116
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

900
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:18,412
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

901
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,746
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

902
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,250
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

903
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,669
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

904
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,797
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

905
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,591
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

906
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,554
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

907
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,222
But why would Andy want me?

908
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:42,602
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

909
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,397
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

910
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,984
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

911
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,446
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

912
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,615
You are a cool toy.

913
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,955
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

914
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,792
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

915
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,171
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

916
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,840
All ll can do is...

917
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:16,344
There's a snake in my boots.

918
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,764
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

919
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,516
when he's got you?

920
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,979
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

921
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,838
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

922
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,841
You should get outta here
while you can.

923
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,188
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

924
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,274
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

925
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,360
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

926
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,778
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

927
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,491
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

928
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,332
Woody, it's the moving van.

929
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,543
We gotta get outta here now.

930
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,007
Come on, Buzz.

931
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,802
All right.

932
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,056
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

933
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,397
I want to ride the pony.

934
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:58,113
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

935
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,575
I'm fine. I'm okay.

936
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,589
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

937
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,428
To infinity and beyond!

938
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,647
Back, back.

939
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,482
Down, down!

940
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,235
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

941
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,615
Guys!

942
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,911
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

943
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,287
There's a good toy down there,

944
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,498
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

945
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:54,127
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

946
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,963
And...
But I need your help.

947
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,015
Please. He's my friend.

948
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,435
And he's the only one I've got.

949
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,327
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

950
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,496
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

951
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,707
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

952
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,388
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

953
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,849
Launch pad is being constructed.

954
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,769
All right, listen up.

955
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,689
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

956
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,441
Legs, you're with Ducky.

957
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,861
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

958
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,407
Okay. Let's move!

959
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,429
Wind the frog.

960
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,745
Wait for the signal.

961
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,636
Go!

962
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,100
All right, let's go!

963
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,144
I'll get it!

964
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,437
Now!

965
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,939
I'm coming. I'm coming.

966
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,284
Scud!

967
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,123
Stupid dog.

968
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,424
Lean back!

969
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,808
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

970
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,435
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

971
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:01,106
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

972
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,899
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

973
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,235
- Stand by.
- Let's go.

974
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:09,572
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

975
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,117
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

976
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:16,079
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

977
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,832
Woody, what are you doing?

978
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:23,169
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

979
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,548
Hey? How'd you get out here?

980
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,261
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

981
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,308
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

982
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,894
Roger. Permission granted.

983
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:44,107
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

984
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,944
And counting.
Ten, nine,

985
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,822
eight, seven, six,

986
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:54,033
five, four, three, two,

987
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:58,204
- one!
- Reach for the sky!

988
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,084
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

989
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,502
What?

990
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,172
<i>Somebody's poisoned the water hole.</i>

991
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:11,217
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

992
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,303
That's right.

993
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:17,098
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

994
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,018
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

995
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,061
or smashed or ripped apart.

996
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,565
_llWell?
- That's right! Your toys!

997
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,901
Mamal

998
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,736
Mamal

999
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,406
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

1000
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:56,513
Mamal

1001
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,643
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1002
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:05,813
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1003
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:12,237
We toys can see everything.

1004
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,782
So play nice.

1005
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,625
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1006
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,294
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1007
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,046
Nice toy.

1008
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,260
What's wrong, Sid?

1009
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,054
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1010
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,432
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1011
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,060
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1012
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,853
Woody.

1013
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,648
Thanks.

1014
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,235
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1015
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,612
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

1016
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,200
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1017
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,997
Quick!

1018
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,087
Just go. I'll catch up.

1019
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,693
Come on!

1020
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,044
You can do it, Woody!

1021
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,048
I got it!

1022
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,216
I made it.

1023
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,641
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1024
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,310
- Down!
- Hold on, Woody!

1025
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,980
I can't do it.

1026
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,400
Take care of Andy for me!

1027
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,027
No!

1028
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,821
Buzz!

1029
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,225
Are we there already?

1030
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,851
- Woody?
- How did you...?

1031
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,269
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you...?

1032
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,604
What happened?

1033
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,773
- What's goin' on?
- What's he takin'?

1034
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,942
There you are!

1035
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,860
Hey. What's he doing?

1036
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,699
He's at it again!

1037
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,295
- Get him!
- Come on!

1038
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,431
No, no!

1039
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,478
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoal!

1040
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,363
Pig pile!

1041
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,763
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1042
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,933
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1043
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,060
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1044
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,521
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1045
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,315
No, no, no! Wait!

1046
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,320
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1047
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,494
Oh! Woody!

1048
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,872
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Look out!

1049
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,003
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1050
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,055
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1051
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,224
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1052
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,687
It is Buzz!

1053
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,731
Woody was telling the truth.

1054
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,235
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1055
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,403
We're almost there!

1056
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,824
Rocky, the ramp!

1057
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,958
Look out!

1058
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,127
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1059
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:30,263
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1060
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,722
Woody! Speed up!

1061
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,724
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1062
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,434
They're runnin' out!

1063
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:55,746
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1064
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,763
Great!

1065
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,476
Woody! The rocket!

1066
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,062
The match! Yes!

1067
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,023
Thank you, Sid!

1068
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,282
No! No, no! No!

1069
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,827
No! Oh, no!

1070
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,748
No, no, no, no, no,

1071
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,583
no!

1072
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,376
No!

1073
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,513
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1074
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,267
You did it!

1075
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,227
Next stop, Andy!

1076
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:04,398
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1077
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,453
I should have held on longer.

1078
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,665
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1079
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,167
Woody!

1080
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,636
Take cover!

1081
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,062
This is the part
where we blow up!

1082
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,563
Not today!

1083
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,369
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'l

1084
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,706
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1085
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,671
To infinity and beyond!

1086
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,929
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1087
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,098
We're not aiming for the truck.

1088
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:26,897
Hey, wow!

1089
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,150
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1090
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,277
<i>Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?</i>

1091
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,446
- Here in the car!
- See?

1092
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,782
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1093
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:49,045
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1094
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,260
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1095
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,637
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1096
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,598
Whoal! It's time!

1097
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,060
Oh, Bo.

1098
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,562
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1099
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,731
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1100
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,276
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1101
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,324
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1102
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,744
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1103
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:22,870
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1104
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:26,665
Molly's first present
is Mrs. Potato Head.

1105
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,751
Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head.

1106
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,920
Way to go, Idaho!

1107
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,047
Gee, I'd better shave.

1108
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,178
Come in, Frankincense.

1109
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,222
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1110
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,141
- It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1111
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,185
- you are not worried, are you?
- I can't quite...

1112
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,686
- Me? No, no.
- Make out...

1113
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,397
No. No, no, no, no.

1114
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,858
A large box... It's...

1115
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,528
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1116
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,824
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1117
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,910
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1118
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,912
Wow! A puppy!

1119
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,222
You've got a friend in me

1120
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:27,560
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,939
When the road looks rough ahead

1122
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:36,902
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1123
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,406
You just remember
what your old pal said

1124
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,242
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1125
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:48,414
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,797
You've got a friend in me

1127
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,593
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:06,307
- You got troubles
- And I got 'em too

1129
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,436
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

1130
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,564
If we stick together
we can see it through

1131
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,942
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1132
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,322
You've got a friend in me

1133
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:27,119
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1134
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,206
Bigger and stronger too

1135
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,373
Maybe

1136
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:37,129
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1137
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,798
It's me and you, boy

1138
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,302
And as the years go by

1139
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,430
Our friendship will never die

1140
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:52,811
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1141
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,857
You've got a friend in me

1142
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,485
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,572
You've got a friend in me
