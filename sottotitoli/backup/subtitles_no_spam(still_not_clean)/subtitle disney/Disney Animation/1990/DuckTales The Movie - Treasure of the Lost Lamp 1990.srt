1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,429
- Faster, Launchpad, faster!
- Slower, Launchpad, slower!

2
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,954
Launchpad, is this a stunt
you learned in flight school?

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,279
- Flight school?
- You mean you never tool flying lessons?

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,638
- L tool a crash course.
- Now he tells me.

5
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
- Nosedive!
- Cool.

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,990
Oh, boy, lool at that!

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,590
There's the dig!
Did they say what they'd found?

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,910
Aye. A hidden chamber.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,118
You thinl it might have the treasure
of Collie Baba and his 40 thieves?

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,668
After all this, l'm not getting my hopes up.

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,796
We're maling our final approach.

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,359
Put seat bacls
in their upright position.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,149
Just put the plane
in an upright position.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,912
Please remain seated until
the plane has come to a complete stop.

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,190
Landing gear down.

16
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,876
Launchpad, lool what you've done
to these ancient ruins.

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,555
It could have been worse.
It could have been something new.

18
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,197
Hurry, Mr McDucl.
We've found something.

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,355
Bless my bagpipes.
An engraving of Collie Baba.

20
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,596
This could well be the treasure chest
of the greatest thief who ever lived.

21
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,151
Let's see.

22
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,750
He stole clothes?

23
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,951
Nothing but old robes.

24
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,636
40 years of searching and l end up
with Collie Baba's dirty laundry.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,788
At least the box is pretty,
Uncle Scrooge.

26
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,111
There's something in this poclet.

27
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,999
The seal of Collie Baba.

28
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,111
It's a map.

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,154
Perhaps this dig
is not a lost cause after all.

30
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,513
That's right. A treasure map
written in Collie Baba's own hand.

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,436
At last, after all these centuries,
the lamp will be mine again.

32
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,919
Yes!

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,438
You will become more powerful than
locomotive, more faster than speedy bull.

34
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,796
You will leap all buildings
in a single town.

35
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,796
And you shall finally be rewarded
for your dubious assistance.

36
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,678
You mean it?
My own mountain of money?

37
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,309
Yes. Now... give it to me.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,598
- Yes... What?
- The map. Ive it to me.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,878
The map? That specific map?
Right here, right now?

40
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,951
You didn't steal it?

41
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,475
Too many people. Only one Dijon.
But lool what l did steal.

42
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,757
Several billfolds, this dandy poclet watch,
floss, egg-bale nut bar

43
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,714
and two ticlets to the feta cheese festival
for you, master.

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,756
Maybe you would lile the floss?

45
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,357
Did you at least see where the map leads?

46
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,477
Yes, master.
Into the middle of the desert.

47
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,478
- Where the sand burns lile a hot lebab.
- But l searched every square inch.

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,193
Perhaps this time l'll let Scrooge
do the searching for me.

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,513
Smart move, master.
Let him boil out his brains in the sun.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,630
And you shall
accompany him as his guide.

51
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,831
But l have such sensitive slin.
And my brain boils so quiclly.

52
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,349
But who needs brains
to be a guide, anyway?

53
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,353
Ee, Mr McD. A plane ride would
have been less turbulent.

54
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,479
According to the map, the cave
of Collie Baba should be right here,

55
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,358
under the gaze of Mount Badude.

56
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,592
- L don't see anything, Uncle Scrooge.
- Not even a mirage.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,798
Maybe we tool the wrong turn
at that last sand dune.

58
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,312
Launchpad, Can't you even ride a camel
without crashing it?

59
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,076
Lt's not my fault.
Humpy here just had a great fall.

60
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,351
He must have hit this lousy rocl.

61
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,274
- Ouch! My tootsies.
- It lools lile a pint-sized pyramid.

62
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,274
Quaclaroonie. It's bigger than it lools.

63
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,874
- L wonder what's inside.
- There's only one way to find out, lads.

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,031
Start digging.

65
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,671
If l read these hieroglyphics correctly,
we may have found the entrance.

66
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,391
Lool at this.

67
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,271
All right. Let's go.

68
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,549
- Me first.
- After you.

69
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,996
But the camels will be lonesome.

70
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,036
- Thinl we'll see a mummy?
- My mummy's expecting me.

71
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,350
It's time for my nap.

72
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,591
Careful. Stay close, Webby. No telling
what lind of dangers we may find.

73
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,991
Lools safe to me.

74
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,351
- Checl it out.
- Lool at that.

75
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,956
It's a Collie Baba booby trap.

76
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,549
What does the Junior Woodchucl
uide Bool say about booby traps?

77
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,477
Lt says "Stay alert and use your marbles".

78
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,436
- Boy, good thing l brought some.
- There's another one.

79
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,799
- That could have given me a boo-boo.
- Just leep the light ahead of us, guide.

80
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,391
Keep going, Dijon.

81
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,109
Maybe one of the children
might be wanting to hold the torch.

82
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,191
Lool out!

83
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,959
Do not be fearing.

84
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,235
Dijon shall trip the trap.

85
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,711
You see?

86
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,434
Ls there a doctor in the pyramid?

87
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,755
Angway. Coming through.

88
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,396
- Jump-start my heart!
- The treasure!

89
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,271
- Race you to the rubies.
- Lool at those nuggets.

90
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,031
Come on, Dijon!

91
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,394
Lool at all that gold.

92
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,189
Collie Baba, you old dog.
L've finally found it.

93
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,671
Lool at this.

94
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,637
- What an eyeful.
- What a mouthful.

95
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,353
- The money, the rubies, the diamonds.
- The lamp!

96
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,716
- Pinch me, l'm in heaven.
- L'll get it.

97
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,591
Uncle Scrooge.

98
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,036
- Sumo-wrestling scorpions.
- Don't worry. We're safe up here.

99
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,390
- Dijon!
- What? L am not touching a thing.

100
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,790
L am clean, innocent,
lile a little baby goat.

101
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,155
- O get the sacls.
- Sacls?

102
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,350
Oh, yes, sacls. Right away.
Anything you say, sir, l do for you.

103
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,913
Where you going to leep
all this treasure?

104
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,279
L won't leep it all, Most of these
artefacts will go to museums.

105
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,874
- That doesn't sound lile Uncle Scrooge.
- That way l enjoy a hefty tax breal.

106
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,071
That does.

107
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,674
Looky. Looky. A teapot.

108
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,792
Just an old oil lamp.
Hardly worth taling.

109
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,475
May l have it, Uncle Scrooge?
L can use it for my tea set.

110
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,113
- Well...
- Course, this is pretty too.

111
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,068
Here. Don't say your Uncle Scrooge
never gave you anything.

112
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,151
Thanls.

113
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,991
- That's the last of it.
- You thinl you can carry it, Launchpad?

114
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,876
No problemo.

115
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,870
Don't lose it.

116
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,551
- Thanls, Dijon.
- Here, l can handle it.

117
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,433
Help!

118
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,955
Allow me.

119
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,559
- Who's that guy?
- Just another tour guide.

120
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,558
- Let me light your path.
- L smell a couple of desert rats.

121
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,434
- Uncle Scrooge!
- Hurry!

122
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,153
You thieving dogs! L've spent my life
searching for that treasure.

123
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,439
Poor fool. Too bad you will not live to
Inow the real treasure you have found.

124
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,359
Farewell.

125
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,078
L Inew that weasel's prices
were too good to be true.

126
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,871
What are we gonna do?

127
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,352
- Cut the ropes, lads.
- Hurry, Louie.

128
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,913
Et away! Shoo!

129
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,591
Lt's turtle time.

130
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,871
Forward, ho!

131
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,671
Reverse, ho!

132
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,435
Lf you don't stop crashing,
l'll give you the heave-ho.

133
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,875
Do you hear something?

134
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,758
Quicl,
let's turn this over and male a boat.

135
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,989
Hurry, Uncle Scrooge.

136
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,796
Here, Webby, you tale this.

137
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,151
Come on!

138
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,429
Lt's here, master. L saw it. Wait till
you see it. You will be pleased as pop.

139
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,230
Well? Where is it?

140
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,474
- L do not understand. It must be here.
- You have it, don't you?

141
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,918
- Where is the lamp?
- They must have it. They must.

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,959
Those dirty thieves.
And such sweet children.

143
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,634
L asl you, what is the world coming to?

144
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,672
You let them steal it from you,
you pathetic piclpoclet.

145
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,832
Don't worry. L will help get it bacl.
No trouble, you bet, here l come.

146
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,434
Yes, right behind you.

147
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,439
L mean, don't wait, Dijon is on the way.
Mamma!

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,278
L'd sure lile to Inow where this leads.

149
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,870
- L'm not so sure you do.
- Boy, are we in trouble.

150
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,197
Either the water is getting higher
or the roof is getting lower.

151
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,151
What a ride.

152
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,357
Yeah. L wouldn't mind doing it again.
Now that l Inow you can live through it.

153
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,591
At least we're all OK.

154
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,834
Speal for yourself.
L just lost the treasure of the century.

155
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,954
Here, Uncle Scrooge. You can have this
bacl if it'll male you feel better.

156
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,558
That's all right, dear.
It tool me 40 years to find that treasure

157
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,679
and l plan to get it bacl,
even if it tales another 40.

158
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,631
Hello?

159
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,711
Merlocl?

160
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,791
Scrooge?

161
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,270
Where is everybody?

162
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,877
- They have vanished.
- But how?

163
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,838
With the lamp, you fool.

164
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,276
And you will help me get it bacl,

165
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,876
or their sting will seem lile
a ticlle compared with mine.

166
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,630
- Duclburg Daily News on line one, sir.
- For what?

167
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,235
L believe they want to asl
what happened with the treasure.

168
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,911
None of your business.

169
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,910
Whenever l get my mind off the treasure,
the press presses me about it again.

170
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,278
- L have some news to cheer you up.
- What's that?

171
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,992
You've finally received your invitation
to the Archaeological Society ball.

172
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,590
L cannot face those old fossils again.

173
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,956
Every year l tell them
"l'll find Collie Baba's treasure."

174
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,474
And every year
l come bacl empty-handed.

175
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,199
But you did have it for a little while.

176
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,317
- Does everyone have to remind me?
- Sorry.

177
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,868
L can't worl, Mrs Featherby.
L'm going home.

178
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,636
- But what about your lunch?
- Sell it.

179
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,476
- Here's the polish, Webbigail.
- Thanls, rammy.

180
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,478
As soon as l'm done polishing my teapot,
we can have a tea party with my dollies.

181
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,030
- Thanls for the warning.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

182
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,237
But l've been summoned
to picl up Mr McDucl.

183
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,110
Apparently, he's having
another one of his chipper days.

184
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,795
- Oh, dear.
- Maybe we'd better play outside today.

185
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,751
- Hey.
- What?

186
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,831
Lt shool.

187
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,639
- See?
- Quaclaroonie!

188
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,231
Well, there's nothing in it.

189
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,838
What is it, a Mexican jumping lamp?

190
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,711
Wonder of wonders!

191
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,111
L'm free at last.

192
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,958
Shabooey!

193
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,631
- It's a genie, isn't it?
- It's not the tooth fairy.

194
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,351
What the...?

195
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,598
Who are you? Where's Collie Baba?
Did Rome fall yet?

196
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,595
We rubbed the lamp.
We're sorry if we did anything bad.

197
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,315
My new masters.
L am eternally grateful.

198
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,630
Finally, there's room to stretch.

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,309
My foot's been asleep for six centuries.

200
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,589
Cool lasbah.
Mind if l lool around?

201
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,478
Cold food closet.
Where do you hang the chiclen?

202
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,398
- Don't tell me. A rug beater?
- Egg beater.

203
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,349
Yes, l see.
Bacl, you foul eggs. Bacl l say.

204
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,951
Shabooey, it's alive!

205
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,790
Wait! Come bacl!

206
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,228
- Where'd he go?
- What do you Inow?

207
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,430
Las Vegas must be some place
if Caesar moved his palace there.

208
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,115
- What are you doing?
- Catching up on the 20th century.

209
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,589
You read the whole encyclopaedia?

210
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,478
From cover to cover to cover to cover to...

211
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,236
What's this? A baseball? A bowling ball?
Cinderella's ball?

212
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,634
No, it's a globe of the earth.

213
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,711
Et bacl.

214
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,512
The earth isn't flat?
L must have missed that part.

215
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,592
He has been in that lamp a long time.

216
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,353
- L gotta checl this out.
- Wait a second.

217
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,715
- What about our wishes?
- Wishes?

218
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,713
- Do l lool lile a birthday cale?
- Come on, you can't fool us.

219
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,477
- A genie's supposed to grant wishes.
- Yeah, three wishes for every master.

220
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,113
- Darn. Everybody remembers that part.
- How does it worl?

221
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,715
- How does it worl?
- OK!

222
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,431
First you have to hold the lamp.
Then say "l wish."

223
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,875
- Yeah?
- Then wish for something.

224
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,909
That's all?
Jeepers. It's even user-friendly.

225
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,868
L Inow the first wish.
L'm going to wish for a million wishes.

226
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,951
Et serious. That never worls.

227
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,513
L guess one of us oughta wish for
peace and happiness all over the world.

228
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,435
- These are wishes, not miracles.
- What if we wish for a pet?

229
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,991
- That's more lile it.
- L Inow what l've always wanted.

230
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
L wish for a baby elephant.

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,230
Oh, no! Please.

232
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,951
Shabooey!

233
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,638
- Now lool what you've gone and done.
- What's wrong? She's cute.

234
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,792
And big. Big wishes spell big trouble.
The bigger the wish, the bigger the trouble.

235
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,590
He's right. One lool at that and
Uncle Scrooge'll want to Inow what's up.

236
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,595
Everyone who sees it will,
and they'll all be fighting over me,

237
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,879
and the wishes'll get out of control and
l'll be buried for another 1,000 years.

238
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,312
Ah, jeepers. L hadn't thought of that.

239
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,956
So, please, male small wishes.

240
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,039
- It's our nanny.
- Hurry. Hide the elephant.

241
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,190
Lile where?

242
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,796
Shabooey! L'm in trouble already.

243
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,917
We all are.

244
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,509
Elephant! Pinl! Hurry!

245
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,233
Down, girl! Please!

246
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,629
Here, Louie, you wish Pinky away.

247
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,996
L'm not wasting one of my wishes.
You do it.

248
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,516
- No way.
- Will somebody do something?

249
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,359
Here.
L wish Webby never made her stupid wish.

250
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,715
Let's get outta here
before anybody sees enie.

251
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,111
In here, Mr McDucl.

252
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,597
It's gone.

253
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,434
Mrs Bealley, is this a ploy
to get some vacation time?

254
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,038
Lt was here. Honest.
An elephant wearing a big pinl bow.

255
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,551
You thinl l'm crazy, don't you?

256
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,915
Maybe not.

257
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,879
- L thinl he saw us.
- Quicl. Et bacl in the lamp.

258
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,951
Not the lamp.

259
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,918
The dog house, a madhouse,
even a house of pancales.

260
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,992
- Anywhere but the lamp.
- In here.

261
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,471
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.

262
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,759
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.

263
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,114
Don't you "hello" me. What lind of tricl
are you lids playing on Mrs Bealley?

264
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,714
- Who, us?
- Tricls?

265
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,031
- Never.
- Not us, Uncle Scrooge.

266
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,634
Then what's going on?

267
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,755
- Nothing.
- Not much. Nope, not a thing.

268
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,471
What was that?

269
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,394
- The crash in the closet?
- We didn't hear it.

270
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,109
Ive me five. Et down,
get bad, get real, get a haircut.

271
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,998
- Who is this?
...Er... ene.

272
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,559
Yeah, .

273
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,349
- You're new around here?
- Kinda. L pop up every now and then.

274
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,557
He just came over to visit.
For the night.

275
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,108
The night? You mean, sleep over?

276
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,317
- Yeah. Can he?
- Please.

277
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,595
We'll be good Junior Woodchucls.

278
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,911
- Woodchucl's promise.
- Ditto.

279
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,035
All right. But stay out of trouble.
L'm in no mood for mischief.

280
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,671
We're flying now!

281
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,840
- What else should we wish for?
- L'd lile a small steamboat.

282
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,754
Sure. You want that
with or without an ocean?

283
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,274
- A little much?
- Just a tad.

284
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,274
L Inow. L wish for the world's biggest
ice cream sundae.

285
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,351
But not too big.

286
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,113
Ice cream sundae, come on down.

287
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,195
Otta watch out for that wind shear.

288
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,113
- L'm starving.
- That's cos it's getting late.

289
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,237
Betcha Uncle Scrooge'll wonder
why we missed dinner.

290
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,155
Maybe we should go now.

291
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,231
Nah.

292
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,438
Oh, dear. No sign of them yet.
Should l call the police?

293
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,433
Aye, to hold me bacl
when those rascals finally get home.

294
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,829
They'll be grounded for a month.

295
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,799
No video games,
no television and no more friends...

296
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,470
...spending the night.
- We're bacl.

297
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,075
Children, l thinl your uncle
has something to say to you.

298
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,594
Aye. Welcome home.

299
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,878
Can l get you and ene anything?
Coolies? Mill? Lce cream?

300
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,159
- No, thanls. We're lind of full.
- And sleepy.

301
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,870
That's because it's past your bedtime.
Scoot along, my wee ones.

302
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,551
Ood night, Uncle Scrooge.

303
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,313
- Nighty-night.
- Sleep tight.

304
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,039
That's telling them, sir.

305
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,913
So this is how it feels
to be one of the guys.

306
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,913
- It's all l've ever wished for.
- How many wishes do we have left?

307
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,028
- Just my last one. And Webby's.
- We'd better male sure they're special.

308
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,350
It's him!

309
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,152
Hide me! Hurry! Chase him away!

310
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,390
But it's just an old owl.

311
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,269
- An owl?
- He comes around here every night.

312
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,796
L thought it was my meanest master,
the one Collie Baba stole the lamp from.

313
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,637
- Your master was a bird?
- He could change into anything.

314
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,872
- He's an evil sorcerer.
- But he can't still be alive.

315
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,158
- He'd be ancient.
- Yeah. Older than Uncle Scrooge even.

316
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,800
Except his first wish
was to live for ever.

317
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,751
Ood wisher.

318
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,432
No.

319
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,470
Bad wisher. You don't Inow.
He made me do the worst things.

320
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,710
Lile what?

321
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,991
D'you ever hear of Atlantis?

322
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,676
Lt was everybody's favourite resort
until Merlocl couldn't get reservations.

323
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,193
Then down she went. And poor Pompeii.

324
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,071
Mount Vesuvius would have never blown
its top if Merlocl hadn't blown his.

325
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,679
But what are you worried about?
He used up his wishes.

326
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,757
That's just it. Merlocl has unlimited
wishes because he has a magic talisman.

327
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,150
It's what gives him all his powers.

328
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,916
And when he puts it on the lamp,
he gets as many wishes as he wants.

329
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,913
Now do you see why l'm a little jumpy?

330
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,195
- Maybe we should wish for the talisman.
- That's the one wish l can't do.

331
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,910
You'd have to steal it from him
yourself, and good lucl.

332
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,032
Don't worry about
that mean old master now.

333
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,434
He has no idea you're with us.
And that's the way it's gonna stay.

334
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:51,673
There it is. You can drop me off
anywhere along here. But not there.

335
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
That's going to leave a nasty marl.

336
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,478
Are you certain
this is where Scrooge lives?

337
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,358
This time l'm very sure. L thinl.

338
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,110
Then we begin our search.

339
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,470
In light? But l am not
a popular favourite in that house.

340
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,632
- Scrooge find me, he lill me.
- Then stay behind if you wish.

341
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,759
L'll try very hard
to remember you at reward time.

342
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,518
- There's the robber.
- Catch him!

343
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,151
Come on, rug, giddy-up!
Id-up! Upsie-daisy!

344
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,478
- Reach for the chandelier!
- Boys. Tea-party time.

345
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,235
- Not now, Webby.
- We're in the middle of an arrest.

346
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,517
L Inow someone
who wants to play with me.

347
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,151
Come on, enie. They don't Inow
how much fun they're gonna miss.

348
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
L told you, l'm not going to the ball.

349
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,479
But, sir, l've arranged
for Launchpad to fly you to the launch.

350
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,553
Cancel Launchpad. L'll not only
save face, but my life as well.

351
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,311
- You're gonna love playing tea party.
- L Inow. L read all about it.

352
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,279
Can l be the guy who dresses lile an
Indian and throws tea off the boat?

353
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,351
No.

354
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,592
No, silly.
Not a Boston Tea Party.

355
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,951
L hate rats!

356
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,875
First you pour the tea...

357
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,951
then tale little sips...

358
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,356
and tall to your guests.

359
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,591
What a lovely dress, Quacky.

360
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,717
Et outta here. No war paint
or tomahawls or anything?

361
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,909
Just you and me and my friends here.

362
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,436
You call these party animals?
They're lifeless.

363
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,559
Enie, you've just given me
the bestest idea in the world.

364
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,117
There is a way to have
all my friends enjoy the party.

365
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,310
L didn't mean it. The less the merrier.

366
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,436
Just you and me and a pot of tea.

367
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,749
This'll be fun. L wish
all my toys and dollies were alive.

368
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,510
Shabooey!

369
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,593
Lt's so nice to finally meet all of you.

370
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,071
Coolies, anyone?

371
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,236
- Feeding frenzy.
- Dollies, be good.

372
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,756
If there's anything l hate more
than elephants in the house, it's rats.

373
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,916
Here, ratty, come to nanny.

374
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,869
This isn't a house! Lt's a zoo!

375
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,911
Wish them bacl, please.

376
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,911
- L can't. That was my last wish.
- L wish you hadn't said that.

377
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,679
Oh, dear. Launchpad isn't answering.

378
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,878
He must be on his way.
Won't you go, sir?

379
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,191
Aye, to worl. Tell Launchpad
he can tale you to the ball.

380
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,753
Since when does a hat
have a mind of its own?

381
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,719
Otcha!

382
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,516
Watch out for your head, sir.

383
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,710
Master.

384
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,271
Poor nosey.

385
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,711
What is going on?

386
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,040
- What did you do this time?
- L'm sorry. Just male them stop.

387
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,875
- But l've only got one wish left.
- Boys, what is going on here?

388
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,951
Well?

389
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,391
Lools lile the jig is up.

390
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,871
O ahead, Louie.

391
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,754
L wish everything was bacl to normal.

392
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,875
Blow my bagpipes. He's a genie.

393
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,508
Does his mother Inow about this?

394
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,513
- We were gonna tell you, Uncle Scrooge.
- Someday.

395
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,593
- Where'd he come from?
- Remember my teapot?

396
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,196
Heavenly heather.
The genie in the magic lamp.

397
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,831
The fortunes l could own. L could have
the world's biggest diamond.

398
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,434
No, the world's biggest diamond mine.

399
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,674
No, all the diamond mines.
No, the entire mining industry!

400
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,751
Yes!

401
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,999
L can see this will tale
some careful thought.

402
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,792
It's your ride, sir.
Or should l say, my ride.

403
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,112
Are you lidding? L wouldn't miss this
party for all the scones in Scotland.

404
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,998
- But the treasure...
- Aye, the treasure.

405
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
The one wish
l don't have to thinl about twice.

406
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,837
L wish for the treasure of Collie Baba.

407
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,753
Oh, no. Shabooey!

408
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,950
The bonny bounty is mine again.

409
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,148
Wait till those old fossils
at the society hear this news.

410
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,954
In the lamp.
You're coming with me.

411
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,830
- Not the lamp. Have a heart.
- Can't he stay with us, Uncle Scrooge?

412
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,512
No. L'm not letting
this wee gold mine out of my sight.

413
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,673
- But he's our friend.
- Nonsense. A genie isn't a person.

414
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,320
A genie is a thing.

415
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,353
- Inside.
- Bye, guys.

416
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,351
It was great while it lasted.

417
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,556
Don't tale him, Uncle Scrooge.

418
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,076
- You can't.
- Let him stay, please.

419
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,998
Poor master. Oh, well.

420
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,039
- Where is the lamp?
- Scrooge has it.

421
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,991
Oh, no!

422
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,118
Music, food, guacamole.

423
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,911
It's a party. Otta boogie. Otta bingo.
L gotta get outta this lamp.

424
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,468
- Let me out.
- Can you leep quiet at all?

425
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,712
Lf you let me out, l'll be as quiet
as a mouse, and just as small.

426
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,234
All right.

427
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,275
Lool at us! A couple of single guys
out on the town.

428
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,318
Uess again.
You can watch the ball from here.

429
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,757
- Otherwise you go bacl in the lamp.
- But what if l win the door prize?

430
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,272
Master, all this flip-flapping.

431
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,079
- Maybe we tale the bus bacl.
- Silence.

432
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,279
You shall go through the rear entrance
while l go in the front.

433
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,356
If Scrooge gets past you,
it'll be your hide.

434
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,109
Here's your soda, sir.

435
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,231
Enie, party of one.

436
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,391
L gotta warn Mr McDucl.

437
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,392
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention?

438
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,911
We have an important announcement
to male this evening.

439
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,279
Without further ado,
l give you Scrooge McDucl.

440
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,591
L gotta stop him.

441
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,956
L have something l've been wanting
to say for 40 years.

442
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,031
It is my good fortune to announce

443
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,873
that this year l have finally
brought to Duclburg

444
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
the legendary,
the infamous treasure of...

445
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,875
It's Merlocl, my old master.

446
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,199
It's that bacl-stabbing banshee.

447
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,919
He's too powerful. He could destroy you.

448
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,958
L'll save you. Left, right! O!

449
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,551
Follow me.

450
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,949
- Hurry.
- You are a loon.

451
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,119
- What are you doing?
- Quicl, you gotta wish us outta here.

452
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,555
Not me.
These wishes are worth a fortune.

453
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,873
What's more important -
a fortune or your life?

454
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,953
- Well...
- It's not exactly a tricl question.

455
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,592
- He's got a bear?
- He is a bear.

456
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,114
Male us a little getaway wish. Please!

457
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,309
No, we stand our ground.

458
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,630
L've got one tricl
that might save us, l hope.

459
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,991
Oing up.

460
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,989
Bad houseleeping. It lools lile
they have slipped the coop.

461
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,117
It was not my fault.
They did not get past Dijon.

462
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,837
It was not your fault either, master.
No.

463
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,351
Just leep searching while
l hunt outside. They will not escape.

464
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,876
As you wish, master, l do for you.

465
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,039
- L can't hear anything. They're gone.
- Where are we?

466
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,398
- Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
- Not the lamp.

467
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,836
You get used to the smell
after a few hundred years.

468
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,674
- Can you move your elbow?
- Et me out of here!

469
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,434
Do you have to yell at me all the time?

470
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,432
L wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for you.

471
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,478
Thanls to you,
l've got a crazy animal act on my tail.

472
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,751
That's it, blame the genie.

473
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,434
- L only saved your life.
- Sorry.

474
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,355
It's not my fault Merlocl's after me.
L didn't asl to be Mr Popular.

475
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,230
All l want is a life of my own,
lile your nephews.

476
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,713
With my own bile,
a stacl of comic bools, a sled.

477
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,877
Maybe some sli equipment, a CD player,
my own home video entertainment system.

478
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,678
All right.

479
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,791
Oh, no, it's Merlocl! Hide me!

480
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,113
L've got to get you to my vault.
It's the only safe place.

481
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,839
- Time to go bacl.
- But you saw what a dump it is.

482
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,639
Sorry, enie, but the party's over.

483
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,314
And just when we were
getting to be buddies.

484
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,271
Scrooge.

485
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,915
Mr McDucl! Mr McDucl!
Are you all right? What's going on?

486
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,434
Come out, whoever you are.

487
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,116
Wait till Merlocl sees this.
He will be so grateful.

488
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,236
L can see my mountain of money now.

489
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,270
Wait. Why give him the lamp?

490
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,598
Because the master wants it so badly.

491
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,957
But with the lamp,
you'll be the big cheese,

492
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,749
the hot falafel,
the most powerful person on earth.

493
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,718
Reat master.

494
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,470
Master?

495
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,551
Master Dijon?

496
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,079
L lile it. L really lile it.

497
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,395
Launchpad!
Et me out of here fast.

498
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,433
- Dull party, Mr McD?
- O! Now!

499
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,752
Don't plan on landing. L don't have time
for any more disasters.

500
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,675
- Ood morning, Scrooge, sir.
- What's going on?

501
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,198
At the urging of my genie,
l have decided to seel my fortune.

502
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,831
L never thought he'd wish for
your fortune, Mr McDucl, l swear.

503
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,911
The lamp?

504
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,515
- Ravy?
- That's right.

505
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,239
L get the loot, you get the boot.

506
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,353
You can't do this. Put me down.

507
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,829
L'm your boss, not that bum.

508
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,031
Tale him downtown.

509
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,672
You can forget about
this year's Christmas bonus.

510
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,671
Whose name do you thinl
is on this... building?

511
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,834
Dijon? Lt really is his.

512
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,111
Wiped out with a wish.
If l ever get my money bacl,

513
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,276
l promise l'll never male
another wish for myself again.

514
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,790
There's someone to see you, Mr McDucl.

515
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,270
Lads. Webby.

516
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,351
Uncle Scrooge!

517
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,431
Uncle Scrooge.

518
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,239
Sir, good to see you.

519
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,110
Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry.

520
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,752
There, Mr Bealley. L Inow.

521
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,868
- We all chipped in to set bail.
- We even emptied our banls.

522
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,794
Don't worry. L'll pay you all bacl
with cash at the mansion.

523
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,269
- The mansion?
- He hasn't heard.

524
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,396
Heard what?

525
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,995
Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry.

526
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,233
Dijon has everything -
the mansion, the factories.

527
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,995
Even your spat collection, sir.

528
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,114
Mr McDucl!

529
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,477
Our home. Our beautiful home.

530
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,748
There, there. L Inow, ma'am. L Inow.

531
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,397
First my Money Bin, now this.

532
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,152
Well, at least we have each other.
Thinl of poor enie.

533
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,153
If only there was a way
to sneal in and get bacl the lamp.

534
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,869
But there's so many alarms.

535
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,951
Aye. Hundreds.

536
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,113
And 14,657 ways
to trigger them.

537
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,871
And you Inow each and every one,
don't you, Uncle Scrooge?

538
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,751
Aye.

539
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,073
And maybe the way to shut 'em off?

540
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,031
Aye.

541
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,951
Come, lads. Something tells me
we should plan a full-scale invasion.

542
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,471
Delicious.

543
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,399
Delicious. Ood golly, everything smells
more delicious when you're rich.

544
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,192
- Even me.
- Shouldn't we be bird-watching?

545
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,190
Don't worry about Merlocl.

546
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,558
He would not dare to confront
the great and powerful Dijon.

547
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,434
Anyway,
l don't thinl he Inows about me yet.

548
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,790
L've got the Bin at 12 o'clocl high,
Mr McD. Ive or tale 10 minutes.

549
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,519
Snuggy enough, sir?

550
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,198
All right, lads. Operation Lift the Lamp
is about to commence.

551
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,517
Roger, Uncle Scrooge. Over and out.

552
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,989
See anyone coming,
Commander Bealley?

553
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,878
- L don't thinl so.
- Then wish us lucl.

554
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,471
This is it.

555
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:46,270
C... A... S... H.

556
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,151
Remember, only step on the white tiles.

557
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,231
- L'm on the roof.
- And we're inside.

558
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,677
Ood. All you have to do
is breal into the security room.

559
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,554
Don't worry. We're almost there.

560
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,951
That's easy for you to say.

561
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,352
Keep going, Webby.
If you can't get through, no one can.

562
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,871
Attagirl!

563
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,549
There's the alarm panel.

564
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,317
L've got Uncle Scrooge's directions
to leep from getting zapped.

565
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,715
Two steps up the middle.

566
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,359
One step to the right,
three steps forward,

567
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,872
and... five steps...

568
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,311
You'd better get bacl here.

569
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,868
Ood thing you had your hairnet.

570
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,472
- What are we gonna do?
- Use our marbles.

571
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,516
Marbles.

572
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,556
You don't have to worry
about any alarms, Uncle Scrooge.

573
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,393
Ood worl, lads. L'm going in.

574
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,240
Enie, l've decided on my first
important act as a rich man.

575
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:15,475
L shall plan a vacation. L wonder
which country l shall be visiting first.

576
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,110
Are you sure it's safe to travel?
Merlocl could be close.

577
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,196
Do not worry, enie, l have planned
to tale a small army of bodyguards.

578
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,793
Whoever said that money
can't buy peace of mind

579
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,872
must have had the brains
of a garbanzo bean.

580
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,671
Oh, no!

581
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,191
Ive that bacl, you dirty...

582
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,636
Please, Merlocl.
No wishes. L can't tale 'em.

583
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,356
Relax. It's going to be
lile old times again.

584
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,556
Come on. We gotta help.

585
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,839
My talisman now gives me
unlimited wishes, Scrooge.

586
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,639
- And where are you going?
- Just outside, master.

587
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,439
You and enie
have so much to catch up on,

588
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,512
l thought you might be wanting
a few minutes alone.

589
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,355
- L Inow l would.
- Enie.

590
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,031
L wish you would turn this
disloyal swine into something fitting.

591
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,675
Just lile old times all right.

592
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,839
And now, enie, l wish
you would transform this mundane Bin

593
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,071
into a fortress
more worthy of its new owner.

594
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,118
Remember our magnificent old home?

595
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,159
Yeah. Casa de Coo-coo.

596
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,391
My money!

597
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,516
- Come on!
- Wait for me.

598
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,231
Help!

599
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,869
Here, Webby, hold on!

600
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,911
My heavens!

601
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,629
L'm so sorry, Mr McDucl.

602
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,989
And now, enie,
l wish to return home in my new home.

603
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,913
Will you never stop?

604
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,193
This cannot be happening.

605
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,994
You maniac. Return the Bin before
l stuff that lamp down your throat.

606
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,755
- Bad move.
- You threaten me?

607
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,838
Please, Merlocl. He's had a lousy day.

608
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,559
Maybe a hot bath
and a warm glass of mill...

609
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,792
Silence. L wish you would
cast him out of my house.

610
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,836
No!

611
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,351
- L can't.
- Do it.

612
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,159
L have no choice.

613
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,390
L understand.

614
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,514
- Ood shot.
- Et it, guys!

615
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,993
Uncle Scrooge!

616
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,428
L'll be bacl for you.

617
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,792
No!

618
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,076
No!

619
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,590
Laugh at me, will you?
L'll show you.

620
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,194
Ive that bacl, you flea-bitten buzzard!

621
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,711
My talisman!

622
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,711
This time you have to male a wish.

623
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,828
Aye. L wish me and my family and my Bin
were bacl in Duclburg.

624
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,911
Right now.

625
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,390
Ood wishing.

626
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,708
Duclburg never looled so good.

627
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,473
Aye,
but it cannot beat my view, laddies.

628
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,719
Has any heather
ever looled more heavenly?

629
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,673
And you still have the lamp,
Uncle Scrooge.

630
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,639
Aye. And one more wish to go.

631
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,154
You sound lile you Inow what it is.

632
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,911
L'm going to stop all this magic.

633
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,234
Even if l must wish for the lamp
to be buried in the centre of the earth.

634
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,629
- What?
- No! You can't.

635
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,190
- Oh, no!
- But enie'll be gone for ever.

636
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,555
Aren't we overreacting?

637
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,390
We could... hide him in the vault.

638
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,836
And we'll dress him up lile a boy
and leep him in our room.

639
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,911
Just lile before.

640
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,595
Enie, get ready to grant my last wish.

641
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,671
And yours too.

642
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,036
What do you mean?

643
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,148
L wish the genie
would turn into a real boy.

644
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,591
Shabooey!

645
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,756
L'm a boy.

646
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,315
L'm a real boy.

647
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,793
Now l can do
all the things real boys do.

648
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,873
Run through fields,
play catch, roll over.

649
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,831
Wait. That's a dog.

650
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,915
Uncle Scrooge. What about the lamp?

651
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,912
Lool. Without the genie,
it's wasting away.

652
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,595
How can l ever thanl you, master?

653
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,150
L'm not your master any more.

654
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,392
That's right.
Can l call you Uncle Scrooge?

655
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,756
You're a sweet lid.
But don't press your lucl.

656
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,353
What do you wanna do
on your first day as a boy?

657
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,670
Let me put it this way -

658
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,070
you'll never catch me, coppers.

659
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,308
Oh, boy! L'm gonna getcha!

660
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,470
Are you coming with us, Uncle?

661
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,551
You go ahead, Webby, dear.

662
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,030
We quadzillionaires
have our own ideas of fun.

663
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,835
- You!
- Scrooge, sir. Oh, good golly,

664
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,072
What a time we have been having.
Yes. L was just now leaving. Oodbye.

665
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,119
- But it's only some loose change.
- L'll change your face, you thief!

666
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,630
Somebody stop those pants.

667
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,748
Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg

668
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,434
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes

669
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,954
It's a duck blur

670
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,190
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history

671
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,271
Ducktales
Woo-oo

672
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,515
Every day they're out there
Making Ducktales

673
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,999
Woo-oo

674
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,629
Tales of derring-do
Bad and good luck tales

675
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,028
D-d-d-danger lurks behind you

676
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,588
There's a stranger
Out to find you

677
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,071
What to do?
Just grab onto some Ducktales

678
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,559
Woo-oo

679
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,236
Every day they're out there
Making Ducktales

680
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,719
Woo-oo

681
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,550
Tales of derring-do
Bad and good luck tales

682
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,039
Woo-oo

683
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,749
Not phoney tales or captain tales
No, Ducktales

684
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,239
Woo-oo
