That's him, all right. The old sea dog.

Captain John Smith. I've heard

- Come on, come on!
- Do your best!

26
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,557
Watch out!

27
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:07,824
Faster! She's taking on more water!

28
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,890
Look out!

29
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,757
John! Get down here!

30
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:22,690
The cannons are breaking loose!

31
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,141
- Reef the topsails! 
- Yes, sir!

32
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,581
Steady on your course.

33
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:32,624
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.

34
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,024
Say your prayers, men!

35
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:46,290
Thomas, watch it!

36
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,490
Help!

37
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:54,690
- Man overboard!
- Help!

38
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:57,890
- Stay your course! He's lost!
- Help!

39
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,824
- Pull the pins!
- Aye, sir!

40
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:08,090
Smith! Smith!

41
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,557
Are you crazy?

42
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,690
Hang on, Thomas! I've got you!

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,824
Quick! The rope!

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,890
Heave!

45
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,957
Come on, lads! Pull!

46
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,757
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

47
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,557
- Put your back into it!
- Pull!

48
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,824
- Pull!
- Hang on!

49
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,890
There, my lucky lads.

50
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,557
Well, that was refreshing.

51
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,690
Well done, Smith.

52
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:55,424
Of course, you'd all
do the same for me.

53
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:57,866
- Oh, sure, sure. Of course we would.
- Sure, yes. Yeah, we would.

54
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,824
Absolutely!

55
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:04,824
- Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe.

56
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,150
Thomas fell overboard, sir.

57
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,648
Thank heavens he's been
successfully retrieved.

58
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,957
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

59
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,224
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be
long before we reach the New World.

60
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,757
And remember what awaits us there.

61
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,824
Freedom, prosperity...

62
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,157
the adventure of our lives.

63
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:27,623
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing...

64
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:31,090
Not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages...

65
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,090
Shall stand in our way.

66
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,157
Carry on, men!

67
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,557
A stirring oration, sir.

68
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:41,557
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated.

69
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:47,290
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless
peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?

70
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,289
This New World's gonna be great, John.

71
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,224
I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house...

72
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:58,557
and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him.

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,224
You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas.

74
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,514
Leave the savages to me.

75
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,556
You think they'll give us much trouble?

76
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:07,690
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

77
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,024
We'll kill ourselves an Injun.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,957
Or maybe two or three.

79
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:18,090
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company.

80
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,424
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

81
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,757
Like all the others, I suppose.

82
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,024
I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas.

83
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,824

99

With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

100
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:37,890
Your return has brought
much joy to the village.

101
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,090
Look at all the smiling faces.

102
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,824
Yes, but there's one
smiling face I don't see.

103
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:48,223
- Where is my daughter?
- You know Pocahontas.

104
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,357
She has her mother's spirit.

105
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:52,957
She goes wherever the wind takes her.

106
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,757
Pocahontas!

107
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:19,024
Your father's back! Come down here!

108
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,224
He's back, Flit.

109
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:26,690
Come on, Meeko!

110
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,490
No! Not that way.

111
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,624
Show-off.

112
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,757
Uh-oh!

113
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,224
Pocahontas?

114
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,690
Pocahontas! Are you all right?

115
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,624
Well, you better be all right
because I'm not coming in after you!

116
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,424
Don't you think we're getting a...
A little old for these games?

117
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,624
Help me turn this thing over.

118
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:46,890
- What were you doing up there?
- Thinking.

119
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,107
Meeko!

120
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:51,381
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?

121
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,157
I know it means something.
I just don't know what.

122
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,224
You should ask your father about it.

123
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:59,024
Maybe I should. Come on, Flit.

124
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:03,024
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

125
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:09,023
Faced a determined enemy.

126
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:14,023
The battle lasted from the rising of the
sun until the evening shadows fell.

127
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:19,024
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum...

128
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,090
for he attacked with the
fierce strength of the bear.

129
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,451
He has proven himself to be
the greatest of warriors...

130
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,581
Oh, he is so handsome.

131
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,800
- And the finest among us...
- Hmph. I especially love his smile.

132
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,890
Destroying every enemy in his path.

133
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,557
Tonight we will feast in his honour.

134
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,157
- My daughter.
- Wing-gapa-o, Father.

135
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,824
Seeing you gives me great joy.

136
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,357
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

137
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,557
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

138
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:50,157
I want to hear everything
you've been doing.

139
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:58,889
Father, for many nights now
I've been having a very strange dream.

140
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,557
I think it's telling me something's
about to happen. Something exciting.

141
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,824
Yes, something exciting
is about to happen.

142
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,312
Really? What is it?

143
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:12,114
Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage.

144
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,957
Marry Kocoum?

145
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,957
I told him it would make my heart soar.

146
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,157
But he's so serious.

147
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,224
My daughter, Kocoum will
make a fine husband.

148
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,757
He is loyal and strong and will build
you a good house with sturdy walls.

149
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,757
With him, you will be safe from harm.

150
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:38,757
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.

151
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:43,490
- This is the right path for you.
- But why can't I choose...

152
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,224
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.

153
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,824
It is time to take your
place among our people.

154
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,224
Even the wild mountain stream...

155
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,624

Is that my Pocahontas?

200
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,824
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

201
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:42,424
Good morning, child.

202
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,023
I was hoping you'd visit today.

203
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:48,290
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!

204
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:51,090
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

205
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,224
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

206
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:56,824
Kocoum? But he's so serious.

207
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,824
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.

208
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,824
But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's...

209
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,290
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it.

210
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:12,690
Quiet!

211
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,290
Quiet!

212
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,224
Now, child, you were saying.

213
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,024
Well, I'm running through the woods...

214
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,690
and then, right there in
front of me, is an arrow.

215
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:30,224
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

216
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,024
A spinning arrow. How unusual.

217
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,424
Yes. It spins faster and faster and
faster until suddenly it stops.

218
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:45,090
Hmm. Well, it seems to me...

219
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:48,690
this spinning arrow is
pointing you down your path.

220
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:52,024
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

221
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,957
How am I ever going to find it?

222
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:58,557
Your mother asked me the
very same question.

223
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,024
She did? What did you tell her?

224
00:17:01,157 --> 00:17:04,090
I told her to listen.

225
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,090
All around you are spirits, child.

226
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:12,290
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.

227
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:16,090
If you listen, they will guide you.

228
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,824
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

229
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,290
What is it telling you?

230
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,557
I don't understand.

00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,557

240
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,490
Clouds. Strange clouds.

241
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:20,357
Look at it, Wiggins. An entire
new world chock full of gold...

242
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:22,490
just waiting for me.

243
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:26,890
And scores of adventures waiting for us.
Right, Percy?

244
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,890
- Do you think we'll meet some savages?
- If we do, we shall be sure...

245
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,418
to give them a proper English greeting.

246
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,781
Ooh, gift baskets.

247
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:38,090
Oh, no. And he came so
highly recommended.

248
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,824
It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep
enough. We can pull right up to shore.

249
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,024
Hey there, Percy.

250
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,624
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

251
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,690
I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go.

252
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,690
About the natives, I'm
counting on you...

253
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:57,890
to make sure those filthy heathens
don't disrupt our mission.

254
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,218
Well, if they're anything
like the savages I've

255
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,314
fought before, it's
nothing I can't handle.

256
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:05,490
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

257
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,890
See you, Percy.

258
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,024
The men like Smith, don't they?

259
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,424
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.

260
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,424
And don't think I don't know what those
back stabbers at court say about me.

261
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,309
Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic

262
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,089
social climber who's
failed at everything...

263
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,924
He's tried.

264
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,448
I'm very well aware that this
is my last chance for glory.

265
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,967
But mark my words, Wiggins.
When King James

266
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:34,181
sees the gold these peasants unearth...

267
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:38,357
success will be mine at last.

268
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:42,357
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Top off the yardarm!

269
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,674
It's incredible!

270
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:47,248
And it's all ours. I've
never seen anything like it.

271
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,571
It could look like Ratcliffe's
knickers, for all I care...

272
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,490
just as long as I get
off this stinkin' boat.

273
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,957
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

274
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,690
Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut.

275
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:56,957
- Steady! Steady!
- Hold up! That's far enough.

276
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,490
All right, now. Tie her off.

277
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:03,824
Here, John, tie off this end.
John? John?

278
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,824
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

279
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:35,357
Hey!

280
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,023
Well. You're a strange-looking fellow.

281
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:46,624
Are you hungry? Here you go.

282
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:50,824
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.

283
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,690
You like it, eh? Well, try eating
it for four months straight.

284
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,424
You got a friend back there?

285
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,624
Hey! Wh... What? Watch out.

286
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:20,424
What? Get... No, get... Uh, look out.

287
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:24,490
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.

288
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,224
All right. All right. I'm leaving.

289
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,957
Did you see their skin?

290
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,090
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

291
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:51,824
My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors.

292
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:54,890
Kekata, what do you see?

293
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,490
These are not men like us...

294
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,624
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun...

295
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:24,224
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

296
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:31,557
They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves...

297
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:36,024
consuming everything in their path.

298
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:43,424
Great Powhatan, I will lead our
warriors to the river and attack.

299
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,490
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

300
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:50,957
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy.

301
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,557
But these pale visitors
are strange to us.

302
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,157
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

303
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,890
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

304
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,824
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches...

305
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,290
in the name of His Majesty
King James the First...

306
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:10,757
and do so name this
settlement Jamestown.

307
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,890
Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir.

308
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:18,824
Hurry now, Percy. We must be all
squeaky clean for the New World.

309
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,594
Captain Smith, it appears
I've selected the

310
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,314
perfect location, eh?
Not a savage in sight.

311
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,757
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

312
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:16,424
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

313
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,090
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

314
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,741
Now, gentlemen, to work. You
men, get the ship unloaded.

315
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:25,648
Right, sir.

316
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:29,624
You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.

317
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,280
It's time to start digging.

318
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:32,714
- Digging? 
- Digging?

319
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:35,274
Why, of course. Let's
not forget what the

320
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,114
Spanish found when they
came to the New World.

321
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:41,157
Gold! Mountains of it.

322
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:44,957
Why, for years they've been
ravaging the New World...

323
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:47,157
of its most precious resources...

324
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,157
but now...

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,624

00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:10,824
My name is Pocahontas.

394
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,157
I'm John Smith.

395
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:23,890
That's it. Keep at it, men.

396
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:28,690
Keep digging. It's got
to be here somewhere.

397
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,777
There's 30 more of
them down by the ridge.

398
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,381
That makes more than a hundred.

399
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:36,024
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

400
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,041
Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?

401
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,066
Aye.

402
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,624
We're slaving away, busting our backs
day and night...

403
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:45,090
- for...
- For king and country. I know, I know.

404
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:48,824
And I share your fatigue. Mmm. Wiggins?

405
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,556
- Wiggins?
- Coming!

406
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,490
Dispose of this.

407
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:00,690
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?

408
00:34:00,824 --> 00:34:03,024
Fetch, boy!

409
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:10,457
Savages! It's an ambush!
Arm yourselves!

410
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,423
Run!

411
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,490
Arm yourselves!

412
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:17,957
Make sure every man has a musket.

413
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,157
Shoot!

414
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:24,290
Them, you idiot!

415
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,024
Where's that blasted
Smith when I need him?

416
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,824
Namontack!

417
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:59,090
Back to the village.

418
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:04,957
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

419
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:09,200
Everyone, back to camp.
Get the rest of the

420
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:11,314
cannons ashore and finish
building the fort!

421
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:13,357
Aye, Governor.

422
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,957
And you.

423
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:18,290
Learn to use that thing properly.

424
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:21,957
A man's not a man unless
he knows how to shoot.

425
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:34,557
These beasts invade our
shores, and now this.

426
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:39,957
This wound is strange to me.

427
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:46,824
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot
do it alone.

428
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:50,690
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

429
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,157
We will call on our
brothers to help us fight.

430
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,024
These white men are dangerous.

431
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,557
No one is to go near them.

432
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,490
- It's called a helmet.
- Helmet.

433
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:12,357
- So, uh, what river is this?
- Qui-yough-co-hannock.

434
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:15,357
You have the most unusual names here.

435
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,357
Pocahontas.

436
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:25,624
You have the most unusual name too.

437
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:28,490
John Smith.

438
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:31,090
Hey!

439
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,157
Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?

440
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,090
Meeko!

441
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:37,490
Well, how do you do, Meeko?

442
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:44,090
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.

443
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,157
- Nothing's happening.
- Uh, no, no. I need your hand first.

444
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,090
It's how we say hello.

445
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:04,357
This is how we say hello.

446
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:14,157
And how we say goodbye.

447
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:18,024
I like hello better.

448
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:25,757
Yeah, I remember you.

449
00:37:27,024 --> 00:37:29,090
Flit just doesn't like strangers.

450
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:31,090
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.

451
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,690
Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

452
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,824
Very stubborn.

453
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,824
Hey!

454
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,757
Meeko, come back here.

455
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:44,157
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get...

456
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,956
- Meeko, bring that back!
- N-No, it's all right.

457
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:49,024
He can keep it. Call it a gift.

458
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,490
- What was that?
- My compass.

459
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:55,290
Compass?

460
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,514
It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.

461
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,757
But it's all right.
I'll get another one in London.

462
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:02,357
- London. Is that your village?
- Yes.

463
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,824
- It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

464
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:09,490
Well, it's got streets filled with
carriages, bridges over the rivers...

465
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:12,224
and buildings as tall as trees.

466
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,289
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

467
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,157
- How?
- We're going to build them here.

468
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:20,624
We'll show your people how to use this
land properly, how to make the most of it.

469
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,757
- Make the most of it?
- Yes.

470
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,588
We'll build roads and
decent houses and...

471
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:27,181
Our houses are fine.

472
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,290
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

473
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:35,624
W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha... Hey. Hey!

474
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,624
Wait! Wa-Wait!

475
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,757
There's so much we can teach you.

476
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:43,174
We've improved the lives of
savages all over the world.

477
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:43,981
Savages?

478
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:46,157
Uh, not that you're a savage.

479
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,440
Just my people.

480
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,914
No. Listen. That's not what I meant.
Let me explain, uh...

481
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:54,024
- Let go!
- No, I'm not letting you leave.

482
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:57,690
Look, don't do this.

483
00:38:57,824 --> 00:39:01,357
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.

484
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:06,224
- A term for people who are uncivilized.
- Like me.

485
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,690
Well, when I say uncivilized,
what I mean is, is...

486
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,956

What is it?

528

The drums.

529
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,557
They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here.

530
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,756
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

531
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:01,024
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

532
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:05,957
I have to go.

533
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,824
All right! This one's ready to hoist!

534
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:21,557
- Two on each side.
- Ready now. Push!

535
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,120
Watch it. It's slippery.

536
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,448
Come on, lads. It's only
a little picket fence.

537
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,757
- Steady. Steady.
- There you go.

538
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:31,557
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?

539
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,824
- Something wrong, John?
- What?

540
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,024
You've been awfully quiet
the last few days.

541
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,690
Oh, he's just mad that he
missed all the action.

542
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:43,824
Ah, don't worry, John. You'll get
your chance to deal with the Indians.

543
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,690
Yeah, we'll take care of them
like we did last time, eh, mates?

544
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:52,024
We shot ourselves an Injun
or maybe two or three.

545
00:43:52,157 --> 00:43:54,624
All right, you howling
nutter, get to work!

546
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,157
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

547
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,223
Oh, sure, we're having
loads of fun, right?

548
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:02,290
Look at us. No gold, no food.

549
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:06,890
While Ratcliffe sits up in his
tent all day, happy as a clam.

550
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:09,290
I am doomed!

551
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:14,024
I should be wallowing in riches by now
and I haven't found as much as a speck!

552
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,490
Think. Think!

553
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:21,224
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?

554
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:26,290
I've mined the forests and
the hills and the swamps.

555
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:28,290
And nothing!

556
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:34,424
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

557
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:38,357
I... I...

558
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:40,357
I made it myself.

559
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:42,690
Take that silly...

560
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:44,957
Of course! The Indians.

561
00:44:45,024 --> 00:44:48,490
Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?

562
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,890
Because we invaded their land and cut
down their trees and dug up their earth?

563
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:56,224
It's the gold! They have it and they
don't want us to take it from them.

564
00:44:56,357 --> 00:45:00,424
Well, I'll just have to take it
by force, then, won't I?

565
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,224
You there! Where's Captain Smith?

566
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,490
Well, he's gone.

567
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:09,824
Aye. Your singing must
have scared them off.

568
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:11,867
Well, then go get
him, for heaven's sake!

569
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:13,514
What if we run into the Indians?

570
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,290
That's what guns are for.

571
00:45:16,357 --> 00:45:18,690
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

572
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:46,889
Pocahontas.

573
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,023
You should be inside the village.

574
00:45:49,024 --> 00:45:50,223
We'll be all right.

575
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,781
We're gathering food for
when the warriors arrive.

576
00:45:53,957 --> 00:45:57,357
Don't go far. Now is not
the time to be running off.

577
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,514
Yes, Father.

578
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,424
When I see you wear that necklace...

579
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,957
you look just like your mother.

580
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:09,157
- I miss her.
- But she is still with us.

581
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,224
Whenever the wind moves through
the trees, I feel her presence.

582
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,357
Our people looked to her
for wisdom and strength.

583
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:19,157
Someday, they will look to you as well.

584
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:22,024
I would be honoured by that.

585
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,957
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.

586
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:28,224
- All right. What is it?
- What?

587
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,957
- You're hiding something.
- I'm not hiding anything.

588
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,224
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

589
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,290
Pocahontas, look!

590
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,424
- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?

591
00:46:44,557 --> 00:46:46,490
- I had to see you again.
- Huh?

592
00:46:46,624 --> 00:46:49,557
Pocahontas. Pocahontas?

593
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,641
Please, don't say anything.
Quick, this way.

594
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:53,666
But...

595
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:56,490
- Nakoma. - Huh?
- Where is Pocahontas?

596
00:46:56,624 --> 00:47:00,357
I... I haven't seen her.

597
00:47:00,624 --> 00:47:04,357
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

598
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,824
Tell her that. She listens to you.

599
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,957
Huh. Sure she does.

600
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:30,157
This place is incredible.

601
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:33,290
And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold.

602
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:35,424
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

603
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:36,524
What's gold?

604
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:39,423
You know, it's, uh...
it's, it's yellow.

605
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:41,357
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

606
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:45,757
Oh! Here, we have lots of it. Gold.

607
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:49,557
No. Gold is this.

608
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:52,290
Hmm. There's nothing
like that around here.

609
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:56,224
- No gold.
- Not that I've seen.

610
00:47:56,424 --> 00:48:00,624
All this way for nothing. Well, those
boys are in for a big surprise.

611
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,957
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

612
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,640
Will you go home?

613
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:10,114
Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.

614
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:12,624
I've never really belonged anywhere.

615
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,357
You could belong here.

616
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:26,890
- What was that?
- Did you see something?

617
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:29,890
No. No. I just, uh... I...

618
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:33,089
I didn't see anything, did I?

619
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,890
Look again.

623
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,357
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

624
00:48:50,424 --> 00:48:52,690
Then you should talk back.

625
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:57,557
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.

626
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:02,490
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

627
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:05,290
Anything you want.

628
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,290
- So, uh...
- Come closer, John Smith.

629
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:17,757
He has a good soul. And
he's handsome too.

630
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,224
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

631
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:24,690
Smith! Smith! Where are you, mate?

632
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,357
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

633
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,224
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

634
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:34,290
Aye. Well, if you spot
one, don't ask questions.

635
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:37,490
Just shoot.

636
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:41,357
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me. It was the tree.

637
00:49:41,424 --> 00:49:44,890
Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting its roots and...

638
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,890
Let's get out of here.

639
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:52,890
- Ow!
- Ow! Run!

640
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,199
But what about Smith?

641
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:57,181
He's a big lad. He can
take care of himself.

642
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:58,933
I'm glad you're on our side.

643
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,714
There's still some
snap in these old vines.

644
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:04,423
I'd better get back before
they send the whole camp out after me.

645
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:08,557
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight. Right here.

646
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:18,357
Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

647
00:50:18,424 --> 00:50:21,083
What am I doing? I
shouldn't be seeing him again.

648
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:23,581
I mean, I want to see him again.

649
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:26,690
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

650
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,757
But still, something inside is
telling me it's the right thing.

651
00:50:30,824 --> 00:50:34,089
- Perhaps it's your dream.
- My dream?

652
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:37,557
Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?

653
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:39,824
Hmm.

654
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:48,557
The warriors are here!

655
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,824
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

656
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,490
- There you are.
- Kocoum. - Look at them.

657
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:08,690
Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons.

658
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,957
Now that we are joined
by our brothers...

659
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:16,357
we will defeat this enemy.

660
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:25,690
- Father, I need to speak with you.
- Not now, my daughter.

661
00:51:25,757 --> 00:51:27,079
The council is gathering.

662
00:51:27,104 --> 00:51:30,381
We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way.

663
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,290
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

664
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,782
But maybe we should
try talking to them.

665
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,556
They do not want to talk.

666
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:41,423
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

667
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:43,957
- Pocahontas.
- Wouldn't you?

668
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:47,690
Of course I would. But
it is not that simple.

669
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,890
Nothing is simple any more.

670
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:36,624
Easy, Thomas. It's me.

671
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:40,290
Oh, John. I could've killed you.

672
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:43,957
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

673
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:46,489
You'll see twice as well.

674
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,424
- Smith, there you are!
- We were looking all over for you.

675
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,490
Smith! Where have you been?

676
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:56,290
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

677
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,824
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

678
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,862
We'll need that
information for the battle.

679
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:01,648
What battle?

680
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,557
We will eliminate these
savages once and for all.

681
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:06,957
No! You can't do that.

682
00:53:07,024 --> 00:53:09,024
Oh, can't I?

683
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,557
Look, we don't have to fight them.

684
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:13,890
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

685
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,424
- You what?
- A savage?

686
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:18,824
They're not savages. They can help us.

687
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:21,624
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.

688
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,889
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

689
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,390
It's better than hardtack
and gruel, that's for sure.

690
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:29,223
I like gruel.

691
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:31,757
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

692
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,489
They want to kill us, all of us!

693
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,556
They've got our gold, and
they'll do anything to keep it!

694
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:41,890
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

695
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:45,489
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

696
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,424
- Yes.
- Lies! Lies! All of it!

697
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:52,824
Murderous thieves! There's no room
for their kind in civilized society.

698
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:57,757
- But this is their land!
- This is my land! I make the laws here.

699
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,890
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian...

700
00:54:02,024 --> 00:54:05,290
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason...

701
00:54:05,424 --> 00:54:07,757
and hanged!

702
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,557
- Pocahontas!
- Nakoma!

703
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:17,224
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.

704
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:20,624
- Don't ask me to do it again.
- I have to do this.

705
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,956
- He's one of them.
- You don't know him.

706
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:25,957
If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.

707
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,490
I'm trying to help my people.

708
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,090
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.

709
00:54:32,157 --> 00:54:34,424
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't.

710
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,357
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!

711
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,824
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothin'.

712
00:54:46,957 --> 00:54:50,424
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

713
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:53,757
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.

714
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,756
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.

715
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:59,957
Those savages didn't attack us for
nothin'. They're hidin' somethin'.

716
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:03,424
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

717
00:55:03,624 --> 00:55:06,157
- Not me.
- Either too hot or too cool.

718
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:08,557
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

719
00:55:08,624 --> 00:55:13,357
Oh, I know. I've been itching a lot.

720
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,024
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

721
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,291
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

722
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:25,048
Yes, sir.

723
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:30,157
And if you happen to see
any Indians, shoot them.

724
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:39,224
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod
sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier.

725
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:41,490
Don't disappoint me again.

726
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,556
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

727
00:55:54,557 --> 00:55:58,424
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

728
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,557
I think she's in trouble.

729
00:56:07,024 --> 00:56:10,090
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

730
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:12,357
- The warriors are here!
- Pocahontas!

731
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,690
John.

732
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:18,690
Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people.

733
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:22,290
- You've got to warn them.
- Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

734
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:24,423
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

735
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:27,090
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.

736
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:28,997
I already tried talking to my men,

737
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:31,248
but everything about this
land has them spooked.

738
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:38,224
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen.

739
00:56:42,757 --> 00:56:45,290
Percy.

740
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:49,024
- Easy, Percy. Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

741
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,889
You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.

742
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,135
Come... Come here, both of you!

743
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,248
It's all right! It's all right!
He's a friend!

744
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,490
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

745
00:56:59,357 --> 00:57:01,490
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

746
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:05,624
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

747
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,024
It's enough to make your sap boil.

748
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,024
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look.

749
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,224
- The ripples.
- What about them?

750
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:32,757
So small at first, then
look how they grow.

751
00:57:34,157 --> 00:57:37,424
But someone has to start them.

752
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,090
They're not going to listen to us.

753
00:57:39,157 --> 00:57:43,357
Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one.

754
00:57:43,557 --> 00:57:45,357
Don't you see?

755
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:50,557
Only when the fighting
stops can you be together.

756
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:56,490
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

757
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,224
No!

758
00:58:32,624 --> 00:58:34,824
Kocoum! No!

759
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,090
Kocoum!

760
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,157
Leave him alone!

761
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,957
Kocoum! Stop!

762
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:10,490
Both eyes open.

763
00:59:18,824 --> 00:59:20,624
Thomas!

764
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,357
- Is he...
- You killed him.

765
00:59:23,557 --> 00:59:25,357
- I thought that...
- Get away from him!

766
00:59:25,424 --> 00:59:27,719
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...

767
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:28,781
He killed him!

768
00:59:31,824 --> 00:59:34,556
Thomas, get out of here!

769
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:36,490
Get out of here!

770
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:43,224
- Who did this?
- Pocahontas was out in the woods.

771
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,090
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him.

772
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,957
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

773
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,802
At sunrise he will be the first to die.

774
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,114
But, Father...

775
01:00:57,224 --> 01:01:00,224
I told you to stay in the village.

776
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,157
You disobeyed me. You
have shamed your father!

777
01:01:04,224 --> 01:01:05,957
I was only trying to help.

778
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:09,957
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

779
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,357
Take him away!

780
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,824
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

781
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,757
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.

782
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,824
I was worried about you.

783
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,224
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.

784
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,556
All this happened because of me.

785
01:01:42,557 --> 01:01:45,490
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

786
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,624
Come with me.

787
01:01:53,557 --> 01:01:57,824
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

788
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:02,624
Be quick.

789
01:02:20,624 --> 01:02:22,357
Pocahontas.

790
01:02:24,757 --> 01:02:28,157
- I'm so sorry.
- For what, this?

791
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:30,638
I've gotten out of worse
scrapes than this.

792
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,556
Can't think of any right now, but...

793
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:36,557
It would've been better if we'd never
met. None of this would've happened.

794
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:39,490
Pocahontas, look at me.

795
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:42,157
I'd rather die tomorrow...

796
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:45,557
than live a hundred years
without knowing you.

797
01:02:45,624 --> 01:02:47,357
Pocahontas.

798
01:02:47,424 --> 01:02:50,357
- I can't leave you.
- You never will.

799
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:55,157
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

800
01:03:08,224 --> 01:03:11,624
Help! Somebody help! Help! Help!

801
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,824
- Easy, lad. What is it?
- It's Smith! They got him!

802
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,624
- Who got him?
- The savages!

803
01:03:16,824 --> 01:03:19,290
- Savages?
- They captured him, dragged him off!

804
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:21,089
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

805
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,290
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

806
01:03:23,357 --> 01:03:25,624
- Filthy beasts!
- Ratcliffe was right!

807
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,424
It's perfect, Wiggins. I couldn't
have planned this better myself.

808
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:32,557
The gold is as good as mine.

809
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:35,424
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!

810
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:37,769
Thomas is right! We've
got to do somethin'!

811
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:38,848
And so we shall.

812
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,659
I told you those savages
couldn't be trusted.

813
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:42,714
That's right!

814
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:46,023
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

815
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:47,057
Yeah, that's right.

816
01:03:47,082 --> 01:03:50,181
But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.

817
01:03:50,224 --> 01:03:53,824
At daybreak, we attack!

I followed the wrong path.

Spinning arrow.

853
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,690
It's the arrow from your dream.

854
01:06:17,824 --> 01:06:21,157
I was right! It was pointing to him.

Daughter, stand back.

882
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:56,024
I won't! I love him, Father.

883
01:07:57,957 --> 01:07:59,824
What?

884
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:07,224
Look around you. This is where the
path of hatred has brought us.

885
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,757
This is the path I choose,
Father. What will yours be?

886
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:52,624
My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years.

887
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:55,824
We have all come here with
anger in our hearts...

888
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:59,956
but she comes with courage
and understanding.

889
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:04,156
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing...

890
01:09:04,157 --> 01:09:06,490
it will not start with me.

891
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,090
Release him.

892
01:09:29,357 --> 01:09:31,224
Now's our chance! Fire!

893
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:33,157
- No!
- What?

894
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,890
- They let him go.
- They don't want to fight.

895
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:39,090
It's a trick! Don't you see? Fire!

896
01:09:44,224 --> 01:09:47,157
Fine. I'll settle this myself.

897
01:09:48,424 --> 01:09:50,757
No!

898
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,090
John!

899
01:09:58,024 --> 01:09:59,224
You shot him!

900
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:02,848
He stepped right... right into it.
It's his own fault.

901
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,466
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

902
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,824
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

903
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:09,824
Unhand me, I say! How dare you!

904
01:10:10,024 --> 01:10:14,357
- Put him in chains!
- I'll see you all hanged for this!

905
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:16,357
And gag him as well!

906
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,756
Is he gonna make it, Thomas?

907
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:32,048
The sooner he gets back
to England, the better.

908
01:10:32,157 --> 01:10:35,024
- Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?

909
01:10:35,157 --> 01:10:39,024
Any minute now. Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo.

910
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,357
How dare you! Untie me at once!

911
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,290
I'll have your heads for this!

912
01:10:47,357 --> 01:10:50,024
And he came so highly recommended.

913
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,490
The ship's almost ready. We'd better
get you on board. We'll lose the tide.

914
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,357
No, not yet.

915
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:08,624
- She said she'd be here.
- Look.

916
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:39,957
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.

917
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:53,290
Here. It's from Grandmother
Willow's bark.

918
01:11:53,357 --> 01:11:55,357
It'll help with the pain.

919
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:58,424
What pain? I've had
worse pain than this.

920
01:11:59,824 --> 01:12:02,690
Can't think of any right now, but...

921
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:11,424
You are always welcome among our people.

922
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,957
Thank you, my brother.

923
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,224
I thought you didn't like strangers.

924
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:30,224
My mother's necklace.

925
01:12:34,157 --> 01:12:36,090
See ya, Percy.

926
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,290
Come with me?

927
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:01,224
You must choose your own path.

928
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:18,824
I'm needed here.

929
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,357
Then I'll stay with you.

930
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:25,957
No. You have to go back.

931
01:13:26,024 --> 01:13:29,490
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

932
01:13:29,624 --> 01:13:34,090
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.

933
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:36,224
Forever.

934
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:05,157
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

935
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,824
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

936
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:15,890

937
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:21,890

01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:25,557
