1
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:54,715
Hi. I'm dory. I suffer
from short-term remembory loss.

2
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,427
-Yes!
-That's exactly what you say!

3
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,349
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be the other kids now.

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,147
-Hi, dory!
-Ahoy there!

5
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,574
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

6
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,494
Okay. I love-- okay.

7
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,991
We'll hide
and you count and come find us.

8
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:13,825
Okay, daddy.

9
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:19,001
No, not daddy. I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend, okay?

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,292
-Okay, daddy.
-No.

11
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,325
-I'm hiding.
-Now count to ten.

12
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,169
One, two, three...

13
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,379
Four...

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,797
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,176
Mommy, can I go play with them?

16
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,678
-Dory. Dory. Dory, honey.
-Dory. Kelpcake.

17
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,521
Undertow, sweetie.

18
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,227
Remember, honey, we have to
stay away from the undertow.

19
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,568
Okay, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

20
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,574
We see the undertow and we say...

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,613
Let's go.

22
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:57,828
No. It's, "heck no."
Okay? Let's try it again.

23
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,703
We see the undertow and we say...

24
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,791
There's the undertow!

25
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,543
There's the undertow.
There is the undertow.

26
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,709
Hey, you found the undertow.
And we see the undertow.

27
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,221
-Did I forget again?
-No, no. No.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,100
-No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
-No biggie, kelpcake.

29
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:24,062
What if I forget you?
Would you ever forget me?

30
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,731
Oh, kelpcake, no.

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:30,686
We will never forget you, dory.
And we know you'll never forget us.

32
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:59,426
Finding
dory

33
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,438
hello?

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,954
Hello!

35
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,622
-Did you hear that?
-What's that? Hear what?

36
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,332
-Stan, I just heard someone say hello.
-I didn't hear anybody say hello.

37
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,124
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

38
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,456
There's a lot of fish here.
Anybody could have just said hello.

39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,206
-Hello?
-There.

40
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,385
-Where?
-There. There. Right there.

41
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,512
-Where am I looking?
-There!

42
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,552
-Oh.
-Hello!

43
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,474
-Hello?
-Oh my goodness, it's a child!

44
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,852
-Hi, kid. Over here. Hello?
-Hello? Hi.

45
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,684
Hi. I'm dory. Can you please help me?

46
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,599
Hi, dory. Are you lost?

47
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,310
Yeah, where are your parents?

48
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,155
I can't remember.

49
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,987
Well we'll look around.
Are any of these fish your parents?

50
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,954
Hi, I'm dory. Can you please help me?

51
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,458
What?

52
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,504
Honey, you just said that.

53
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,997
-I did?
-Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:19,055
I'm sorry. I suffer from
short-term remembory loss.

55
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,008
-Oh, how awful.
-Short-term memory loss?

56
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,889
Okay, you wait here for one second.
Okay, sweetie pie?

57
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,473
-Stan. Stan. Stan.
-What? What?

58
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,142
What do we do? The poor thing is lost!

59
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,350
-What do you want me to do?
-We have to do something.

60
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,361
-She can't remember a thing!
-She could come from anywhere.

61
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,994
Wow, you are no help today.
Dory? Sweetie? How about we--

62
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,073
she's gone.
Well, that's not good. Hey, dory!

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,370
-Dory!
-Dory!

64
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,369
I'm dory. I lost my family.
Can you help me?

65
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,254
I'm dory.
I suffer from short-term memory--

66
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,049
just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

67
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,271
Just keep swimming. Swimming.
What do we do?

68
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,529
Hi. I lost my family. Can you help me?

69
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,028
Where did you see them last?

70
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,164
Well, funny story, but I forgot.

71
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,202
Oh, sweetie,
do you want to come swim with us?

72
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:30,367
That is the nicest offer I've gotten
all day. I think. I can't remember.

73
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,379
Anyhoo, thanks,
but I'm looking for someone.

74
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,246
Oh. Can't remember. Can't remember.
Can't remember.

75
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,928
Hi! I'm dory. Was it something I said?

76
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,062
Kidding. Okay, you're not coming back.

77
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:51,941
I was looking for something and i--
okay, get it. Date night. Have fun.

78
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,146
Well, I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

79
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,984
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?

80
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,570
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,613
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:06,737
Okay. Guess we'll hang out another
time. Don't be a stranger, stranger.

83
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,287
Huh?

84
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:19,797
A white boat! They took my son!
My son! Help me! Please!

85
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,963
Watch out!

86
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,339
Oh! Oh, sorry! Are you okay?

87
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,300
-He's gone. He's gone.
-There, there.

88
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,472
-No, he's gone.
-It's all right.

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,930
-He's gone.
-It'll be okay.

90
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,639
No, no, they took him away.
I have to find the boat.

91
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,437
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,320
-You have?
-Uh-huh. It went this way! Follow me!

93
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,443
Thank you! Thank you.
Thank you so much!

94
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,005
One year later

95
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,504
Klaus. Klaus, the piÃ±ata's drooping.

96
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,181
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
I can fix it. Ow!

97
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,057
Hey, marlin?

98
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,902
Oh. Hey, guys, I was just--

99
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,994
dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

100
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,363
And remember, the anemone stings.

101
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,741
Oh right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

102
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,664
Hey, marlin? Ow!

103
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,171
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed. Back to it.

104
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:42,915
Hey, marlin?

105
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,258
And we're up. That's it.
Ready to start the day.

106
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,553
-And we were looking for something.
-Nemo.

107
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,049
Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

108
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,561
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

109
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,096
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

110
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,017
Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

111
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,569
No. No, there were definitely four.

112
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,111
But last time you told it,
there were three.

113
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,736
Son, which one of us traveled
across the entire ocean?

114
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:10,204
Nemo did. Obviously we had to
cross the ocean...

115
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,275
To find him, so you know... he went first.

116
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,754
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

117
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,089
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

118
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,713
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

119
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,921
-I thought you told her.
-I did tell her!

120
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,761
-Dory.
-Yeah.

121
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:35,097
Mr. ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

122
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:42,015
So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.

123
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,187
Oh. Why not?

124
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,445
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

125
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,320
That's the one thing I can remember.
Yes.

126
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,445
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

127
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,623
And Mr. ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

128
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,616
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

129
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,290
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.

130
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,837
-You understand.
-I totally understand now.

131
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,461
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

132
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,836
He wants me
to be the teacher's assistant.

133
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,045
No, not exactly.

134
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,144
I am so honored. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

135
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,597
Mr. ray! You got help.

136
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,808
Oh. Okeydokey.

137
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,612
-All right, kids.
-All right, kids.

138
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,192
-Today's the day!
-Today's the day!

139
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,977
Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

140
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,861
Sting ray migration.

141
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,107
Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?

142
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,321
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

143
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,241
Migration is about going back to...

144
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,447
-Bed!
-Yes!

145
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,325
-No.
-No.

146
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,456
-The sand!
-No! Migration is about going home.

147
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,125
-Home.
-Which is where you're from.

148
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:45,964
Where you're from.

149
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,208
Can someone tell me
where they're from?

150
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,667
-I live by a giant rock.
-I live 3 coral caves away from here.

151
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,341
My house is covered in algae.

152
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,839
Where'd you grow up, dory?

153
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,009
Me? I don't know.

154
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,017
My family. Where are they?

155
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,312
Can I help you?

156
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,902
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
You see, I suffer from--

157
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,698
short-term memory loss.

158
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,408
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

159
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,040
Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...

160
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,873
They make sense. Like I have a family.

161
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,459
I know because I've-- I must have
come from somewhere. Right?

162
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,673
Everyone has a family.

163
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,041
I may not remember their names
and what they look like.

164
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,422
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again, but...

165
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,762
-What were we talking about?
-Mommies and daddies.

166
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,514
Mommies and daddies. Right.

167
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,557
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!

168
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,393
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.

169
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,399
You guys seem a little young, but okay.

170
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,232
You see, kids,
when two fish love each other--

171
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,568
and we'll stop right there.

172
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,856
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.

173
00:10:56,031 --> 00:11:00,581
Oh...

174
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,254
Migration, migration
let's learn about migration

175
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,254
it's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea

176
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,298
here's a scientific promise
that a fish who's oceanodromous

177
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,384
where did everyone go? I'm by myself
oh there they are. I'm back

178
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,602
plus or minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning

179
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,433
oh, kids stay away from the edge.

180
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,768
Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody
stay back from the edge. Come on.

181
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,564
-Okay, that's too far.
-That's too far.

182
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,647
Come on. Come on.
Get back over here. Back this way.

183
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,899
-Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
-All right, listen up!

184
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,606
-When the rays pass through here--
-the rays, gonna pass through.

185
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,397
What do we have to be careful of?

186
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,111
Everybody has to be careful of what?
Hmm?

187
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,619
-The undertow!
-That's right.

188
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,288
That's right. The under--
the undertow?

189
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:48,291
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

190
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,628
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into--

191
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,844
Mr. ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

192
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,126
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

193
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,470
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

194
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:06,387
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!

195
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,808
To and fro,
our hearts know where to go

196
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,819
beating like a drum,
it sends us back to where we're from

197
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,149
oh... we're going home

198
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,819
we know who we are,
and it's time to travel far

199
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,829
for days and nights we'll roam,
to make our way back home

200
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,793
oh... we're going home

201
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:30,003
swimming to and fro,
our hearts know where to go

202
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,253
beating like a drum, it sends us back
to where we're from

203
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,130
we see the undertow and we say--

204
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:37,756
dory!

205
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,342
Dory!

206
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,642
Dory! Dory!

207
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,351
-Is she dead?
-No, she's not dead.

208
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,847
-Aw. Oh man.
-Give her some space, everybody.

209
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,979
The Jewel of morro bay, California.

210
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,687
The Jewel of morro bay, California?

211
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,533
I remembered something so i--

212
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,780
I remembered something!

213
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,487
I actually remembered something!
Something important.

214
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,657
Something important?
What? What was it?

215
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,542
I'm not sure anymore,
but I can still feel it. It's right there.

216
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,206
All right, thank you, Mr. ray.

217
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,795
Okay, come on. Try to remember better.
Don't be such a dory, dory.

218
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,762
Hmm. I don't know. I-- hold on. Hold on.

219
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,010
-Oh. Oh!
-What? Did you remember?

220
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,551
Ugh, I don't remember.
It was something-- it was--

221
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,811
oh, oh, oh! It was something about the--

222
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,023
the Jewel of morro bay, California.

223
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,191
My family! I remember my family!

224
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,112
They're out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

225
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,744
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys! Guys! Hello?

226
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,817
Guys! Where are you?

227
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,236
-Dory!
-Hello?

228
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,738
-Dory!
-Ah! Where did you go?

229
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,078
-You were the one to go.
-My parents. I remembered them.

230
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,657
What? What did you remember?

231
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,922
I remembered them! My mom. My dad.

232
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,924
I have a family. They don't know
where I am. Let's go. We have to go.

233
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,508
Dory, no. No! This is crazy!
Where exactly are you trying to go?

234
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,135
To the gem of the baltic?

235
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,643
-The Jewel of morro bay, California.
-Yes!

236
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,893
No, dory. California's all the way
across the ocean.

237
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,016
Then we'd better get going.

238
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,940
How come every time we're on the edge
of this reef, one of us is trying...

239
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,774
To leave?
For once, can't we just enjoy the view?

240
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,530
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family?

241
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,821
No! We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.

242
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,278
The only reason to travel
in the first place is so...

243
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,619
-You don't have to travel ever again.
-Yeah, but I want to--

244
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,906
-dory, look--
-please.

245
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,460
All I know is that I miss them.

246
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,875
I really, really miss them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

247
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,641
Do you know what that feels like?

248
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,812
Yes, I know what that feels like.

249
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:02,066
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there is my family.

250
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,415
Please, marlin,
i can't find them on my own.

251
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,825
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.

252
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,575
Yeah, dad, you can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

253
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,290
No.

254
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,759
But I know a guy.

255
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:30,005
Whoo-hoo!
Righteous, righteous, righteous!

256
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,659
Totally sick. Totally sick.

257
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,237
I know. Isn't it great?

258
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,752
No! I'm gonna be totally sick.

259
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,714
It's the California current, dude.
It's got some gnarly chop.

260
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,376
Surf's up, dude!

261
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,380
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl,
just do me a solid...

262
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,588
Head to the back of the shell, lean out,
and go for distance.

263
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
We call that "feeding the fishes."

264
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,098
Correctamundo, squirt!

265
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,183
And now we're looking for my parents
at the brooch of the Atlantic? Or the--

266
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,940
-the Jewel of morro bay, California.
-Exactly!

267
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,850
How are you gonna find your parents?

268
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,811
Do you remember what they look like?

269
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,769
I'm a bit new to the memory thing,
so I can't say for sure...

270
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:26,568
But something tells me they were
mostly blue, with s-- maybe yellow.

271
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,397
That sounds right.

272
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:31,161
Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know
them when I see them. We're family.

273
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,043
By the way crossing the ocean
is the kind of thing you should...

274
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,203
Only do once. One time!

275
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,791
Morro bay, California's
coming up, dudes.

276
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,087
Whoo-hoo! Let's find my family.

277
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,422
Go! Go! Go, go, go.

278
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,877
-Just go, dad.
-Don't push me, Nemo.

279
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,756
So long, little blue!
Hope you find your parents.

280
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,772
And good luck "feeding the fishes."

281
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,770
Too late. Already fed.

282
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,145
Oh.

283
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,607
This feels familiar. Mom! Dad!

284
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,529
No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait.

285
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,121
Mom! Dad!

286
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,873
Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents...

287
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,413
Are just gonna be floating around here
waiting for you?

288
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,830
Well, I don't know, but there's only
one way to find out. Mom! Dad!

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,630
-Yell louder, dory.
-Mom! Dad!

290
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,505
-Sh!
-What was that?

291
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,930
Wait. I've heard that before.
I remember someone saying, "sh."

292
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,054
Yes, well done. That was me.
One minute ago.

293
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:34,797
Sh!

294
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,845
Please. Have you seen
my mommy and daddy?

295
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,308
Their names are Jenny and Charlie.

296
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,024
Sh!

297
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,068
Jenny and Charlie.

298
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,032
What? Jenny and what?

299
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,030
Those are their names!
My parents are Jenny and Charlie!

300
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,776
-Dory, wait!
-Jenny!

301
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,163
Can't we just take a moment
to come up with a plan?

302
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,615
-Jenny! Charlie!
-Sh!

303
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,996
-Are you crazy?
-Sorry, she's a little excited.

304
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,873
-Jenny! Charlie!
-Dory, stop yelling for a second.

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,670
It's not a good idea
to come into a new neighborhood...

306
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,206
And call this much attention to yourself.

307
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,340
You don't understand. I remembered
my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie!

308
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,178
These crabs are locals and i
get the feeling they're shushing...

309
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,005
Us for a reason. You might wake up
something dangerous.

310
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,230
Are you talking about like
something with one big eye...

311
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,272
Tentacles, and a snappy thing?

312
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,023
Well, that's very specific,
but something like that, yes.

313
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,188
You just in general don't want to--

314
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,744
oh my goodness. Okay.

315
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:36,374
There's a mistake. We're backing away.
Let us live and we will--

316
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:41,041
we'll worship you. We'll build a--
do you like a monument?

317
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,471
Oh! Ooh! Whoa! Swim for your life!

318
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,531
-Nemo!
-Nemo!

319
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,489
Dad!

320
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,703
-Nemo!
-Dad!

321
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,912
No!

322
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,420
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go!

323
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,080
Dad!

324
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,423
No, no! No!

325
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,430
Dory! Dory, slow down!
We're not being chased anymore.

326
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,434
Are you sure?

327
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,602
Jenny and Charlie. Jenny and Charlie!

328
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,275
I just remembered their names!
We have to keep going. We're so close.

329
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,569
-Huh?
-Nemo, are you hurt?

330
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,281
Oh my goodness! Nemo!
Are you okay? What happened?

331
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,114
-Not now, dory. Please!
-Oh no.

332
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,620
-Nemo. Oh no. Oh no.
-I'm okay.

333
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,742
Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry.

334
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,119
Oh my goodness! Nemo, are you okay?

335
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,248
I said, "not now." You've done enough.

336
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:11,675
I have? Oh no. But I can fix it.
I can. I'll go get help.

337
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,297
You know what you can do, dory?
You can go wait over there.

338
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:18,054
Go wait over there and forget.
It's what you do best.

339
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,636
You're right. I don't know why I thought
i could do this.

340
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,187
Find my family. I can't do this.
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it.

341
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,113
-I'm okay.
-Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay?

342
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:34,322
Okay? I can do that. I'll be--
it'll be all right, Nemo.

343
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,816
Hello? Someone? Hello?

344
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,870
Anyone? Hello? Anyone?

345
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,495
Hello.

346
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,042
-Hello?
-I'm sigourney Weaver.

347
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,037
Oh. Hi, sigourney. I need your help.

348
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,168
Won't you please join us...

349
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,715
Oh. Great, great, great.

350
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,130
As we explore the wonders
of the pacific ocean...

351
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,550
And the amazing life it holds within.

352
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,890
Witness the majesty
of the beluga whale.

353
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,516
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

354
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,681
Dory! There you are!

355
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,520
Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's
gonna tell us where we are.

356
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,846
Look out!

357
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,691
-Oh, look at this!
-No respect for ocean life.

358
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,025
-Marlin! Nemo!
-Dory!

359
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,241
No, no, no. Not again! Not again!

360
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:18,901
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.

361
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,525
Dory! Dory!

362
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,369
Don't worry, dory! Stay calm.
We'll come find you!

363
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,037
And welcome to
the marine life institute...

364
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:32,826
Where we believe in rescue,
rehabilitation and release.

365
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,211
Marlin? Nemo?

366
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,355
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?

367
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,894
Me help you?

368
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,525
Huh? What's happening? Help?

369
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,863
Looks like we're done here.

370
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,277
Dude, cut it out. You're a scientist.
We talked about this.

371
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,776
Oh, come on. It's funny.

372
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:14,042
Oh boy. Okay. This is-- I'll be fine,
i just need to find a way out and...

373
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:26,105
If I could just-- get a hold of yourself,
get a hold of yourself.

374
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,103
You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.

375
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,016
-Hey, you.
-Oh.

376
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:31,983
Spinner.

377
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,604
Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm dory. I'm--

378
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,650
name's Hank. How sick are you?

379
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:37,935
Sick? I'm sick?

380
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,108
Why else would you be in quarantine?

381
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,236
Oh no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.

382
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,991
All right. Now don't get hysterical--
uh-oh. Not good.

383
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,776
What? What is it? What happened?
What's that?

384
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,490
That there is bad news.

385
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,995
It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.

386
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:55,294
They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.

387
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,039
In Cleveland.

388
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:02,338
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

389
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,088
Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

390
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,100
I have to get to the Jewel of morro bay,
California and find my family.

391
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,103
That's this place.
The marine life institute.

392
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,024
The Jewel of morro bay, California.
You're here.

393
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,810
You mean I'm from here? My parents
are here. I have to get to them.

394
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,190
So what exhibit are you from?

395
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,317
Wait. I'm from an exhibit? Which one?
I have to get there.

396
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,615
Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.

397
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,949
Unless... nah.
Never work. It's too crazy.

398
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,125
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

399
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,294
You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...

400
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,365
To help you get to your family.
If I just take--

401
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,792
yes! Great idea. You take me
to find them. Why didn't I think of that?

402
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,842
No, no, no. If I just take your tag...

403
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,676
I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...

404
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:50,014
And find your family. All you have to do
is give me the tag.

405
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,220
What tag? There's a tag on my fin!

406
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,809
How could you forget you have a tag
on your fin?

407
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:58,865
Oh no. I'm sorry. I-- I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

408
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,270
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

409
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,070
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

410
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,034
You were about to give me your tag.

411
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,317
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

412
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,369
So I can go to--

413
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,495
so I can go to Cleveland.

414
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,002
Cleveland? I hear good things about
Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

415
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,333
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

416
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,670
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

417
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,417
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

418
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,220
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

419
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,724
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

420
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:32,679
Look...

421
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,072
I don't work here. It's not like
i have a map of this place.

422
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,442
A map! Good idea.

423
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,649
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh boy.

424
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:51,283
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me--

425
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:55,038
I don't have much. I--
how about if I give you this tag?

426
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,502
Great idea.

427
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,795
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?

428
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,764
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

429
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,926
-Yeah, dad.
-I said that?

430
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,933
You said that,
dory swam to the surface,

431
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,260
and she got taken by some--

432
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,560
all right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

433
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,933
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that--

434
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,941
I'm not positive I did. It's actually
a compliment because...

435
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,105
I asked her to wait and I said,
"it's what you do best."

436
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,275
So i-- oh, it's my fault!

437
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:32,275
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

438
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,079
What if it's a restaurant?

439
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,583
Oy! You two! Shut it!

440
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:40,575
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favorite dream!

441
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,459
Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?

442
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,956
-Yeah.
-Oh, that is a good one.

443
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,798
-Oh yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
-It's one of my favorites.

444
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,134
-Excuse us. Hello! We're trying to--
-son! Son.

445
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,799
Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.

446
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,009
They could pounce at any moment.

447
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,765
They don't look very pouncy.

448
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:58,482
That's what they want you to think.

449
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,312
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

450
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,938
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

451
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,818
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.

452
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,107
-She is?
-It's a fish hospital.

453
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:16,531
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

454
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,702
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

455
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,461
-Nasal parasite.
-Anemia.

456
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,212
All fixed up and sent on our way.

457
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,422
Oh thank goodness.

458
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,553
Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab--

459
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,800
-Gerald, get off the rock!
-Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!

460
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,836
-Get off! Now you know better! Off!
-Off! Off! Off! Off!

461
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:39,852
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the marine life institute.

462
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,097
The Jewel of morro bay, California.

463
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,357
She was right. It looks like
dory can do something besides forget.

464
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,323
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

465
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,533
So how are we gonna get inside?

466
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,202
Wait. You want to get inside mli?

467
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,032
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

468
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,369
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

469
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,584
Oh, we know a way.

470
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:04,424
-You do?
-Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.

471
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,881
-What are they doing?
-I don't know. It sounds bad.

472
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,205
-Are we there yet?
-Sh. Keep it down!

473
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,472
Hank., I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like-- i-- destiny.

474
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,508
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

475
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,929
Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,178
I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.

477
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,561
I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...

478
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,898
-You see I suffer from short-term--
-short-term memory loss.

479
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,694
Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.

480
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,227
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "how are you? Oh I'm fine."

481
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,571
"How are you? I'm fine too."
News flash -nobody's fine.

482
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,568
Oh, I'm fine. How are you?

483
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,912
-Hank, look, there's a map!
-Sh!

484
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,621
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

485
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,575
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

486
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,917
Got it. What was the first part again?

487
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,383
Ugh.

488
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,591
What? The octopus escaped again?

489
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,300
Wow. Look at all the exhibits.

490
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,421
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

491
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,880
-Pick one!
-Okay.

492
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,586
Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out.

493
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:01,391
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

494
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,774
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

495
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,857
Hank! There you are.

496
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,481
-Hurry up!
-Okay. Okay.

497
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,899
K. It starts with a "k."
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!

498
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,991
No! No kids. Kids grab things.

499
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,953
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

500
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,657
You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,

501
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,004
you're a septopus.

502
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,502
I may not remember, but I can count.

503
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:26,964
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

504
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,962
Journey to the-- hey, look. Shells.

505
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,630
Hey, look. Shells!
Daddy, here's a shell for you.

506
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,301
That's great, dory.
You found another one.

507
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,510
-I did?
-Oh, yes, you did.

508
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,101
You're getting good at this, dory.

509
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,649
Hey, look. Shells!

510
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:53,227
-Hey, I live there.
-Yes! Yes, indeed.

511
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,648
-I like shells.
-That's right, dear.

512
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,492
Do you think you could find me
another shell?

513
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,830
Purple ones are my favorite.

514
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,333
Okay, mommy.

515
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:12,708
Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell!
Hey, my home had a purple shell.

516
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,342
So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

517
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,336
No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

518
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,388
Purple shells were her favorite
and she had this adorable giggle.

519
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:21,549
And then my dad was really friendly.

520
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,007
And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

521
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,641
Still think this is destiny?

522
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,310
-Hank, we have to find my folks!
-Quiet!

523
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,407
Ugh. Base, this is Carol.

524
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:43,702
I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.

525
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,083
-See what you did?
-Sorry.

526
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,205
This could not be worse.

527
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:51,416
Hmm. "Destiny." Destiny.

528
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,884
Hank. I got a feeling.
I think we should get in the bucket.

529
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,206
-No. Stop.
-Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is--

530
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,922
-no, no, no, no, no.
-We've got to get in that bucket.

531
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,350
-I'm not going with you in that bucket.
-Here...I...Go...In...The...Bucket. Bye.

532
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:11,555
Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea. Play dead.

533
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,647
I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you
hold your eyes open that long?

534
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,956
Hey, guys. Wait a second.

535
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,760
Our next guest
has been here a very long time.

536
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:49,929
She's a whale shark.
Her name is destiny.

537
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,308
Destiny? Really?

538
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,485
You'll notice she's extremely
nearsighted and has trouble...

539
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:58,896
Navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.

540
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:02,486
Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish?

541
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,866
Wait. What?

542
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,991
-Hi! Hello there.
-Whoa! Oh. Whoa.

543
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,124
All right, I'll go with you.

544
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,458
-Excuse me.
-Is that blue blob talking?

545
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,965
-Can you help me? I lost my family.
-You lost your family?

546
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,379
Well, it's a long story,

547
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,174
and truth be told,
i don't remember most of it.

548
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,879
Aw, that is so sad. You poor thi--

549
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,644
sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

550
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,267
Oh, I think you swim beautifully.

551
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,309
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

552
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,188
Thank you.

553
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,823
You're welcome.

554
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,112
Wait. Say that again.

555
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:43,154
You're welcome.

556
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,820
-Dory?
-Yes.

557
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:45,988
-Dory?
-Yes.

558
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,074
-Dory?
-Yes.

559
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,779
-Dory!
-Yes.

560
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,079
-You and I were friends!
-No!

561
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,163
-Dory, it's me! Destiny!
-You know me?

562
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,000
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

563
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,786
-We were pipe pals!
-We were?

564
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,207
-Aw, you're so pretty.
-So you know where I'm from?

565
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,260
Yep, you are from
the open ocean exhibit.

566
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,177
I'm from the open ocean exhibit?

567
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,262
Then that's where my parents are.
We got to go. Can you take me there?

568
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,098
Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

569
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:14,565
Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

570
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,686
-Who's that?
-That's my neighbor, Bailey.

571
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,194
He was brought in with a head injury.

572
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,435
I know you're talking about me, destiny.

573
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,726
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

574
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,940
The doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

575
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,031
Hear every word
you're saying about me.

576
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,204
What's echolocation?

577
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,284
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

578
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,500
Find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

579
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,382
Now I know you're talking about me.
I really can't echolocate.

580
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,253
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

581
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,460
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

582
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,931
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

583
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:51,512
Echolocation. Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

584
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,725
-What?
-What are glasses?

585
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:57,518
It's sort of like you go, "hoo" and then
you see things. Why do I know that?

586
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,064
Oh. That's interesting.

587
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,443
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

588
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:08,111
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

589
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,320
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the--

590
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,330
what's it called? The place--
the soap and lotion?

591
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,163
-Open ocean.
-Open ocean!

592
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,789
Open ocean! I know where that is.

593
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:21,076
That's the exhibit located right next to--
i don't care.

594
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,091
Easy!

595
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,089
If you're trying to get to the open ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

596
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,465
-Through the pipes. Great.
-Through the pipes?

597
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,633
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

598
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,891
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's--
did you get that, Hank? All that?

599
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,934
-Yeah.
-Great! Let's go.

600
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,523
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

601
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:48,323
That's-- I'm-- i-- see, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

602
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,527
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

603
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,658
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

604
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,655
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

605
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,707
-Not my problem. Tag!
-But I can't get in that way.

606
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,131
-I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
-There's no other way.

607
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:08,135
-There's no other way.
-Now, now. Don't panic.

608
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:12,338
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

609
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:16,641
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

610
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:18,727
-Charlie!
-A joke. I'm kidding!

611
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:22,522
Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

612
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,978
Joke. I got it.

613
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:27,317
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

614
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,861
Thank you, daddy.

615
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:36,325
Thank you, daddy. Nope. My father
said there's always another way.

616
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,500
-What? There is no other way.
-Open ocean. Open ocean.

617
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,250
Open ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

618
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,593
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

619
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,713
-Wait, what?
-Always another way. There's--

620
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:52,841
there! Guys, follow me. I know
how we can get to locomotion.

621
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,340
-Open ocean.
-Exactly.

622
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,095
Guys. You know I can't swim
over there, right?

623
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,520
Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

624
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:06,113
I don't see how this is going to get us
inside. What are you even doing?

625
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,023
We're calling her over, of course.

626
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,942
Calling her over? Calling who over?

627
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,993
Lads, meet Becky.

628
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,619
Flying? No, no, no new information.

629
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,539
Listen, tell her thank you. You guys
have gone above and beyond. Really.

630
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,920
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

631
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,469
Because that's really our strength.

632
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,179
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

633
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,392
That's where they take the sick fish.

634
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:41,021
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

635
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:48,442
Hi, Becky. Ow! Stop. Let's call
her pecky because this is hurting.

636
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:49,937
I think she likes you, dad.

637
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:55,068
Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.

638
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,069
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

639
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,949
Becky, is-- would that work
with your schedule? Ow!

640
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,869
She doesn't understand
what I'm saying.

641
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,576
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

642
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,327
-Imp-- what?
-Imprint.

643
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:11,591
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.

644
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,835
-Now look her in the eye.
-Yeah.

645
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,927
Nemo, I think we should devise
an alternate plan.

646
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,766
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

647
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,982
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!

648
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,943
That's fine, dad. And in the meantime,
dory will just forget us.

649
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,985
Like you said, it's what she does best.

650
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,778
Fine.

651
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:38,738
Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye?

652
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,116
Just pick one, mate.

653
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,124
Becky.

654
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:51,126
Ooh. Ooo-roo. Roo-roo, Becky.

655
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,339
Okay, this is all great.

656
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,721
How exactly is Becky
supposed to carry us?

657
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:04,636
Oh yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald!

658
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,388
-Hmm?
-Yeah, Gerald.

659
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,190
-Come on, son.
-Hmm?

660
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,977
Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail,
we'll let you sit on the rock.

661
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,820
-Yeah, Gerald. We swear it.
-Hmm.

662
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,414
That's right. Shimmy on over here.

663
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,584
Come on. You can do it.

664
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,407
That's right.

665
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,038
Mind you don't scuff your bum.

666
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,582
Thank you so much, Gerald.

667
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,382
Welcome to your time on this rock.

668
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,053
Comfortable, isn't it?

669
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,755
-Time's up! Get off! Off! Off! Off! Off!
-Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off!

670
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:46,177
No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

671
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,275
Good luck!

672
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,069
Okay, when I tell you you're gonna--

673
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,113
yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal
with a big splash.

674
00:37:56,276 --> 00:38:00,856
On my mark. Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.

675
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,583
-Now?
-Not 'til destiny gives the signal.

676
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,248
You know something? I have no idea
why you're even doing this.

677
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,213
What do you mean?

678
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,214
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

679
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,206
If I had short-term memory loss...

680
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,208
I'd just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.

681
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,050
Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

682
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,265
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.

683
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,721
You're lucky. No memories.
No problems.

684
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,018
Huh. No memories. No problems.

685
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:31,308
Still not clear. Still not clear.

686
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,808
You don't have to say when it's not time.

687
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,310
-Not--
-just tell me when it is time.

688
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,231
Okay, here we go. And-- wait!

689
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,070
"Here we go. Wait." Are you serious?

690
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:39,865
-Okay, on the count of three.
-Don't count. Just say, "go."

691
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,737
-Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it!
-What? Okay, okay.

692
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,622
-Wow. Look at that! I mean--
-that's the signal.

693
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:45,871
Go, go, go! That's the signal!

694
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:56,092
Now remember, destiny said follow
the signs to the open ocean exhibit.

695
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:59,763
I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.

696
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,263
Got it. Follow the signs to open ocean.

697
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,590
I'm just gonna repeat it, okay?
That should work.

698
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,505
Follow the signs to open ocean.
Follow the signs to open ocean.

699
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:09,427
Mm. Go right! Follow the signs
to open ocean.

700
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,936
Follow the signs to open ocean.
Follow the signs to open ocean. Left!

701
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,023
-Follow the signs to open ocean.
-And steer clear of people, will you?

702
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,399
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.

703
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,981
Sh! Do not mess me up!

704
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:25,032
Oh, poor baby. Let me get that for you.
Here you-- oh!

705
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,623
Oh my.

706
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,622
Where do we go? Where do we go?

707
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,667
Oh, sorry!
Okay, I was looking, looking...

708
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,582
Roo-roo, Becky! Drop us anywhere.
We're okay.

709
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,840
Just wait, dad. I think she's looking
for a place to land.

710
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,675
She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't
even know which way to look.

711
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,310
Wait, Becky. What are you doing?
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.

712
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,149
Okay. I was going somewhere.
The question is where.

713
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:01,646
Which way? Do you see the sign?

714
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,653
I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to
something gets me to my family!

715
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,278
"The world's most powerful pair of--"

716
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,407
I know that. Why do I know that?
It's another memory.

717
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,197
Hank, we need to go that way!
Left. Go left.

718
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,004
Becky! Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

719
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,047
She can't hear you, dad.

720
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,010
All right. New plan. We have to
get closer to Becky so she can hear us.

721
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,850
I don't think we should move the pail.

722
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:33,021
Nemo. Without me Becky's lost.

723
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,187
Dad, just trust her.

724
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,229
Trust her? So she can forget us
all together?

725
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:42,027
-I trust Becky.
-You trust her? Becky's eating a cup!

726
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,357
Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa!

727
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:58,462
Well, at least we're not stuck
in the bucket anymore.

728
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,125
Or on top of quarantine.

729
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,468
The baby otter talk is beginning now.

730
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:12,064
Why, thanks, sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who wants to learn about otters?

731
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,562
Looking for the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

732
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,063
Otters!

733
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,307
-Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party!
-Cuddle party! I'm in!

734
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,235
Where are we?
Are we close to open ocean?

735
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,781
Yes. I think-- well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so--

736
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:27,895
what? What other sign?

737
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,411
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses.

738
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,283
What? What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?

739
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,619
Well, because I remembered it.

740
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,505
No. That wasn't the plan. Ow!

741
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:41,502
All right, that's it!
You have wasted my time!

742
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,675
-Wait. No.
-That transport truck leaves at dawn...

743
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:45,627
And I'm not missing it,
so give me your tag.

744
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,257
Wait. No, I remembered that sign.

745
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,054
-So?
-So I'm remembering more...

746
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,432
And more and I feel like my memory's
getting better. I think we should--

747
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,265
no! Your memory is not working.
You can't remember anything.

748
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,101
It's probably how you lost your family
in the first place!

749
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:03,858
All right, look, let's just take it down
a notch. Just give me the tag and--

750
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:07,284
you know something, for a guy with
three hearts you're not very nice.

751
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,654
Three hearts? What are you
talking about? I don't have three hearts.

752
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:10,948
-Yes, you do.
-I don't!

753
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:11,779
-You do!
-Don't!

754
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,069
-Do!
-Stop saying that!

755
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,330
Fun fact- the octopus has three hearts.

756
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,621
Two pump blood to the gills
while the third pumps...

757
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:19,907
-Blood throughout the body.
-Wait!

758
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,002
Kid zone

759
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,997
you know, someone with three hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

760
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,548
And it's mean to say that
i would lose someone I love!

761
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:29,302
Touch
pool

762
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:33,048
I did not lose them! Hank?

763
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:37,018
Hank? Hank?

764
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,478
-Han-s.
-No. Not hans. I'm looking for Hank.

765
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,814
-Han-s.
-Hank. With a "k." Hank.

766
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,150
-Hands!
-Hands? Oh, oh, oh, hands!

767
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,784
Hank! Hank?

768
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,855
My arm!

769
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:53,658
Hank!

770
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,000
Where are you? Hank! Oh! Can you
please help me? I'm looking for--

771
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,503
please help me. I've lost
my friend frank. I'm sorry, not frank.

772
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:06,749
You're in my space!

773
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:10,221
He's an octopus. No, septo--
septopus. That's right.

774
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,382
He's a septopus. Septopus.
Septopus. Septopus.

775
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:16,051
One, two, three, four, five, six, s--
septopus! He's camouflaged!

776
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:21,433
Hank. Come on, Hank!
Let's get out of here.

777
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:23,192
Dory, what are you doing?

778
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:27,067
Hank! What's the plan?

779
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:29,362
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever.

780
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,816
Okay. Good plan.

781
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,873
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.
I can't remember right.

782
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,159
-Sweetie. Sweetie.
-Oh, watch out, kelpcake.

783
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,536
Oh, watch where you're going.

784
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:45,753
I'm sorry, daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

785
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:50,376
Oh, sweetie.
Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry.

786
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:54,967
You know what you need to do?
Just keep swimming.

787
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,135
Yeah.

788
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:59,433
And I bet you can remember that
because we're just--

789
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,394
we're gonna sing a song about it.

790
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,399
Just keep swimming
just keep swimming

791
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,112
just keep swimming
swimming, swimming

792
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,153
what do we do?
We swim

793
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,237
swim, swim, swim
we swim

794
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,993
-we swim, swim, swim
-just keep swimming

795
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:22,159
my parents taught me that song!
We sang it as a family.

796
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,749
All this time I thought I made it up!

797
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,584
-What song?
-Just keep swimming.

798
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:27,749
Hank, we've just got to keep swimming.

799
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:31,208
What? No way! Listen to me,
it's too dangerous to move.

800
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:34,168
No, you listen to me. I know
you're scared, but you can't give up.

801
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,339
Follow me.

802
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,969
Just keep swimming
just keep swimming

803
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,512
my mom wrote this song for me

804
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,426
it's gonna get us out of here

805
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,021
sing with me, Hank. Come on.

806
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,984
I'm coming, mommy.
I'm coming, daddy!

807
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:50,766
-We're gonna be okay.
-Stop!

808
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,321
-Huh?
-Turn back.

809
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:53,652
Turn back!

810
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:58,659
You're headed right for poker's cove.
Poker's cove.

811
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,486
-Poker's cove?
-Incoming!

812
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,122
Stop it!

813
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,790
Oh, what is this?

814
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:12,802
Sorry.

815
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,303
That's okay. Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

816
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,220
Hank? Oh, Hank. There you are.

817
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,557
Wow. You got us out of there.

818
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,397
Huh. I did.

819
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:31,896
I got us out of there.

820
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,528
I mean, technically
you also got us in there.

821
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:38,697
But if you hadn't I'm not sure
we would have gotten here.

822
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,450
Echolocation

823
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,489
the world's most
powerful pair of glasses

824
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,201
echolocation. Echolocation!

825
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,789
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses. We found it!

826
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:50,045
No. You found that.

827
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,167
Welcome to the open ocean.

828
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,625
Home.

829
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:07,523
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

830
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,603
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

831
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,440
Dad, stop. She's not coming back.

832
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,065
She might. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

833
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:15,278
Dad! You made her feel like
she couldn't do it.

834
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,366
You're not talking
about Becky, are you?

835
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,083
I miss dory.

836
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:29,955
Me too.

837
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:36,958
The truth is,
I'm just so worried about her.

838
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,554
She's the one who should be worried
about us.

839
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:43,217
Well, she would definitely have an idea
of what to do if she were here.

840
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,557
I don't know how she does that.

841
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:49,562
I don't think she knows, dad.
She just does.

842
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:52,396
Well, then we'll just have to think.

843
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,070
-What would dory do?
-What would dory do?

844
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,153
Yeah! What would dory do?

845
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,609
She would assess her situation,
and then she'd evaluate...

846
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,490
Then she would analyze her options--

847
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,237
dad, that's "what would marlin do."

848
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,748
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

849
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,002
She would just look at the first thing
she sees and--

850
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,930
dory would do it.

851
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,940
Nemo, hold on to me. Whoa!

852
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:38,442
Hey, it's working! Whoa!

853
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:46,448
Just keep gasping.

854
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,996
-Are you okay?
-Yeah! What would dory do now?

855
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,127
Who's dory?

856
00:47:58,545 --> 00:47:59,625
Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.

857
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,053
Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you!

858
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,836
I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.

859
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,680
Years? Wow.

860
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,892
Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because--

861
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:11,676
now why would you want to go?
You just landed.

862
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,810
Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself.

863
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,688
I would love to, but my son and i
have to get to quarantine, so--

864
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,896
-wonderful thing to have a son.
-Yeah it is.

865
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,147
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.

866
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,160
-That's fascinating, but--
-but scallops have eyes.

867
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,372
And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!

868
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,493
Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.

869
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,910
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

870
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,419
Oh, shelley! Why? Why?

871
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,713
Now what would dory do?

872
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,666
Come with us as we explore the
mysterious world of the open ocean.

873
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,855
-Okay, Hank, follow me.
-You're in a cup.

874
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,432
Right. I'll follow you then.

875
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:05,362
-Wait.
-An octopus has three hearts.

876
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:07,695
Huh. That's a fun fact.

877
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,957
-We're here. This is really happening.
-Sh!

878
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:35,931
Well, looks like this is it, kid.
Now I got a truck to catch.

879
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,441
Wait! Wait! I had something for you.

880
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:44,229
-Tag.
-The tag. Right!

881
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,406
You know,
i think I'm gonna remember you.

882
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,250
Oh, you'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

883
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,000
Three heartbeats.

884
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:03,996
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.

885
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,136
My parents are actually down there.

886
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:17,928
You okay?

887
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:20,346
I'm ready.

888
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:23,734
Yeah, I think you are.

889
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:31,107
Wow!

890
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:39,123
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they? Okay. Okay.

891
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:49,925
Pardon me. Oh. Hi. Hello. Have you
seen a mom and a dad without me?

892
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:53,142
Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?
They're old like you.

893
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:56,973
Not old like you,
but older than you even. Okay. Bye.

894
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,310
Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid
a long time ago that would be me?

895
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:05,609
I don't know how long ago exact--
okay. You're in a hurry.

896
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:07,942
-Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
-Oh sorry.

897
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,540
It's our goal that every animal
we rescue and care for...

898
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:21,164
Will eventually return home
to where they belong.

899
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,340
Shells.

900
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:31,474
And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, dory...

901
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,393
You just follow the shells.

902
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:35,012
Hey, look! Shells!

903
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:44,646
Follow the shells.

904
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,333
-Hey, I live there.
-Yes, yes indeed.

905
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:02,831
My home. That's my home!

906
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,998
Mom! Dad!

907
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:10,214
Okay, kelpcake. Now count to ten.

908
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,719
One, two, three...

909
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:15,970
Four...

910
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,893
You're welcome.

911
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:20,766
Who are you talking to, kelpcake?

912
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,683
My pipe pal, destiny!

913
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,574
Mom? Dad?

914
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,452
Mommy loves purple shells.

915
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:52,094
-Mommy?
-What's going to happen to her?

916
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,006
There, there, Jenny.

917
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,181
Oh no, don't cry, mommy. Don't cry.

918
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:00,351
Do you think she's-- that she can
make it on her own, Charlie?

919
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,390
Oh, honey. It'll be okay.

920
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,943
Mommy loves purple shells.

921
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:19,738
-Dory!
-Dory?

922
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:21,488
-Dory!
-Mommy?

923
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:25,584
-Dory!
-Mommy! Daddy!

924
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,170
My parents...

925
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,671
I... I lost them.

926
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:43,969
It was my fault.

927
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,645
-Where's your tag?
-Huh?

928
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,610
Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?

929
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:51,901
-Quarantine?
-Yeah!

930
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:55,154
That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, bill?

931
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:58,319
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

932
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:01,658
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.

933
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,123
What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?

934
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:07,036
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!

935
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:08,866
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

936
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:11,501
Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.

937
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,338
You can just go through the pipes,
honey.

938
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,262
Oh. Oh I can't do that.

939
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,467
-Why not?
-I'll forget where I'm going.

940
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:24,807
And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

941
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,853
-Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
-You're not helping, bill.

942
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,518
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

943
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,651
Oh boy.

944
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:40,165
Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?

945
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:44,332
Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.

946
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,870
Okay.

947
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,712
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

948
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,708
Two lefts and a right. Okay.
Don't forget.

949
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:05,604
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

950
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:10,558
Two lefts and a right. Two lefts
and a right. Two lefts and a right.

951
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:16,397
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

952
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,529
Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?

953
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:26,035
Oh no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

954
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,079
Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.

955
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,827
Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

956
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:33,075
I'm forgetting everything.

957
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,090
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.

958
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,762
Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

959
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:43,473
-And...Swim, swim, swim.
-Yeah, I don't know about this.

960
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:46,045
Trust me,
i won't let you hit anything. Wall!

961
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,140
What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!

962
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,984
You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

963
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,310
Now really focus, okay? Wall!

964
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:55,979
Destiny!

965
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,938
Dory? Hello?

966
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:01,818
I'm lost in the pipes
and my parents are in quarantine!

967
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:05,317
Hang on, dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!

968
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,320
You know it's broken!

969
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,991
Just stop it, and try the "ooh" thing
dory talked about, will you?

970
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,117
-But I don't think I can--
-don't bail on me, Bailey!

971
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:15,166
Ooh!

972
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,628
Ooh! Ooh!

973
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:20,804
Come on, Bailey. What did you
just tell me, huh? Really focus!

974
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,344
Ooh! I feel stupid.

975
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:24,628
-Bailey.
-Sorry. Ooh!

976
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:28,301
-Hello?
-Here! We're here!

977
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:32,142
-Guys-- ooh! Guys-- ooh!
-What? What is it?

978
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:36,404
I'm getting something! Ooh!
Here we go! Ooh! Oh yes! Ooh!

979
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:41,152
I can see the quarantine!
This is amazing!

980
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:45,276
Ooh! I can see everything!
And I can see you!

981
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,122
He can see you!

982
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:51,372
My life's a rainbow! Can you see me?
Right, it doesn't work that way.

983
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,657
-Bailey!
-Okay! Tell dory to go left!

984
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,210
He says go left!

985
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,794
Left?

986
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,377
-Ooh! Straight!
-Straight!

987
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:01,342
-Straight!
-Ooh! Go right!

988
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:04,343
-Right!
-Right!

989
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:08,215
Ooh! I'm light-headed! Ooh! Wait. Ooh!

990
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:10,677
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.

991
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,676
Holy Neptune, she's not alone! Ooh!

992
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:16,806
-What is it?
-I can't tell! But it's coming for her.

993
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:20,517
Oh no! Dory, swim! Swim the other way!

994
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:22,111
-What? Where?
-What? Where?

995
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:23,784
-Go right!
-Right!

996
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,199
No, my right! Oh no!
She's heading right towards it!

997
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,195
No! Dory, turn around!

998
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,535
That's great, dory!
You're headed right toward us!

999
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:36,375
What? You want me to go right?

1000
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:37,958
No! No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!

1001
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,712
-Dory!
-Marlin?

1002
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,219
-I knew it! You're okay!
-Oh my gosh!

1003
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:49,222
It's consuming her! It's eating her alive!

1004
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,388
-You're okay!
-You found me! How did you find me?

1005
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,727
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

1006
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:59,063
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

1007
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,729
And then we just started looking.

1008
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:03,568
Dory! I'm sorry!

1009
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:05,244
Okay, what was that?

1010
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,742
Hang on. I got to take this.

1011
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,614
It's okay! Sorry for what?

1012
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,740
What? You're okay?

1013
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,909
-Yes!
-I found marlin and Nemo!

1014
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:17,288
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

1015
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:18,576
I heard.

1016
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:21,214
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

1017
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:25,206
I say we go this way. Follow me.
It's time to head home!

1018
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:29,176
Wait, wait, wait! My parents are here.

1019
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,091
-They are?
-You found your parents?

1020
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:35,601
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but I know where they are.

1021
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:40,056
I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that-- I'm getting help--

1022
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,939
-down to quarantine.
-Quarantine.

1023
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:45,775
That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...

1024
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:50,953
But secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... the exhibit.

1025
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,450
Dory?

1026
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:57,445
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

1027
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:59,961
What?
Why wouldn't they want to see you?

1028
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,961
Because... I lost them?

1029
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:08,922
Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

1030
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:12,798
They're going to have missed...
Everything about you.

1031
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,310
-Really?
-Do you know how we found you?

1032
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:17,312
-Something about a clam? Or...
-No.

1033
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:18,314
-No, an oyster.
-No.

1034
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:19,515
-Mollusk?
-No.

1035
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:20,355
-Something?
-No.

1036
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:21,769
-I don't... no?
-No clam.

1037
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:24,647
We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

1038
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:26,825
"What would dory do?"

1039
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,651
Why would you say that?

1040
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,819
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

1041
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:36,199
Stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!

1042
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,535
Outsmarting sharks
and jumping jellyfish.

1043
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:45,997
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

1044
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:52,052
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

1045
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:56,512
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

1046
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,518
And I'm sorry about that.

1047
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:07,650
But, dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

1048
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:15,201
And when you do that, you'll be home.

1049
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,211
Dad.

1050
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,419
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to dory?

1051
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:36,393
Yes, Nemo. We do.

1052
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,150
Marine life
institute

1053
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,408
hey, so how much more
we got left to load?

1054
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,075
Just this last row.

1055
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:02,624
The sooner we finish,
the sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.

1056
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,370
-Watch the turn.
-Watch what? Ow!

1057
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:08,421
-Too late.
-Okay, I think we're close. Whee!

1058
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,710
Hi!

1059
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,919
-Is this quarantine?
-Yes! This is it! We're in quarantine!

1060
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,432
My parents are here!

1061
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:20,104
Where are we going? Hey, what--
no, why are we going towards the door?

1062
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:24,274
-We are all better!
-I feel fantastic!

1063
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:26,896
Dude.

1064
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:32,316
My family! Come on, let's go!
Excuse me.

1065
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:33,571
Dory, wait a minute!

1066
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,775
I'm coming mommy! I'm coming daddy!

1067
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:44,793
Whoo-hoo! Almost home.
Almost home. I'm almost home.

1068
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,583
I think I'm getting the hang of this! Oh!

1069
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,880
I hear footsteps.

1070
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,006
-Hank!
-Quiet.

1071
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:59,639
Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.

1072
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,643
-Why?
-Her parents are there!

1073
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:07,142
Look, you've got three minutes
to get everyone in this cup with you...

1074
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:09,151
And then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?

1075
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:10,193
Got it.

1076
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:15,943
Oh boy.

1077
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:22,117
Mom? Dad?

1078
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:26,624
Mom? Dad?
Hey, everybody. It's me, dory!

1079
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:30,328
Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's dory? Dory?

1080
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,169
Mom? Dad?

1081
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,503
Mom? Dad?

1082
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,799
Mom? Dad?

1083
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:41,337
-She should just pick 2 and let's go.
-Dad.

1084
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:43,932
What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.

1085
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:47,846
Mom? Dad? Where are my parents?

1086
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,942
Dory? Are you really
Jenny and Charlie's girl?

1087
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:55,034
Yes, I am! That's me! Where are they?

1088
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:58,360
Dory, right after you disappeared,
they thought you...

1089
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:01,869
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

1090
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,869
-Uh-huh?
-Come on, come on, come on.

1091
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:08,543
And so they came here to look for you.

1092
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,365
They're here! Where are they?

1093
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:16,208
Dory, that was years ago.

1094
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,220
-Huh?
-They never came back.

1095
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,471
Oh no.

1096
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:24,972
You see, dory, when fish
don't come back from quarantine...

1097
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,307
It means they're not...

1098
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:28,926
What?

1099
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,770
Dory, they're gone.

1100
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,231
They're dead?

1101
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,572
-They wanted to find you...
-Wait. Are you sure they're gone?

1102
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:41,533
Dory, listen, it's going to be okay.

1103
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:43,067
Dory, they loved you so much.

1104
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,080
Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!

1105
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,617
-Dory, are you all right?
-Are you okay?

1106
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,918
-I was too late.
-Dory, no. No. Now listen.

1107
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:58,915
-I don't have a family.
-No, dory. That's not true.

1108
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,800
Time to go!

1109
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,797
I'm all alone.

1110
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:05,469
-Dory.
-Dory!

1111
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,143
Where's everybody else?

1112
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,600
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!

1113
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:14,099
I found the octopus!

1114
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:16,941
Where did he go?

1115
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,912
Mommy? Daddy?

1116
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,458
Help.

1117
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:41,804
No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.

1118
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:47,295
Help. Help me. Please.
Somebody help me!

1119
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,019
Hey, can-- help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!

1120
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,523
-Oh. Lost who?
-I-i-i-i...

1121
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:57,516
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

1122
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:04,033
Oh! Can you help me? I've lost...Them.

1123
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:05,526
Can you be more specific?

1124
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,947
My-- my-- them! Them! Them!

1125
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,828
Help! Help!

1126
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,955
Please? They're gone!

1127
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:40,150
I've lost... I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.

1128
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:46,534
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.

1129
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:50,415
Something important. What was it? I--

1130
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:55,542
what was it? It's going away.

1131
01:05:56,373 --> 01:06:00,383
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

1132
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:04,674
And I forget. That's what I do best.
That's what I do.

1133
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:10,548
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

1134
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:14,216
What would dory do?

1135
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,734
I would look around.

1136
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:25,071
And there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.

1137
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,739
Kelp is better. Okay.

1138
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:38,042
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

1139
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:43,754
It all looks the same,
except there's a rock...Over there.

1140
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:49,381
And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

1141
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,608
Oh this isn't going anywhere.

1142
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:13,827
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.

1143
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:18,122
And some shells...This way.

1144
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:20,786
I like shells.

1145
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:27,756
I like...Shells.

1146
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:55,446
Whoa.

1147
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:34,495
Hello. I'm--

1148
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:37,915
-dory!
-Dory! You're here.

1149
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,826
-Oh my baby!
-You're really here.

1150
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,045
-Let me look at you.
-You found us.

1151
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:43,375
-I'm never letting you go again.
-Oh my missing girl, you're here.

1152
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:44,538
-My baby!
-It's you.

1153
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:48,378
-Yes! Oh absolutely!
-It's really you! Mom, you're here.

1154
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:51,205
-I am, I...
-And dad, so are you.

1155
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,838
Right here, kelpcake.

1156
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:58,046
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,892
Oh honey. Oh honey, no. Kelpcake.

1158
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:04,728
I know I've got a problem. I know I'm--
and I'm so sorry.

1159
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:09,025
And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.

1160
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:11,896
But my thoughts --they leave my head
and ideas change.

1161
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:14,199
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

1162
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:19,413
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

1163
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,247
-What?
-You found us!

1164
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:25,173
That's right. You found us.

1165
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:30,127
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

1166
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:34,125
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

1167
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,428
Exactly!

1168
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:39,104
But I thought you were gone.
How did you--

1169
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:42,219
we went into quarantine to look for you,
but you weren't there.

1170
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:45,391
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1171
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,771
Through the pipes.
That's right, sweetie. And so we did too.

1172
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:51,778
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

1173
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:54,282
-We thought you might come back.
-We stayed and waited for you.

1174
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:57,454
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1175
01:09:58,407 --> 01:09:59,487
Shells.

1176
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:09,795
And you found us.
Oh honey, you found us.

1177
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,460
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

1178
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:18,926
You remembered
in your own, amazing, dory way.

1179
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:24,310
I did. All by myself.

1180
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:29,984
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

1181
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:31,817
Oh, my poor little girl.

1182
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:35,822
Oh, I haven't been all by myself--
marlin and Nemo!

1183
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,948
-Nobody saw where dory went?
-No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

1184
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:42,034
Seriously?
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.

1185
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,874
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

1186
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:45,536
-We're looking--
-me help you?

1187
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,173
Dad, look! It's dory.

1188
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:55,763
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
i knew she'd find a way-- what?

1189
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,341
Hey, where's dory? Is she with you?

1190
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:02,515
I'm sorry. I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

1191
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,598
-What?
-All right. Let's get going.

1192
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:05,893
No!

1193
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:08,556
And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

1194
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,347
-A whale?
-Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

1195
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,811
Actually marlin never believes
i even know how to speak whale...

1196
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,861
But you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

1197
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,525
You know, I like this marlin already.

1198
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,153
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

1199
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,741
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1200
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,617
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

1201
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,870
What would dory do?

1202
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,825
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

1203
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,543
Wait. Wait I know this place.

1204
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,750
Hello. I'm sigourney Weaver.

1205
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,548
-There!
-Won't you please join us?

1206
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:40,719
-That's the marine life institute.
-Oh, you were born there.

1207
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:41,724
Dory, is that where your friends are?

1208
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:45,925
Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.

1209
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,980
A truck. They're in the truck!

1210
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:51,059
That means I could--
never see them again!

1211
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,268
No! No, no, no. What would dory do?

1212
01:11:54,231 --> 01:11:58,401
I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

1213
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,736
Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I-- I...

1214
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:06,735
I really miss them. I've said that before.

1215
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:10,411
Dory?

1216
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:15,249
Mom, marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.

1217
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:19,299
And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

1218
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:22,093
Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't--
what's another word for fate?

1219
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:27,259
Like destiny. Destiny? Destiny!

1220
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:29,559
-Dory?
-Destiny!

1221
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:32,985
-Morning, dest--
-sh. It's dory. Something's wrong.

1222
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:38,111
Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.

1223
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,072
-Destiny?
-We got to jump.

1224
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:42,816
-Jump?
-No time to argue!

1225
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,446
Destiny!

1226
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:47,453
Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!

1227
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:51,748
-No, no. Destiny.
-Oh no! That's bad! What do we do?

1228
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,078
-All right.
-Yes.

1229
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,996
-Here we go. One. Two.
-Yes. Yes.

1230
01:12:58,086 --> 01:12:59,956
I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

1231
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:03,634
Destiny! I've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1232
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,470
You've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1233
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:06,966
I will be your eyes.

1234
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:09,467
You can be my eyes. But the walls!

1235
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,678
There are no walls in the ocean!

1236
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:15,439
-No walls?
-It's your destiny, destiny.

1237
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,612
Well, why didn't you say so?

1238
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:21,153
What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!

1239
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,200
Mom, dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.

1240
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,288
Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?

1241
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,698
They look just like you!

1242
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:36,002
Hello. I'm Bailey. Mrs. dory, Mr. dory.

1243
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,536
-Oh please, call me Jenny.
-Oh and I'm Charlie.

1244
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:39,539
Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

1245
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,050
Okay, what truck?

1246
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:45,181
Bailey, status report.

1247
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:48,512
Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.

1248
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:50,849
Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway

1249
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,351
and it's heading south. Ooh.

1250
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,806
Let's go. We are stopping that truck.

1251
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:58,978
-This I've got to see.
-Yeah, yeah, me too!

1252
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,320
Oh boy, this is gonna be good!

1253
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:04,282
What the-- Gerald!
Have you lost your marbles?

1254
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,320
-Don't get used to it, Gerald!
-Cheeky joke.

1255
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:12,414
Bailey, I forgot everything.
Catch me up.

1256
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:15,538
Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.

1257
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:18,246
Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.

1258
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:22,337
Oh, look, there's a bunch of cute otters
over there. I want one! Ow!

1259
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:27,092
Ow, Bailey!

1260
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,256
Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.

1261
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:31,098
-Okay, what would dory do?
-I don't see how we can get on it.

1262
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:33,263
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

1263
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:36,022
Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

1264
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,355
People stop to look at things. Things
that they like. Things that are cute.

1265
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:41,864
Things that are cute! Okay, I got it.

1266
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:43,609
-What? What is it?
-Quickly before I forget.

1267
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:46,395
Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.

1268
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:47,150
Got it.

1269
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:50,069
You guys, follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.

1270
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,790
Whoa. Dory.
Honey, you're not leaving us again.

1271
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,622
Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.

1272
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:59,617
Dory, what happens if--
you know, if you're gone for too long.

1273
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,501
And what if you get confused and that
makes you distracted. And what if--

1274
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:03,918
I lose you again?

1275
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:06,547
Yes.

1276
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,798
Mom, dad,
it's gonna be okay because...

1277
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:14,759
I know that even if I forget
i can find you again.

1278
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:22,811
Ooh. Okay a little left. Ooh.
Back the other way a bit.

1279
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:25,111
Ooh. Okay, that's it. Go! Don't do it.

1280
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:27,435
-Bailey!
-Okay, now! Now! Do it! Do it!

1281
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,279
-Time for your idea.
-Okay. What idea?

1282
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,419
Okay. What do I do?
What would dory do?

1283
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,921
Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.

1284
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,963
Cars have to stop.
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!

1285
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,590
Look out!

1286
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,183
They're so cute!

1287
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:56,223
Look at them! There must be one, twoâ¦

1288
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:02,103
-what's going on, dad?
-I don't know how.

1289
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,151
I don't know in what way, but I think
this has something to do with--

1290
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:11,651
-dory!
-Water. Water. I need water.

1291
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:12,952
Are you crazy? How'd you get here?

1292
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:16,119
-Dory!
-Oh!

1293
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,003
-I thought we'd never see you again.
-Aw, me too.

1294
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:22,252
But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
i just couldn't forget you.

1295
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,920
I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much, huh?

1296
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,754
-We're family?
-Mm-hmm.

1297
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:30,339
Do you know what that feels like?

1298
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:33,843
Yes, I know what that feels like.

1299
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,355
Aw!

1300
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:39,853
Hey! Hey, come on. Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo!

1301
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:42,557
-Oh no. There goes our ride.
-Back in the water. Come on.

1302
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:45,686
Dory, the traffic is starting to move.

1303
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:50,495
Leave it to me. I got this.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

1304
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:53,817
Becky! Becky, come back.
We need your help! Becky!

1305
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:56,911
Dory, follow me.

1306
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:01,583
No, no, wait. We don't have dory!
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.

1307
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:06,537
We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky! Loo-loo. Ooo-roo-roo.

1308
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:08,881
-Please don't eat us!
-Where's dory?

1309
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:10,666
-Who are you?
-Jenny?

1310
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,007
-Marlin?
-Charlie?

1311
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:16,010
-Nemo? Thank you so much.
-Thank you for taking care of dory.

1312
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:18,098
Dory! She's still in the truck.

1313
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:22,063
Becky! Fetch dory! Ooo-roo. Dor-roo.

1314
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,731
Okay, kid. I guess this is goodbye.

1315
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,066
-No!
-What do you mean, "no"?

1316
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:31,743
You're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.

1317
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:33,397
What is it with you
and ruining my plans?

1318
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:36,567
Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One! And it is to--

1319
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,410
no, you listen to me. What is so great
about plans? I never had a plan.

1320
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:44,042
Did I plan to lose my parents? No.
Did I plan to find marlin? No.

1321
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:46,826
Did you and I plan to meet?
Wait. Did we?

1322
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:49,129
-Are you almost done?
-Well, I don't think we did.

1323
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:52,093
And that's because the best things
happen by chance. Because that's life.

1324
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:56,796
That's you being with me out
in the ocean not safe in some glass box.

1325
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:57,969
-Can I say something?
-I'm not done!

1326
01:17:58,095 --> 01:18:01,265
A friend of mine-- her name's
sigourney-- once told me that...

1327
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,931
All it takes is three simple steps:

1328
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,480
Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing--

1329
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:07,735
release!

1330
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,942
That's right! So what do you say?

1331
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:14,068
Release! Release! Release!

1332
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:17,526
Release! Release! Release!

1333
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:20,236
Release! Release! Release!

1334
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,794
I was gonna say, "okay."

1335
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:25,462
Not good.

1336
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,789
-Oh no! They're going away!
-Oh no! Dory! What do we do?

1337
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,456
Quick! Guys, grab my fin!

1338
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:35,337
Ooh! He's trying to get the door open.
Ooh. It's locked from the outside.

1339
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:36,634
Come on, dory. You can do it.

1340
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,140
Destiny! Destiny! Wall! Wall! Wall!

1341
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:43,010
-Dory, no! Wait!
-Dory!

1342
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:47,192
-Bailey, where are they headed?
-Ooh. I'm losing them.

1343
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:53,567
Dory, it's over.

1344
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:56,817
-No, there's got to be a way.
-Yeah. There's a way!

1345
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:59,607
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

1346
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,121
But-- there's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

1347
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,831
There isn't, dory. I'm telling you.
This time there is no other way.

1348
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:07,408
Well, what about that?

1349
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,498
Holy carp. There is another way.

1350
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:14,094
Take a deep breath, kid.

1351
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:16,513
Release! Release! Release!

1352
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:20,683
Release! Release! Release! Release!

1353
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:28,889
-What is that?
-I donât care what it is! Get it off!

1354
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:30,439
What the--

1355
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,356
suck it, bipeds.

1356
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:36,784
All right, Hank, you've got seven arms--
i don't know. Just try something.

1357
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,152
Okay. Here we go.

1358
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:43,528
-Huh? Hey! Stop. Stop. Wait! No!
-Hey! Hey! Stop. Wait. Oh no!

1359
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:46,367
-That's doing something.
-And we are moving. Good job, Hank.

1360
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:51,465
-Wait, wait, wait! Come on! Whoa!
-Hey! What? Hey! Stop! Wait. Wait.

1361
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,883
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to drive. Certainly I can't do--

1362
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:56,705
I'm not in any position--
but could you go faster?

1363
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,880
No! No, no! No, no, no!

1364
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:04,514
-Whoo!
-Hey! Give us our truck back!

1365
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:06,218
I can't see squat.
Which way are we going?

1366
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:10,310
Okay. Well, all the cars
are going left so go left.

1367
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:13,895
Gilman street. Ashby Avenue. Powell.

1368
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:16,519
Gilman street again. Huh.
Gilman street again.

1369
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:18,527
How much longer
are we gonna veer left?

1370
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,955
Okay, we just need to know
how we got on,

1371
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,372
then we'll know how to get off.

1372
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,042
Well, let me know
when you figure it out.

1373
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,750
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.

1374
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:31,252
Hey, I know those guys!
That's where we came from. Turn right.

1375
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:32,831
Here we go!

1376
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:42,093
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait!
-Oh my-- whoa. Hey!

1377
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:44,723
We are so fired.

1378
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:49,350
Keep straight. Straight. Left. Left.
No, no, no. Right. Right. Right.

1379
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:52,524
-Good driving, Hank.
-Pay attention to the road.

1380
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,904
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Uh-oh.
Fork in the road.

1381
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:57,402
-Which way?
-Ocean. Ocean. Hey, a boat!

1382
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,364
You know, I haven't had
great experiences with boats, but i--

1383
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:02,954
-which way?
-Boats go to the ocean. Right!

1384
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:04,278
Hold on!

1385
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:08,704
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

1386
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:11,957
Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't know, but--

1387
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,289
well, something will come and--

1388
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,841
seagulls. Hank, follow those birds!
The ocean's left, Hank.

1389
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,257
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

1390
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:25,219
Ooh. Hold on. Ooh.
I'm getting something.

1391
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:26,642
Is it them? Is everything perfect?

1392
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:30,313
Uh-oh, it's the fuzz. Busted.

1393
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:37,312
Okay, we're good. The ocean!
It's straight ahead. Floor it!

1394
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:38,441
Now we're talking.

1395
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:43,150
-Oh. Uh-oh!
-What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

1396
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:45,697
Oh no. What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?

1397
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,078
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

1398
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:50,871
I'm okay with crazy.

1399
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:52,788
All right, Hank.

1400
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:56,963
Ooh. There's no way out. It's over.
They're going to fish jail! Ooh!

1401
01:21:57,125 --> 01:22:02,125
Wait. Ooh. Oh no. Ooh.
Get back! Incoming!

1402
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:37,713
Fish!

1403
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:48,391
What lies before you represents
the third and final part of the...

1404
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,349
Marine life mission.

1405
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:55,682
Rescue, rehabilitation, and release.

1406
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:58,235
Come to papa.

1407
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,069
I'm sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

1408
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:13,873
One, two, three, four...

1409
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:18,833
Wait a minute. Why am I counting?
Hey, where is everyone?

1410
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:23,207
Uh-oh, did they leave me? No! No, no.
They wouldn't do that.

1411
01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:26,258
Okay. That's okay. I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?

1412
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:30,433
I was covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

1413
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,764
Okay, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

1414
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,760
Oh, i-- five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

1415
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,308
Ready or not, here I come!

1416
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:37,773
Ha, found you!

1417
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:38,775
I see you!

1418
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:39,984
Haha! Gotcha!

1419
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:42,105
All right, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

1420
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,442
-Aw, man.
-Ah, nobody found me!

1421
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:46,528
Bring it in. Time for another--

1422
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,150
don't touch me.
Time for another lesson.

1423
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,820
When is Mr. ray coming back
from his migration?

1424
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:53,119
If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

1425
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,123
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

1426
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:57,615
Okay kids, who wants to learn
about echolocation?

1427
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:58,998
-Boo.
-Nobody.

1428
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:01,422
Oh, come on, guys.
It's actually really cool.

1429
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,133
Okay, kelpcake. Have fun.

1430
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,923
Nice day for a swim, huh?

1431
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,957
All right. Bye mom. Bye dad.

1432
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,630
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

1433
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:12,091
You coming, dory?

1434
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,221
Me? Oh I'm just going to the dropoff.

1435
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:20,145
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!
That's-- that's a good idea?

1436
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,360
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

1437
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:26,944
The view. Well, you have a good time!

1438
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:31,649
All by yourself. Not getting lost.

1439
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,458
Oh!

1440
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:46,746
Huh?

1441
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:55,352
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, no, dory. Dory. Dory! D--

1442
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:10,487
-hey, marlin.
-Oh, hey. Hello, dory.

1443
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,112
You all right? You look worried.

1444
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,619
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

1445
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:21,582
What?

1446
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,293
Well, I just--

1447
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,458
you did it.

1448
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,550
-Yay!
-You did it, kelpcake.

1449
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:33,224
-Yes!
-Did what?

1450
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:38,472
Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

1451
01:25:38,597 --> 01:25:41,847
Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

1452
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,305
-Yeah.
-Do you know what this means?

1453
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:49,480
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, dory.

1454
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:50,690
Really?

1455
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,070
Mommy, can I go play with them?

1456
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:59,159
-Yes.
-Absolutely! Go get them, kelpcake.

1457
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:06,916
Yeah. I did it.

1458
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,550
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1459
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:19,725
It really is quite a view.

1460
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:24,772
Yep.

1461
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,020
Unforgettable.

1462
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:46,545
The end

1463
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:28,481
off, off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off!

1464
01:35:31,273 --> 01:35:34,943
Come on. Roll, roll. That's it. Hurry!
That's it. Just roll!

1465
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:35,820
I'm right behind you.

1466
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:38,486
You can do it! Just a little farther.
That's it!

1467
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:40,815
I am truly going to vomit!

1468
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:44,161
-VoilÃ !
-All right, gang, good work.

1469
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:47,831
Look, flo, we made it!

1470
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:50,578
We won't have any more problems
from here on out.

1471
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:54,500
No respect for ocean life.

1472
01:35:55,506 --> 01:35:56,506
Now what?
