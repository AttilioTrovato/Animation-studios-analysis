1
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,514
In the beginning...

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,517
there was only ocean...

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,646
until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>Te Fifi.</i>

5
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:10,027
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:13,155
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:17,535
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,205
But in time...

9
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,375
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,669
They believed
if they could possess it...

11
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,464
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

12
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,009
And one day...

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,137
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,683
<i>voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.</i>

15
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:46,856
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,900
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,403
A trickster.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,074
A shapeshifter who
could change form...

19
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,870
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,206
And his name...

21
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,251
was Maui.

22
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,223
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

23
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,143
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

24
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,205
Maui tried to escape...

25
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,750
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

26
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,254
Te Ka!

27
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,424
A demon of earth and fire.

28
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,935
Maui was struck from the sky...

29
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,522
never to be seen again.

30
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:14,777
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

31
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,738
were lost to the sea.

32
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,074
Where, even now...

33
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,201
1,000 years later...

34
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,954
Te Ka and the demons of the deep...

35
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,123
still hunt for the heart.

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,627
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

37
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,088
chasing away our fish...

38
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,466
draining the life
from island after island...

39
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:40,886
until every one of us is devoured...

40
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,723
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

41
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,642
of inescapable death!

42
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,482
But one day...

43
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,651
the heart will be found...

44
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,904
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

45
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,406
find Maui...

46
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,658
deliver him across the great ocean...

47
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,994
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

48
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,829
and save us all.

49
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

50
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:10,624
Papa.

51
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,501
No one goes outside the reef.

52
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,755
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

53
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,673
There are no monsters.

54
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,635
Monsters!

55
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,846
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!

56
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:28,017
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

57
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,645
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

59
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,647
...we'll be fine.

60
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,274
The legends are true.

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,026
Someone will have to go.

62
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,361
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

63
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,198
Who would want to go anywhere else?

64
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,569
Shoo, shoo!

65
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,546
Moana!

66
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,689
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

67
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,483
What? I wanna's go back.

68
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,235
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

69
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,363
It's dangerous.

70
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,367
Moana, come on.

71
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,535
Let's go back to the village.

72
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,581
You are the next great chief
of our people.

73
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,751
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

74
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,297
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

75
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,144
Moana

76
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,689
Make way, make way

77
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,732
Moana, it's time you knew

78
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,653
The village of Motunui is all you need

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,905
The dancers are practicing

80
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,408
They dance to an ancient song

81
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:15,411
<i>Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need</i>

82
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,496
This tradition is our mission

83
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,249
And Moana, there's so much to do

84
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,792
Don't trip on the taro root

85
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,086
That's all you need

86
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,213
We share everything we make

87
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,257
We joke and we weave our baskets

88
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,718
The fishermen come back from the sea

89
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:32,386
I wanna see

90
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,304
Don't walk away

91
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,390
Moana, stay on the ground now

92
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,434
Our people will need a chief

93
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,519
- And there you are
- There you are

94
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,563
There comes a day

95
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,442
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

96
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,444
Where you are

97
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,195
Consider the coconut

98
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,573
- The what
- Consider its tree

99
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,118
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

100
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,746
We make our nets from the fibers

101
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,748
The water is sweet inside

102
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:05,044
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

103
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,962
Consider the coconuts

104
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,881
The trunks and the leaves

105
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,550
The island gives us what we need

106
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,469
And no one leaves

107
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,095
That's right, we stay

108
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,889
We're safe and we're well-provided

109
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,974
And when we look to the future

110
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,642
There you are

111
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,479
You'll be okay

112
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,439
In time you'll learn just as I did

113
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,318
You must find happiness
right where you are

114
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,828
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

115
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:43,999
The water is mischievous
Hal! I like how it misbehaves

116
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,087
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

117
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:52,758
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

118
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:58,806
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

119
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:03,268
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

120
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:07,606
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

121
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,276
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are

122
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,365
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

123
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,993
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

124
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,292
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

125
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,881
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

126
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,551
This is a sacred place.

127
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,719
A place of chiefs.

128
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,388
There will come a time...

129
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:44,518
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

130
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,229
Like I did. Like my father did.

131
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,400
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

132
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,569
And on that day...

133
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,988
when you add your stone...

134
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,700
you will raise this whole island higher.

135
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,661
You are the future of our people, Moana.

136
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,372
And they are not out there.

137
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,417
They are right here.

138
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,753
It's time to be who they need you to be.

139
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,340
- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers

140
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,509
- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside

141
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,845
- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs

142
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,763
- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside

143
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,765
- The village believes in us
- That's right

144
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,434
The village believes

145
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,769
The island gives us what we need

146
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,938
And no one leaves

147
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,440
So here I'll stay

148
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:35,444
My home, my people beside me
And when [think of tomorrow

149
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,654
There we are

150
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,615
I'll lead the way

151
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,783
I'll have my people to guide me

152
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,577
We'll build our future together

153
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,787
Where we are

154
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,664
'Cause every path leads ya back to

155
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,291
Where you are

156
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,752
You can find happiness right

157
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,795
Where you are

158
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,965
Where you are

159
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,306
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

160
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,474
Fixed!

161
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,767
Not the fronds.

162
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:11,063
- Wind shifted the post.
- Ah!

163
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,191
Mmm! That's good pork!

164
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,320
Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't...

165
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,491
What?
They're calling me, so I got to... Bye!

166
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,160
Ow! Ow! Ow!

167
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,495
You're doing great.

168
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,080
Is it done yet?

169
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,583
So close.

170
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

171
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:54,481
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

172
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,567
Should we maybe just cook him?

173
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,947
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

174
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,826
Far beneath in some cases.

175
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,203
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei

176
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,454
than meets the eye.

177
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:17,587
It's the harvest.

178
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,133
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

179
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:28,932
Well...

180
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:33,979
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

181
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,063
There.

182
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:38,859
Thanks, Moana.

183
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,028
She's doing great.

184
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,408
This suits you.

185
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
Chief?

186
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,412
There's something you need to see.

187
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:52,414
Our traps in the east lagoon...

188
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,750
they're pulling up less and less fish.

189
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,586
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

190
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,921
Uh, we have. There's no fish.

191
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,258
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

192
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,468
We tried.

193
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,927
The windward side.

194
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,597
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

195
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,432
We've tried the whole lagoon.

196
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,934
They're just gone.

197
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,228
Have you tried using a different bait?

198
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:16,772
I don't think it's the bait.

199
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,440
There's no fish.

200
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,317
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

201
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,445
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

202
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,655
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

203
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,658
What if we fish beyond the reef?

204
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,953
No one goes beyond the reef.

205
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,581
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

206
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,666
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

207
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,460
We have one rule.

208
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,795
An old rule, when there were fish.

209
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,922
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

210
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,009
...instead of endangering our people
So you can run right back to the water.

211
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,185
Every time I think you're past this...

212
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,107
No one goes beyond the reef!

213
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,825
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

214
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,993
Standing on a boat.

215
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:16,998
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

216
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,167
But you still do.

217
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,046
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

218
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,799
Because he was you.

219
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,468
Drawn to the ocean.

220
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,011
Down by the shore.

221
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,806
He took a canoe, Moana.

222
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,433
He crossed the reef...

223
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,686
and found an unforgiving sea.

224
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,896
Waves like mountains.

225
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,192
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.

226
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,945
Your dad couldn't save him.

227
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:52,367
He's hoping he can save you.

228
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,203
Sometimes...

229
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,291
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

230
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,086
it's just not meant to be.

231
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:21,229
I've been staring
at the edge of the water

232
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:24,566
Long as I can remember

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,652
Never really knowing why

234
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,408
! Wish I could be the perfect daughter

235
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,411
But I come back to the water

236
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,788
No matter how hard I try

237
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,835
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

238
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,880
Every path I make
Every road leads back

239
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,591
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

240
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,177
Where I long to be

241
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,846
See the line where the
Sky meets the sea

242
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,265
It calls me

243
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:00,268
And no one knows

244
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,271
How far it goes

245
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:08,610
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

246
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,280
One day I'll know

247
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>If 1 go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go</i>

248
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,871
! Know everybody on this island

249
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,624
Seems so happy on this island

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,335
Everything is by design

251
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,840
! Know everybody on this island

252
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,052
Has a role on this island

253
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,805
So maybe I can roll with mine

254
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,017
! Can lead with pride
I can make us strong

255
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,728
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

256
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:47,148
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

257
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,192
What is wrong with me

258
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,948
See the light as it shines on the sea

259
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,826
It's blinding

260
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,036
But no one knows

261
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,665
How deep it goes

262
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,917
And it seems like it's calling out to me

263
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,878
So come find me

264
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,590
And let me know

265
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,218
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

266
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,429
The line where the sky meets the sea

267
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:20,348
It calls me

268
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,143
And no one knows

269
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,646
How far it goes

270
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,526
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

271
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,362
One day I'll know

272
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:39,826
How far I'll go

273
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:43,538
Whoa.

274
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,710
We're okay, Pua.

275
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,420
I can do this.

276
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,716
There's more fish beyond the reef.

277
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,637
There's more beyond the reef.

278
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,521
Not so bad.

279
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,281
Pua!

280
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,627
Whatever just happened...

281
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,129
blame it on the pig.

282
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,505
Gramma.

283
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,970
Are you gonna tell Dad?

284
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,557
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

285
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,562
He was right.

286
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,314
About going out there.

287
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,820
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

288
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,992
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

289
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,494
Put that stone up there.

290
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:53,126
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

291
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,962
You said that's what you wanted.

292
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:57,922
It is.

293
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,678
When I die...

294
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,348
I'm going to come back as one of these.

295
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,643
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

296
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,479
Why are you acting weird?

297
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,149
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

298
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:20,487
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

299
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,490
Is there something you wanna tell me?

300
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,868
Is there something you want to hear?

301
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:34,709
You've been told
all our people's stories...

302
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,212
but one.

303
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,672
What is this place?

304
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:44,302
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

305
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,230
Ooh!

306
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,649
What's in there?

307
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,320
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

308
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,490
Who are you meant to be?

309
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,495
Go inside...

310
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,247
bang the drum...

311
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,707
and find out.

312
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,988
Whoa.

313
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
Oh.

314
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,819
Bang the drum.

315
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:59,455
We read the wind and the sky

316
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,457
When the sun is high

317
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:04,419
We sail the length of the seas

318
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,254
On the ocean breeze

319
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:08,965
At night we name every star

320
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:11,259
We know where we are

321
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,638
We know who we are
Who we are

322
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:20,601
We set a course to find

323
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,314
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

324
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,069
We keep our island in our mind

325
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,239
And when it's time to find home

326
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,283
We know the way

327
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:40,288
We are explorers reading every sign

328
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:45,460
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

329
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,678
We know the way

330
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,269
We were voyagers.

331
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,521
We were voyagers!

332
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,567
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

333
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,486
We were voyagers!

334
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:14,447
Why'd we stop?

335
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:16,616
Maui.

336
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,828
When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.

337
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,331
Te Ka awoke.

338
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:27,251
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

339
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:31,672
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

340
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,676
and now we have forgotten who we are.

341
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,764
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

342
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:42,016
chasing away our fish...

343
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,935
draining the life...

344
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,730
from island after island.

345
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,944
Our island.

346
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,404
But, one day...

347
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:59,659
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

348
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,745
deliver him across the great ocean...

349
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,291
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

350
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,046
I was there that day.

351
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,049
The ocean chose you.

352
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,935
I thought it was a dream.

353
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,609
Nope!

354
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:38,281
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

355
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:40,199
at the bottom of his hook.

356
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,452
Follow it, and you will find him.

357
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,081
But why would it choose me?

358
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,293
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

359
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,087
But I know who does!

360
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,388
The crops
are turning black.

361
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:04,348
What about the fish?

362
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,225
This is happening all over the island.

363
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,810
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

364
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,645
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

365
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,231
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

366
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,941
There's a cavern of boats.

367
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,651
Huge canoes.

368
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:19,405
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

369
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,034
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

370
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,872
You told me to help our people.

371
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,291
This is how we help our people.

372
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,751
Dad?

373
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:32,793
What are you doing?

374
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,463
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

375
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,672
No! Don't!

376
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,383
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

377
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,927
There is no heart!

378
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:42,762
This is just a rock!

379
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:43,804
No!

380
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,320
Chief! It's your mother!

381
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,998
Mother...

382
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,641
What can be done?

383
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,940
Go.

384
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,817
Gramma.

385
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,570
Go.

386
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,532
Not now. I can't.

387
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,033
You must!

388
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,578
The ocean chose you.

389
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,247
Follow the fish hook.

390
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,415
Gramma...

391
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,667
And when you find Maui...

392
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,671
you grab him by the ear. You say...

393
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,091
"am Moana of Motunui.

394
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,677
"You will board my boat...

395
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,221
"sail across the sea...

396
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,392
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

397
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,563
I can't leave you.

398
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:21,235
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

399
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:35,583
Go!

400
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,222
There's a line
where the sky meets the sea

401
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,224
And it calls me

402
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:55,311
But no one knows

403
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:59,148
How far it goes

404
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:04,278
All that time wondering where I need
to be is behind me

405
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,406
I'm on my own

406
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,451
To worlds unknown

407
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,662
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

408
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,539
Is a choice I make

409
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,292
Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown

410
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,879
Where I go alone
Where I long to be

411
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,641
See her light up the night in the sea

412
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:36,477
She calls me

413
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,271
And yes, I know

414
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,899
That I can go

415
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:47,071
There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me

416
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,616
Soon I'll know

417
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,244
How far I'll go

418
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:17,560
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

419
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,106
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

420
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,816
I am Moana...

421
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,318
of Motu...

422
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,071
<i>...</i>

423
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,709
Heihei?

424
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,276
It's okay. You're all right.

425
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,069
See?

426
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,281
There we go. Nice water.

427
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,950
The ocean is a friend of mine.

428
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,287
Heihei?

429
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,581
Heihei!

430
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,680
Stay.

431
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,523
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

432
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,200
I am Moana of Motunui.

433
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,495
You will board my boat...

434
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,499
sail... across the sea...

435
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,793
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

436
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,965
I am Moana of Motu...

437
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,342
Board my boat!

438
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,388
Oh, no.

439
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,396
No, no, no!

440
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,826
Ocean...

441
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,912
can I get a little help?

442
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,500
No, no.

443
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,003
Please.

444
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,296
Come on!

445
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,100
Help me!

446
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
Please!

447
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:43,390
Whew!

448
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:49,605
Um...

449
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,814
What?

450
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:52,775
I said help me!

451
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:55,110
And wrecking my boat?

452
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,279
Not helping!

453
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:01,867
Fish pee in you all day!

454
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,160
So...

455
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,175
Maui?

456
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:26,684
Maui!

457
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,439
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

458
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,316
I am Moana of Motunui.

459
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,026
You will board my boat.

460
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,112
No. You will board my boat.

461
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:41,031
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

462
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:43,951
You will board my...

463
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,245
Boat! A boat!

464
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:49,081
The gods have given me a...

465
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,972
Maui, shapeshifter...

466
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:07,266
demigod of the wind and sea...

467
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,476
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

468
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,019
What?

469
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,647
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

470
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,982
hero of men.

471
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,068
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

472
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,029
I am...

473
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,364
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

474
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,825
And women. Men and women.

475
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,993
Both. All.

476
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,745
Not a guy, girl thing.

477
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,663
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

478
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,998
You're doing great.

479
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,875
What? No! I'm here to...

480
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,418
Of course.

481
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,753
Yes, yes, yes.

482
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,714
Maui always has time for his fans.

483
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,258
When you use a bird to write with...

484
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,178
it's called tweeting.

485
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,684
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

486
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,687
You are not my hero.

487
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,398
And I'm not here
SO you can sign my oar!

488
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,193
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

489
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,403
And you will board my boat...

490
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,740
and sail across the sea and put it back!

491
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:05,991
Um...

492
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,786
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

493
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,871
which is impossible because...

494
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,831
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

495
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,250
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

496
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,712
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

497
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,257
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

498
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:23,425
is "thank you."

499
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,052
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

500
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,220
What? No, no, no!

501
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:27,721
I didn't... I wasn't...

502
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,931
Why would I ever say that?

503
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,307
Okay, okay.

504
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,269
! See what's happening
Yeah

505
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:37,397
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

506
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,149
You don't even know how you feel

507
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:40,943
It's adorable

508
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,987
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

509
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,407
Open your eyes
Let's begin

510
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:48,617
Yes, it's really me

511
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,744
It's Maui
Breathe it in

512
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,579
I know it's a lot

513
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:54,665
The hair
The bod

514
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,584
When you're staring at a demigod

515
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,420
What can I say except

516
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:01,588
You're welcome

517
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:05,092
For the tides, the sun, the sky

518
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,594
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

519
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,429
You're welcome

520
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:12,474
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

521
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,769
What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky

522
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,771
When you were waddling yay high?

523
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,064
This guy

524
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,569
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

525
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:25,946
You're looking at him yo

526
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,783
Oh also I lassoed the sun

527
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,243
You're welcome

528
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,787
To stretch your days and bring you fun

529
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,748
Also I harnessed the breeze

530
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,166
You're welcome

531
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,627
<i>To fill your sails and shake your trees</i>

532
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:44,756
So what can I say except
You're welcome

533
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:47,384
For the islands I pulled from the sea

534
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,178
There's no need to pray
It's okay

535
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,680
You're welcome

536
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:55,642
Ha
! Guess it's just my way of being me

537
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:56,810
You're welcome

538
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:59,104
You're welcome

539
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:00,814
Well come to think of it

540
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,066
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

541
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:04,902
I could explain every
natural phenomenon

542
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,322
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around

543
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,324
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

544
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,825
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

545
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,785
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

546
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,537
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

547
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,874
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

548
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,834
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

549
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:23,295
Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'

550
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,005
Ha ha
Ha ha

551
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,049
Ha ha

00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:30,177
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

553
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,511
You're welcome

554
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:34,306
For the wonderful world you know

555
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,351
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

556
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:38,560
You're welcome

557
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,355
Well come to think of it
! Got to go

558
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,399
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

559
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:45,692
You're welcome

560
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:48,362
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

561
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

562
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:52,741
You're welcome

563
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,160
"Cause Maui can do
everything but float

564
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,204
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

565
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,539
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

566
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:00,707
Huh?

567
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,042
And thank you!

568
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
Hey!

569
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:07,547
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

570
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,218
You're welcome

571
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,346
You're so welcome.

572
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,187
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

573
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,271
I'm going to get my hook.

574
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,565
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

575
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,944
Okay, talk to the back.

576
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:35,909
Boat snack.

577
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:05,564
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

578
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:08,400
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

579
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,111
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

580
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,865
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

581
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,451
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

582
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,976
I could watch that all day.

583
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,811
Okay. Enjoy the island.

584
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,313
Maui, out.

585
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,898
No! Stop!

586
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,983
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

587
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,251
Did not see that coming.

588
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,423
I am Moana of Motunui.

589
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,925
This is my canoe...

590
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,676
and you will journey to...

591
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,556
All right, get over it. We got to move.

592
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:24,768
And she's back.

593
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,479
I am Moana of Motunui...

594
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,860
It was Moana, right?

595
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,028
Yes.

596
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,697
And you will restore the heart!

597
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,210
All right. I'm out.

598
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,716
Oh, come on!

599
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,386
What is your problem?

600
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,889
Are you afraid of it?

601
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:04,558
No! No.

602
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,101
I'm not afraid.

603
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,065
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

604
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,233
You, stop it.

605
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,069
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

606
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,363
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

607
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,698
and I lost my hook.

608
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,032
Get it away from me.

609
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:22,868
Get this away?

610
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:24,995
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

611
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,830
Stop that. I will smite you!

612
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,665
You wanna get smote?

613
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,833
Smotten?

614
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:33,503
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

615
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,380
it's a homing beacon of death.

616
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,841
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

617
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,010
Come for this? The heart?

618
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
You mean this heart right here?

619
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,304
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

620
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,889
Come and get it!

621
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,265
You are gonna get us killed!

622
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:48,935
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
SO you can put it back.

623
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,103
Thank you.

624
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,438
You're welcome.

625
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:57,444
Kakamora.

626
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,862
Kaka-what?

627
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,447
Murdering little pirates.

628
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:04,034
Wonder what they're here for.

629
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,749
They're kinda cute.

630
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:29,517
Ocean!

631
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:31,478
Do something! Help us!

632
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:34,064
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

633
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,732
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

634
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,902
You can't sail?

635
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:40,487
[, Uh...

636
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,155
I am self-taught.

637
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,669
Can't you shapeshift or something?

638
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,878
Do you see my hook?

639
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,630
No magic hook, no magic powers!

640
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,408
Their boat is turning into more boats!

641
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,513
Yep, I just did that.

642
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:55,353
No, no!

643
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,440
Heihei!

644
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:12,871
Maui!

645
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,039
They took the heart!

646
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:17,584
That's a chicken.

647
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,753
The heart is in the...

648
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,837
We have to get him back!

649
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:27,385
Maui!

650
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,971
Cheeeehoooo!

651
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,693
There! Right there!

652
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,861
You're turning?

653
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,154
What are you doing?

654
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,447
Escaping!

655
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,782
The heart!

656
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,742
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

657
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,911
Besides, you got a better one.

658
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:53,995
Hey!

659
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,080
What am I gonna steer with?

660
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,957
They're just gonna kill ya!

661
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:03,380
Coconuts.

662
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,465
Got it!

663
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,220
Hey!

664
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,237
Yeah!

665
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:11,322
We did it!

666
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,826
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

667
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,369
You surprise me.

668
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,746
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

669
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,293
You wanna get to Te Fiti you got to
go through a whole ocean of bad.

670
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,794
Not to mention Te Ka.

671
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:27,714
Lava monster?

672
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,883
Ever defeat a lava monster?

673
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,760
No. Have you?

674
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,480
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

675
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,858
You can't restore the heart without me...

676
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,776
and me says no.

677
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,237
I'm getting my hook.

678
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,239
End of discussion.

679
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,248
You'd be a hero.

680
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,628
That's what you're all about, right?

681
00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:09,631
Little girl, I am a hero.

682
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:11,257
Maybe you were.

683
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:12,550
But now...

684
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:15,637
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

685
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:18,097
The guy who cursed the world.

686
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,850
You're no one's hero.

687
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,185
No one?

688
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:32,862
But...

689
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,031
put this back...

690
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,950
save the world...

691
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,118
you'd be everyone's hero.

692
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:46,960
Maui! Maui! Maui!

693
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,295
You're so amazing!

694
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,590
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Ka.

695
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:53,841
Then we get your hook.

696
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:57,720
We get your hook, take out Te Ka,
restore the heart.

697
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,515
Unless you don't wanna be...

698
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,810
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

699
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,478
Hero to...

700
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:07,063
all.

701
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,318
First, we get my hook.

702
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,112
Then save the world.

703
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:15,154
Deal?

704
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,281
Deal.

705
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,703
Worth a shot.

706
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,539
Okay, we go east.

707
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,874
To the lair of Tamatoa.

708
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:32,505
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

709
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,394
Teach me to sail.

710
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:52,066
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

711
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:53,234
I should...

712
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,529
I should be sailing.

713
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,698
It's called wayfinding, princess.

714
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,242
And it's not just sails and knots...

715
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,037
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

716
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,247
Knowing where you are...

717
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,999
by knowing where you've been.

718
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,501
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

719
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,128
I am the daughter of the chief.

720
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,463
- Same difference.
- No.

721
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,257
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

722
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,550
you're a princess.

723
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:18,926
You are not a wayfinder.

724
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:22,513
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

725
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:30,146
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

726
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:38,154
You are a bad person.

727
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,073
If you can talk, you can teach.

728
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:41,240
Wayfinding.

729
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,243
Lesson one. Hit it.

730
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:48,081
Pull the sheet.

731
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,458
Not the sheet.

732
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,626
No.

733
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:52,710
Nope.

734
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:54,837
Nope. No.

735
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,590
Tried that one already.

736
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:04,764
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

737
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,018
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

738
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,438
It's cold.

739
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:15,233
Wait, it's getting warmer.

740
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,362
Aah! That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

741
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:37,296
We're here?

742
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,508
See, told you I could do it!

743
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:50,226
Motunui?

744
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,020
I'm home?

745
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:58,359
- Moana!
- Dad?

746
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,820
Moana!

747
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,155
Mom?

748
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,699
Help!

749
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,577
No!

750
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,245
Moana!

751
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,833
Enjoy your beauty rest?

752
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,669
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

753
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,464
so they actually get
where they need to go.

754
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,507
Muscle up, buttercup.

755
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,634
We're here.

756
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,305
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

757
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,724
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

758
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,895
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

759
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:34,979
Ah!

760
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,607
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

761
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,318
my hook is the coolest collectible.

762
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:42,403
And he lives up there?

763
00:54:45,406 --> 00:54:46,407
No, no, no.

764
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,992
That's just the entrance...

765
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,369
to Lalotai.

766
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:51,788
Lalotai?

767
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,706
Realm of monsters?

768
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,250
We're going to the realm of monsters?

769
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,878
We? No. Me.

770
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,465
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

771
00:55:04,258 --> 00:55:05,968
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

772
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,514
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

773
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,891
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

774
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,726
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

775
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,436
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

776
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,063
I'm not explaining it to you.

777
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,856
"Cause then it's not funny.

778
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,705
So, daughter of the chief...

779
00:55:34,872 --> 00:55:36,332
I thought you stayed in the village.

780
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,209
You know, kissing babies and things.

781
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,128
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

782
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:43,714
why your people decided to send...

783
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:45,967
How do I phrase this? You.

784
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:49,387
My people didn't send me.

785
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,721
The ocean did.

786
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:52,098
The ocean?

787
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,266
Makes sense.

788
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,017
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

789
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,394
Obvious choice.

790
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,939
It chose me for a reason.

791
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,691
If the ocean's so smart...

792
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,944
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

793
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,863
Or bring me my hook?

794
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,282
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

795
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,159
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

796
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,246
You're the Chosen One!

797
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:34,223
The ocean chose you for a reason.

798
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,976
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

799
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,812
So, not seeing an entrance.

800
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,148
Yes, because it only appears...

801
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,150
after a human sacrifice.

802
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:47,528
Kidding.

803
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,946
So serious.

804
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:13,679
Don't worry...

805
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,015
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

806
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,183
Cheeeehoooo!

807
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:25,399
I am still falling!

808
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:28,694
You can do this.

809
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:30,529
Go!

810
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,261
And he sticks the landing.

811
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:55,554
Huh?

812
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:58,933
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

813
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,435
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

814
00:58:01,602 --> 00:58:02,645
Huh?

815
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:08,818
Well, she's dead.

816
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,487
Okay, let's get my hook.

817
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,749
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew.

818
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,633
Maui's fishhook!

819
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,177
Yeah!

820
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,054
Sorry!

821
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,221
I thought you were a monster...

822
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:20,639
But I found your hook.

823
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:22,933
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

824
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,101
Stay.

825
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:26,479
What? No. I'm the one who found...

826
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:28,147
Listen. For a thousand years...

827
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,524
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

828
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:31,734
getting my hook...

829
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,486
and being awesome again.

830
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:36,030
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

831
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:39,909
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

832
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:43,162
Except...

833
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,538
maybe as bait.

834
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:45,915
Huh?

835
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,666
Wow!

836
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,877
The shiny, glittery cave.

837
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,378
And just like me...

838
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:54,173
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

839
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,217
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

840
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:57,843
You're not selling it!

841
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,929
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

842
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,556
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

843
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,061
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

844
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,729
Make him talk about himself.

845
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,023
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

846
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,691
You two must get along swell.

847
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,860
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

848
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,196
You ripped off his...

849
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,364
Maui?

850
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,375
What have we here?

851
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:34,088
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

852
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:37,383
Ugh! It's a human!

853
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,220
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

854
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,805
Just pick an eye, babe.

855
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,598
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

856
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,059
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

857
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,562
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

858
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:51,147
Don't! That's my gramma's!

859
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:52,398
"That's my gramma's!"

860
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,649
I ate my gramma!

861
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,277
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

862
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:58,070
Why are you here?

863
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,739
"Cause you're amazing!

864
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:06,245
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

865
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,956
And I just had to know...

866
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,667
how you became so...

867
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,295
crabulous?

868
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:18,924
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

869
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,969
Because if you are...

870
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,180
I will gladly do so.

871
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,264
Huh?

872
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:26,765
In song form!

873
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:32,605
Well, Tamatoa
hasn't always been this glam

874
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:35,107
I was a drab little crab once

875
01:01:36,483 --> 01:01:39,195
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

876
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:41,614
Because I'm beautiful, baby

877
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:43,949
And did your granny say

878
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:45,826
Listen to your heart

879
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,787
Be who you are on the inside

880
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:52,291
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

881
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,792
Your granny lied

882
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:55,669
I'd rather be shiny

883
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:58,714
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

884
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,343
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

885
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:05,346
! Will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

886
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:08,057
Just a sec
Don't ya know

887
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:12,061
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

888
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,687
Beginners

889
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:16,315
Oh, and here they come, come, come

890
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,525
To the brightest thing that glitters

891
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:19,693
Mm, fish dinners

892
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,238
! Just love free food

893
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:25,699
And you look like seafood

894
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,911
Hey, crab cake!

895
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:34,208
I'm back.

896
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,753
It's Maui Time!

897
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,674
What do you say, little buddy?

898
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,385
Giant hawk? Coming up!

899
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:45,928
Cheeeehoooo!

900
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:51,934
Cheeeehoooo!

901
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,232
Well, well, well.

902
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,693
Little Maui's having
trouble with his look

903
01:03:01,568 --> 01:03:03,654
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

904
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,448
Ouch
What a terrible performance

905
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:08,033
Get the hook
Get it?

906
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,911
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

907
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:14,540
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

908
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,668
And your tattoos on the outside

909
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:21,171
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

910
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,382
I'll never hide
I can't

911
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,591
I'm too shiny

912
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:27,720
<i>Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough</i>

913
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:31,223
Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny

914
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,892
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

915
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,729
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

916
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:40,274
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

917
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,277
To beat a decapod
Look it up

918
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,237
You will die, die, die

919
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,239
Now it's time for me to take apart

920
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:49,742
Your achin' heart

921
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:54,496
Far from the ones who abandoned you

922
01:03:55,205 --> 01:03:59,376
Chasing the love of these humans

923
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,463
Who made you feel wanted

924
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:05,257
You tried to be tough

925
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:09,470
But your armor's just not hard enough

926
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,432
Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie

927
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:17,227
Ever seen someone so shiny

928
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,522
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

929
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:22,274
C'est la vie
Mon ami

930
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,942
I'm so shiny

931
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:26,904
Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea

932
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:28,197
Just for me

933
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,950
You'll never be quite as shiny

934
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:36,288
You wish you were nice and shiny

935
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:40,167
- Hey!
- Huh?

936
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,628
I got something shiny for ya!

937
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,132
The heart of Te Fiti.

938
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:49,635
You can't run from me!

939
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,804
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

940
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,517
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

941
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,273
The power of creation...

942
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:05,109
for a crustacean.

943
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,735
Where is it? Where is it?

944
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,987
We got to go!

945
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,656
What about the heart?

946
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:13,325
He can have it. I've got a better one.

947
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,994
Yes, I have the...

948
01:05:16,161 --> 01:05:17,162
Wait a minute.

949
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:20,165
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

950
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:23,502
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

951
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:26,880
Come back here!

952
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:33,679
Cheeeehoooo!

953
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,806
Hey!

954
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:37,516
Did you like the song?

955
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:46,400
We're alive!

956
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,568
We're alive!

957
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,529
Listen...

958
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,614
I appreciate what you did down there.

959
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:53,949
Mm-hmm.

960
01:05:54,032 --> 01:05:55,075
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

961
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,410
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

962
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,578
I'm sorry.

963
01:05:57,744 --> 01:06:00,789
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

964
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:02,875
No, no. No way!

965
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,294
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

966
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,381
shark head.

967
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,718
What? Do you have a shark head?

968
01:06:12,926 --> 01:06:14,595
Look, the point is...

969
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,639
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

970
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:20,350
who had no business
being down there...

971
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,269
you did me a solid.

972
01:06:22,394 --> 01:06:24,521
But you also almost died.

973
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,732
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

974
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,067
So, chances of beating Te Ka?

975
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:30,402
Bupkis.

976
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,822
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

977
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,240
It's not cursed.

978
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:36,950
Shark head.

979
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:39,828
It is not cursed.

980
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:55,010
Cursed.

981
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:01,266
What can I say except

982
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,268
We're dead soon

983
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,937
We're dead soon

984
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:07,898
Can you at least try?

985
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:12,277
Giant hawk.

986
01:07:15,113 --> 01:07:17,241
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

987
01:07:18,116 --> 01:07:20,035
All right, break time's over.

988
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,203
Get up.

989
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,705
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

990
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:27,626
Tell me I can beat Te Ka
'cause I'm "Maui?"

991
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,462
Take a hike, Tiny.

992
01:07:36,468 --> 01:07:38,971
How do you get your tattoos?

993
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:41,598
They show up. When I earn them.

994
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,394
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

995
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,855
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

996
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:50,148
What's Nunya?

997
01:07:50,315 --> 01:07:51,650
Nunya business.

998
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:54,611
I'll just keep asking.

999
01:07:56,863 --> 01:07:57,864
What's it for?

1000
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,659
You need to stop doing that.

1001
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,040
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1002
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:08,667
I said back off.

1003
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,502
Is it why your hook's not working?

1004
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:29,271
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1005
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,690
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1006
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:33,775
throw me off.

1007
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:37,279
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1008
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:39,406
I know I don't.

1009
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:43,535
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1010
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,412
You're right.

1011
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:50,042
But my island is dying...

1012
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,879
so I am here.

1013
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:56,923
It's just me and you.

1014
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,760
And I want to help...

1015
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:04,222
but I can't if you don't let me.

1016
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,147
I wasn't born a demigod.

1017
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:14,941
I had human parents.

1018
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,281
They took one look and decided...

1019
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,909
they did not want me.

1020
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:26,370
They threw me into the sea...

1021
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:29,956
like I was nothing.

1022
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,961
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1023
01:09:35,128 --> 01:09:36,755
They gave me the hook.

1024
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:38,590
They made me...

1025
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:40,425
Maui.

1026
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,471
And back to the humans I went.

1027
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,809
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1028
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,104
Anything they could ever want.

1029
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,107
You took the heart for them.

1030
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,694
You did everything for them.

1031
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,363
So they'd love you.

1032
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,117
It was never enough.

1033
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:16,545
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1034
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,881
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1035
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:24,136
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1036
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,974
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1037
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:30,892
You are.

1038
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,195
Okay, okay.

1039
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,657
I love you, too, buddy.

1040
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,708
Cheeeehoooo!

1041
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,641
Yeah!

1042
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,459
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1043
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:07,299
What?

1044
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,967
I figured it out.

1045
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:14,014
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1046
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:17,976
"cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1047
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:21,605
All those new lands, new villages.

1048
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,441
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1049
01:13:24,816 --> 01:13:26,484
And if I were the ocean...

1050
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:30,739
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1051
01:13:31,489 --> 01:13:33,325
to start that again.

1052
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:37,871
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1053
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,041
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1054
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:43,752
I did.

1055
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,757
Moana of Motunui...

1056
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:54,554
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1057
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,183
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1058
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,435
You're so amazing!

1059
01:14:02,228 --> 01:14:03,229
It's time.

1060
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:23,083
Go save the world.

1061
01:14:24,584 --> 01:14:26,211
Cheeeehoooo!

1062
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,525
Maui!

1063
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:23,727
What are you doing?

1064
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,645
Finding you a better way in!

1065
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:29,024
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1066
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,316
- Turn around!
- No!

1067
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:31,609
Moana, stop!

1068
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:32,777
No!

1069
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,474
Are you okay?

1070
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:05,018
Maui?

1071
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,778
I told you to turn back.

1072
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,823
I thought we could make it.

1073
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:20,241
We?

1074
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,787
I thought I could make it.

1075
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:26,873
We can fix it.

1076
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,167
It was made by the gods.

1077
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,086
You can't fix it!

1078
01:16:31,377 --> 01:16:33,588
Next time we'll be more careful.

1079
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,924
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1080
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,510
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1081
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:40,678
We can find a way around.

1082
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:42,680
I'm not going back.

1083
01:16:43,848 --> 01:16:45,391
We still have to restore the heart.

1084
01:16:45,683 --> 01:16:47,060
My hook is cracked.

1085
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,895
One more hit, and it's over.

1086
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,147
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1087
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,191
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1088
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,526
That's not true!

1089
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:57,195
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1090
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:07,997
We are only here...

1091
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:11,292
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1092
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:15,213
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1093
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,173
and you believed it.

1094
01:17:18,424 --> 01:17:20,927
I am Moana of Motunui.

1095
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,304
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

1096
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:24,639
...sail across the sea...

1097
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,890
I'm not killing myself...

1098
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:27,308
SO you can prove
you're something you're not!

1099
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:28,726
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1100
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,813
The ocean chose me!

1101
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,482
It chose wrong.

1102
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,285
Maui!

1103
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,760
Why did you bring me here?

1104
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,601
I'm not the right person.

1105
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:15,273
You have to choose someone else.

1106
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,153
Choose someone else.

1107
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:22,280
Please.

1108
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:42,634
No.

1109
01:18:58,524 --> 01:19:00,818
You're a long ways
past the reef.

1110
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:03,196
Gramma?

1111
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,201
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1112
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,661
Gramma!

1113
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:17,377
I tried, Gramma.

1114
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,005
I couldn't do it.

1115
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:24,259
It's not your fault.

1116
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:28,179
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1117
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:31,015
If you are ready to go home...

1118
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,519
I will be with you.

1119
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,704
Why do you hesitate?

1120
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,790
I don't know.

1121
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,713
! Know a girl from an island

1122
01:20:02,755 --> 01:20:05,425
She stands apart from the crowd

1123
01:20:05,883 --> 01:20:08,886
She loves the sea and her people

1124
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,556
She makes her whole family proud

1125
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,435
Sometimes the world
seems against you

1126
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,938
The journey may leave a scar

1127
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:21,899
But scars can heal and reveal just

1128
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:24,652
Where you are

1129
01:20:25,611 --> 01:20:28,573
The people you love will change you

1130
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:31,826
The things you have
learned will guide you

1131
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:35,413
And nothing on earth can silence

1132
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,583
The quiet voice still inside you

1133
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:42,253
And when that voice starts to whisper

1134
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,089
Moana, you've come so far

1135
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,592
Moana, listen

1136
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:52,430
Do you know who you are?

1137
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:56,100
Who am 1?

1138
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:01,606
I am a girl who loves my island

1139
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:05,568
And the girl who loves the sea

1140
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:09,030
It calls me

1141
01:21:11,115 --> 01:21:13,993
I am the daughter of the village chief

1142
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:17,413
We are descended from voyagers

1143
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:20,166
Who found their way across the world

1144
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,585
They call me

1145
01:21:24,295 --> 01:21:26,798
I've delivered us to where we are

1146
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:30,134
! Have journeyed farther

1147
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:33,012
I am everything I've learned and more

1148
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,181
Still it calls me

1149
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,644
And the call isn't out there at all

1150
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:42,605
It's inside me

1151
01:21:43,022 --> 01:21:44,982
It's like the tide

1152
01:21:45,149 --> 01:21:49,404
Always falling and rising

1153
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:52,323
! Will carry you here in my heart

1154
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,535
You remind me

1155
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:58,663
That come what may

1156
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,833
! Know the way

1157
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:06,587
I am Moana

1158
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:43,249
I am Moana of Motunui.

1159
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:45,710
Aboard my boat...

1160
01:22:46,043 --> 01:22:48,212
! Will sail across the sea...

1161
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:51,549
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1162
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,754
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1163
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,089
We make it past the barrier islands...

1164
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:34,091
we make it to Te Fiti.

1165
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:35,927
None of which you understand...

1166
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:38,095
because you are a chicken.

1167
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,705
No!

1168
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:49,417
Heihei! No, no, no!

1169
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,169
Nice work!

1170
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:02,680
Te Fiti.

1171
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,040
Maui!

1172
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:34,754
You came back.

1173
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:39,884
But your hook.

1174
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,552
One more hit and...

1175
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:43,888
Te Ka's got to catch me first.

1176
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,100
I got your back, Chosen One.

1177
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,561
Go save the world.

1178
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,646
Maui.

1179
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:53,564
Thank you.

1180
01:25:54,523 --> 01:25:55,816
You're welcome.

1181
01:25:56,525 --> 01:25:58,110
Cheeeehoooo!

1182
01:26:16,879 --> 01:26:18,005
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1183
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:30,935
Hey, Te Ka!

1184
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:32,687
Shark head!

1185
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:35,356
Cheeeehoooo!

1186
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:46,784
Moana!

1187
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,004
Get the heart to the spiral!

1188
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,961
Te Fiti...

1189
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:40,546
it's gone.

1190
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:54,852
Te Ka!

1191
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:31,931
Let her come to me.

1192
01:28:55,412 --> 01:28:58,916
I have crossed the horizon to find you

1193
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:08,551
! Know your name

1194
01:29:12,346 --> 01:29:16,183
They have stolen the
heart from inside you

1195
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,024
But this does not define you

1196
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:31,615
This is not who you are

1197
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:38,539
You know who you are

1198
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:48,048
Who you truly are.

1199
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:12,239
Te Fiti!

1200
01:30:52,821 --> 01:30:54,198
The chicken lives.

1201
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,035
I'm sorry about your hook.

1202
01:30:58,535 --> 01:31:01,538
Well, hook, no hook...

1203
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,624
I'm Maui.

1204
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:24,311
Te Fiti!

1205
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:27,314
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1206
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:33,070
Look, what I did was...

1207
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,655
wrong.

1208
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,865
I have no excuse.

1209
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:38,575
I'm sorry.

1210
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,088
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1211
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:54,091
Cheeeehoooo!

1212
01:31:55,926 --> 01:31:56,927
Thank you.

1213
01:31:57,052 --> 01:31:59,596
Your kind gesture is
deeply appreciated.

1214
01:31:59,763 --> 01:32:00,764
Cheeeehoooo.

1215
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,898
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1216
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,149
You could come with us, you know.

1217
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:56,653
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1218
01:32:58,155 --> 01:32:59,990
They already have one.

1219
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:19,593
See you out there, Maui.

1220
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,805
See you out there, Moana.

1221
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:24,681
Cheeeehoooo!

1222
01:34:16,024 --> 01:34:17,693
Mom! Dad!

1223
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,027
Moana!

1224
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:31,582
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1225
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:34,543
It suits you.

1226
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:35,752
She's back!

1227
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:36,920
Moana!

1228
01:34:37,087 --> 01:34:38,088
Pua!

1229
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,091
Moana!

1230
01:34:43,343 --> 01:34:44,678
Welcome home!

1231
01:35:34,603 --> 01:35:36,772
We set a course to find

1232
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:41,193
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

1233
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,864
We keep our island in our mind

1234
01:35:46,406 --> 01:35:50,619
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

1235
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:55,332
We are explorers reading every sign

1236
01:35:55,958 --> 01:36:00,170
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

1237
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:12,432
We know the way

1238
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:24,912
I've been staring
at the edge of the water

1239
01:36:24,995 --> 01:36:27,915
Long as I can remember

1240
01:36:27,998 --> 01:36:30,751
Never really knowing why

1241
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:36,215
! Wish I could be the perfect daughter

1242
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:38,884
But I come back to the water

1243
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:42,054
No matter how hard I try

1244
01:36:43,055 --> 01:36:45,641
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

1245
01:36:45,724 --> 01:36:48,477
Every path I make
Every road leads back

1246
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:51,146
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

1247
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:54,233
Where I long to be

1248
01:36:56,569 --> 01:36:58,946
See the line
where the sky meets the sea

1249
01:36:59,029 --> 01:37:00,823
It calls me

1250
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:04,201
And no one knows

1251
01:37:04,243 --> 01:37:06,579
How far it goes

1252
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:11,876
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

1253
01:37:12,418 --> 01:37:15,254
One day I'll know

1254
01:37:15,337 --> 01:37:19,258
<i>If 1 go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go</i>

1255
01:37:29,226 --> 01:37:32,646
! Know everybody on this island

1256
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,482
Seems so happy on this island

1257
01:37:35,566 --> 01:37:38,861
Everything is by design

1258
01:37:39,778 --> 01:37:43,365
! Know everybody on this island

1259
01:37:43,449 --> 01:37:45,951
Has a role on this island

1260
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:49,288
So maybe I can roll with mine

1261
01:37:49,955 --> 01:37:52,499
! Can lead with pride
I can make us strong

1262
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:55,377
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

1263
01:37:55,461 --> 01:37:57,838
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

1264
01:37:57,922 --> 01:38:01,258
What is wrong with me

1265
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:05,137
See the light as it shines on the sea

1266
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,306
It's blinding

1267
01:38:07,932 --> 01:38:10,351
But no one knows

1268
01:38:10,434 --> 01:38:12,895
How deep it goes

1269
01:38:13,562 --> 01:38:15,606
And it seems like it's calling out to me

1270
01:38:15,648 --> 01:38:18,150
So come find me

1271
01:38:18,233 --> 01:38:20,945
And let me know

1272
01:38:21,487 --> 01:38:23,906
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

1273
01:38:24,323 --> 01:38:26,450
See the line
where the sky meets the sea

1274
01:38:26,492 --> 01:38:28,786
It calls me

1275
01:38:28,827 --> 01:38:31,288
And no one knows

1276
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:34,291
How far it goes

1277
01:38:34,959 --> 01:38:39,338
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

1278
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,882
One day I'll know

1279
01:38:42,007 --> 01:38:44,885
How far I'll go

1280
01:40:04,701 --> 01:40:08,122
! See what's happening
Yeah

1281
01:40:08,288 --> 01:40:10,916
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

1282
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:13,210
You don't even know how you feel

1283
01:40:13,502 --> 01:40:15,003
It's adorable

1284
01:40:15,379 --> 01:40:18,132
It's nice to see that humans
never change

1285
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:21,552
Open your eyes
Let's begin

1286
01:40:21,718 --> 01:40:24,847
Yes, it's really me
Breathe it in

1287
01:40:25,097 --> 01:40:26,682
I know it's a lot

1288
01:40:26,849 --> 01:40:28,809
The hair
The bod

1289
01:40:29,351 --> 01:40:31,728
When you're staring at a demigod

1290
01:40:32,396 --> 01:40:34,565
So what can I say except

1291
01:40:34,731 --> 01:40:36,150
You're welcome

1292
01:40:36,567 --> 01:40:39,194
For the tides, the sun, the sky

1293
01:40:39,653 --> 01:40:41,697
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

1294
01:40:41,864 --> 01:40:43,574
You're welcome

1295
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:46,618
I'm just an ordinary demiguy

1296
01:40:46,702 --> 01:40:50,747
What can I say except
You're welcome

1297
01:40:50,831 --> 01:40:53,750
For the tides, the sun, the sky

1298
01:40:53,834 --> 01:40:56,003
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

1299
01:40:56,086 --> 01:40:57,963
You're welcome

1300
01:40:58,005 --> 01:41:00,465
I'm just an ordinary demiguy

1301
01:41:00,507 --> 01:41:02,050
Honestly, I could go on and on

1302
01:41:02,134 --> 01:41:04,011
I could explain
every natural phenomenon

1303
01:41:04,052 --> 01:41:07,181
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was me, I was messing around

1304
01:41:07,264 --> 01:41:08,891
I killed a snake
I buried its guts

1305
01:41:08,974 --> 01:41:10,684
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

1306
01:41:10,767 --> 01:41:12,477
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

1307
01:41:12,519 --> 01:41:14,354
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

1308
01:41:14,438 --> 01:41:17,691
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

1309
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:19,860
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

1310
01:41:19,902 --> 01:41:21,820
Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'

1311
01:41:21,862 --> 01:41:23,071
Singing and scratchin'

1312
01:41:23,155 --> 01:41:25,449
Flipping and snappin'
People are clappin', hearing me rap

1313
01:41:25,532 --> 01:41:27,618
Bring the chorus back in

1314
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:31,413
Well, anyway let me say
You're welcome

1315
01:41:32,039 --> 01:41:34,875
For the wonderful world you know

1316
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:39,213
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

1317
01:41:39,296 --> 01:41:41,965
Well, come to think of it
! Got to go

1318
01:41:42,049 --> 01:41:46,053
Hey, it's your day to say
You're welcome

1319
01:41:46,136 --> 01:41:48,931
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

1320
01:41:49,014 --> 01:41:53,143
I'm sailing away, away
You're welcome

1321
01:41:53,227 --> 01:41:55,896
'Cause Maui's the ultimate God

1322
01:41:56,521 --> 01:41:58,398
You're welcome

1323
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,817
You're welcome

1324
01:46:07,397 --> 01:46:08,773
Shiny

1325
01:46:09,316 --> 01:46:11,818
I'm so shiny

1326
01:46:12,444 --> 01:46:14,237
Didn't help me though, did it?

1327
01:46:14,404 --> 01:46:16,364
Still upside down here.

1328
01:46:16,531 --> 01:46:18,783
Just need a little push.

1329
01:46:20,952 --> 01:46:21,953
Can we be real?

1330
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:25,499
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1331
01:46:25,665 --> 01:46:26,875
you'd totally help me.

1332
01:46:27,042 --> 01:46:28,668
You would. You know you would.
