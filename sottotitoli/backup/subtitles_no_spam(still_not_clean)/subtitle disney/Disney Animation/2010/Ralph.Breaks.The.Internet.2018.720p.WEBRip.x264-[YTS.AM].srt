

2
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,861
Okay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.

3
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,197
Great, but can you make it

4
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,731
a little more challenging
this time?

5
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,767
Okay. Check this out.

6
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,704
I spy with my little eye...

7
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,175
something yellow...

8
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:10,579
and round,
and it eats dots.

9
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,016
Seriously, Ralph?

10
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,550
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.

11
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,987
Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.

12
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,554
No, that's not...

13
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:20,990
Why is that obvious?

14
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:22,859
Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

15
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,194
that is yellow and round
and eats dots.

16
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,695
I can name two things.

17
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:27,897
Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.

18
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,866
Boom!
I accept your apology.

19
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:33,069
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

20
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,971
Yeah, you got me.

21
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:38,007
Knew it.
All right, riddle me this...

22
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,711
do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

23
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:43,645
No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

24
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,014
I don't know.

25
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:47,050
I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,

26
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,217
I might agree...

27
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,752
but look at those
two very specific

28
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,187
tuffets of shin hair...

29
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,722
poking out of his boots.

30
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,758
That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,727
You're totally right, kid.

32
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,029
He's baby smooth
everywhere else.

33
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,031
I rest my case.

34
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,701
My mind is blown!

35
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,102
Let's go get a root beer.

36
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:09,272
Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.

37
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:10,940
Ooh!

38
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,942
Nice one. Okay.

39
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,677
I think I got one
in the chamber.

40
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,714
Ew!

41
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,649
- Gross.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,917
Hey, wanna sneak into <i>Tron?</i>

43
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,752
Doesn't that game
have a virus?

44
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,221
No. I'm sure
they fixed it.

45
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,090
Whoo!

46
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:29,559
I'm gonna beat
my speed record!

47
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,062
Hey, wait for me!

48
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,237
Ralph.

49
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,772
Yeah?

50
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:44,943
I don't think
they fixed the game.

51
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,012
Uh... No.

52
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,014
Help!

53
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,282
Hey, Tron!

54
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,084
Tronny!

55
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,820
Tronny boy!

56
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,822
Help!

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,156
Do you realize

58
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,859
we're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones...

59
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:06,629
floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?

60
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,997
Like, doesn't the very nature

61
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,766
of our existence
make you wonder...

62
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:12,101
if there's more to life
than this?

63
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:13,970
Why would I wonder
if there's more to life

64
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:16,205
when the life
I got is perfect?

65
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:18,841
I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.

66
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,810
<i>I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game</i>

67
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:21,978
<i>who wrecks a building.</i>

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,613
<i>And yeah, for 27 years,</i>

69
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,915
<i>I was a total zero
without any friends.</i>

70
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,984
But now,
I got a best friend...

71
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,252
who just happens to be

72
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,120
the coolest kid
in the whole arcade.

73
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:33,122
Aw, thanks, pal.

74
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:34,125
Watch this.

75
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,295
Home run!

76
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:39,831
All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.

77
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,198
Are you really saying

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,301
there's not one single,
solitary thing...

79
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:46,370
about your life
that you would change?

80
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:48,372
Well, think about it.

81
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:51,308
You and me get to
goof off all night long.

82
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,943
Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.

83
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,312
Then the arcade closes

84
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,314
and we get to do it
all over again.

85
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:00,016
The only thing I might do
different in that scenario...

86
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,051
would be not having
to go to work.

87
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,854
Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.

88
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,055
Huh?

89
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,293
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

90
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,330
All right,
let's get you plugged in.

91
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,232
That's a plug-in alert.

92
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,733
Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.

93
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,902
- Let's go see what it is!
- Yeah!

94
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:22,004
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.

95
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:24,241
Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?

96
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,875
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks

97
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,944
it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.

98
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,446
What do you think,
lady love?

99
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:33,083
I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.

100
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,185
- Kids love those things.
- Ooh.

101
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,921
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.

102
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:40,758
Please be a racing game.

103
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,862
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

104
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:49,133
Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.

105
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,867
It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.

106
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:52,035
Yeah, that's what I said.

107
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:53,769
And Wi-Fi is the Internet...

108
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,038
which is an online community

109
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,206
where human beings
go to shop...

110
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,041
and play games and socialize.

111
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,809
Ooh, fun!

112
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,211
Oh, no, it is not.

113
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,447
That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."

114
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,916
What it should say
is "Die-Fi."

115
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,154
That's a little humor there.

116
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,256
But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.

117
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,024
It is new, it is different,

118
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,459
and therefore
we should fear it.

119
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,861
So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.

120
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,963
The arcade's about to open.

121
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,833
Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...

122
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,767
and we're not even allowed
to go in there.

123
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,736
Totally not fair.

124
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:29,306
A new racing game
would've been cool.

125
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:30,340
Something wrong
with your game?

126
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,909
No, no.

127
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,311
It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.

128
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,313
I know every shortcut.

129
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,082
Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.

130
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,985
New track? You already got,
like, three choices.

131
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,320
Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wish

132
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,755
something new
and different...

133
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,089
would happen in your game?

134
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,157
Nope.

135
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,260
Really? Well,
agree to disagree.

136
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,129
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

137
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,830
No, no. It's just
a fancy way to say

138
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,332
we don't have to
argue about it.

139
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,167
We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.

140
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,870
Relax. Stop making it
a thing.

141
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,506
Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.

142
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,473
All right.

143
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,150
She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.

144
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:17,323
Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play <i>Sugar Rush!</i>

145
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:20,157
Pick Vanellope, Swati.

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,892
She's got
the best superpower.

147
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,294
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

148
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,295
<i>Drivers,</i>

149
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,531
<i>start your engines.</i>

150
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,400
You're gonna lose today,
Princess.

151
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,538
While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta...

152
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,541
I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope...

153
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,042
the racer who's about to
kick your butt.

154
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,947
<i>Three, two, one, go!</i>

155
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,988
And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.

156
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:53,857
Whoo-hoo!

157
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,160
Whoo!

158
00:06:56,895 --> 00:07:01,198
And one, two, three gumballs
right on cue.

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,166
Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.

160
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,139
Ooh! Huh.

161
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:11,241
Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.

162
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:13,378
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

163
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,180
<i>Vanellope takes a huge lead.</i>

164
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,818
<i>No one's gonna catch her now.</i>

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,556
She's gonna love this.

166
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,495
Right on time.

167
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,095
What?

168
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,066
"Looking for something new...

169
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,367
"and different?

170
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:39,437
"Then take this track."

171
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,472
Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.

172
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,940
I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.

173
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,376
Whoa!

174
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:48,246
Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.

175
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:51,014
Never seen that before.

176
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:54,452
This is awesome!

177
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,621
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

178
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,423
You're welcome!

179
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,191
Get back up
on the track, Swati.

180
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,559
You're going to lose.

181
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,029
I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.

182
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:09,233
Whoo!

183
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:11,136
What is wrong with
this thing?

184
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,471
What?

185
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,414
No, no!

186
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:22,915
Kid!

187
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,290
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

188
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,258
Kid! Kid!

189
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,992
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?

190
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,994
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,430
What an amazing track!

192
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,266
Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

193
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,601
You're welcome!

194
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,170
You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.

195
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,338
Wait a minute.

196
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,240
You took a serious
doody where?

197
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,677
Vanellope, get up here.

198
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,314
We have a situation.

199
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:59,517
Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working...

200
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,487
and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.

201
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,322
- Whoa.
- I'm real sorry.

202
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,656
It's okay, Swati.

203
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,525
I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.

204
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,027
- What did you do, Ralph?
- Nothing.

205
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,129
Leave him alone.

206
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:13,064
He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.

207
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:16,067
Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.

208
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,069
All right, on you...

209
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,670
Oh!

210
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,006
Okay. Still not a problem.

211
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,207
He'll just order a new part.

212
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,475
Well, I'd order a new part...

213
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,177
but the company
that made <i>Sugar Rush</i>

214
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,345
went out of business
years ago.

215
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:30,214
I can try to find one
on the Internet.

216
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,315
- Good idea.
- Oh, me too.

217
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:33,084
Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a...

218
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,619
I found one! On ebay!

219
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,354
Really? How about that?

220
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:38,556
See? Those kids
have it under control.

221
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,591
They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.

222
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,393
Are you
kidding me? How much?

223
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,695
That's more than this game
makes in a year.

224
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:46,330
Aw, I hate to say it,

225
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,666
but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday...

226
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,469
and it might be time to sell
<i>Sugar Rush</i> for parts.

227
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,539
- Aww.
- Where's he going?

228
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,207
Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.

229
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,341
Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!

230
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,777
Go, run, run,
run, run!

231
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,612
- Let's go!
- Run!

232
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,353
Gangway!

233
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,388
Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!

234
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,523
Stop it! No running!

235
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,425
What are you people doing
out of your game,

236
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,593
for Peter's sake?

237
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,562
The arcade is open!

238
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,363
<i>Sugar Rush</i>
is getting unplugged.

239
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:29,440
- We're homeless!
- Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

240
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,076
Oh, what are we going to do?

241
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,480
Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.

242
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:37,114
I don't want to be gameless.

243
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:40,318
An unplugging.
Good Lord.

244
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,420
I haven't seen
this many gameless characters

245
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,424
since <i>Space Invaders</i>
went down.

246
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,224
Um...

247
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,259
Where are we gonna live?

248
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,629
Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess...

249
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:52,163
and then we'll figure out

250
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,067
where the heck
we're gonna put you all.

251
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,283
Okay.

252
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,484
Here we go.

253
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:13,752
I raided Gene's fridge.

254
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,153
Good news, he's got pie.

255
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,656
Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.

256
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:21,092
I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.

257
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,794
Or we could take
these pillows...

258
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:24,161
If we stack them right,

259
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,264
we can make an igloo
out of pillows.

260
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,434
Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!

261
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,402
So what do you think, kid?

262
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:33,474
Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?

263
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:38,477
I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.

264
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,647
I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?

265
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,316
What? Come on,
are you kidding?

266
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,784
You sleep in,
you do no work,

267
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,185
then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.

268
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,154
I've literally
just described paradise.

269
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:52,156
But I loved my game.

270
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,124
Oh, come on.

271
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,426
You were just bellyaching
about the tracks

272
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:55,594
being too easy.

273
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:57,763
No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.

274
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable...

275
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:06,137
but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.

276
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,706
And it's that,
it's that feeling,

277
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,676
that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.

278
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:14,748
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.

279
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,117
And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph...

280
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:21,486
what am I?

281
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:22,854
Well, you're my best friend.

282
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,289
That's not enough.

283
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,424
Hey.

284
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,259
No, I just...

285
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,230
I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.

286
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,834
I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.

287
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:36,870
Oh.

288
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:40,405
Okay.

289
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,876
I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.

290
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,613
If you want.

291
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:49,414
<i>All right, now...</i>

292
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,682
<i>we found some good homes</i>

293
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,618
<i>for so many of our chums</i>
<i>from</i> Sugar Rush...

294
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,386
and we're just hoping
a few more of you

295
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:55,554
will open your doors...

296
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,556
and your hearts
to those in need.

297
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:00,359
Well, I suppose
that large green olive

298
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,194
will fit in nicely
with my decor.

299
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:04,429
I'm a sour ball.

300
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:07,232
Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?

301
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,767
Come along, condiment.

302
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,535
Mm-kay.

303
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:13,507
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.

304
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,907
We're, like, adorable.

305
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,676
You sure are.

306
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,845
So, any takers?

307
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,815
Um...

308
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,552
Anyone?

309
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:31,790
Felix, I know
we've never once talked about

310
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,759
having a family before, but...

311
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,661
I know, it feels
like the kind of thing

312
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:37,229
you just jump into
with both feet...

313
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:38,965
and nary a plan.

314
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,767
Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.

315
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:44,302
Can I get a quick word
with you two?

316
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,707
Look, I get it.

317
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,409
You've been married
six years,

318
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,811
you're looking to
spice things up...

319
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:53,913
but trust me,
adopting 15 children

320
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,747
is the wrong kind of spice.

321
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:57,683
Those things
are basically feral.

322
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:02,688
Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.

323
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,491
Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.

324
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:07,659
That's right.

325
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,830
Besides, how hard
can parenting be?

326
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:12,664
You treat the child
like your best friend...

327
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,533
you give them
everything they want...

328
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:15,968
and you just love
their little socks off.

329
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,335
Right, Tammy?

330
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:18,905
Darn-tootin'.

331
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:20,572
Huh?

332
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:22,742
Come and get it.

333
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:23,810
Get your own candle.

334
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,478
Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TV

335
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,980
only have one channel?

336
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,850
Well,
hate to say I told ya...

337
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,451
Ow!

338
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,463
Hey, Tapper?

339
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,566
No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.

340
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:49,635
Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.

341
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:51,871
Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.

342
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:55,942
She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.

343
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,977
Oh. And get this,
she said...

344
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,481
being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.

345
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,348
Not enough?
I'm a great friend!

346
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,017
Right, Tapper? Right?

347
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,385
I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?

348
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,755
Ralph, come on.

349
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,557
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.

350
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,660
There you are... Oh.

351
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:15,762
Hey, Ralph.

352
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,330
Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?

353
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:19,565
Since tonight.

354
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,601
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

355
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,836
Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.

356
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,004
I guess you can have it.

357
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,739
Doesn't look like
she's coming.

358
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,907
Thanks.

359
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,609
You know,
I can't help but think

360
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,811
this whole mess
is somehow...

361
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,514
partially my fault.

362
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,583
It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.

363
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:39,418
Mine was, too.

364
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,822
But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.

365
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:45,424
Isn't that just a blessing?

366
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:52,465
Eeeee-oh-boy!

367
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,734
Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?

368
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,936
Um, isn't that
just a blessing?

369
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:58,538
No, the weird sound thing.

370
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,006
Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?

371
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:02,041
Yeah. Eee-oh...

372
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,409
Sorry, say it again?

373
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,411
- Eeeee-oh-boy.
- Eeeee-oh-boy!

374
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,547
- Eee-oh-boy!
- Eee-boy! Say it again?

375
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,714
- Eeeee-oh-boy!
- Eeeee-oh-boy.

376
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:11,050
- Eeeee-oh-boy...
- eboy! eboy! eboy!

377
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,151
- eboy? eboy?
- eboy.

378
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,886
Yeah.

379
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:15,087
Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?

380
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,856
That kid out in the arcade

381
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,491
said there was
a steering wheel part...

382
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,694
on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or...

383
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:24,096
ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!

384
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,765
Ralph, are you thinking about

385
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,100
going to the Internet
and finding that part?

386
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,236
Getting that part's
the only thing

387
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,137
that's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thing

388
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,140
that's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.

389
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,974
And if <i>Sugar Rush</i> is fixed,

390
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,109
all those lovable scamps
living in my house...

391
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,512
and destroying my sanity

392
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,948
will have homes
of their own again!

393
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,051
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!

394
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,052
I will cover for you.

395
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:47,987
Thanks, pal.

396
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,656
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.

397
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,425
Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.

398
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,827
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.

399
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,664
Shoryuken!

400
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,967
Eeeee-oh-boy.

401
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,707
Boo!

402
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,842
Ralph, what is wrong
with you?

403
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:11,178
Start churning butter

404
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,779
and put on your church
shoes, little sister...

405
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:16,749
'cause we're about to
blast off!

406
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,951
What are you
even talking about?

407
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,020
Oh, we're going to
the Internet.

408
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:20,954
What?

409
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,788
Yeah, to find the part
to fix your game.

410
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,856
No way!

411
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,092
Yeah, I probably
should've just said,

412
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,859
"We're going to the Internet."
We're going to the Internet!

413
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,062
Yeah, we are!

414
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,797
Hey, Surge,
are we glad to see you.

415
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,166
We want to report
some malfeasance

416
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,634
over by the <i>Whac-A-Mole.</i>

417
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,203
Yeah, we saw
some undesirables

418
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:38,838
causing a real donnybrook
over there.

419
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,974
Oh, heck no.
Not on my watch.

420
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,177
Appreciate the tip.

421
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,548
So, all we gotta do
is find this eboy place.

422
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,151
- Ebay.
- Right, ebay.

423
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,486
So we go there,
get the steering wheel...

424
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,988
we have it delivered
to Litwak before Friday.

425
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,555
He'll fix your game.

426
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,125
Everything goes back
to the way it was.

427
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,927
Boom! Happily ever after.

428
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,560
This is a shockingly sound,

429
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,063
well-thought-out idea
for you, Ralph.

430
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,197
No offense.

431
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,731
I know. And none taken.

432
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:06,900
Ooh, here it comes.

433
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,969
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

434
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,173
I give you the Internet!

435
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,876
Huh.

436
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,911
The Internet is
not nearly as impressive

437
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,780
as how Sonic described it.

438
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,049
Yeah, I gotta admit,
I'm underwhelmed.

439
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,583
Where do you think
they keep their ebay?

440
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:25,551
Beats me.

441
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,653
Hello, anybody here?

442
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:29,089
Anyone? Hello!

443
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,258
We're looking for ebay!

444
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,161
Ooh. Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.

445
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,628
Check this out.

446
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,702
Hoolie-hoo!
Hoolie-hoo!

447
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,904
Okay, connect to network.

448
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:46,006
Bingo.

449
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:50,079
Password is "high score"
with a zero instead of an "o."

450
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:51,912
Yes.

451
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,149
And we are online.

452
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,290
Hoolie-hoo!

453
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,892
Hoolie-hoolie-hoo!

454
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,594
Ooh, Ralph, look.

455
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,863
Cool. Mood lighting.

456
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,068
Ahhh! That's a gremlin!
Stay away! It's a gremlin!

457
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,538
It looks like
a tiny Mr. Litwak.

458
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

459
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,011
Oh, cool! Come on, Ralph,
let's follow him!

460
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,179
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!

461
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,148
Hey!
Don't leave without me!

462
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,616
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

463
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,920
Vanellope!

464
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,722
I can't breathe.
I don't fit.

465
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,328
Whoo-hoo!

466
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,631
Yeah! Whoo!

467
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,011
Kid!

468
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,813
Ralph! Isn't this great?

469
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,715
No, it is not!

470
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,118
Whoo-hoo!

471
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,390
No, no, no.

472
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,299
Whoa!

473
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,261
Sweet mother
of monkey milk!

474
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:49,297
Whoa!

475
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,765
Kid, I don't think
we're in Litwak's anymore.

476
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,734
We most certainly
are not, friendo.

477
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,840
We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!

478
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,349
Holy cow!

479
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,716
Look at all this stuff.

480
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,017
Whoa.

481
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,890
This is the most beautiful
miracle I've ever seen.

482
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,958
But it's so big.

483
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,194
It goes on
forever and ever.

484
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,728
How are we

Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

487
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:26,968
I'm sure
there's someone out here

488
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,970
who could give us directions.
Oh!

Look at that little egg guy.

490
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,106
He's got on one of those hats
that smart people wear.

491
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,941
I bet he could
help us. Come on.

00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,709
Welcome back
to the search bar, madam.

Where can I find ballet...?

498
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,222
Ballet shoes? Ballet classes?
Ballet folklorico?

499
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,357
...tights?

<i>Girls' size small.</i>

501
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:53,427
Oh, little Madeline's
trying ballet now, is she?

502
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,265
I hope this lasts longer
than the soccer phase.

503
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,133
Hmm.

504
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,002
I found 23 million results

505

Oh, hello, sir.

510

Interesting, you don't seem to
have a search history.

Humpty Dumpty together again.

519
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,166
This guy's
a little soft-boiled.

00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,301
I'm pretty sure
he's just trying to

guess what you're gonna say.

522

I only found one result

Hmm. Isn't that interesting?

a pair of goggles.

I think all you have to do is
yell out the biggest number...

577
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,116
and then you win this stuff.

578

And I thought
Qbert's game was weird.

Hey, kid, hop up here...

580

their steering wheels.

We're way ahead of schedule.

633

We rule!

634
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:38,013
I'll just need

Sorry, what's a
credit card number?

Uh, seven.

Sorry, no. You're right,
ridiculous. I meant 11.

640
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:51,226
Those aren't
credit card numbers.

641
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:52,728
I'm pretty sure they are.

642
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,429
How exactly do you intend
to pay for this item, sir?

643
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:56,666
You owe $27,001.

644
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:58,233
What?

645
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,636
Dollars? Dollars like money?

646
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:03,505
Yes, and if you don't
have a credit card...

647
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,407
we also accept PayPal,
Venmo,

648
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,442
ProPay, SquareCash
and BuzzzyBucks.

649
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:09,144
Uh...

650
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:10,748
You're gonna laugh. Okay.

651
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:16,551
So this big galoot, he
left his wallet at home.

652
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,421
Yeah, yeah, I did leave
my wallet at home,

653
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:21,258
in my wallet room.
And the door's locked.

654
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:23,225
Uh-huh.

655
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,494
Look. If you don't pay
within 24 hours...

656
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,663
you will be in violation
of the unpaid item policy...

657
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:30,131
you will forfeit the bid,
and you will lose this item.

658
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,134
Next!

659
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:34,637
Hey, buddy,
you going to eboy?

660
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,739
Well, I got some free advice
for you. Don't.

661
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,741
What a scam!

662
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:41,513
We were so close,
and we would have gotten...

663
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,714
Look, their signs
aren't even real!

664
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,522
What the heck? Dang Internet.

665
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:59,160
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

666
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,329
Hey, kid. What's going on?
What's wrong?

667
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,498
If I don't have
a steering wheel,

668
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,700
I don't have a game,
I'm gameless.

669
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,670
There's only one steering
wheel in the whole Internet...

670
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:10,473
and we blew our chance
to get it. We blew it!

671
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,441
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

672
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,175
We came here
to save your game,

673
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,277
and that's what
we're gonna do.

674
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,345
Right.

675
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:17,713
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

676
00:28:19,182 --> 00:28:21,149
There you go.

677
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,352
Now look,
all we got to do...

678
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:26,455
is figure out a way to earn
a little bit of moola.

679
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:29,859
We're video game characters,
Ralph. We don't have moola.

680
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:31,561
Unless you can think
of some magical way

681
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:34,365
to get rich
playing video games.

682
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:39,635
Wanna get rich
playing video games?

683
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:41,470
Click right here
to find out how.

684
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:43,539
Back off, pop-up!

685
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,807
Right this way, miss.

686
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:46,509
Dang pop-up blockers.

687
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:48,844
Why does everybody
gotta be so mean?

688
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,213
Ooh! There he is! Oh, thank
goodness you're still here!

689
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:54,383
Me and my friend here, we got
24 hours to make $27,001...

690
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:55,718
or she loses her game.

691
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,886
Yeah, can you please tell us

692
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:59,188
how to get rich
playing video games?

693
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,890
You bet!

694
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:03,326
Come on, click here, and
I'll take you to my website.

695
00:29:06,598 --> 00:29:09,398
You got an ample carriage
there, buster.

696
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,666
Causing a little drag.

697
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:11,867
Sorry. You're getting close
to the edge.

698
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:12,969
Huh?

699
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:15,905
You see the...?
The edge. The edge!

700
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,676
By the way,
my name is JP Spamley...

701
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:22,211
and I'd like to welcome
the both of you

702
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:23,746
to the Spamley family.

703
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:28,551
All right,
step into my parlor.

704
00:29:28,553 --> 00:29:30,720
This is your website?

705
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:32,388
I know what you're thinking,
not to worry.

706
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,923
My anti-virus guy
was just here.

707
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,324
Clean as a...

708
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:36,726
Oh!

709
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:37,827
Dang it!

710
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:38,928
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.

711
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,796
Anyway, I know
it's a bit of a mess...

712
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,365
Hey, Gord!

713
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,933
But I do have a system here,
I really do.

714
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:46,235
If I can just
find that... Gord!

715
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,404
I just got to find this list.

716
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,639
Oh, there you are.

717
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:52,675
These guys are looking to
get rich playing video games.

718
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:53,845
What do you got for them,
partner?

719
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:04,787
Thank you.

720
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,424
"Fishwife's amulet,
<i>Wizard Quest,</i> three dollars."

721
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,393
"Foxhole hammer,

722
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:12,294
<i>"Zombie Crusades,</i>
five dollars"?

723
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:13,829
Now, those there are

724
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:16,298
some of your more
commonplace, low-dollar items.

725
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,501
Can you back up a sec,
Mr. Spamley?

726
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,569
Um, you're saying if we find

727
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,304
the Golden Cleats

728
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:23,940
from <i>Pro League Soccer...</i>

729
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:26,609
we find those and bring them
back here to you...

730
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:29,913
then a human being in the
real world will pay us $15?

731
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:30,947
Yes, ma'am.

732
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,482
Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.

733
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:34,750
Folks go into games...

734
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,752
they harvest
the most coveted items...

735
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:38,621
and they sell them
on my website

736
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:40,656
to the highest bidder.
Ha-ha?

737
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:42,358
Okay, but here's the thing...

738
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,427
we need like
a buttload of money.

739
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,865
So, do you have any more
lucrative items, maybe?

740
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:48,499
Gord!

741
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,499
Gord!

742
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,402
Oh, there you are.

743
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,272
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.

744
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:58,674
Is $40,000 lucrative
enough for you?

745
00:30:58,676 --> 00:30:59,776
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

746
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:01,444
It's more than enough.

747
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,379
I got a guy
in Des Moines, Iowa...

748
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:06,282
who will pay 40 grand
for Shank's car...

749
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,984
from a game
called <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

750
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:09,552
A racing game?

751
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:11,520
That's right. <i>Slaughter Race</i>
is the most popular

752
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:13,522
online racing game
out there.

753
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:15,458
However,
it is wicked dangerous.

754
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,860
We ain't afraid of danger.

755
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:18,862
This kid's the best racer
in the whole world.

756
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:21,898
We'll get you that car,
no problemo.

757
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,367
Slaughter Race!
<i>Enter at your own risk.</i>

758
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,780
Okay, this game
is kind of amazing.

759
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:39,583
Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.

760
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,686
I don't think
I've ever been in a game

761
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:43,920
with smog before.

762
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:48,058
- Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
- Easy, boy. Easy.

763
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:54,030
Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.

764
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:54,833
Agreed.

765
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,371
- Look. Look.
- Whoa!

766
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:03,540
There it is.

767
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:05,575
That car is gorgeous.

768
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,544
No wonder it's worth so much.

769
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:10,881
Aw, sugar.

770
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,517
- Players. They beat us to it.
- Aw.

771
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,685
<i>31 hours
of continuous gameplay...</i>

772
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:18,421
<i>and we've finally
found Shank's car.</i>

773
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:20,357
Let's jack this ride.

774
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,559
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.

775
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,561
Jim! Jimmy?

776
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:27,464
You're not playing that
horrible game again, are you?

777
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:28,698
No, Grandma!

778
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,033
I'm doing my homework.

779
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,568
Okay, like I said...

780
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,005
<i>Let's jack this ride.</i>

781
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:40,879
Well, well, well.

782
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,884
While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.

783
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:51,588
Hey, I think
that might be Shank.

784
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,089
Listen up, mice...

785
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:56,159
anyone who tries to play
with this cat's ride

786
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:57,661
is gonna get got.

787
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:00,664
<i>You're going down, Shank.</i>

788
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,066
Pyro. Give those punks
the works.

789
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,570
With pleasure.

790
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,773
<i>End of the road!</i>

791
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:11,944
Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.

792
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:14,511
Ralph, maybe...

793
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,446
Hey, where are you going?

794
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,615
I am scared.

795
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:19,783
If we get burned up
in here,

796
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,084
that's it, we're dead,
we're gone.

797
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,786
So, I think we should
get outta here right now.

798
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,622
No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.

799
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,126
Hey, Shank?

800
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:30,694
What's up, Pyro?

801
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:32,996
Um, do you ever reckon
we're going a bit too hard

802
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:34,531
on the players?

803
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:37,567
Honestly, no, I don't.

804
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:41,571
Of course, I have empathy for
players like DirtySocks537

805
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:43,575
and BabeRaham_Linkin...

806
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,675
but if we just let them win,

807
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:47,978
where's the life lesson?
You know?

808
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,481
- Mmm.
- Yeah, but to Pyro's point...

809
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,917
I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.

810
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,685
I hear you, Felony...

811
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:57,854
but imagine a game
without challenges.

812
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:00,824
The same predictable thing
every single time...

813
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:02,026
who wants that?

814
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,060
Shank's right.

815
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:06,130
I just saw a really
insightful TED talk...

816
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:08,165
and I can't really remember
what the guy said.

817
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,201
It was more about
how he made me feel.

818
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,702
But I think, ultimately,
the point was...

819
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:15,872
I honor your journeys, guys.

820
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:17,942
And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.

821
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:19,076
Thank you.

822
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,077
Hey, Shank,

823
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,879
did you ever wonder
what it would be like...

824
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:23,747
if someone actually
did get your car?

825
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:25,216
Well, I know one thing...

826
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:27,817
whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.

827
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:33,490
Good day to you, madam.

828
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,691
Who are you?

829
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:38,095
I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.

830
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,197
And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaints

831
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,866
down at HQ.

832
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,801
Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.

833
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,169
Anyways, someone told Larry...

834
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:46,503
that we've been
hearing a lot of

835
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:47,905
gun sounds
and screaming sounds...

836
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:49,874
and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.

837
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:53,179
Whoa! This is nice.

838
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:57,614
Where have you been
all my life?

839
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:59,716
Uh, so I came to
check on things.

840
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,285
Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?

841
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:03,754
Oh, I'm Larry?

842
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,689
Uh, you said
Larry took the call.

843
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,032
Good job, Larry!

844
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:17,536
Yeah, worked like a charm!

845
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,743
<i>Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?</i>

846
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:27,613
And I need yours. Sorry.

847
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,918
<i>I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.</i>

848
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:36,789
This is the worst day
of my life!

849
00:35:37,991 --> 00:35:39,757
It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.

850
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,292
This game is cool.

851
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,326
Just get us out of here

852
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:44,595
so we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.

853
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:45,830
No problem.

854
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,200
Uh-oh.

855
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,070
Look at this guy
coming in hot.

856
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:10,089
You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!

857
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,262
You still have value,
Butcher Boy.

858
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,999
Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.

859
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:23,300
She looks upset.

860
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:25,603
Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.

861
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:35,780
Where are you going?

862
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:38,282
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.

863
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,620
There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.

864
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,288
Whoo!

865
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:58,303
Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.

866
00:36:58,305 --> 00:36:59,670
Oh, hello!

867
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:01,672
I believe you have
something of mine.

868
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,076
Yeah, come and get it.

869
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,256
Ooh!

870
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,126
This girl can drive.

871
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:32,437
Would you hurry up
and lose her?

872
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,340
I'm trying!

873
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:37,242
Hang on, chumbo!

874
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,152
I don't like this!

875
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,031
Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.

876
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,899
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?

877
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,068
Dead end! Dead end!

878
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,736
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

879
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:08,373
Whoo-hoo!

880
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,142
- Oh, yeah!
- That's the stuff.

881
00:38:10,144 --> 00:38:11,243
Good job, kid.

882
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,079
Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.

883
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:16,083
One exit straight ahead.

884
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:35,934
You're not gonna lose me
that easy.

885
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:37,235
How did you...?

886
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:38,769
Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.

887
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,038
Kid!

888
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:50,982
Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!

889
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:52,417
Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?

890
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:54,319
You just stay put,
don't panic.

891
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:55,487
I'm gonna talk to her.

892
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,022
Ralph, be careful.

893
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,091
It's fine.
This is what heroes do.

894
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:04,264
My bottom is stuck.

895
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:09,935
This car is not designed
for a big boy.

896
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:11,803
I'll tell you that. Hi.

897
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:14,306
You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?

898
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:16,841
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

899
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:19,444
No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.

900
00:39:19,446 --> 00:39:22,948
My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.

901
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,949
You should see her
racing around

902
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:25,784
her sweet little track...

903
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,252
in her cookie wafer car
we built together.

904
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:33,091
And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke...

905
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:35,093
and it was my fault...

906
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:37,262
so we're here
to try to fix it...

907
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,430
and we need money to do that,

908
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:40,165
and someone was
gonna pay us money...

909
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,866
- to steal your car...
- Okay, okay.

910
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,902
- ...and so we took it.
- You can stop crying.

911
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:45,170
Though I do respect

912
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:46,871
your wonderful display
of vulnerability.

913
00:39:46,873 --> 00:39:48,574
Thank you.

914
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:50,475
I get it, I do.

915
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:53,011
Friendship is
everything to us, too.

916
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,347
- Right, guys?
- Word. We're like family.

917
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,182
That's really great.

918
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,184
So, does this mean
we can keep your car?

919
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,187
Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.

920
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:03,355
Hey, you got
your phone on you?

921
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,490
- You know it.
- Let's make a video.

922
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,593
Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.

923
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:08,860
I'd love to.

924
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:10,161
Wait. What's the...?

925
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:12,964
What are you doing?

926
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,168
Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.

927
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:18,504
I'm gonna wreck it!

928
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:20,606
Good. All right.
Turn it off.

929
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:23,275
Ow.

930
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:24,510
What the heck
did you do that for?

931
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:25,711
Yeah.

932
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:28,547
There are much better ways
to make money on the Internet

933
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:30,248
than stealing cars...

934
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,419
such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.

935
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:35,253
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

936
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:37,490
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

937
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,425
It's the video-sharing site.

938
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:41,126
I'm just starting
your account...

939
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,462
All right, there you go.

940
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:47,232
If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.

941
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,335
A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss...

942
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:51,236
she's the head algorithm
over there.

943
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:52,605
Tell her I sent you.

944
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:54,072
Yesss will hook you up.

945
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:56,274
Wow, that's really nice
of you.

946
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:58,243
I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.

947
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:00,145
Well, thank you.

948
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,514
I should be thanking you,
little sister.

949
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:03,081
That race was fun.

950
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,916
Oh.

951
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:05,520
Well, thank you again.

952
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:07,386
Uh... You know...

953
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:10,289
While we're talking shop,
what move did you do

954
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,223
to get through
that tunnel of fire?

955
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:14,926
Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or...?

956
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:16,462
Maybe.

957
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:18,564
If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch...

958
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,466
I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.

959
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:21,667
See you.

960
00:41:36,116 --> 00:41:37,216
Whoa.

961
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:38,419
Show-off.

962
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:42,154
Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.

963
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:44,323
I know.
It was so exciting!

964
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,225
No, exciting is
when you smile.

965
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:47,959
Scary is when
you clench your butt,

966
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,595
and my butt
is still clenched.

967
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:51,630
Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me...

968
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:54,966
that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?

969
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:57,470
Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.

970
00:41:57,472 --> 00:41:59,971
Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool...

971
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:02,141
she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool...

972
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:04,310
Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?

973
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:08,547
What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.

974
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,150
There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.

975
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,486
Hey, just where do you think
you're going?

976
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,388
To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.

977
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,656
No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.

978
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:19,658
He can give us
some easier loot to find.

979
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,495
No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.

980
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,064
Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.

981
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,266
- Well, I do.
- Well, I...

982
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:29,201
- Hello, mister.
- Who are you?

983
00:42:29,203 --> 00:42:31,103
I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.

984
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:33,339
Huh. An actual eboy.

985
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:36,709
Just here to let you know your
bid expires in eight hours.

986
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,012
Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.

987
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:41,647
You got it, Jackson!

988
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:45,551
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley...

989
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:47,386
it will take 20 years

990
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:49,155
to make enough money
to buy the wheel.

991
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:52,224
All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.

992
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,059
But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place

993
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:55,363
is a terrible idea.

994
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:06,205
Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.

995
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:08,674
Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.

996
00:43:08,676 --> 00:43:10,543
- Look, there's you!
- Oh, yeah.

997
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,044
<i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>

998
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,415
I wonder
why those little guys

999
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,184
are giving your video
all those hearts?

1000
00:43:18,186 --> 00:43:19,418
Because obviously
they love me.

1001
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,654
I told you this place
was a good idea.

1002
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:23,522
Yeah,
sure you did, doof.

1003
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:26,091
Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?

1004
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:29,395
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.

1005
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,432
No. No. No.

1006
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:34,701
Uninspired, cliched...

1007
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,602
Ugh! YouTube's got this one.

1008
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:39,305
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

1009
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:42,541
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.

1010
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:44,076
No!

1011
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:47,179
Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?

1012
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:51,083
I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...

1013
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:52,786
which means
I curate the content...

1014
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:55,655
at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.

1015
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:57,423
Which means, I don't
have time to trifle...

1016
00:43:57,425 --> 00:44:00,059
with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobo

1017
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:01,327
that trundles
into my office.

1018
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:02,729
Call security, Maybe.

1019
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:06,432
Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.

1020
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:07,601
Who?

1021
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,235
The man
with the undulating jowls.

1022
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:10,637
So?

1023
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,105
His video has
1.3 million hearts.

1024
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:14,774
Well!

1025
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:17,309
Why didn't you tell me

1026
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:19,278
I was in the presence
of a genius?

1027
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,714
Grab him a drink.

1028
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:22,314
Yeah, this lady
named Shank...

1029
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:23,617
she actually made the video.

1030
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,785
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

1031
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:28,120
No wonder
your video's so dope.

1032
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,756
Shank is for real cool.

1033
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:31,123
Right?

1034
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,492
She is not.

1035
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:34,461
I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.

1036
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,464
Well, that's right,
you big baby.

1037
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:39,499
Yeah.

1038
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:40,667
Um, what'd you say
your name was?

1039
00:44:40,669 --> 00:44:42,334
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

1040
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:45,605
Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!

1041
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:49,609
And these are for you. Hearts,
hearts, hearts, hearts.

1042
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,210
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!

1043
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:52,344
Yes! Hearts!

1044
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,350
Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefest

1045
00:44:57,352 --> 00:44:59,118
you guys got going on here...

1046
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,687
but Shank kinda
told us that

1047
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:04,156
viral videos can make,
like, actual money?

1048
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:06,225
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

1049
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:08,428
Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.

1050
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,796
Ka-ching!

1051
00:45:09,798 --> 00:45:11,631
$43,000!

1052
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:14,601
Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.

1053
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:17,537
Oh, no, no, no.

1054
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:19,506
That's $43.

1055
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,543
43? That's not even
half of 27,001.

1056
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,846
And we only have eight
hours left to save my game.

1057
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,783
Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.

1058
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:31,484
Your video is tapped out.

1059
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:32,919
But I thought
I was trenching?

1060
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:34,454
Trending.

1061
00:45:34,456 --> 00:45:36,623
You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.

1062
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,592
Now, you're not.

1063
00:45:38,594 --> 00:45:39,394
Thanks for stopping by,
though.

1064
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,462
Aw!

1065
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:43,697
What are we gonna do, kid?

1066
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,633
All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.

1067
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:49,869
What if we go back
to <i>Slaughter Race</i>

1068
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:51,071
and I ask Shank really...

1069
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:55,408
No, no, no. We're not going
back to that death trap.

1070
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,644
Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos...

1071
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:00,280
of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?

1072
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:01,915
You mean
saturate the market?

1073
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:04,417
That could get you
a lot of hearts fast.

1074
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:05,652
Have you thought
this through at all?

1075
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:08,455
What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?

1076
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,757
I'll just copy
whatever's popular.

1077
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:13,360
Genius. Yo, Maybe,
what's trending right now?

1078
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:15,562
Mmm-hmm. Let's have
a lookie-lookie.

1079
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,631
As usual, human suffering
is number one...

1080
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,332
followed by hot pepper

1081
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:20,600
eating challenges...

1082
00:46:20,602 --> 00:46:22,302
video game walkthroughs...

1083
00:46:22,304 --> 00:46:23,737
oh, screaming goats
are back...

1084
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,840
unboxings, cooking demos,
makeup tutorials...

1085
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:29,843
and lastly, ugh, bee puns.

1086
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:32,381
<i>Let's "bee" friends.</i>

1087
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:35,715
Two weeks in a row, guys.

1088
00:46:35,717 --> 00:46:37,717
That's a fortnight
of bee puns.

1089
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,553
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.

1090
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,323
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Oh, yes, I am.

1091
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:46,292
And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup...

1092
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:47,727
and whatever else it takes!

1093
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:50,430
Because, kid, we came here
to save your game

1094
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,731
and we're gonna do it.

1095
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,600
I love it! Ha!

1096
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,402
That is what the Internet
was made for!

1097
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,838
Now, let's get to work.

1098
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:00,875
Seen it.

1099
00:47:00,877 --> 00:47:02,709
Saw that one.

1100
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:04,746
Seen it. Seen it.

1101
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,014
Huh?

1102
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:17,490
Yo, McNeely,
you remember Wreck-It Ralph?

1103
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:18,959
That bad guy
from the old video game?

1104
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,995
Yeah, exactly.

1105
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:22,295
I'm gonna send you
a super random video.

1106
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,596
Check it out, dude.

1107
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:24,901
Yeah, I'll give it a heart.
Whatever.

1108
00:47:35,945 --> 00:47:37,945
Hey, everybody, welcome to
<i>Up To the Meme-ent!</i>

1109
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,479
I'm your host,
Dani Fernandez.

1110
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,981
Nobody knows
who's making them,

1111
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,750
but the whole world
is going bonkers...

1112
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:45,452
over a series
of truly bizarre videos...

1113
00:47:45,454 --> 00:47:47,855
starring '80s-era bad guy
Wreck-It Ralph.

1114
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,790
Check out what
everyone is buzzing about...

1115
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,324
<i>over at BuzzzTube.com.</i>

1116
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,960
<i>Hey, guys,
Wreck-It Ralph here...</i>

1117
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:55,562
<i>with the ghost pepper
challenge.</i>

1118
00:47:55,564 --> 00:47:57,265
<i>Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.</i>

1119
00:47:57,967 --> 00:47:59,532
<i>Mmm. That's not so...</i>

1120
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:01,802
<i>Oh, it's very hot!
Oh, make it stop!</i>

1121
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:03,604
Yo, McNeely,
another one just dropped.

1122
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:04,739
Check it out, dude.

1123
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:06,707
Where are these things
coming from?

1124
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:07,842
Hey, Josey,

1125
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,943
did you see
the pepper challenge?

1126
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,044
Oh, not yet.

1127
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:12,512
I'm watching the one
where he just smacks his lips.

1128
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,881
It's disgusting.

1129
00:48:13,883 --> 00:48:15,348
<i>You don't want
any real hard lines.</i>

1130
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,785
<i>You just want to blend that
out there, like this...</i>

1131
00:48:17,787 --> 00:48:19,687
<i>And that, my friends,</i>

1132
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,523
<i>is how you achieve
the perfect cat eye.</i>

1133
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,624
<i>I always start</i>

1134
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:27,027
<i>with the hootnanny.
Shift it into a floss.</i>

1135
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,396
<i>And now I finish with
a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?</i>

1136
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:31,932
<i>Follow along with me,</i>

1137
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:35,703
<i>and I'm gonna give this little
cloud a little friend...</i>

1138
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,471
<i>in the form of a tree.</i>

1139
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:38,775
<i>Everybody needs a friend.</i>

1140
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,909
<i>Look at these guys.</i>

1141
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:43,878
<i>Look at this one,
sleeping under his ear.</i>

1142
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,080
<i>You couch potatoes.
Wake up.</i>

1143
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:49,049
<i>We've been baking
at about 950 degrees</i>

1144
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,551
<i>now for six hours...</i>

1145
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,052
<i>so she should be ready.</i>

1146
00:48:53,422 --> 00:48:56,423
<i>Voila! Burnt pie!</i>

1147
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:57,892
<i>Let's have a little whiff</i>
<i>of this here.</i>

1148
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,762
<i>My hair,</i>
<i>my hair! My hair!</i>

1149
00:49:00,596 --> 00:49:02,630
This man is on fire.

1150
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:04,732
Literal and figurative fire.

1151
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,600
But he still needs
200 million hearts

1152
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:08,035
in the next five hours...

1153
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:10,037
or this beautiful child
loses her game.

1154
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:12,540
That's why
I'm on to phase two...

1155
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:15,042
you, my elite Pop-Up Army.

1156
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:17,144
I need you out there
popping up...

1157
00:49:17,146 --> 00:49:19,647
and getting clicks
all over the Internet.

1158
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:22,550
I'm talking Tumblr,
Instagram, Mashable.

1159
00:49:22,552 --> 00:49:23,951
Be my pied pipers and

1160
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:26,620
lead that beautiful traffic
to BuzzzTube...

1161
00:49:26,622 --> 00:49:28,858
because Wreck-It Ralph
needs his hearts.

1162
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:35,462
Hey, mister! Hey, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you, you.

1163
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:36,931
You don't wanna miss this.

1164
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:37,965
It's the latest
Wreck-It Ralph video.

1165
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,535
Click it. Click it!

1166
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:54,915
Man oh Manischewitz,
that looks so fun.

1167
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:56,151
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

1168
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:58,786
I don't know. Can you be
annoyingly aggressive?

1169
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,622
I don't know.
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1170
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,826
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1171
00:50:04,894 --> 00:50:06,994
Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.

1172
00:50:06,996 --> 00:50:08,596
Thank you!

1173
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:09,730
If you're going, I wanna go.

1174
00:50:09,732 --> 00:50:13,168
No, baby, you've got to stay
here and be my movie star.

1175
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,470
What? No, no, no. Me and the
kid are like shoes and socks.

1176
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,838
Or peanut butter and bacon.

1177
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,640
One cannot exist
without the other.

1178
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:20,908
Go on, kid, tell her.

1179
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,876
It's true.

1180
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:25,446
In fact, it's so true
that we will be fine

1181
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:27,514
if we're apart
for a minute.

1182
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:30,018
Come on, pal. It's my game
we're trying to save.

1183
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,621
I just wanna get out there
and be useful.

1184
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:33,654
But without me?

1185
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,689
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.

1186
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,858
Oh, and you're
some mature adult?

1187
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,860
Well, I'm bigger.

1188
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,795
Don't be insecure,
big fella.

1189
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:44,099
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.

1190
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:46,869
She'll be in
my personal web browser.

1191
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,504
And your app comes
with BuzzzFace...

1192
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,706
so you can keep in touch
anywhere on the Internet.

1193
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,541
See, I'll be fine.

1194
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:56,445
I know, I just...

1195
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:03,084
We haven't been apart
in like six years.

1196
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,988
I'm going to miss you.

1197
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:07,889
You'll be fine, too.

1198
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:09,657
The more hearts
your videos get,

1199
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:11,625
the faster
we'll get the wheel.

1200
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,228
And then we can go home.

1201
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,762
Look, we'll be celebrating

1202
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:16,998
at Tapper's this time
tomorrow, buddy.

1203
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,903
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1204
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,170
Bye!

1205
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:25,006
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.

1206
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:30,912
So where exactly
are you sending her?

1207
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:33,181
Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game...

1208
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:34,851
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

1209
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:38,253
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.

1210
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:40,889
Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.

1211
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,190
Why don't we
send her somewhere

1212
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:44,859
a little more totally
different than that...

1213
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:47,262
and nowhere near there?

1214
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:50,531
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.

1215
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,767
That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess...

1216
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:54,803
so how about this one here

1217
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:56,237
with the sweet little
pink castle?

1218
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,405
I love it.

1219
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:01,311
Okay, I'll redirect our newest
pop-up to OhMyDisney.com.

1220
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:10,253
Jeez Louise, this place
is bonkers! Whoa!

1221
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:17,995
To infinity and beyond!

1222
00:52:21,565 --> 00:52:24,799
Aw, come on. Princesses
and cartoon characters?

1223
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:26,267
Lame.

1224
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,970
Hey, easy there.

1225
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:31,174
Oh, I mean,
no offense or anything.

1226
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:34,275
Well, time to get to work.

1227
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,810
And for your final question.

1228
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:38,880
"My friends
would describe me as?"

1229
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:41,983
<i>"Smart, funny,
kind, or brave."</i>

1230
00:52:41,985 --> 00:52:42,986
<i>Um...</i>

1231
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,087
Kind, I guess?

1232
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:50,125
Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is

1233
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:51,926
Snow White!

1234
00:52:51,928 --> 00:52:53,328
I do believe our friendship

1235
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,330
will be the fairest
of them all!

1236
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:58,666
Hey, wanna meet my BFF?
It's Wreck-It Ralph.

1237
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:00,668
Just click here
to see his new video.

1238
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,605
Thank you.

1239
00:53:03,607 --> 00:53:06,241
<i>Yeah, um, in</i> Captain America:
The First Avenger...

1240
00:53:06,243 --> 00:53:08,143
<i>Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,</i>

1241
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:10,311
<i>the World Tree,
Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.</i>

1242
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:12,180
<i>Are we to believe, sir,</i>

1243
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:13,784
<i>that you are a descendant
of that tree?</i>

1244
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:16,651
I am Groot.

1245
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,686
<i>Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.</i>

1246
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:20,855
<i>Um, what is Drax really like?</i>

1247
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:22,358
- I am Groot.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1248
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,693
<i>Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?</i>

1249
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:26,761
- I...
- Excuse me.

1250
00:53:26,763 --> 00:53:27,829
I'll take this one.
He is Groot,

1251
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:28,930
I am Vanellope,

1252
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:30,233
click here
to meet Wreck-It Ralph.

1253
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:34,836
Eh, this is almost too easy.

1254
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,237
<i>Hey, do you
have a permit for that pop-up?</i>

1255
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:37,672
Uh...

1256
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:40,175
<i>That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.</i>

1257
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:42,043
Boop!

1258
00:53:42,045 --> 00:53:43,180
<i>She's getting away.</i>

1259
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:46,850
<i>This way.</i>

1260
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:48,417
Ooh!

1261
00:53:48,419 --> 00:53:49,619
Sorry, mister!

1262
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:56,192
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!

1263
00:53:58,196 --> 00:53:59,661
<i>I think she
went down this way. Come on.</i>

1264
00:53:59,663 --> 00:54:00,995
<i>Roger that.</i>

1265
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,130
<i>Did you see
a kid come through here?</i>

1266
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:04,866
She came running through here
like a headless hen.

1267
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:07,902
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1268
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:09,904
<i>No, maybe she went down</i>

1269
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:11,207
<i>to the</i> Air Bud <i>pavilion.</i>

1270
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:12,809
<i>Come on. Let's check it out.</i>

1271
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,217
Uh, hi!

1272
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:27,089
Whoa, whoa.
Ladies, I can explain.

1273
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:30,059
See, I'm a princess, too.

1274
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:31,893
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

1275
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:33,928
Princess Vanellope
Von Schweetz...

1276
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,865
of the, uh, <i>Sugar Rush</i>
Von Schweetzes.

1277
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:38,167
I'm sure you've heard of us.

1278
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:40,369
It'd be embarrassing for you
if you haven't.

1279
00:54:41,272 --> 00:54:43,838
Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?

1280
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,007
What kind?

1281
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,841
- Do you have magic hair?
- No.

1282
00:54:46,843 --> 00:54:48,444
- Magic hands?
- No.

1283
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:50,712
- Do animals talk to you?
- No.

1284
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:51,846
- Were you poisoned?
- No!

1285
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:53,115
- Cursed?
- No!

1286
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:54,816
- Kidnapped or enslaved?
- No!

1287
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:56,418
Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?

1288
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,953
Then I have to assume
you made a deal

1289
00:54:57,955 --> 00:54:59,355
with an underwater
sea witch...

1290
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:00,256
where she took your voice

1291
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,757
in exchange
for a pair of human legs?

1292
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:05,127
No! Good Lord,
who would do that?

1293
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:06,728
Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?

1294
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,997
Ew! Barf!

1295
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:09,131
Do you have daddy issues?

1296
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,399
I don't even have a mom.

1297
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:12,201
Neither do we!

1298
00:55:12,203 --> 00:55:14,736
And now for
the million-dollar question.

1299
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:17,239
Do people assume
all your problems got solved

1300
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:19,141
because a big strong man
showed up?

1301
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:21,277
Yes! What is up with that?

1302
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,878
She is a princess!

1303
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:25,981
Who made your gown?

1304
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:27,815
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

1305
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:29,118
Oh, this old thing?

1306
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,986
Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.

1307
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:32,087
- As would I.
- Me too!

1308
00:55:32,089 --> 00:55:33,889
- So cool.
- Best outfit ever!

1309
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:35,057
Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!

1310
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:36,460
I'll get my mice on this.

1311
00:55:39,497 --> 00:55:41,964
So this is love.

1312
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:46,335
All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!

1313
00:55:46,337 --> 00:55:48,304
Yay, Vanellope!

1314
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:51,106
Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world...

1315
00:55:51,108 --> 00:55:53,275
I never thought
I'd get to wear a real...

1316
00:55:53,277 --> 00:55:54,777
what's it called again?

1317
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,213
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

1318
00:55:57,215 --> 00:56:01,116

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! What's going on?

1320
00:56:03,821 --> 00:56:05,321
Uh, she's singing.

1321
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:08,490
Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.

1322
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:10,326
Wait, you all
saw it too, right?

1323
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:11,527
That's what happens

1324
00:56:11,529 --> 00:56:13,829
when a princess
sings about her dreams.

1325
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:17,132
Oh, that's never happened
to me. I mean, not even once.

1326
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:19,034
Why don't you give it
a try?

1327
00:56:19,036 --> 00:56:22,004
What is it you really want?
Sing about that.

1328
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:23,472
Okay. Uh, sure.

1329
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:25,209
Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.

<i>♪ Oh, yes

1332
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,823
Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.

1333
00:56:40,825 --> 00:56:42,157
Mmm-hmm.

1334
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:44,493
So, this steering wheel
you sing of,

1335
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:46,095
that's a metaphor?

1336
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:48,297
Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just...

1337
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,899
I literally want
a steering wheel.

1338
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:53,102
I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.

1339
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:54,537
Maybe a little.

1340
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:57,940
But sometimes
your song can't start...

1341
00:56:57,942 --> 00:57:00,077
until you go someplace
to reflect.

1342
00:57:01,078 --> 00:57:02,545
What works for some of us...

1343
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:06,150
is finding a form of water
and staring at it.

1344
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,183
What?

1345
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:10,520
Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!

1346
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:11,920
I stare at the ocean.

1347
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:13,088
Horse trough.

1348
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,223
Soap bubbles!

1349
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:16,927
Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water...

1350
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:19,396
Uh, important water.

1351
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:22,231
Right. Of course.
"Important water."

1352
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,567
I stare at
the important water...

1353
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:27,903
and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?

1354
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:28,971
- For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.

1355
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:31,574
Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.

1356
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,977
Five minutes,
Princesses.

1357
00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:37,580
Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizlet

1358
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:39,281

1359
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:41,584
Okay, thank you.

1360
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:44,621
Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.

1361
00:57:44,623 --> 00:57:46,889
It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.

1362
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:49,024
And best of luck
finding your song.

1363
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:57,300
Uh-huh.

1364
00:57:57,302 --> 00:57:58,601
What did she just say?

1365
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,537
We don't know.
We can't understand her.

1366
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:02,238
She's from
the other studio.

1367
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,972
Ah.

1368
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:06,175
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...

1369
00:58:06,177 --> 00:58:08,911
with a little box
I'm gonna open.

1370
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:10,380
Let's see what we got here.

1371
00:58:10,382 --> 00:58:13,683
A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.

1372
00:58:13,685 --> 00:58:15,185
Got a little heft to it.

1373
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:16,985
Something wobbling
around in there.

1374
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:18,455
Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.

1375
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:19,589
Let's open it up.

1376
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:25,328
Man, who would've
guessed a bee pun

1377
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,597
would be the thing
to put us over the top?

1378
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,399
Huh. That's the Internet
for you.

1379
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:32,402
All right, it is uploading.

1380
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:33,636
Hey, mister!

1381
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:35,003
Oh. Hi, eboy.

1382
00:58:35,005 --> 00:58:36,272
Just here to let you know

1383
00:58:36,274 --> 00:58:39,007
your bid does expire

1384
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:41,077
Thanks, little eboy.

1385
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:42,080
You got it, chairman.

1386
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:44,012
You hear that, Yesss?

1387
00:58:44,014 --> 00:58:45,482
We don't have
a lot of time left.

1388
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,649
Okay. We just gotta...

No, no, no.

1390
00:58:48,986 --> 00:58:50,687
No! Not you!

1391
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:52,355
What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?

1392
00:58:52,357 --> 00:58:53,523
What does that mean?

1393
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:55,125
The file's not loading.

1394
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:57,060
If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.

1395
00:58:57,062 --> 00:58:59,962
- Hmm.
- You don't have enough hearts.

1396
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:01,331
Ralph, where are you going?

1397
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,567
I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.

1398
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:04,501
Ah! Genius! Good thinking.

1399
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,170
Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!

1400
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:12,542
Only one person.

Yep, here we go.

1404
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,649

You guys!

1405
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:21,551
Aw. A cat?

1406
00:59:21,553 --> 00:59:25,457
You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.

1407
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:27,524
Aw.

1408
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:28,658
What?

1409
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,627
Give me that hose, partner.

1410
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:34,097
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.

1411
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,699
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.

1412
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:39,337
That's it.
Let's see who's in here.

1413
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:41,039
Hello?

1414

Anybody in here?

1415
00:59:46,411 --> 00:59:48,346
What the heck is this place?

1416
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:51,616
Some kind of libary?

1417
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:55,351
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

1418

Hey, they're talking about me.

1419
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,124
Gee whiz,

1424
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,434
"So stupid."

1425
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:13,572
"Ralph is the worst."

1426
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:16,475
"I hate him."

1427
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:20,078
"He's so fat and ugly."

1428
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:26,652
"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."

1429
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:36,526
Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?

1430
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:38,129
Hey, I got to show you...

1431
01:00:39,397 --> 01:00:40,432
Oh.

1432
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,433
First rule
of the Internet...

1433
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,336
do not read the comments.

1434
01:00:46,338 --> 01:00:47,573
I should have told you that.

1435
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,840
Look.

1436
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:53,142
This place can bring out
the worst in some people...

1437
01:00:53,144 --> 01:00:54,745
but you gotta ignore all this.

1438
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:58,147
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.

1439
01:00:58,149 --> 01:01:00,149
I don't care.
It's fine.

1440
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:04,624
People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.

1441
01:01:05,758 --> 01:01:07,357
It's just a good reminder

1442
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,726
that this is the only heart

1443
01:01:08,728 --> 01:01:09,562
that really matters.

1444
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:12,161
Vanellope gave me this...

1445
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:13,597
and as long as she likes me...

1446
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,432
I don't need anybody else.

1447
01:01:15,434 --> 01:01:17,100
And I sure
don't need the Internet.

1448
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:18,569
Hold on.

1449
01:01:18,571 --> 01:01:20,604
It's not all bad.

1450
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:22,606
The Internet
can also be a place...

1451
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:25,108
where you find a steering
wheel at one website...

1452
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,445
and make enough money
to buy it at another one.

1453
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,581
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.

1454
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:31,849
Wait, really?

1455
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:34,217
Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.

1456
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:37,186
You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!

1457
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:38,422
Oh, my gosh!

1458
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:39,857
This is great!

1459
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:41,792
Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't
have done it without you!

1460
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:43,192
That's really true.

1461
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:44,628
Hey, eboy?

1462
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,195
What do you need, ace?

1463
01:01:46,197 --> 01:01:47,765
Can you give me a ride?

1464
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,835
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

1465
01:01:51,202 --> 01:01:53,573
Come on, song, come on.

1466
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,141
I'm reflecting.

1467
01:01:56,776 --> 01:01:58,141
What is it that I want?

1468
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,510
What is my quest?

1469
01:01:59,512 --> 01:02:01,480
What is my dream?

1470
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:06,149
Well, ladies, I tried.

1471
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:08,619
No song for this princess,
I guess.

1472
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:10,556
Ooh! Huh.

1473
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,157
How does this thing work?

1474
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:15,559
<i>Hey, kid, can you see me?</i>

1475
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:17,461
Yeah! Yeah,
you're right there.

1476
01:02:17,463 --> 01:02:19,563
<i>We did it! We got the money!</i>

1477
01:02:19,565 --> 01:02:21,899
No way, Ralph!
That's great!

1478
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:24,401
I'm on my way to ebay
right now with the eboy.

1479
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:25,669
We're almost there, champ.

1480
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:26,804
Good work, eboy.

1481
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:29,239
Hey, meet me out in front of
ebay in five minutes, okay?

1482
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:30,808
<i>Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

1483
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,676
We're going home, kid!

1484
01:02:32,678 --> 01:02:34,845
<i>Our lives can finally
get back to normal.</i>

1485
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:35,815
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1486
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,418
Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.

1487
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,820
So, I guess that's it.

1488
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:45,891
I guess I just wanted a...
a steering wheel.

1489
01:02:46,826 --> 01:02:49,259
And now, I got it, so...

1490
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:50,563
whoo-hoo.

1491
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:56,834

Oh. Ralph. Ralph!
Hey, there.

1545
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,146
Oh, hey, Spamley.

1546
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:29,480
What's the good word,
brother?

1547
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,916
Well, the good word is I just
paid for the steering wheel...

1548
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:33,451
and we are going home.

1549
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:34,552
Congratulations.

1550
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:35,820
Thanks.

1551
01:06:35,822 --> 01:06:37,956
Hey, have you seen
Vanellope anywhere?

1552
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:40,058
Oh, uh, your little chum?
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

1553
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,093
Hope she's not lost.

1554
01:06:42,095 --> 01:06:44,030
Let me try to reach her
on this doohickey.

1555
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,608
See over there?
Over that mountain?

1556
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,843
- Yeah.
- That's the Sequoia Speedway.

1557
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:00,478
<i>It's gonna be unlocked
next month.</i>

1558
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,480
Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

1559
01:07:02,482 --> 01:07:04,015
<i>I think
the track will end...</i>

1560
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:06,618
right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.

1561
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,653
Oh, I love it.

1562
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:09,954
Hey, can I tell you something

1563
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:12,191
that I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?

1564
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:13,625
Of course.

1565
01:07:13,627 --> 01:07:15,160
I know it sounds crazy...

1566
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:18,665
but the second I walked
into this game, it felt...

1567
01:07:19,532 --> 01:07:21,733
Well, it felt like home.

1568
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:24,103
I mean, more than
<i>Sugar Rush</i> ever did.

1569
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:26,105
Oh, yeah? How so?

1570
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:27,939
'Cause it's like my dream.

1571
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:30,142
It's full of weirdos...

1572
01:07:30,144 --> 01:07:33,511
and the racing
is super dangerous...

1573
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:35,849
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

1574
01:07:36,716 --> 01:07:38,017
I mean, back home,

1575
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:40,485
I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...

1576
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:43,490
because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.

1577
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:46,793
Hmm.

1578
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:52,530
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

1579
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:54,199
There is no law

1580
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:57,635
saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

1581
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:58,638
You know?

1582
01:07:59,073 --> 01:08:00,205
Whoa.

1583
01:08:00,207 --> 01:08:01,874
Yeah.

1584
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:05,244
You are a very
wise person, Shank.

1585
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:07,645
And a good friend, too.

1586
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:09,014
Thank you.

1587
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:11,183
Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."

1588
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:14,820
You know,
after you go home

1589
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:16,721
and your life
gets back to normal...

1590
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:18,690
you are always
welcome here.

1591
01:08:18,692 --> 01:08:21,693
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

1592
01:08:21,695 --> 01:08:23,764
I want this to be my life.

1593
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:25,967
I can't go home now.

1594
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:29,236
I just can't.

1595
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,578
Wow.

1596
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:40,713
You know,
where I come from,

1597
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:43,015
that's called
a kick in the face.

1598
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:44,950
I can't believe it.

1599
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:47,920
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

1600
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:49,924
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

1601
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,993
No, this can't be right.

1602
01:08:53,294 --> 01:08:55,127
No, she's been brainwashed.

1603
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:56,628
That's what this is.

1604
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,663
Because the Vanellope I know

1605
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:59,098
would never abandon me
like that.

1606
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,866
I gotta get her out
of there now.

1607
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,135
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1608
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:04,269
I admire the impulse...

1609
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:06,805
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

1610
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:08,307
she's liable to hold it
against you.

1611
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:10,743
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

1612
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:11,877
that's obviously bad for her?

1613
01:09:11,879 --> 01:09:13,078
Of course not.

1614
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,014
Then how do I make her leave?

1615
01:09:15,016 --> 01:09:18,117
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

1616
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:21,987
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...

1617
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:25,791
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1618
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:27,760
- Who's asking?
- Whoa.

1619
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:29,094
Back home, me and the kid

1620
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:31,697
used to goof off
in this game called <i>Tron.</i>

1621
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,266
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...

1622
01:09:34,268 --> 01:09:36,268
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

1623
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,936
So, is there a way

1624
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:40,105
to do something
like that to <i>Slaughter Race?</i>

1625
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:41,142
Oh, there's ways.

1626
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:43,577
Follow me.

1627
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:49,948
I got mothers' maiden names...

1628
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,284
social security numbers,
PIN numbers...

1629
01:09:52,286 --> 01:09:53,719
Now, this area down here

1630
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:55,287
is what's called the Darknet.

1631
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:57,156
A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...

1632
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:59,324
so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!

1633
01:09:59,326 --> 01:10:01,126
Oh, there you are.

1634
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:03,662
Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.

1635
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:05,664
But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...

1636
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:08,636
Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.

1637
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:10,836
Oh, oh, here we go.

1638
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:12,871
Are you sure this is safe?

1639
01:10:12,873 --> 01:10:14,706
Is it safe?
Of course it is.

1640
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:17,676
Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.

1641
01:10:17,678 --> 01:10:19,180
Oh, he has a little brother?

1642
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:24,783
Double Dan!

1643
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:26,185
Long time no see.

1644
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:27,686
Who are you?

1645
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:29,088
JP Spamley.

1646
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,090
Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...

1647
01:10:31,092 --> 01:10:34,726
which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.

1648
01:10:34,728 --> 01:10:36,196
- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1649
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,297
Are you looking at my brother?

1650
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,364
- No, sir.
- Don't you look

1651
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:39,332
at my little brother.

1652
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,667
- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!

1653
01:10:44,705 --> 01:10:45,971
You?

1654
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:47,840
What are you doing here?

1655
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,074
Uh...

1656
01:10:49,076 --> 01:10:51,311
The reason I came to
your neck of the face...

1657
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,113
I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.

1658
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,449
Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...

1659
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,917
Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...

1660
01:10:58,919 --> 01:11:00,353
I heard a rumor
that you could, well,

1661
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:02,754
give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...

1662
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:03,722
that might be able to

1663
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:05,724
slow down
the <i>Slaughter Ra</i> game?

1664
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:07,460
Oh, yeah.

1665
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:10,296
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

1666
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:11,397
Crash it? No!

1667
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,266
No, no, no.

1668
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,867
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

1669
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:16,001
Hmm.

1670
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:18,071
If there's a way
to just, uh...

1671
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,038
I don't know...

1672
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,374
just make the cars
go slow or something...

1673
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,976
so the game is boring...

1674
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:26,112
and my friend
comes back home to me.

1675
01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:30,016
Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.

1676
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:33,419
Easy there, boy.

1677
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:35,255
He's keen.

1678
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:39,092
Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

1679
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,927
Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

1680
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:43,831
that make a program insecure.

1681
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,135
You release him into that
<i>Slaughter Race</i> game,

1682
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,870
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

1683
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:53,439
Then he'll copy that defect

1684
01:11:53,441 --> 01:11:56,176
and spread it
all over the game...

1685
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:59,811
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...

1686
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:02,248
just like you wanted.

1687
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,416
Okay.

1688
01:12:03,418 --> 01:12:05,318
Just to be super clear here...

1689
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,785
no one gets hurt, right?

1690
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:07,921
Are you stupid?

1691
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,088
Well, uh...

1692
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,291
Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...

1693
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,791
is if you are stupid.

1694
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:14,294
All you have to do...

1695
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,830
is make sure the virus stays
in <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1696
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:19,832
Right. Don't be stupid.

1697
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:21,167
Make sure it doesn't get out
of <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1698
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:22,268
Goiter it. Gah!

1699
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:23,436
- Got it! Got it.
- Get out!

1700
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:24,971
Thank you,
you're a cyst face.

1701
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,139
- Out!
- I mean, assistance.

1702
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,007
Thank you for your
cyst face... Assistance.

1703
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:29,475
- Get out!
- Goodbye!

1704
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:31,044
Ugh.

1705
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,015
Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.

1706
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:37,350
Ah, beginner's luck.

1707
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:39,018
Come on, kid.
I know a hustle

1708
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,119
when I see one.

1709
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,223
- Player's on the way.
- Thanks, Bob.

1710
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,824
- Let's roll!
- Game faces on, guys.

1711
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:46,926
Show time. You ready
for your first race?

1712
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:49,329
Um, yeah. I think so.

1713
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,931
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

1714
01:12:51,933 --> 01:12:54,100
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.

1715
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:56,238
Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?

1716
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,205
Not exactly.

1717
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:01,841
Come on, V.
He's your best friend.

1718
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:03,142
You gotta let him know

1719
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:04,877
you're planning on
staying here for a while.

1720
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:07,880
I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.

1721
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:09,882
Yeah, he might,
but you guys...

1722
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:12,485
you'll talk, you'll work it
out, you'll figure it out.

1723
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:14,287
Yeah, but what if we don't?

1724
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:17,090
What if his feelings
get hurt so bad...

1725
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,158
he won't wanna be
my friend anymore?

1726
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,395
Look.
All friendships change...

1727
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,230
but the good ones...

1728
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:25,566
they get stronger
because of it.

1729
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,935
Uh, Shank,
I hate to bother you...

1730
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:31,271
but the player is waiting.

1731
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,139
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do, kid.

1732
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:34,209
It's your call.

1733
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,077
Yeah, okay.

1734
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,077
All right.

1735
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:39,247
Let's race.

1736
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,564
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:35,884
I find two results
for your query.

1898
01:22:35,886 --> 01:22:38,020
Either you put all the clones
in therapy.

1899
01:22:38,022 --> 01:22:39,988
Not very realistic.

1900
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,957
Or, the anti-virus district
is surrounded

1901
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:44,026
by a gate made from
security software.

1902
01:22:44,028 --> 01:22:44,993
If Vanellope could somehow

1903
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:46,495
lead all of the clones
through the gate...

1904
01:22:46,497 --> 01:22:48,497
they would be deleted
all at once.

1905
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:51,700
Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.

1906
01:22:51,702 --> 01:22:54,436
Wait. We know a pied piper.

1907
01:22:54,438 --> 01:22:55,871
- We do?
- Yesss.

1908
01:22:55,873 --> 01:22:57,439
- Who?
- Yesss!

1909
01:22:57,441 --> 01:22:58,108
Yeah, but who is it?

1910
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:01,946
Oh, you mean Yesss!

1911
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:08,750
Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.

1912
01:23:08,752 --> 01:23:10,485
It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,

1913
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,688
wouldn't you say?

1914
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,089
Guess I forgot
to tell Ralph

1915
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:15,824
that when you
break the Internet...

1916
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:18,627
you don't literally
have to break the Internet.

1917
01:23:18,629 --> 01:23:19,862
I can't believe he did this.

1918
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:22,497
Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously made

1919
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:24,633
some real questionable
choices here.

1920
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:28,770
But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game...

1921
01:23:28,772 --> 01:23:32,576
so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.

1922
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:35,613
You ready to pied the piper?

1923
01:23:38,649 --> 01:23:40,651
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

1924
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:45,188
It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...

1925
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,590
who you can't live without!

1926
01:23:47,558 --> 01:23:49,127
Friend!

1927
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:54,930
Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as...

1928
01:23:54,932 --> 01:23:56,698
needy, and clingy,

1929
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,070
and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.

1930
01:24:00,471 --> 01:24:01,770
Listen, kid...

1931
01:24:01,772 --> 01:24:02,638
I don't blame you

1932
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,907
for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.

1933
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:07,076
I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.

1934
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:10,779
I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.

1935
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:12,514
I know I was, but I...

1936
01:24:12,516 --> 01:24:13,649
Hey, my babies!

1937
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:16,785
That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!

1938
01:24:16,787 --> 01:24:18,455
All right, to be
continued, okay?

1939
01:24:26,131 --> 01:24:28,131
Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!

1940
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:45,580
You guys okay?

1941
01:24:45,582 --> 01:24:46,849
I'm fine!

1942
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:49,852
Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.

1943
01:24:49,854 --> 01:24:52,155
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.

1944
01:24:53,258 --> 01:24:55,590
Uh...

1945
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:57,794
Uh, guys?

1946
01:25:08,173 --> 01:25:11,606
Friend?

1947
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:13,876
That is unsettling.

1948
01:25:17,716 --> 01:25:19,017
Friend.

1949
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:21,284
Get Vanellope out of here now.

1950
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:22,418
What about you, Ralph?

1951
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,555
Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.

1952
01:25:25,589 --> 01:25:26,925
Hey, you!

1953
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:32,261
You keep away from her!

1954
01:25:32,263 --> 01:25:34,931
I'm gonna wreck it!

1955
01:25:37,135 --> 01:25:39,971
She's not your friend!

1956
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,539
She's my friend!

1957
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:45,008
Here it is, this way.

1958
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,078
Come on, kid.
We gotta move.

1959
01:25:59,657 --> 01:26:00,992
Eeeee-oh-boy!

1960
01:26:18,076 --> 01:26:19,144
No!

1961
01:26:20,178 --> 01:26:21,844
Whoa!

1962
01:26:21,846 --> 01:26:25,016
Vanellope!

1963
01:26:29,687 --> 01:26:31,956
Hey! Let go of me!

1964
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:36,094
- Kid!
- Ralph!

1965
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:42,665
Hey!

1966
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:45,101
Hey, get back here!

1967
01:26:45,103 --> 01:26:46,104
Huh?

1968
01:26:47,872 --> 01:26:49,305
You put her down!

1969
01:26:49,307 --> 01:26:51,140
Whoa!

1970
01:27:13,232 --> 01:27:14,799
Vanellope!

1971
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:34,320
You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!

1972
01:27:34,986 --> 01:27:37,387
No!

1973
01:27:37,389 --> 01:27:38,921
Well, you are!

1974
01:27:38,923 --> 01:27:40,859
And I will never
be your friend!

1975
01:27:45,063 --> 01:27:46,365
Hey, doofus!

1976
01:27:47,266 --> 01:27:48,066
Ralph!

1977
01:27:56,007 --> 01:27:58,244
Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!

1978
01:28:04,949 --> 01:28:06,350
I got you, little sister.

1979
01:28:10,055 --> 01:28:11,721
Now go!
Get out of here!

1980
01:28:11,723 --> 01:28:13,390
- Ralph!
- Go!

1981
01:28:13,392 --> 01:28:16,195
No!
Don't hurt him!

1982
01:28:16,861 --> 01:28:17,929
Please, no!

1983
01:28:22,734 --> 01:28:25,202
Stop it!
You're squishing him!

1984
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:28,939
You're gonna
kill my best friend!

1985
01:28:33,145 --> 01:28:35,414
Fine! You win!
You win, okay?

1986
01:28:38,918 --> 01:28:41,220
Just please put him down.

1987
01:28:43,856 --> 01:28:46,390
I'll be your
only friend, okay?

1988
01:28:46,392 --> 01:28:48,458
Just let him go.

1989
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,062
No! No, kid.

1990
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,231
Huh?

1991
01:28:53,866 --> 01:28:56,099
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

1992
01:28:56,101 --> 01:28:58,969
Put him down
and I'll go with you...

1993
01:28:58,971 --> 01:29:00,470
and we'll be
best friends forever.

1994
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,974
Just me and you.

1995
01:29:03,976 --> 01:29:05,177
That's what you want, right?

1996
01:29:08,447 --> 01:29:09,747
Well,
that's not what I want!

1997
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:14,084
It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!

1998
01:29:14,086 --> 01:29:16,220
You don't own her!

1999
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:19,022
That's not how
friendship works!

2000
01:29:19,024 --> 01:29:20,859
You need to let her go!

2001
01:29:22,995 --> 01:29:23,996
Hey.

2002
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:29,134
You need to let her go.

2003
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:35,241
I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.

2004
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:39,144
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.

2005
01:29:41,013 --> 01:29:43,215
But you're gonna be okay.

2006
01:29:45,884 --> 01:29:47,584
And we're gonna be okay.

2007
01:29:47,586 --> 01:29:48,854
Right, kid?

2008
01:29:50,489 --> 01:29:53,158
Of course we are. Always.

2009
01:29:55,294 --> 01:29:58,362
See? No matter
where she goes...

2010
01:29:58,364 --> 01:30:01,198
or where she lives...

2011
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,467
she's always gonna
be our friend.

2012
01:30:03,469 --> 01:30:05,936
And we just gotta trust her.

2013
01:30:05,938 --> 01:30:08,374
Because that's what
best friends do.

2014
01:30:09,475 --> 01:30:10,976
Right?

2015
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:26,892
Thanks, buddy.

2016
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,296
Wow!

2017
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:33,897
I feel good about this.

2018
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:35,899
Mmm.

2019
01:30:35,901 --> 01:30:38,237
Mmm.

2020
01:30:40,272 --> 01:30:41,439
Ralph, look!

2021
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:43,375
I think you fixed
your insecurity!

2022
01:30:45,378 --> 01:30:46,611
You're right.

2023
01:30:46,613 --> 01:30:48,945
Whoo-hoo!

2024
01:30:48,947 --> 01:30:50,113
Ralph, no!

2025
01:30:52,117 --> 01:30:53,618
Whoa!

2026
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,620
Park it right here, Ralph!

2027
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,954
Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!

2028
01:30:57,956 --> 01:31:00,125
Whoo!

2029
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:02,527
Wow, that didn't work.

2030
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:09,066
Look up there!

2031
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:10,936
It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.

2032
01:31:19,579 --> 01:31:20,380
Hah!

2033
01:32:09,429 --> 01:32:11,464
Mmm.

2034
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,435
Oh, thanks, Frogger.

2035
01:32:15,968 --> 01:32:17,103
Wait a minute.

2036
01:32:17,637 --> 01:32:19,270
Who are all of you?

2037
01:32:19,272 --> 01:32:21,305
We're friends of Vanellope's.

2038
01:32:21,307 --> 01:32:23,474
Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope's

2039
01:32:23,476 --> 01:32:25,109
is a friend of ours.

2040
01:32:25,111 --> 01:32:26,978
You're welcome.

2041
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,346
Ralph!

2042
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:30,448
Looking good, big fella!

2043
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:32,083
Heyo!

2044
01:32:33,186 --> 01:32:34,385
This dress is not made
for a big boy.

2045
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:36,387
It's going right up
the back alley there.

2046
01:32:36,389 --> 01:32:38,055
Let me just make
a little adjustment.

2047
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:40,491
There we go.

2048
01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:42,093
<i>Internet users are breathing</i>

2049
01:32:42,095 --> 01:32:44,395
<i>a collective sigh
of relief tonight.</i>

2050
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:46,731
<i>Just as mysteriously
as it appeared,</i>

2051
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:49,135
<i>the Wreck-It Ralph virus
has vanished.</i>

2052
01:32:55,408 --> 01:32:57,508
You know what
I just realized?

2053
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:00,244
The sun never rises
or sets here...

2054
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:02,213
because everything's
always on.

2055
01:33:02,215 --> 01:33:04,782
Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?

2056
01:33:04,784 --> 01:33:06,350
I know, right?

2057
01:33:06,352 --> 01:33:07,552
You know,
other than KnowsMore,

2058
01:33:07,554 --> 01:33:09,320
I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.

2059
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:11,355
Yeah. Yeah.

2060
01:33:11,357 --> 01:33:14,358
Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?

2061
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,760
Be right there!

2062
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:18,429
Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!

2063
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:21,032
Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.

2064
01:33:21,034 --> 01:33:23,436
Oh. That's a good dad joke.

2065
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:26,437
Hey, don't forget.

2066
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:28,372
You know Shank added
my code and everything,

2067
01:33:28,374 --> 01:33:30,208
so I'll be able
to regenerate.

2068
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:31,342
I'm gonna be totally safe.

2069
01:33:31,344 --> 01:33:33,779
No, I know.
It's gonna be great.

2070
01:33:33,781 --> 01:33:35,379
You found your dream game.

2071
01:33:35,381 --> 01:33:36,649
Yeah, I did.

2072
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:38,551
I did.

2073
01:33:39,419 --> 01:33:41,552
So, uh...

2074
01:33:41,554 --> 01:33:44,589
I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?

2075
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:47,560
Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.

2076
01:33:48,628 --> 01:33:51,462
Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.

2077
01:33:51,464 --> 01:33:53,498
No, no. It's okay.

2078
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,535
Now we can both
have a half. See?

2079
01:33:57,605 --> 01:33:58,404
Yeah!

2080
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:08,114
I love you so much.

2081
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:10,618
I'm really gonna miss you.

2082
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:14,420
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

2083
01:34:15,623 --> 01:34:17,156
I really am.

2084
01:34:22,763 --> 01:34:23,764
All right.

2085
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,601
Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.

2086
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,538
Go on. Get out of here.

2087
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,807
The world's
waiting for you, kid.

2088
01:35:31,432 --> 01:35:33,498
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

2089
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,801
<i>it still feels kind of
weird around here.</i>

2090
01:35:35,803 --> 01:35:37,836
<i>I mean, a lot has changed.</i>

2091
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:39,304
<i>Even though we got
that steering wheel</i>

2092
01:35:39,306 --> 01:35:40,372
<i>and saved</i> Sugar Rush...

2093
01:35:40,374 --> 01:35:42,543
<i>it's never really gonna
be the same.</i>

2094
01:35:44,545 --> 01:35:45,744
<i>For one thing,
the racers aren't even</i>

2095
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,346
<i>that obnoxious anymore.</i>

2096
01:35:47,348 --> 01:35:49,748
Oh, golly. I'm sorry
you didn't win, Taffyta.

2097
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,384
Pfft! Our friendship
is much more important to me

2098
01:35:52,386 --> 01:35:53,685
than winning, Rancis.

2099
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:55,420
Losing builds character!

2100
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:57,356
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

2101
01:35:57,358 --> 01:35:58,890
<i>Felix and Calhoun,</i>

2102
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,092
<i>as goofy as they are,</i>

2103
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:02,527
<i>they turned out to be
pretty great parents.</i>

2104
01:36:02,529 --> 01:36:03,829
I gotta hand it
to you two,

2105
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:06,331
how on earth did you
tame those things?

2106
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:07,699
It's simple, Surge.

2107
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:10,302
The key to parenting is...

2108
01:36:13,273 --> 01:36:15,240
And then what you do is...

2109
01:36:17,711 --> 01:36:20,946
And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.

2110
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:24,383
Wow, I wish every parent
could hear that.

2111
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:25,751
<i>I'm keeping busy, too.</i>

2112
01:36:25,753 --> 01:36:27,686
<i>I finally joined
Zangief's book club.</i>

2113
01:36:27,688 --> 01:36:29,755
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?

2114
01:36:29,757 --> 01:36:31,690
Do you feel Dostoyevsky

2115
01:36:31,692 --> 01:36:34,292
intended to make
narrator unreliable?

2116
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:35,761
Um...

2117
01:36:35,763 --> 01:36:37,964
I do and I don't.

2118
01:36:37,966 --> 01:36:40,532
You do, and you don't.

2119
01:36:40,534 --> 01:36:43,301
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.

2120
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:44,603
Thanks, Sonic.

2121
01:36:44,605 --> 01:36:47,339
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

2122
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:49,675
<i>Oh. And we got this new thing
we do every Friday night...</i>

2123
01:36:49,677 --> 01:36:51,777
<i>where we all go and hang out
in a different game.</i>

2124
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:53,445
<i>I actually hosted this week.</i>

2125
01:36:53,447 --> 01:36:54,846
Heyo!

2126
01:36:54,848 --> 01:36:57,449
Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.

2127
01:36:57,451 --> 01:36:59,317
What's burnt pie,
Wreck-It?

2128
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:01,620
Oh, it's just a pie
that you burn.

2129
01:37:01,622 --> 01:37:02,554
You can use any pie.

2130
01:37:02,556 --> 01:37:04,322
You just leave it
in the oven too long.

2131
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:10,629
<i>Yeah, we really do
have a lot of fun.</i>

2132
01:37:10,631 --> 01:37:13,966
I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.

2133
01:37:13,968 --> 01:37:16,702
<i>Oh, man, your stories
never disappoint, Ralph.</i>

2134
01:37:16,704 --> 01:37:18,303
<i>I just wish
we could hang out sooner.</i>

2135
01:37:18,305 --> 01:37:19,806
Yeah. Me, too.

2136
01:37:19,808 --> 01:37:21,506
When did you say you were
getting those days off?

2137
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:24,309
<i>Uh, our upgrade
starts on January 25th,</i>

2138
01:37:24,311 --> 01:37:26,012
<i>so, like, two months
from now.</i>

2139
01:37:26,014 --> 01:37:28,680
Oh, that'll go by in a flash.
Oh, speaking of which...

2140
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:29,782
you want me to bring you
anything from home

2141
01:37:29,784 --> 01:37:30,783
when I come visit?

2142
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:32,852
<i>Oh! You know what
I cannot find</i>

2143
01:37:32,854 --> 01:37:34,619
<i>anywhere on the Internet?</i>

2144
01:37:34,621 --> 01:37:37,556
<i>A halfway decent</i>
BurgerTime <i>burger.</i>

2145
01:37:37,558 --> 01:37:39,859
<i>I've been talking them up
to Shank and the crew.</i>

2146
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:41,593
<i>And honestly, I think
they're starting to think</i>

2147
01:37:41,595 --> 01:37:42,762
<i>I'm making it up.</i>

2148
01:37:42,764 --> 01:37:44,030
All right,
consider it done.

2149
01:37:44,032 --> 01:37:45,700
I'll bring you guys
a truckload.

2150
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:50,368
Well, sun's coming up already.

2151
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,838
Guess I better get to it.

2152
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,338
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

2153
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,506
<i>Talk next week?</i>

2154
01:37:54,508 --> 01:37:56,374
I shall await your call,
madam.

2155
01:37:56,376 --> 01:38:00,980
<i>Then,</i> adieu, adieu,
<i>farting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

2156
01:38:00,982 --> 01:38:03,283
<i>So long, stinkbrain.</i>

2157
01:38:03,852 --> 01:38:04,753
Bye, kid.

2158
01:38:18,666 --> 01:38:21,667
Hey. You doing
okay there, Ralph?

2159
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:25,905
Yeah, I am, actually.
I'm doing great.

2160
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:28,643
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.

2161
01:42:00,055 --> 01:42:03,123
Hey, Mo, did you like
the movie, sweetie?

2162
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:05,726
Well, there was a scene
in the trailer...

2163
01:42:05,728 --> 01:42:07,761
that wasn't in the movie...

2164
01:42:07,763 --> 01:42:10,197
and that makes me sad.

2165
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:12,299
Aw, that's too bad.

2166
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:13,900
Maybe playing your game
will cheer you up.

2167
01:42:13,902 --> 01:42:14,903
Okay.

2168
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:19,072
Pancake.

2169
01:42:19,074 --> 01:42:20,175
Milkshake.

2170
01:42:21,243 --> 01:42:23,779
Pancake.
Pancake.

2171
01:42:24,313 --> 01:42:25,544
Milkshake.

2172
01:42:25,546 --> 01:42:27,114
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I wanna try, I wanna try!</i>

2173
01:42:27,116 --> 01:42:28,582
<i>My turn, my turn!</i>

2174
01:42:28,584 --> 01:42:30,617
<i>Pancake. Milkshake.</i>

2175
01:42:30,619 --> 01:42:32,986
<i>Milkshake. Milkshake.</i>

2176
01:42:32,988 --> 01:42:34,821
Pancake. Pancake.

2177
01:42:34,823 --> 01:42:37,157
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

2178
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:38,892
I'm starting to understand
why people like this game.

2179
01:42:38,894 --> 01:42:40,293
Very zen.

2180
01:42:42,231 --> 01:42:44,931
Hey, everybody,
look what I found!

2181
01:42:44,933 --> 01:42:47,067
- More pancakes!
- Sweet!

2182
01:42:47,069 --> 01:42:49,302
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2183
01:42:49,304 --> 01:42:50,771
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2184
01:42:50,773 --> 01:42:52,806
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2185
01:42:52,808 --> 01:42:54,941
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2186
01:42:54,943 --> 01:42:57,210
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!

2187
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:58,845
Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try
feeding the kitty

2188
01:42:58,847 --> 01:43:00,347
for a little while.

2189
01:43:00,349 --> 01:43:03,083
No, the kitty gets
the milkshake.

2190
01:43:03,085 --> 01:43:06,922
The bunny gets the pancake.
