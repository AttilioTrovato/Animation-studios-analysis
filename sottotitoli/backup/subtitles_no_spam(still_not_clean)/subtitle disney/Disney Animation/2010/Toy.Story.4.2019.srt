1
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:53,459
Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!

2
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,261
I hope they make it
back all right.

3
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,364
Heads up! Andy's coming!

4
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:01,167
Andy, time for dinner.

5
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,501
Yes! I'm starving!

6
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:03,936
Don't forget
to wash your hands!

7
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,171
Okay, Mom!

8
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,877
- Do you see him?
- No.

9
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:12,043
Well, he's done for.

10
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,246
He'll be lost! Forever!

11
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,147
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

12
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:17,569
The rest of you,
stay put.

13
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,571
Bo!

14
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,473
Situation?

15
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:41,941
Lost toy.
Side yard.

16
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,577
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.

17
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,546
They have names?
You never told me that.

18
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,481
You never asked.

19
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,049
Where is he?

20
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,219
There!

21
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,320
How do we reach him?

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,688
Operation Pull-Toy!

23
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:57,555
Slink!
You got it, Woody!

24
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,565
Barbies!

25
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:07,036
Go!

26
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,075
Flashlight.

27
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,594
Hang on, R.C.!

28
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,470
I ain't got any more slink!

29
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:21,708
Oh, it's beautiful.

30
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,243
I'm so glad to see

31
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:25,477
this old lamp
go to a good home.

32
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,412
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.

33
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:30,149
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

34
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,417
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.

35
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,757
Thank you.

36
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:40,995
Where's Woody?

37
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,337
Yeah, hi. I think
I left my keys here.

38
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:54,173
Woody.
Quick!

39
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,107
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

40
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:56,743
Woody, it's okay.

41
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:00,212
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

42
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:01,513
What's best for Andy
is that...

43
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:01,748
Woody.

44
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:04,217
I'm not Andy's toy.

45
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:06,619
What?

46
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,620
It's time for
the next kid.

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,389
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.

48
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:10,892
I really appreciate it.

49
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:14,659
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

50
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,632
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.

51
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,801
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...

52
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,142
or put in the wrong box.

53
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:34,253
And that box
gets taken away.

54
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:43,488
Mom, where's Woody?

55
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,257
Andy! Come inside!

56
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,512
I can't find Woody!

57
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:07,747
Well, good night.

58
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:10,084
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

59
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,637
Oh, there you are.

60
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:34,606
Mom, I found him!
I found him!

61
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:37,120
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.

62
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,599
<i>? You've got a friend in me</i>

63
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,736
<i> Reach for the sky!</i>

64
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,906
<i>? You've got a friend in me</i>

65
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,808
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!

66
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:11,644
<i> ? When the road looks</i>
rough ahead

67
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,479
<i>There's a snake in my boot.</i>

68
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,447
<i> ? And you're miles and miles</i>
From your nice warm bed

69
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:19,685
<i> ? You just remember</i>
what your old pal said

70
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,887
<i> ? Boy, you've got</i>
a friend in me

71
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,822
To infinity and beyond!

72
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:27,392
<i> ? Yeah, you've got</i>
a friend in me

73
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,529
My cowboy!

74
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,231
<i> ? Now, some other folks</i>
might be a little bit
smarter than I am

75
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,433
<i> ? Big and stronger, too</i>

76
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,267
Woody, let's go!

77
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,870
<i> ? Maybe</i>

78
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,505
<i> ? But none of them will ever</i>
love you the way I do

79
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:42,640
<i>You're my favorite deputy!</i>

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,510
<i> ? It's me and you, boy</i>

81
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,747
<i> ? And as the years go by</i>

82
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,349
<i> ? Our friendship</i>
will never die

83
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,351
Reach for the sky!

84
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:54,920
<i> ? You're gonna see</i>
it's our destiny

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,289
They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!

86
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,394
<i>? You've got a friend in me</i>

87
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:05,498
Full speed ahead! Yay!<i>
? You've got a friend in me</i>

88
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,512
<i> ? You've got a friend in me ?</i>

89
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,647
It's getting hot in here!

90
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,682
Where's my ear?

91
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:24,882
You're on my foot!

92
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:26,685
Oh, hey,
quit shoving.

93
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,286
- Sorry!
- Could you move over

94
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,288
- a bit, please?
- That was my horn.

95
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,856
<i>To infinity and beyond!</i>

96
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,024
I know that was you,
Potato Head.

97
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:34,728
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...

98
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,262
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...

99
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:37,731
expect to be put
in the closet.

100
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,666
How much longer?

101
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,967
Keep it to
a dull roar, Rex.

102
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,836
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.

103
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:45,471
Settle down, Slink.

104
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,671
Sit. Good boy!

105
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,041
Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?

106
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,743
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.

107
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,310
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.

108
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,414
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,483
How are you, uh,
feeling about today?

110
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,952
Uh, good, good.
Yeah, good.

111
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm good.

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,856
Uh... Good.

113
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:06,793
We're on! Bonnie's done
with breakfast!

114
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,461
Any minute now.
You hear that?

115
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,596
Any minute now.

116
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:11,930
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

117
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,731
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...

118
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,034
Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it.

119
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,435
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right,
you're right.

120
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,039
The town is open!

121
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,308
Hi, Mayor!

122
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,575
Banker!

123
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,310
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

124
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,478
Mailman!

125
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,647
And the sheriff!

126
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,748
Okay. Bye, toys!

127
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,718
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

128
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,552
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

129
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,893
They went that way!

130
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,027
Chase them!

131
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,767
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

132
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,569
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."

133
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:50,737
When's the last time

134
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:52,938
we ever got to play that?

135
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,506
Remember when
she played "house"?

136
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:55,674
I liked "house."

137
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:56,809
Those were the days.

138
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,477
It was basic.
You made a house,

139
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,645
you lived in it, done.

140
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,012
Hmm. That's
the third time

141
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,580
you haven't been
picked this week.

142
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,083
I don't know.
I don't keep count.

143
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,783
Oh, you don't have to.

144
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,920
I'll do it for you.
Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

145
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,054
It's been a while.

146
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:09,854
Oh, looky there.

147
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:11,924
You got your
first dust bunny.

148
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:12,758
Aw, how adorable.

149
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,060
What you gonna name it?

150
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,161
Uh, what about Dusty?

151
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:18,530
- Francis!
- Harry!

152
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,765
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!

153
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,132
LeBron?
No, Fluffy.

154
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:22,834
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!

155
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,036
"Tumbleweed." Oh,
that's good. That's good.

156
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:24,771
He's a cowboy,

157
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,571
so that makes a lot of sense.

158
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,506
So many choices.

159
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,440
I just can't decide!

160
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,641
Bonnie?

161
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:29,709
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

162
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,844
You don't wanna be late

163
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,112
for kindergarten
orientation, do you?

164
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,147
But I don't wanna go.

165
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:36,815
We talked about this.

166
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,416
We're gonna meet
your teachers,

167
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,051
see your classroom...
Can I bring a toy?

168
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,988
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

169
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:48,594
Freeze! Nobody move!

170
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:49,828
Bonnie always
forgets something.

171
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,463
She'll be back any second.

172
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,698
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

173
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:54,599
But it's money!

174
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:54,733
You all right, Woody?

175
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,969
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.

176
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,070
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

177
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,171
Hey, Woody. Here.

178
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,540
Oh, thanks, Jessie.

179
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,776
We're here for you,
buddy.

180
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:04,977
I don't want to play
the baker.

181
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,146
Pricklepants.

182
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:07,813
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!

183
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:09,114
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

184
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:10,916
Excuse me, Dolly?

185
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,517
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

186
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:13,386
Go back to the closet.

187
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm worried
about Bonnie.

188
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,690
A toy should go with her
to orientation.

189
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,525
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

190
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,294
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

191
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:22,895
It can be too much
for a kid.

192
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:24,097
Having a buddy with them
to get through it

193
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:26,565
can really help things.

194
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,600
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,

195
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:30,737
but Bonnie's not Andy.

196
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:32,171
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.

197
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,105
But if you would just...

198
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:36,007
Places, everyone!

199
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,022
Bonnie?

200
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,858
What are you doing
back there?

201
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,994
Come on, we have to go.

202
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,863
That's my big girl.

203
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:02,033
Come on.
We gotta hurry, okay?

204
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,136
Don't forget your backpack.

205
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,440
You're gonna
have so much fun.

206
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,576
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

207
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:14,453
Woody?

208
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,156
Here we are.

209
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,906
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.

210
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,209
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

211
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,176
My name is Miss Wendy.

212
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,046
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.

213
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:52,551
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.

214
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,128
You want to see?

215
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,007
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.

216
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,743
Okay, class,
let's all find
a seat at a table...

217
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,979
so we can
start craft time.

218
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,214
On the first day of school,

219
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,550
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.

220
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,853
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.

221
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,222
Now, everyone take a cup...

222
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:34,126
and we'll use
the art supplies
to decorate them.

223
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,061
Hi.

224
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,651
Bonnie.
That is so clever.

225
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,920
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"

226
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,855
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

227
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:11,926
I'm Miss Wendy.

228
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:17,295
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

229
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:18,430
His name is Forky!

230
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,031
Wow!
That is so cool!

231
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,099
I finished kindergarten!

232
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:23,402
Uh...

233
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,936
No.
That was just orientation.

234
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,439
But for being
such a brave girl,

235
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,839
we have a surprise
for you.

236
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,041
What is it?

237
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,108
Since school doesn't start

238
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,411
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!

239
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,781
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!

240
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:36,850
Yay!

241
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,390
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.

242
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,292
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?

243
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,229
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.

244
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,440
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

245
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,876
Ow.

246
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,480
He did go
to kindergarten!

247
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,083
I knew it.
No, no, no, guys, listen...

248
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:11,916
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?

249
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,118
No, of course not!

250
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:14,252
You could have been
confiscated.

251
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,987
What does that mean?
Taken away.

252
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,155
No!
Or worse.

253
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,256
You could've been lost!

254
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:19,491
No, no, no, guys, listen.

255
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,193
Bonnie had a great day
in class...

256
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:21,794
and we're going
on a road trip.

257
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,262
Road trip?
Vacation!

258
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,230
Yee-haw!

259
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,799
But then something
really weird happened.

260
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,967
Bonnie made
a friend in class.

261
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,068
What a kid.

262
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,368
Oh, she's already
making friends.

263
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:34,473
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.

264
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,208
Hey, it's okay.

265
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,276
Come on out.
That's it.

266
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,479
Come on, there you go.

267
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,815
Come on, let's get
you out of there.

268
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,118
You got this.

269
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:48,119
Good. Good.

270
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:51,223
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.

271
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:53,057
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!

272
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,326
Look how long
his arms are!

273
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:57,329
Trash?
No.

274
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,196
No, toys.

275
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:01,366
They're all toys.

276
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:03,770
Trash?
No, no, no.

277
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,872
That's the trash.

278
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,073
These are your friends.

279
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:09,874
Hi!

280
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,276
Trash!

281
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:12,477
No, no, it's okay.
Trash!

282
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:14,246
Woody,
I have a question.

283
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:15,847
Um, well, actually,
not just one,

284
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:16,982
I have all of them.

285
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,382
I have all the questions.

286
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:20,051
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?

287
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:21,386
Because he was made
from trash.

288
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,286
Trash!

289
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,656
Look, I know
this is a little strange,

290
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:25,489
but you gotta trust me
on this.

291
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:25,792
Trash?

292
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,094
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.

293
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,363
Important?

294
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:32,196
He's a spork.

295
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:33,831
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...

296
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,434
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

297
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:38,936
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.

298
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:40,070
Woody, aren't you being

299
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,172
a little dramatic
about all this?

300
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,907
I know this is new
to everybody...

301
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,075
but you should see how much

302
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,477
this little guy
means to Bonnie.

303
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:48,280
When she started
playing with him...

304
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,415
she had the biggest smile
on her face.

305
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:51,983
I wish you could have seen it.

306
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:53,185
Bonnie was really upset...

307
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:54,920
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

308
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,454
it was
a complete transformation.

309
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:58,590
Uh, Woody?
Just a second, Jessie.

310
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,561
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

311
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:04,461
Something happened to him.

312
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,498
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!

313
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:08,834
Ah, trash.

314
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,201
- No, no, no!
- No! No!

315
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,102
- You're a toy now, Forky!
- Come on!

316
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,504
Stop! Stop it!

317
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,104
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!

318
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:15,340
Trash! Trash!

319
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,308
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him

320
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:18,910
till he's used
to the room.

321
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,949
Hmm.

322
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,251
Forky?

323
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,586
Where are you, Forky?

324
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,988
There you are!

325
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,158
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

326
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:49,240
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

327
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,043
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

328
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,944
She loves you
and you need to...

329
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,428
Ooh.

330
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:13,198
Forky?

331
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,501
Bonnie!

332
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,636
Let's go!

333
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,604
Rise and shine!

334
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:22,440
Who wants to go
on a road trip?

335
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,242
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...

336
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,245
and Forky, and...

337
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,979
Forky? Where are you?

338
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,582
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

339
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:31,616
Forky?

340
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:34,318
Forky!

341
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,554
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!

342
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,623
Let's go, Forky!

343
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,328
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.

344
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:46,163
You need help with him
on the road trip?

345
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:49,167
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.

346
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,135
We'll just be stuck
in an RV.

347
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:53,104
He can't get far.
I got this.

348
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:54,171
I got it.

349
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,011
<i>? I can't let you</i>

350
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:03,014
<i> ? I can't let you</i>

351
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:07,352
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away

352
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,720
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

353
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,056
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

354
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,427
<i>? I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away

355
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:20,065
<i> ? Don't you want to see</i>
the sun come up each morning?

356
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,632
No, no!

357
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,003
<i> ? Don't you want to see</i>
the sun go down each day?

358
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:30,141
<i> ? Don't you want to see that</i>
little girl that loves you so?

359
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:31,575
<i> ? Her heart would break</i>

360
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:33,077
Oh, yeah!

361
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:35,080
<i> ? If you should go</i>

362
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,248
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

363
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:39,616
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

364
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:41,085
?<i> I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away

365
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,520
No, no, no!

366
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,489
No! No! No!

367
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:48,426
<i> ? So it seems to me like</i>
you're never gonna
behave yourself

368
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:51,530
<i> ? Since I'm not gonna</i>
do this every day

369
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,568
<i> ? Come tomorrow, you're gonna</i>
have to save yourself

370
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,005
<i> ? Got nothing more to say</i>

371
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,373
<i> ? You're not listening anyway</i>

372
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,476
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

373
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,678
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

374
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:08,446
Trash, here I come!

375
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:09,314
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away

376
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,449
Come on.

377
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:14,184
<i> ? I can't let you</i>

378
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:14,786
<i> ? I can't let you</i>

379
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,322
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away

380
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:20,424
I don't wanna be a toy!

381
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,660
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

382
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,796
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
<i>
? I can't let you</i>

383
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:29,074
<i> ? I can't let you</i>
throw yourself away ?

384
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:54,258
Hey, buddy.

385
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:56,094
Hey, Buzz.

386
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:57,327
You doing okay?

387
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:59,163
I don't know, Buzz.

388
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:01,699
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

389
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,669
but I don't remember it
being this hard.

390
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:07,572
Want me to take
the next watch?

391
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,173
I'll keep an eye
on Forky.

392
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,142
No, no.
I need to do this.

393
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,544
That little voice
inside me

394
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:14,813
would never
leave me alone
if I gave up.

395
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,081
Huh.

396
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,682
Who do you think it is?

397
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:19,719
Who?

398
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,219
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

399
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,655
Uh...

400
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:24,789
Me.

401
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,492
You know,
my conscience?

402
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:32,330
That part of you
that tells you things?

403
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:32,832
What you're
really thinking?

404
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,366
Fascinating.

405
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,304
So, your inner voice
advises you.

406
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:39,838
What?

407
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:44,342
<i> It's a secret</i>
mission in uncharted space.

408
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:45,077
<i> Let's go.</i>

409
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:49,715
Where's Forky?

410
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:52,817
Oh, no!
Forky!

411
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,353
Forky!

412
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:55,720
I am not a toy!

413
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,889
I'm a spork.

414
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,223
Be quiet!

415
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:00,491
I was made
for soup, salad...

416
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,759
maybe chili,
and then the trash.

417
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,229
I'm litter!

418
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,330
Freedom!

419
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,801
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?

420
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,503
5.32 miles, give or take.

421
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:12,636
I can make that.

422
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:14,271
I'll meet you
at the RV park.

423
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:16,644
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

424
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,128
Forky!

425
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,697
Forky, where are you?

426
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:41,266
Forky!

427
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:42,566
Forky, where are you?

428
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,287
Carry me?
No.

429
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:04,956
Why do I have
to be a toy?

430
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:06,423
Because you have
Bonnie's name

431
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:07,691
written on the bottom
of your sticks.

432
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:08,927
Why do I have
Bonnie's name

433
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,628
written on the bottom
of my sticks?

434
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,564
Because she...

435
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:17,402
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?

436
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:17,702
Ugh. Yes.

437
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:19,705
And who does she sleep
with every night?

438
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,340
The big white
fluffy thing?

439
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,807
No, not her pillow.

440
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:24,842
You.

441
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,878
All right, Forky.

442
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:30,681
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

443
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,249
You're Bonnie's toy.

444
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,485
You are going to help
create happy memories...

445
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:35,787
that will last
for the rest of her life.

446
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:38,957
Huh? What?

447
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,228
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.

448
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,496
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

449
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:47,700
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.

450
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,434
Maybe you don't like
being one,

451
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:51,635
but you are one
nonetheless.

452
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:52,836
Which means
you are going

453
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:54,338
to be there for Andy
when he...

454
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:55,472
Who's Andy?

455
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,642
I mean, Bonnie.

456
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,443
You have to be there
for Bonnie.

457
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:01,312
That is your job.

458
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:02,846
Well, what's your job?

459
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,982
Well, right now,
it's to make sure
you do yours.

460
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:05,756
Carry me?
No!

461
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,625
Who's Andy?

462
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,263
Andy was my other kid.

463
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:20,265
You had another kid?

464
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:21,365
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,367
For a long time.

466
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,837
And it was pretty great.

467
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:29,373
I was a favorite toy,
actually.

468
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:32,576
Running the room
was my job.

469
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,978
Keeping all the toys
in place...

470
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:36,847
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?

471
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:38,882
Wow,
that is messed up.

472
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,419
Right!

473
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:42,153
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

474
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,587
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

475
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:46,391
Thank you!
Seriously, that is the...

476
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:48,293
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up

477
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,894
and become a full person.

478
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,631
And then they leave.

479
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,934
They go off and do things
you'll never see.

480
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:00,904
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

481
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:01,739
But then somehow
you find yourself,

482
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:03,975
after all those years...

483
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:07,045
sitting in a closet
just feeling...

484
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:08,046
Useless?

485
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:11,449
Yeah.

486
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:13,884
Your purpose fulfilled?

487
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,620
Exactly.

488
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,388
Woody, I know
what your problem is.

489
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:18,456
You do?

490
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,024
You're just like me.

491
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,025
Trash!

492
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:22,826
What is it with
you and trash?

493
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:24,562
It's warm.
Ew.

494
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:25,997
It's cozy.
I guess.

495
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:27,332
And safe!

496
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:27,732
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,

497
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,934
"Everything's gonna
be okay."

498
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:31,769
Forky, that's it.

499
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,672
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

500
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:37,610
She does?
Yes!

501
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,879
Wait a sec.

502
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,948
You mean
she thinks I'm warm?
Yep.

503
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,450
And cozy?
Uh-huh.

504
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:45,750
And sometimes
kinda squishy?

505
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,385
Well, that, too. Yes.

506
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,821
I get it now.

507
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,122
I'm Bonnie's trash.

508
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:52,457
Yes! Wait, what?

509
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:53,658
I am Bonnie's trash!

510
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:54,926
No, no, no, not exactly.

511
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:56,594
She must be feeling
awful without me.

512
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:57,961
Woody, we got
to get going,
she needs me!

513
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,564
Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

514
00:25:59,564 --> 00:25:59,765
Forky, slow down! Forky!

515
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,432
Bonnie, I'm coming!

516
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,690
Forky!

517
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,160
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

518
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,728
Hurry!

519
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:36,547
Whoo!

520
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,421
Huh? Woody?

521
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,532
Bo?

522
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:10,537
Woody?

523
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:16,473
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

524
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:19,075
I know, I know.
But my friend
might be in there.

525
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,444
Friend?

526
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,046
Oh, a friend, uh...

527
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:23,648
Well, a friend is...

528
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,016
Well, a friend is
like you and me.

529
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:27,117
Trash?
Trash, like... Yes.

530
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:28,885
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

531
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:31,087
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.

532
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:33,690
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

533
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:43,768
Bo?

534
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,438
Bo?

535
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:48,639
Bo?

536
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,441
Bo?

537
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:53,076
Bo?
Bo?

538
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,212
Bo?

539
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:56,546
Bo.

540
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:58,149
Bo, Bo, Bo...

541
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:01,919
Bo?
Bo?

542
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,225
Can we go back
to Bonnie now?

543
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,558
I don't see your friend.

544
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:10,126
Yeah, okay.

545
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:11,661
She's not in here.

546
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:12,830
Come on, let's go.

547
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:25,478
Is that Bo?

548
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,583
Uh...
Hey, howdy.

549
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:32,750
Hey there.

550
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,119
Uh, sorry to
bother you, but...

551
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,955
Why,
you're not a bother at all.

552
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:40,290
We were just out for
my early morning stroll.

553
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,691
And look...

554
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:43,693
we met you!

555
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:44,862
My name is Gabby Gabby.

556
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:47,265
And this is my
very good friend Benson.

557
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:49,566
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.

558
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:52,669
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?

559
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:53,837
This is Forky.

560
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:54,971
I'm trash.

561
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,973
Our kid made him.

562
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:59,242
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.

563
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:00,577
Are you two lost?

564
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:02,246
Lost?
No, no.

565
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:05,181
But we are looking
for a lost toy.

566
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:08,152
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?

567
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:09,253
Name's Bo Peep?

568
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:09,720
Bo Peep?

569
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,789
Oh, yes, I know Bo.
You do?

570
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,025
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.

571
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,892
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

572
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,228
Well, okay.

573
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:22,633
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

574
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:25,001
Wow, what service.

575
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:33,009
Uh...
Thank you for your help.

576
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,144
I haven't seen Bo
in years.

577
00:29:34,144 --> 00:29:36,212
May I ask,
when were you made?

578
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:36,748
Me? Uh...

579
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:39,650
I'm not sure.
Late '50s?

580
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,084
Me, too!

581
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:42,819
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

582
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,354
Wouldn't that be something?

583
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:45,757
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

584
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:50,294
Well, I try
to stay active.

585
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:50,761
And look at that,

586
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:52,830
you have
a voice box like me.

587
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,864
Benson, show him.

588
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:57,337
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

589
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:01,773
<i> I'm Gabby Gabby</i>

590
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,941
<i>and I love you.</i>

591
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:06,777
Wow, you need
to fix that.

592
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,880
My record works just fine.

593
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,848
It's the voice box
that's broken.

594
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:13,049
Does yours still work?

595
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,017
Hey!

596
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:14,753
<i>There's a snake in my boot!</i>

597
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:17,888
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

598
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:18,889
I bet it's the same type.

599
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:21,325
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.

600
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:23,361
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

601
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:25,764
Oh.

602
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:28,231
The store is about to open.

603
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:30,334
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.

604
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,135
Oh, no. We can't stay.

605
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:33,903
Yes, you can.

606
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,217
We gotta go.

607
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:49,687
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

608
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:53,423
Right inside there.

609
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:54,924
Returned that lamp
the next day.

610
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:56,227
You're kidding me!

611
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:57,894
Mom, can we go
to the park now?

612
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:58,997
Harmony!

613
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,366
Stop him, please.

614
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:14,979
What's going on?

615
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:18,114
Come on! Let's go!

616
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:20,017
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

617
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:22,353
Forky? We got
to get out of...

618
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,157
Woody!

619
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,997
<i> I'd like</i>
to join your posse, boys.

620
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,037
<i> But first, I'm gonna sing</i>
a little song.

621
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:43,039
Grandma, look what I found.

622
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,042
Can I take it to the park?
Sure.

623
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,944
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.

624
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:51,148
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys
the toys anyway.

625
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,017
Thanks, Grandma!

626
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:56,888
<i> Yee-haw!</i>

627
00:31:57,888 --> 00:31:59,422
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?

628
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,158
We're going
to the park.

629
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:01,827
Maybe later, sweetie.

630
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:10,867
Any sign of Woody?

631
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:11,835
I don't see him!
Shh!

632
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,039
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.

633
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,440
The spoon is safer.

634
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,776
Mmm.

635
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:23,847
Forky?

636
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,283
Where's Forky?

637
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,383
Mom! Dad!

638
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:29,053
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?

639
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,453
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!

640
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,189
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.

641
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,091
I'm sure
he's here somewhere.

642
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,459
You know,
if you don't find him,

643
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,392
you can make a new one.

644
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:38,895
No! There's only
one Forky!

645
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:40,064
Uh...

646
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:41,332
Let's go look outside.

647
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:43,467
Maybe he fell on
the ground somewhere.

648
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:44,934
Oh, poor Bonnie.

649
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:46,303
We're gonna
find him, okay?

650
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:48,439
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.

651
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,774
Woody was right.

652
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:51,941
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

653
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,110
Why isn't Woody back yet?

654
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,511
Do you think
he's lost?

655
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,180
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

656
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,914
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

657
00:32:57,914 --> 00:32:59,350
What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
I, uh...

658
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,084
Buzz.
What would Woody do?

659
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:02,886
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.

660
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:04,421
What would Woody do?

661
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:06,891
<i>It's a secret mission</i>

662
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,825
<i> in uncharted space. Let's go!</i>

663
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,228
I think I have to go.

664
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:12,462
Where?
Where you goin'? Why?

665
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:13,831
Should we all go?

666
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:15,466
- Are we going?
- And then what?

667
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,534
<i>No time to explain!</i>
Attack!

668
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:17,968
No time to explain!

669
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:19,436
- Oh, no!
- Buzz!

670
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,905
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

671
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:31,915
Woody and Forky
were last seen
on the highway.

672
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:33,584
But where is the highway?

673
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,952
<i> The slingshot</i>
maneuver is all we've got!

674
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:38,087
<i> Full speed ahead!</i>

675
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:41,128
Thanks, inner voice!

676
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,402
Hi-ya!

677
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:53,104
The highway.

678
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:54,910
On my way, Woody!

679
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,593
Rad.

680
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,161
Hey! Step right up!

681
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:19,363
Put your money down!

682
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,431
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!

683
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,565
Hey! Hey!

684
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:29,640
Harmony, honey.
Sunscreen.

685
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,940
Okay.

686
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,513
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

687
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:44,053
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...

688
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:45,591
Oh, that way!

689
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:05,542
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

690
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,944
Whoa, whoa.
We got a busload of campers!

691
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:10,180
Here they come!

692
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,082
- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!

693
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:27,064
Oh, baby!
It's a good day
to play, huh?

694
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,531
Am I right?

695
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,038
Huh?

696
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,614
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

697
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:46,326
"Do you like riding horses?"

698
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:58,328
Wanna play
on the swings?

699
00:35:58,328 --> 00:35:59,529
Wait for me!

700
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,165
Bo?

701
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:03,306
Come on.

702
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,377
Bo!

703
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:15,178
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!

704
00:36:15,178 --> 00:36:16,480
Bo Peep!

705
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,281
I never thought
I'd see you again!

706
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,421
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?

707
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:25,689
None.
No one.

708
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:26,757
Wait, you're a lost toy?
You're a lost toy?

709
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:29,526
That's awful.
That's great.

710
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:32,029
Huh?
I mean, awfully great...

711
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:34,998
that you are lost out here.

712
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:38,268
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!

713
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:40,172
Huh?

714
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,040
I told you
not to drive so fast.

715
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,709
You almost ran him over.

716
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,411
Oh, hey, guys!

717
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,013
Whoa! Hold on there!

718
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:52,015
Okay! I missed you, too.

719
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:55,018
If it isn't Bobby? Gus?

720
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,085
Uh...

721
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,286
Lefty?

722
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,422
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

723
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:00,323
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

724
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,292
Girls.
Girls! Of course!

725
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,129
All right, all right.

726
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:07,564
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

727
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:08,767
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

728
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:12,069
Hey! Nice find, girls.

729
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:13,236
Where did you get
all this stuff?

730
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:14,638
Here and there.

731
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:17,241
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...

732
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:17,709
so I try
to be prepared.

733
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,477
How long have you been
out on your own?

734
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:22,578
Seven fantastic years!

735
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,647
Seven?

736
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,149
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

737
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:27,417
Uh, no.

738
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,118
- Gigs.
- Yo!

739
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:31,087
Come on out.
There's someone
I want you to meet.

740
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,393
Be right down.

741
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,229
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

742
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:40,596
Whoa! Who's this?

743
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:42,399
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?

744
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:42,734
The cowboy?
Yep!

745
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:47,604
No way!

746
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:50,207
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.

747
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,609
Woody, this is
Giggle McDimples.

748
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,178
Oh, hi, Giggle.

749
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,080
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.

750
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,314
Howdy, Sheriff.

751
00:37:58,314 --> 00:37:59,649
Officer Giggle McDimples.

752
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:01,819
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.

753
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,152
Yeah, search and rescue.

754
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:03,721
Ants, caterpillars,

755
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,855
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

756
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:07,491
Carl! Where you headed?

757
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:09,359
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

758
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:09,761
at the playground
on Main Street.

759
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:12,629
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.

760
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:15,299
That could be
20 to 30 kids.
Nice!

761
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:18,634
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

762
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:20,104
You guys in?

763
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:22,538
You bet! Woody,
you are gonna
love this!

764
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,373
Uh, no,
I can't, sir.

765
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,243
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.

766
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:27,844
What?
You got a kid?

767
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,245
Yeah.

768
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:31,348
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

769
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,649
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.

770
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:35,486
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.

771
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:38,654
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

772
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:41,457
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?

773
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:42,692
It's not Andy, is it?

774
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,627
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

775
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:46,596
But he gave us to Bonnie.

776
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:48,598
You have a little girl?
No way!

777
00:38:48,598 --> 00:38:50,334
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

778
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:51,567
Her other toy is trapped

779
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:52,902
in this antique store,
and I have to...

780
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:54,837
Second Chance Antiques?

781
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,306
We know that store.

782
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:57,674
That's great.
That is great!

783
00:38:57,674 --> 00:38:59,442
If you know the store,
you could really

784
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:00,843
help me find him...
No way.

785
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,379
We wasted years there,

786
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:03,513
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

787
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:05,281
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

788
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:06,382
But I don't have a choice.

789
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:08,317
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

790
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:08,785
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

791
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:12,256
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

792
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,558
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

793
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:17,160
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

794
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,629
No, no...

795
00:39:18,629 --> 00:39:22,332
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

796
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,301
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.

797
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:26,602
Molly's not here.

798
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:28,672
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

799
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:30,674
That was a long time ago.

800
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:33,210
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

801
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,877
She was the cutest thing...

802
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,913
but so afraid
of the dark.

803
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,448
It was just a phase.

804
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:38,716
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

805
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:40,785
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

806
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:43,721
it broke every
toy's heart.

807
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,623
And then,
Bo came into the room.

808
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:51,594
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

809
00:39:51,594 --> 00:39:53,663
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.

810
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:55,698
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

811
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:56,933
And Molly would
fall asleep

812
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,435
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

813
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:00,772
Okay! Okay. I get it.

814
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:06,375
Bo, my kid really
needs this toy.

815
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,446
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

816
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:12,616
All right, all right.

817
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:14,451
Thank you! Oh!

818
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:15,685
Oh, thank you!
All right.

819
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:16,721
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

820
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:23,259
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

821
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:42,245
Ow!

822
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,582
Hey, hey!

823
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:47,917
- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!

824
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,620
Oh, that feels great!

825
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,455
Look at that!
Good as new.

826
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,957
Yeah. Thank you,
uh, Benson.

827
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:58,261
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?

828
00:40:58,261 --> 00:40:58,796
Like I said, soon.

829
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,397
He won't forget
about you.

830
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:02,498
How do you know?

831
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,335
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

832
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:06,469
Sticks.

833
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,672
That makes you
a very important toy.

834
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:09,774
That's exactly
what Woody says.

835
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:12,442
Hmm. Interesting.

836
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,576
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!

837
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:14,011
She's back.

838
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:17,281
Who is she?

839
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:19,448
Harmony.

840
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:20,549
Wait a second...

841
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:20,785
she took Woody.

842
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:23,453
Did she lose him?

843
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:26,491
No. My Harmony is perfect.

844
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:32,562
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.

845
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:34,531
Whoo-hoo!
What is tea time?

846
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:35,667
Oh, I'll show you.

847
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,843
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

848
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:49,647
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

849
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:52,683
Uh... A little higher.

850
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:54,417
Stick out
your pinky.

851
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,018
Nice!

852
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:56,721
Mmm! Delicious!

853
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:59,388
Harmony, sweetie,
I'm leaving.

854
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:00,656
Come give me a hug.

855
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,832
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

856
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:18,475
When my voice box is fixed...

857
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:22,424
I'll finally get my chance.

858
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:36,859
Now, about our friend Woody.

859
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,596
I wanna know
everything about him.

860
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:40,864
Oh, yeah, Woody.

861
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:41,799
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!

862
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:45,435
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not
his first kid?

863
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:47,471
He had this other kid, Andy.

864
00:42:47,471 --> 00:42:47,739
And you know what?

865
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,652
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.

866
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:04,988
Hey, up here,
Astro-boy.

867
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:05,756
If you think you can
just show up

868
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:07,759
and take our
top prize spot...

869
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:09,893
you're wrong!
Dead wrong!

870
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:10,761
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

871
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:13,930
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.

872
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,033
No, I need...

873
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:17,466
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

874
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:18,602
Join the club, pal.

875
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:18,770
Yeah, join the club!

876
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,036
Come on, help me
get outta here.

877
00:43:21,036 --> 00:43:22,973
I'll help you.
With my foot!

878
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:24,640
Get him.

879
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,176
Get him.

880
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:27,910
Bunny, what are you doing?
Hmm?

881
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,046
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

882
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,948
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.

883
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:33,917
What's not
to understand, hmm?

884
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,018
You gonna make me say it?

885
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:35,786
What?

886
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:37,988
With these tiny legs,

887
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:39,522
I cannot reach
without your help.

888
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:40,656
Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what

889
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:41,892
I've been talking about,
Bunny.

890
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,426
You need to work
on paying attention

891
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:44,194
and your listening skills.

892
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:45,594
Ha!

893
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:47,196
How you like that,
cheater? Huh?

894
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:48,732
Yeah!

895
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:53,002
Oh, to infinity
and my foot! Boom!

896
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:55,839
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

897
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,442
How do I get out of here?

898
00:43:58,442 --> 00:43:59,875
<i>This planet is toxic.</i>

899
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:00,745
<i> Closing helmet</i>
to conserve oxygen.

900
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:02,747
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

901
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,114
Ow!

902
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:06,216
Let go of me!

903
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,585
Get off of me!

904
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:09,819
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.

905
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:10,854
Yeah, that's it.

906
00:44:10,854 --> 00:44:12,455
Hey, where you going?

907
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:14,890
You better get
over here, spaceman!

908
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,660
Yeah, put us
back up there!

909
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,727
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

910
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:19,931
I'm trying!
Come on!

911
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:24,100
Antique store,
here we come!

912
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,968
Bo, why do you ride
around in a skunk?

913
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:28,171
Whoa! Skunk!

914
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:29,573
A skunk!

915
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:31,073
Oh, I get it. Smart.

916
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:33,479
Corndogs,
corndogs, corndogs!

917
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,683
Why are you
so bad at driving?

918
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:41,718
You got six eyes.

919
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:44,221
Thanks for the landing.

920
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:47,591
Uh...
Come on, follow me.

921
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:54,129
- I'm fine.
- His face!

922
00:44:54,129 --> 00:44:55,498
That's hilarious.
I'm fine. Don't worry.

923
00:44:55,498 --> 00:44:57,067
Happens all the time.

924
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:58,268
Tape!

925
00:44:58,268 --> 00:44:59,669
Not a bad hiding spot.

926
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:01,004
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

927
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:02,571
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.

928
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:04,140
This will be more fun.

929
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,009
Let's get you
to that store!

930
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:09,178
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy,
what's the deal?

931
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:10,881
There's no deal.
Uh-huh.

932
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:13,015
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

933
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:15,151
Giggle...
Trust me. I've been there.

934
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,654
You know about
me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

935
00:45:17,654 --> 00:45:18,955
Shh! Here he comes!

936
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:19,756
Oh, man...
What?

937
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:22,058
No, not you.

938
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:24,093
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

939
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,661
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.

940
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:27,029
Easiest way in is

941
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:28,131
- the roof.
- The roof!

942
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,071
Let's go antiquing.

943
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:36,638
Hold on!

944
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:38,540
Huh?

945
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,709
Whoa!

946
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:41,011
How did you end up here?

947
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:41,712
I thought you were given
to a new family.

948
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:43,913
Oh, you know
how it goes.

949
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:45,281
Their little girl grew up

950
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:47,917
and didn't need me anymore,
so...

951
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:49,652
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

952
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:51,654
Eh, who needs
a kid's room...

953
00:45:51,654 --> 00:45:55,825
when you can have
all of this?

954
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:09,672
Whatcha looking at,
Sheriff?

955
00:46:09,672 --> 00:46:11,107
What? Oh, uh...

956
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:13,977
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.

957
00:46:13,977 --> 00:46:15,812
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

958
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:17,346
I was looking
at the antique store.

959
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:19,683
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.

960
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:21,084
Countdown for what?
Four.

961
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:22,018
You want to get
to the store,
don't you?

962
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:23,252
Three. Two. One!

963
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:36,832
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.

964
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:38,167
Where is it?

965
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:40,837
<i>Meteor shower! Look out!</i>

966
00:46:40,837 --> 00:46:42,372
Woody?

967
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:44,239
Good work, inner voice.

968
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,710
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

969
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,212
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.

970
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:50,346
Jessie is loving it.

971
00:46:50,346 --> 00:46:50,747
Jessie's still with you?

972
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:52,783
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.

973
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,687
Well, I mean,
most of us.

974
00:46:57,687 --> 00:46:58,989
What about Rex?

975
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,957
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

976
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:02,859
the Potato Heads...
Buzz?

977
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,460
Yeah, Buzz, too.

978
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,997
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

979
00:47:06,997 --> 00:47:08,931
Bo Peep?
Buzz!

980
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:09,734
My old moving buddy!
Buzz?

981
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:11,901
It's so good to see you!

982
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:13,236
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

983
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:14,870
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

984
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:17,207
<i>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...</i>

985
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:17,774
<i> Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

986
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:20,109
Three years!
Three years!

987
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:21,310
That's how long
we've been

988
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,812
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!

989
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:24,047
Look, I'm sorry
about that.

990
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,681
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

991
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,384
Who are these guys?

992
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:29,252
Lightyear promised us a kid.
You did what?

993
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:30,953
I did not.

994
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:32,321
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!

995
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:32,790
All right now,
come on, stop it!

996
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,890
Cut it out now!

997
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:35,991
Come on, guys,
break it up.

998
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:37,127
Guys, I have a kid!

999
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,663
You got a kid?

1000
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:39,763
Like a kid-kid?

1001
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:42,966
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?

1002
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:45,035
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

1003
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:46,201
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1004
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:47,870
We're gettin' a kid?
Yes!

1005
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,239
We're gettin' a kid?

1006
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:51,006
<i> ? We're gonna get a kid</i>
? Kid

1007
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:51,709
<i> ? We're getting a kid</i>
All right, let's go.

1008
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,176
<i> ? We gonna get something, oh</i>
? We gonna uh, uh, uh

1009
00:47:54,176 --> 00:47:56,212
Where's Forky?
Long story.

1010
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:59,015
<i> ? Kid, we get a kid</i>
? Kid, kid, kid

1011
00:47:59,015 --> 00:48:01,419
?<i> We gonna kid ?</i>
? We gonna kid, kid?

1012
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,422
He's not anywhere.

1013
00:48:05,422 --> 00:48:06,723
Forky's gone.

1014
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:09,158
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.

1015
00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:11,895
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.

1016
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:14,332
But then we have to
keep driving, okay?

1017
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:19,169
They're about to leave!

1018
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:20,469
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!

1019
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:22,872
The panic is attacking me!

1020
00:48:22,872 --> 00:48:24,973
Hey! Watch it, buddy!
What do we do?

1021
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:25,710
We have to stop them!
How?

1022
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,911
We could frame
Dad for a crime
so he goes to jail.

1023
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:31,413
Or go back in time
and warn Woody
about the future.

1024
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:32,881
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.

1025
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:33,819
Jessie!

1026
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:39,321
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1027
00:48:39,321 --> 00:48:40,024
We looked everywhere.

1028
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:42,658
But we need
to get going now, okay?

1029
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:42,725
Can we please leave
a note for Forky...

1030
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:43,761
so he knows
where we're going?

1031
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:47,062
He has to go to kindergarten.

1032
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:47,797
Huh?

1033
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:52,402
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

1034
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:54,772
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

1035
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:57,806
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.

1036
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,209
How about we go
to the carnival?

1037
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:01,977
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

1038
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,379
What did you do?

1039
00:49:04,379 --> 00:49:07,951
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

1040
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:08,984
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!

1041
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:10,486
Nice work, Jessie!

1042
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:13,290
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are
on their way back right now.

1043
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,058
Whoa!

1044
00:49:17,058 --> 00:49:18,828
Forky is in there?

1045
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:19,995
Yeah.

1046
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:21,364
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

1047
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:24,100
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

1048
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,835
No, say Ducky. Ducky.
Bunny. Bunny.

1049
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:26,969
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

1050
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:28,104
You have to
follow my lead.

1051
00:49:28,104 --> 00:49:31,107
We stay together,
we stay quiet.
Are we clear?

1052
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:33,296
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

1053
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:55,998
Are you kidding me?
Move over.

1054
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:57,100
You move over.
Quit pushing me.

1055
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,500
Stop.
Shh!

1056
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,569
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has
three heads!

1057
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:00,736
No, no, no!

1058
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:04,207
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.

1059
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:05,279
Gonna have nightmares.

1060
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:13,917
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.

1061
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,185
All right,
this isn't so bad.

1062
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:17,252
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.

1063
00:50:17,252 --> 00:50:18,922
Not just the dummies.

1064
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:22,292
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

1065
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:24,861
Where Dragon roams.

1066
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:27,163
We can handle a cat.
No.

1067
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:27,931
Not this one.

1068
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:35,004
Is that how we look
on the inside?

1069
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:37,272
- There's so much...
- fluff.

1070
00:50:37,272 --> 00:50:38,875
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

1071
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,442
We could go straight across.

1072
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:42,312
How?
That's quite a jump.

1073
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:44,346
We know the perfect toy
to help.

1074
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:45,881
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.

1075
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,051
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?

1076
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,451
We gotta get
Forky now!

1077
00:50:49,451 --> 00:50:50,953
Woody, don't...

1078
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:52,254
Stick to the plan.
10-4.

1079
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:54,060
Follow me.
Roger that.

1080
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:02,031
Woody just sits
in the closet?
With no playtime?

1081
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,433
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

1082
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:05,602
That's awful.

1083
00:51:05,602 --> 00:51:07,536
Such pretty hair...

1084
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:08,937
What are you doing?

1085
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,073
You need to stick
to the plan.

1086
00:51:10,073 --> 00:51:11,473
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...

1087
00:51:11,473 --> 00:51:13,442
Can we go
to the carnival, too?

1088
00:51:13,442 --> 00:51:14,477
...there.

1089
00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:16,446
Come on. Stay quiet.

1090
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:18,214
You better hope
the dummies didn't...

1091
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:23,392
Whoa!

1092
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:58,024
My sheep!

1093
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,363
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

1094
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:09,131
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.

1095
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:10,265
Just tell me how to help.

1096
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:10,701
You really wanna help?

1097
00:52:11,701 --> 00:52:14,236
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

1098
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:15,337
What about the others?

1099
00:52:15,337 --> 00:52:17,674
Giggle knows what to do.

1100
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:22,145
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.

1101
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:24,180
We have to get that key.

1102
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,647
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.

1103
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:27,116
You can't be serious.

1104
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,518
How are we supposed
to do that?

1105
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:29,986
Okay.

1106
00:52:29,986 --> 00:52:31,154
You know what,
leave that to us.

1107
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:32,422
We know exactly
what to do.

1108
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:33,288
Mmm-hmm.

1109
00:52:35,424 --> 00:52:36,192
Aw.

1110
00:52:36,192 --> 00:52:38,328
Where did you
two come from?

1111
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:40,562
The keys!
Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

1112
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:42,966
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!

1113
00:52:42,966 --> 00:52:44,132
Well, we're not doing that.

1114
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:45,435
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.

1115
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:45,703
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

1116
00:52:46,703 --> 00:52:48,171
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?

1117
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:49,343
Yes.

1118
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:58,214
The keys!
Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

1119
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:00,149
Uh... you're kidding.
Really?

1120
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:00,750
Okay, okay.
You just...

1121
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,185
All right. Well...

1122
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:05,221
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?

1123
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:06,355
There you go!

1124
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,205
Argh. Where is this going?
Shh! Don't interrupt.

1125
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:38,187
- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?

1126
00:53:38,187 --> 00:53:40,323
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

1127
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:42,190
Okay, do you want
the key or not?

1128
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,359
What is
wrong with you?

1129
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,527
What is wrong with...?

1130
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:46,495
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

1131
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:48,131
It's one thing
to say no.

1132
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:48,765
It's another to offer
a reason...

1133
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:51,205
How do we get that key?

1134
00:53:57,473 --> 00:53:59,207
You're kidding!

1135
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:00,576
Really?

1136
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:00,743
Woody's back?

1137
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:03,413
Woody's back?

1138
00:54:03,413 --> 00:54:05,214
And you're sure
it's Bo Peep
who's with him?

1139
00:54:06,348 --> 00:54:07,482
Thank you, Benson.

1140
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:09,317
Make sure the others
are ready.

1141
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,087
Woody's back!

1142
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:14,024
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1143
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:16,225
Bonnie.

1144
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:18,261
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

1145
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:19,361
Prepare?

1146
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:20,529
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?

1147
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:23,098
No. But it sounds complicated.

1148
00:54:23,098 --> 00:54:24,232
Oh, it's easy.

1149
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:25,600
I'll teach you, okay?
Okay.

1150
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,437
The first thing
you do is...

1151
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:29,605
one of us finds
a place to hide...

1152
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:31,140
Scary.

1153
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:33,527
then tries to find them.

1154
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:53,395
What are we doing?
Shh!

1155
00:54:53,395 --> 00:54:56,169
Just stand there
and be quiet!

1156
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:03,138
I'll do the talking.

1157
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:06,142
Hi, Tinny!

1158
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:07,810
Aw, nice to
see you, too.

1159
00:55:09,145 --> 00:55:11,147
Yeah, he's with me.

1160
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:11,714
My friend?
No, no, no.

1161
00:55:12,714 --> 00:55:14,549
He's my accessory.

1162
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:16,486
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!

1163
00:55:16,486 --> 00:55:18,654
Long time no see.

1164
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:20,288
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?

1165
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:21,524
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half

1166
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:23,259
at the front
of the store.

1167
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:25,328
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

1168
00:55:25,328 --> 00:55:26,395
Bo came back!

1169
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:27,696
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1170
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:29,631
Excuse me. Sorry.
What are you doing here?

1171
00:55:29,631 --> 00:55:31,868
I thought the store
had no return policy!

1172
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:33,435
Bo, help me out.

1173
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,171
I need a battery.

1174
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:37,372
<i> We got to get</i>
this wagon train a-movin'!

1175
00:55:37,372 --> 00:55:38,808
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.

1176
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:39,908
Cheater.

1177
00:55:39,908 --> 00:55:41,310
Have you seen Duke?

1178
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,652
He's in the back.

1179
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:52,622
Look who jumped
40 school buses

1180
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:53,855
and landed back
into my life.

1181
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,359
Hi, Duke!
Who's the cowboy?

1182
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:57,926
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

1183
00:55:57,926 --> 00:56:01,430
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

1184
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,232
Oh, yeah!

1185
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:05,401
- Yes!
- Huh?

1186
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:07,569
He's posing.

1187
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:08,837
Duke?

1188
00:56:08,837 --> 00:56:09,739
Duke, we need to...
Hold on. One more.

1189
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:13,308
Oh, yeah!
What brings
you back, Peep?

1190
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:14,576
We need your help.

1191
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:17,647
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.

1192
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:21,484
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

1193
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:23,218
What were you doing
getting tangled up

1194
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:24,587
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.

1195
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,256
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

1196
00:56:27,256 --> 00:56:28,457
to wander into the aisle.

1197
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:29,892
That doesn't make any sense.

1198
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:31,560
It doesn't, does it?

1199
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,596
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

1200
00:56:33,596 --> 00:56:35,830
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?

1201
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,933
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.

1202
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,602
He does!

1203
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:41,971
Wait, are you that toy?

1204
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:42,705
So, here's the plan.

1205
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:46,341
We need to
jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.

1206
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:49,212
And you are the toy to do it.
No.

1207
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:50,379
Duke.
Nope.

1208
00:56:50,379 --> 00:56:51,647
Duke? Duke?
Nuh-uh. No way!

1209
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:53,381
Duke. Duke!
Pass. Negative.

1210
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:53,716
Duke.
Rejected.

1211
00:56:54,716 --> 00:56:56,484
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.

1212
00:56:56,484 --> 00:56:56,786
My kid...

1213
00:56:57,786 --> 00:56:57,788
You have a kid?

1214
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:00,455
Uh...

1215
00:57:00,455 --> 00:57:03,259
Hey, Duke, show us
some more poses,
what do you say?

1216
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:05,393
I had a kid.
Oh, no.

1217
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:05,796
Rejean.

1218
00:57:06,796 --> 00:57:09,700
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.

1219
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,569
<i> It was the happiest Boxing Day</i>
of my life.

1220
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:15,937
<i>That's Duke Caboom,</i>

1221
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:17,707
<i> riding the amazing</i>
Caboom stunt cycle!

1222
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:20,475
<i> Caboom!</i>

1223
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:23,913
<i> I was ready to finally</i>
do what I was made to do.

1224
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:25,348
<i> Caboom!</i>

1225
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:27,283
<i> But when Rejean realized</i>
I couldn't jump

1226
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:29,451
<i> as far as the toy</i>
in the commercial...

1227
00:57:30,451 --> 00:57:33,422
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

1228
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:34,957
Rejean threw me away!

1229
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:36,359
It's not fair!

1230
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,426
Why, Rejean? Why?

1231
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:43,299
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

1232
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:45,368
That was a long time ago.

1233
00:57:45,368 --> 00:57:46,935
Right now,
we need the only toy

1234
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:48,772
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.

1235
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:50,839
Crash?

1236
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:52,540
Crash?

1237
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,877
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...

1238
00:57:54,877 --> 00:57:57,980
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

1239
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,582
I am?
Yes!

1240
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:01,884
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

1241
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:04,486
Be the Duke
you are right now...

1242
00:58:04,486 --> 00:58:06,991
the one who jumps
and crashes!

1243
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:15,531
Be who I am right now.

1244
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:18,466
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?

1245
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,868
Caboom?

1246
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:20,703
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

1247
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:22,538
Caboom!

1248
00:58:23,538 --> 00:58:23,939
Who's the most
spectacular daredevil

1249
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:25,908
Canada has ever seen?

1250
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:27,676
Duke Caboom!

1251
00:58:27,676 --> 00:58:29,011
Can you do the jump?

1252
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:30,948
Yes, I Canada!

1253
00:58:32,948 --> 00:58:33,750
Uh-huh.

1254
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,352
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!

1255
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:39,421
<i> Yee-haw!</i>

1256
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:40,589
Yo, Bo!

1257
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:42,892
Gigs! You made it!

1258
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:44,060
Good work!

1259
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,627
How'd you get it?

1260
00:58:45,627 --> 00:58:47,696
How do we get that key?

1261
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:53,703
It was hard.
Very difficult.

1262
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:56,471
Barely made it out alive.
Yeah.

1263
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:57,605
So, you're welcome.

1264
00:58:57,605 --> 00:59:00,509
Okay. Let's do this.

1265
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:02,377
Let me wrap that up for you.

1266
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:04,946
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.

1267
00:59:04,946 --> 00:59:07,450
Good. That sale
buys us some time.

1268
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,953
Wait for it.

1269
00:59:11,953 --> 00:59:13,968
All right, let's go!

1270
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:57,565
So, how long
were you in here?

1271
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,402
I don't know.
Couple years.

1272
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:02,504
I didn't wanna sit
on a shelf waiting
for my life to happen.

1273
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:02,705
So, I left.

1274
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:05,140
Wow.

1275
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,609
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.

1276
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:09,044
Aw, Sheriff.

1277
01:00:09,044 --> 01:00:10,848
You're selling
yourself short.

1278
01:00:12,848 --> 01:00:14,718
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

1279
01:00:16,718 --> 01:00:17,986
You really don't think

1280
01:00:17,986 --> 01:00:19,989
you'll ever be in
a kid's room again, huh?

1281
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,091
Nope.

1282
01:00:22,091 --> 01:00:22,292
And now with the carnival
traveling through,

1283
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:24,593
it's our chance
to hop a ride...

1284
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:26,060
and leave town.
You're leaving?

1285
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,596
Sure am.

1286
01:00:28,596 --> 01:00:29,098
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?

1287
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:30,866
Without a kid?

1288
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,968
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

1289
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:37,439
You'd be surprised.

1290
01:00:37,439 --> 01:00:39,709
So, how'd you
end up in this store
in the first place?

1291
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:43,011
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1292
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:46,948
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1293
01:00:46,948 --> 01:00:48,821
and so I, uh...

1294
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:53,922
Wow.

1295
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:56,692
Yeah.

1296
01:00:56,692 --> 01:00:57,761
Will you look at that?

1297
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:03,538
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

1298
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:14,009
That's gonna be
quite a jump
for you and Duke.

1299
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:15,815
For me?

1300
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:22,585
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

1301
01:01:22,585 --> 01:01:23,553
I am?

1302
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:24,754
Let's caboom.

1303
01:01:25,754 --> 01:01:27,522
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.

1304
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,060
Yeah, at crashing.

1305
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,196
And now!

1306
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:36,732
Go!

1307
01:01:37,732 --> 01:01:37,767
Whoa!

1308
01:01:46,174 --> 01:01:48,076
Huh? Rejean.

1309
01:01:48,076 --> 01:01:50,913
<i> It's a commercial.</i>
It's not real!

1310
01:01:50,913 --> 01:01:53,515
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

1311
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:54,989
No, no, no!

1312
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,270
What's new, pussycat?

1313
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,939
Forky?
Girls?

1314
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:18,741
Forky, where are you?

1315
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:21,609
You're never
gonna find me.

1316
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:23,678
Forky?

1317
01:02:23,678 --> 01:02:25,881
Woody!
How'd you find me?

1318
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:27,850
Bo, I found him!
Hi.

1319
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,053
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1320
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:32,154
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1321
01:02:32,154 --> 01:02:33,955
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

1322
01:02:33,955 --> 01:02:36,125
What?
Where'd they go?

1323
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:38,794
Okay, we can go now!

1324
01:02:40,794 --> 01:02:41,964
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.

1325
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:42,997
Hi, Bo.

1326
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:44,332
Where are my sheep?
Yeah!

1327
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:45,901
Look! Woody found me!

1328
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:48,038
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!

1329
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:51,806
Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!

1330
01:02:51,806 --> 01:02:53,241
Woody!

1331
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:56,611
I just wanna talk.
Yeah, with my voice box!

1332
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:59,047
Pull!

1333
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:00,582
Whoa!

1334
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:03,185
<i>You're my favorite deputy.</i>

1335
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:06,221
<i> Somebody's poisoned</i>
the water hole.

1336
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:07,957
<i> I'd like to join your posse.</i>

1337
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:10,259
<i>Reach for the sky!</i>

1338
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:23,238
Girls!

1339
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:25,172
Drop it.

1340
01:03:28,277 --> 01:03:29,979
No! No! Forky!

1341
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:32,013
We've gotta go!
Wait!

1342
01:03:32,013 --> 01:03:34,151
Forky!

1343
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,055
Woody!

1344
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:51,834
Bonnie's backpack?

1345
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:56,238
Ahh!

1346
01:03:58,906 --> 01:04:00,341
Giggle!

1347
01:04:02,044 --> 01:04:04,647
Don't let Woody leave!

1348
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:07,819
Grab on!

1349
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,922
Duke, get us out of here!

1350
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:14,890
<i> Oui!</i>

1351
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,826
Here, kitty, kitty!

1352
01:04:17,826 --> 01:04:18,727
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1353
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:21,330
Woody!

1354
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:26,239
Forky!

1355
01:04:45,354 --> 01:04:46,922
Is everyone okay?

1356
01:04:50,192 --> 01:04:52,694
Shh. It's okay.

1357
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:53,730
Shh. It's okay.

1358
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,964
Bunny? Bunny?

1359
01:04:56,964 --> 01:05:00,368
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

1360
01:05:00,368 --> 01:05:04,239
No, no, no, no.

1361
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,475
Oh, Bunny!
It's gonna be okay.

1362
01:05:06,475 --> 01:05:07,609
Forky's still in there.

1363
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:09,143
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1364
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:09,745
You want us
to go back in there?

1365
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:11,980
We barely
got out alive.

1366
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,716
Woody, it's better
if we wait.

1367
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:14,917
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1368
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:16,118
But I saw Bonnie's...

1369
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:17,051
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1370
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:18,085
But the backpack...

1371
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,354
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1372
01:05:19,354 --> 01:05:20,723
Woody, look at us!

1373
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:25,794
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

1374
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:29,163
No. No, no, no.
We are wasting time.
We can do this.

1375
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:31,132
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.

1376
01:05:31,132 --> 01:05:32,301
Yeah, yes,
listen to her!

1377
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:34,136
Nobody wants this!
I do!

1378
01:05:34,136 --> 01:05:35,337
Why?
Because!

1379
01:05:35,337 --> 01:05:37,406
Why?
Just because!

1380
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,239
Why?

1381
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,444
Because it's all
I have left to do!

1382
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:43,747
I don't have anything else.

1383
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:47,415
So, the rest of us
don't count?

1384
01:05:48,415 --> 01:05:50,486
That's not what I meant.

1385
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:52,020
Bonnie needs Forky.

1386
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,756
No. You need Bonnie!

1387
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:55,991
Open your eyes, Woody.

1388
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:57,859
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1389
01:05:57,859 --> 01:06:02,163
It can't be just about
the one you're still
clinging to.

1390
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:04,165
It's called loyalty.

1391
01:06:04,165 --> 01:06:06,402
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.

1392
01:06:14,042 --> 01:06:15,779
I'm not the one who's lost.

1393
01:06:17,779 --> 01:06:19,247
Let's get out of here.

1394
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:21,850
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

1395
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,352
Come on.

1396
01:06:23,352 --> 01:06:24,553
Mmm-hmm.

1397
01:06:24,553 --> 01:06:26,020
We'll find our own kid.

1398
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,158
You're crazy.

1399
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:31,158
Bo!

1400
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:34,201
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

1401
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:43,906
Woody, you did
all you could.

1402
01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:45,808
Time to go home.

1403
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:46,908
No.

1404
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:48,109
Woody.

1405
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:49,444
I don't leave
toys behind, Buzz.

1406
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:50,913
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

1407
01:06:50,913 --> 01:06:53,415
Not now. Not ever.

1408
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:57,185
And he left me behind.

1409
01:06:57,185 --> 01:06:58,886
What now, inner voice?

1410
01:06:58,886 --> 01:07:00,989
<i> Mission</i>
accomplished. Return to base.

1411
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:03,225
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?

1412
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:05,160
<i> We're going home,</i>
space ranger.

1413
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,562
<i> Fall back, this planet...</i>

1414
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,196
<i> Retreat! There's too...</i>

1415
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,531
<i> Go! Time to fly! Exit the...</i>
Back... Run...

1416
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:11,600
<i> Get out!</i>
Returning to Star Command.

1417
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,035
Okay. Okay.

1418
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:18,372
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1419
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:22,176
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

1420
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:25,113
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?

1421
01:07:25,113 --> 01:07:26,085
Sure.

1422
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:33,455
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody.

1423
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:34,991
I knew you'd be back.

1424
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:38,593
You don't know me.

1425
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:40,428
But I do.

1426
01:07:40,428 --> 01:07:44,198
You were left
in the closet,
feeling useless...

1427
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:46,301
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

1428
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:48,303
I'm not leaving
without Forky.

1429
01:07:48,303 --> 01:07:50,272
Can we agree
on just one thing?

1430
01:07:51,272 --> 01:07:52,306
What?

1431
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:54,176
That being there for a child

1432
01:07:54,176 --> 01:07:57,013
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1433
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:00,283
Okay.

1434
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:05,988
I was defective
right out of the box.

1435
01:08:05,988 --> 01:08:09,390
I can only imagine
what it must have
been like for you.

1436
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,062
All that time you
spent with Andy...

1437
01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:18,200
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1438
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,903
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...

1439
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:25,006
proudly watching him
grow up.

1440
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:28,242
And then you got
a second chance
with Bonnie...

1441
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:31,145
giving her comfort
when she's scared
at school...

1442
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:34,582
helping her when
she needs it most.

1443
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:38,455
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

1444
01:08:40,455 --> 01:08:42,123
Please.

1445
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:43,225
Be honest with me.

1446
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:47,965
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?

1447
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,504
It was.

1448
01:08:56,504 --> 01:09:01,077
All I want is
a chance for just
one of those moments.

1449
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:07,086
I'd give anything
to be loved
the way you have.

1450
01:09:13,086 --> 01:09:14,189
Just leave me Forky.

1451
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:18,527
Bonnie needs him.

1452
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:20,935
Of course.

1453
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,210
The flat tire is fixed!

1454
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,211
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1455
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:39,480
Where is he?

1456
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,416
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

1457
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,085
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?

1458
01:09:43,085 --> 01:09:44,486
We have a situation.

1459
01:09:44,486 --> 01:09:46,087
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

1460
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:47,589
How do we do that?

1461
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:49,190
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.

1462
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,093
Finally.

1463
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:52,426
It's okay.
Any minute now...

1464
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,763
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

1465
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:57,099
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

1466
01:09:57,099 --> 01:09:58,567
and we'll head back
in there.

1467
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:00,402
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.

1468
01:10:00,402 --> 01:10:00,737
You good, Bonnie?
Yup.

1469
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:03,638
Great. Let's get out of here.

1470
01:10:05,273 --> 01:10:06,675
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?

1471
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:08,109
Hmm.

1472
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:09,077
<i>Scanning perimeter.</i>

1473
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:10,312
<i> Laser at full power!</i>

1474
01:10:10,312 --> 01:10:12,014
Buzz, what are you doing?
I'm thinking.

1475
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:14,015
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?

1476
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,384
Yeah, I got it.

1477
01:10:15,384 --> 01:10:17,118
<i> Attack!</i>
Meteor shower! Look out!

1478
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:19,621
<i> It's a secret mission in</i>
uncharted space! Let's go!

1479
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:22,256
<i> Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

1480
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:23,392
Bonnie, how do you
turn this off?

1481
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:23,792
<i> Full speed ahead!</i>

1482
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,461
<i>- Open the pod bay doors!</i>
- I don't know.

1483
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,130
<i> It's just you and me now,</i>
cadet.

1484
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,531
<i> A distress signal is coming</i>
from that rocket.

1485
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:31,132
Just toss it in the drawer.

1486
01:10:31,132 --> 01:10:34,068
<i>To infinity and beyond!</i>

1487
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:36,670
Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!

1488
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,739
Oh, no, my backpack!

1489
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:41,309
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

1490
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:42,676
You did?

1491
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:46,547
All right,
let's swing by
and get it.

1492
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:53,554
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.

1493
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:55,189
I mean, who does
he think he is?

1494
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:56,425
Exactly!

1495
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:58,326
He was way out of line.

1496
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:00,194
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.

1497
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:03,130
- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm.

1498
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,203
Coast is clear.
Oh.

1499
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:11,439
Head to the middle.

1500
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:12,840
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,

1501
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,276
we'll hide right there.

1502
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:17,612
Uh, no way!
Stuff that.

1503
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:18,612
Awesome.

1504
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:20,181
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

1505
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:21,215
- Ready?
- No!

1506
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:22,651
And another thing,

1507
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:24,251
Woody asked you for help.
On your mark...

1508
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:25,620
And he
treats you like that?

1509
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,221
...get set...
He only cares about himself.

1510
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:28,322
No!

1511
01:11:28,322 --> 01:11:29,690
You're wrong.

1512
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,358
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.

1513
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:32,861
By putting
everyone in danger.

1514
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:34,764
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...

1515
01:11:35,764 --> 01:11:37,299
You gotta love him for it.

1516
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:37,767
Whoa, say what now?

1517
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,635
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

1518
01:11:40,635 --> 01:11:42,273
Fill me in here.

1519
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,243
Get in! We're going back.

1520
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:50,345
We just got here.

1521
01:11:50,345 --> 01:11:52,313
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

1522
01:11:52,313 --> 01:11:54,220
Move your plush!
Let's ride!

1523
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,890
<i>You're my favorite...</i>

1524
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:17,839
Yay!

1525
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:21,143
<i>You are my best friend.</i>

1526
01:12:21,143 --> 01:12:22,477
<i> Let's play all day!</i>

1527
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:24,345
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?

1528
01:12:24,345 --> 01:12:25,613
Isn't that lovely?

1529
01:12:25,613 --> 01:12:25,781
<i> Time for tea.</i>

1530
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:29,216
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

1531
01:12:29,216 --> 01:12:30,484
All my dreams

1532
01:12:30,484 --> 01:12:30,786
are coming true
because of you.

1533
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:32,888
Thank you! Thank you!

1534
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:34,188
Uh, you're welcome.

1535
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,759
It's time, Benson.

1536
01:12:37,759 --> 01:12:40,528
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to
miss our talks.

1537
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:43,230
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

1538
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,334
Thank you,
my little utensil.

1539
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:49,138
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

1540
01:12:50,138 --> 01:12:52,340
He is terrifying.

1541
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:54,876
Hello.
Hi.

1542
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,243
Bonnie?

1543
01:12:56,243 --> 01:12:57,479
Can I help you
with anything?

1544
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:57,746
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.

1545
01:12:58,746 --> 01:12:59,782
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.

1546
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:02,384
Feel free to look around.

1547
01:13:02,384 --> 01:13:03,786
Quick! Before she finds it!

1548
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:09,193
Look! There's Harmony.

1549
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,929
<i>You make me so happy!</i>

1550
01:13:13,929 --> 01:13:15,163
<i> Let's be best friends.</i>

1551
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:17,831
Oh, this is it!

1552
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:19,201
We're going home, Forky!

1553
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,202
Huh?

1554
01:13:22,202 --> 01:13:23,773
Forky! Oh!

1555
01:13:24,773 --> 01:13:27,547
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

1556
01:13:33,547 --> 01:13:36,652
<i> I'm Gabby Gabby,</i>
and I love you.

1557
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:39,590
I'm gonna cry.

1558
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,260
Oh, what have you
got there?

1559
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,662
I found this old doll.

1560
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,765
You can take it
home if you want.

1561
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:52,702
Nah.

1562
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,943
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.

1563
01:14:02,943 --> 01:14:04,912
There's my backpack!

1564
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:06,251
Mom, it's over here.

1565
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:12,519
Forky!

1566
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:13,988
Mom, I found him!

1567
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,991
Oh, there he is!

1568
01:14:15,991 --> 01:14:17,559
Now, please leave him
in there,

1569
01:14:17,559 --> 01:14:19,300
so he doesn't get lost again.

1570
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:26,903
But what about Gabby?

1571
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,938
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.

1572
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,640
This is important.

1573
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,876
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

1574
01:14:34,876 --> 01:14:35,809
You understand?

1575
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,912
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?

1576
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:39,782
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1577
01:14:40,782 --> 01:14:42,817
Oh. You mean a carousel.
Yes!

1578
01:14:42,817 --> 01:14:44,618
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

1579
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:45,889
Got it.

1580
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,935
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

1581
01:15:01,935 --> 01:15:04,273
You can have
your voice box back.

1582
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:08,076
I don't need it anymore.

1583
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:09,477
Oh, yes, you do.

1584
01:15:09,477 --> 01:15:10,944
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,

1585
01:15:10,944 --> 01:15:12,514
but we have to hurry.
Come on.

1586
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:16,550
No. Harmony
was my chance.

1587
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,920
My time's over.

1588
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,723
Now, please go away.

1589
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:34,573
You hear that?

1590
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:42,644
A friend
once told me...

1591
01:15:42,644 --> 01:15:45,313
"There are plenty of kids
out there."

1592
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:49,550
And one of them
is named Bonnie.

1593
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,455
She's waiting for you,
right now.

1594
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:56,693
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1595
01:15:58,693 --> 01:16:00,862
What if you're wrong?

1596
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:04,832
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

1597
01:16:04,832 --> 01:16:07,535
you'll never find out,
will you?

1598
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:11,706
He's right.

1599
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,879
I learned that
from the best.

1600
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:21,116
Come on, Gabby.

1601
01:16:21,116 --> 01:16:23,523
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1602
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:30,892
The carousel?

1603
01:16:30,892 --> 01:16:33,461
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1604
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:34,996
Woody said
to meet him there.

1605
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:37,098
You gotta be kidding!
How do we do that?

1606
01:16:37,098 --> 01:16:38,465
Oh! We could, uh...

1607
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:39,934
We are not
sending Dad to jail.

1608
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:40,969
You're no fun.

1609
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:42,737
<i>Left turn in 0.5 miles.</i>

1610
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:47,440
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

1611
01:16:57,651 --> 01:16:58,920
Skunk!

1612
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,855
Skunk!

1613
01:17:10,497 --> 01:17:12,867
Too many people.
Gonna need
an alternate route.

1614
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:14,805
Will we make it
to the carousel
in time?

1615
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,175
Yes, we Canada!

1616
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:23,411
What? What is it?

1617
01:17:28,648 --> 01:17:32,019
Recalculating.
Take a right.

1618
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,220
What? A right?

1619
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,922
Right turn ahead.

1620
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:36,890
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?

1621
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,693
Honey,
it's fine. Just drive.

1622
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,563
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.

1623
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:43,799
Another right!

1624
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:46,800
Right.
Take another right.

1625
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,603
Huh?
Another right? Really?

1626
01:17:48,603 --> 01:17:48,770
Turn right!
Now!

1627
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,706
Turn right!

1628
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:54,908
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!

1629
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:57,812
Do you think
Woody will get there
in time?

1630
01:17:57,812 --> 01:18:00,514
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

1631
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:02,649
No dice. Rejected.
Duke, Duke, you got this.

1632
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:04,551
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.

1633
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:04,720
You made the last jump.

1634
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,822
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

1635
01:18:07,822 --> 01:18:11,091
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

1636
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,060
No. He'd never do that.
No, no, no.

1637
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:16,163
He's the toy
that went on
to crash 40 feet

1638
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:18,565
into that target!

1639
01:18:18,565 --> 01:18:20,667
Yeah, he is.

1640
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:22,237
I'm Duke Caboom!

1641
01:18:22,237 --> 01:18:24,171
Oh, man. I can do this!

1642
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:25,607
Yes, you Canada!

1643
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:25,773
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

1644
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:28,209
Yes, you... What?

1645
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,515
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!

1646
01:18:35,515 --> 01:18:37,218
What is he doing?
Oh, no.

1647
01:18:47,795 --> 01:18:50,602
This is for you, Rejean.

1648
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:57,139
Caboom.

1649
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:00,841
Yes!

1650
01:19:01,841 --> 01:19:02,210
He did it!

1651
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,577
All right, our turn!

1652
01:19:04,577 --> 01:19:06,046
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

1653
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:13,121
Yee-haw!

1654
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:17,125
Another right!

1655
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,992
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

1656
01:19:18,992 --> 01:19:20,995
Are you sure?
Stupid rental.

1657
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:22,596
- I'm turning us around.
- No!

1658
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:24,165
- Huh?
- Recalculating.

1659
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:25,332
Turn right.

1660
01:19:25,332 --> 01:19:27,938
- Must be broken.
- No! No!

1661
01:19:31,938 --> 01:19:33,140
What is happening?

1662
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,608
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!

1663
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,077
I can't! I can't!

1664
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:38,580
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.

1665
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:46,153
Got a visual
on the RV,

1666
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:48,661
heading southbound.

1667
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:55,197
Gabby?

1668
01:19:57,197 --> 01:19:57,898
Gabby?

1669
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:04,153
I think she's lost.

1670
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:21,665
Are you sure?

1671
01:20:31,665 --> 01:20:33,635
Change of plans.

1672
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:40,340
<i>Pull over.</i>

1673
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,276
I can't! This is a rental!

1674
01:20:42,276 --> 01:20:43,944
I don't know
what's happening!

1675
01:20:54,321 --> 01:20:56,290
I'm so nervous.

1676
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,725
What if she doesn't like me?
Gabby.

1677
01:20:58,725 --> 01:20:59,961
I don't know
if I can do this.

1678
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:01,729
Gabby, it's just
like you said.

1679
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:05,903
This is the most
noble thing
a toy can do.

1680
01:21:10,903 --> 01:21:12,239
Okay.

1681
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,810
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

1682
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,880
Not too far.

1683
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,315
That's it.

1684
01:21:22,315 --> 01:21:24,986
Perfect.

1685
01:21:24,986 --> 01:21:27,299
Winner, winner...
Chicken dinner.

1686
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:50,782
Are you lost, too?

1687
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:56,818
<i> I'm Gabby Gabby.</i>
Will you be my friend?

1688
01:21:58,818 --> 01:22:00,193
I'll help you.

1689
01:22:07,193 --> 01:22:11,032
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?

1690
01:22:11,032 --> 01:22:11,767
Oh, honey,
what's wrong?

1691
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:14,301
I can't find
my mom and dad.

1692
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:16,403
It's okay.
I'll help you
find them.

1693
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:17,904
I'm sure they're not far.

1694
01:22:17,904 --> 01:22:19,172
She was right next to us.

1695
01:22:19,172 --> 01:22:19,774
She was right here!

1696
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,309
And I looked
away for one second.

1697
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:23,452
Mommy!

1698
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:32,953
I couldn't find you...

1699
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:34,354
and then I found this doll.

1700
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,456
You did?

1701
01:22:35,456 --> 01:22:37,068
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1702
01:22:49,068 --> 01:22:52,005
Whoa.
We actually did that.

1703
01:22:52,005 --> 01:22:54,509
Oh, yeah. Yes!

1704
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:56,443
That was amazing.

1705
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:58,880
We make a great team, guys.

1706
01:23:00,113 --> 01:23:02,884
<i>Pull over now!</i>

1707
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:06,453
Almost there.

1708
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:09,326
Stop!
Stop!

1709
01:23:14,028 --> 01:23:15,962
Are we home?

1710
01:23:15,962 --> 01:23:17,065
Huh?

1711
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:21,868
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

1712
01:23:21,868 --> 01:23:24,237
Dad's totally going to jail.

1713
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,279
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

1714
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:35,382
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

1715
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:37,184
For me?

1716
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,254
Have a good night.

1717
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:43,825
What the...?

1718
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:45,859
You've gotta be
kidding me.

1719
01:24:00,306 --> 01:24:01,542
Hey.

1720
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,313
Um... So long, cowboy.

1721
01:24:05,313 --> 01:24:07,148
Happy trails.

1722
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:15,827
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

1723
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:25,465
I'm glad
I got to see you again.

1724
01:24:26,465 --> 01:24:28,627
I... I don't...

1725
01:24:54,627 --> 01:24:55,987
Goodbye, Bo.

1726
01:25:20,987 --> 01:25:22,957
Buzz, I... I...

1727
01:25:24,957 --> 01:25:26,662
She'll be okay.

1728
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:32,604
Bonnie will be okay.

1729
01:25:38,604 --> 01:25:40,041
You sure?

1730
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,339
Hey. Listen to
your inner voice.

1731
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,175
Bo?

1732
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:15,376
Is it really her?

1733
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:17,111
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!

1734
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:18,045
Jessie.

1735
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:20,576
Bo!

1736
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:54,742
Oh!

1737
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:23,278
So long, Forky.

1738
01:27:25,278 --> 01:27:28,081
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

1739
01:27:29,517 --> 01:27:32,420
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.

1740
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,742
Oh, my goodness.
The awning.
What is going on?

1741
01:28:08,654 --> 01:28:12,526
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?

1742
01:28:12,526 --> 01:28:12,795
He's not lost.

1743
01:28:14,795 --> 01:28:17,264
Not anymore.

1744
01:28:18,264 --> 01:28:20,666
To infinity...

1745
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:23,200
And beyond.

1746
01:29:19,725 --> 01:29:21,595
Yay!

1747
01:29:21,595 --> 01:29:24,197
There goes
another one.

1748
01:29:24,197 --> 01:29:25,832
We're never
getting outta here.

1749
01:29:25,832 --> 01:29:27,201
Psst. Frog legs.

1750
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:28,501
Up here,
Rainbow Connection.

1751
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:30,938
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?

1752
01:29:30,938 --> 01:29:32,238
We can make
that happen.

1753
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:33,573
You can?
Really?

1754
01:29:33,573 --> 01:29:35,345
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

1755
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:40,317
Aw.

1756
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:20,220
All right.
Nice job, gang!

1757
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,554
Every prize
with a kid.

1758
01:30:21,554 --> 01:30:23,224
What's next?
Leave that to us.

1759
01:30:23,224 --> 01:30:25,250
We know exactly
what to do.
Mmm-hmm.

1760
01:31:02,729 --> 01:31:04,531
Plush Rush!

1761
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:06,367
How you like that, huh?

1762
01:31:06,367 --> 01:31:08,335
You got plush-rushed, son!

1763
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:09,502
Dance!

1764
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:12,372
Dance! Get those knees up!

1765
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:17,278
Let's see those
feet move! Whoo!

1766
01:31:28,455 --> 01:31:30,924
Or we can get
more toys to kids.

1767
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:32,594
Yeah, let's do that.

1768
01:31:34,594 --> 01:31:36,898
Do you really have
laser eyes?

1769
01:31:38,898 --> 01:31:40,334
Yeah.

1770
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:42,328
Whoa.

1771
01:32:09,328 --> 01:32:10,997
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1772
01:32:11,997 --> 01:32:13,567
Jessie's back!

1773
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:15,402
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

1774
01:32:15,402 --> 01:32:16,569
Well, it was...

1775
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:17,837
How was
"Present and Explain"?

1776
01:32:17,837 --> 01:32:19,105
Uh, you mean
"Show and Tell"
there, big guy.

1777
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:20,541
You see
any kids eat paste?

1778
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:21,809
Guys, listen!

1779
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:24,010
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.

1780
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,580
She even made
a new friend in class.

1781
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,849
Oh, she's already
making friends.

1782
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:31,984
No, no,
she made a new friend.

1783
01:32:31,984 --> 01:32:33,857
Come on out, it's okay.

1784
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:56,577
Hi. I'm, uh...
I'm Forky.

1785
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:58,612
Trash?

1786
01:32:58,612 --> 01:33:02,014
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

1787
01:33:02,014 --> 01:33:04,385
We are all toys.

1788
01:33:04,385 --> 01:33:08,488
Unique,
beautiful toys.

1789
01:33:08,488 --> 01:33:12,492
I will explain everything.

1790
01:33:12,492 --> 01:33:15,898
How am I alive?

1791
01:33:18,898 --> 01:33:21,675
I don't know.

1792
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:40,787
<i>? I was a lonesome cowboy</i>

1793
01:33:41,787 --> 01:33:45,826
<i> ? Lonesome as I could be</i>

1794
01:33:45,826 --> 01:33:50,531
<i> ? You came along</i>
and changed my life

1795
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:53,834
<i> ? And fixed</i>
what was broken in me

1796
01:33:54,834 --> 01:33:59,840
<i> ? I was a lonesome cowboy</i>

1797
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,211
?<i> I didn't have a friend</i>

1798
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:08,681
<i> ? Now I got friends</i>
coming out of my ears

1799
01:34:08,681 --> 01:34:13,453
<i> ? I'll never be lonesome again</i>

1800
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:17,858
<i> ? You can't be happy</i>
when you're all by yourself

1801
01:34:17,858 --> 01:34:20,493
<i> ? Go on, tell me I'm wrong</i>

1802
01:34:20,493 --> 01:34:22,095
<i> ? You're wrong</i>

1803
01:34:22,095 --> 01:34:26,065
<i> ? When someone takes you</i>
down from the shelf

1804
01:34:26,065 --> 01:34:28,702
<i> ? And plays with you some</i>
It's wonderful

1805
01:34:29,702 --> 01:34:30,970
<i> ? Wonderful</i>

1806
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:36,143
<i> ? I was a lonesome cowboy</i>

1807
01:34:37,143 --> 01:34:40,546
<i> ? But not anymore</i>

1808
01:34:40,546 --> 01:34:44,818
<i> ? I just found out</i>
What love is about

1809
01:34:44,818 --> 01:34:48,656
<i> ? I've never</i>
felt this way before

1810
01:34:49,656 --> 01:34:52,794
<i> ? I was a lonesome cowboy</i>

1811
01:34:54,794 --> 01:34:59,666
<i> ? But not anymore ?</i>

1812
01:39:48,453 --> 01:39:50,224
Caboom!

1813
01:39:51,224 --> 01:39:51,700
Yes!
