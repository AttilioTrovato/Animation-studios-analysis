3
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:09,338
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

4
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,854
Thousands of years ago
these were the...

5
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,490
forces that ruled our world

6
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:18,082
A world where prey were
scared of predators.

7
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:21,060
And predators had an
uncontrollable...

8
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:25,699
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

9
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:27,499
Awww!

10
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:30,495
Blood! Blood! Blood!

11
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,603
And.. death!

12
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:40,918
Ahhh...

13
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:47,287
Back then, the world
was divided in two.

14
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:51,292
Vicious predator,
or meek prey.

15
00:01:54,398 --> 00:02:00,723
But over time, we evolved,
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

16
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:05,123
Now predator and prey
live in harmony.

17
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:09,588
And every young mammal
has multitudinous opportunities.

18
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:13,835
Yeah, I don't have to cower
in a a herd anymore.

19
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,491
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

20
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:24,867
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,966
I'm gonna be an actuary.

22
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,709
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...

23
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,975
A police officer!

24
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,518
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard!

25
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:48,900
It may seem impossible to small minds.
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

26
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:55,746
But, just 211 miles away,
stands the great city of Zootopia.

27
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:59,077
Where our ancestors first joined
together in peace.

28
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:05,270
And declared that anyone
can be anything!

29
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,077
Thank you and good night.

30
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:12,990
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

31
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:13,986
Nope

32
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,823
Well, we gave up on our dreams,
and we settled. Right, Bon?

33
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,177
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

34
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:22,155
You see, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

35
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,468
If you don't try anything
new, you'll never fail.

36
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:26,016
I like trying, actually.

37
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,966
What your father means, hon, is that it's
gonna be difficult, impossible even...

38
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,111
- for you to become a police officer.
- Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

39
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,207
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.

40
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,137
- Never.
- Never.

41
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,031
Well... Then I guess
I'll have to be the first one.

42
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:42,627
Because I am gonna make
the world a better place!

43
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:46,399
Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk
about making the world a better place,

44
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,383
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

45
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:52,585
Yes! Your dad, me,
your 275 brothers and sisters.

46
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,532
- We're changing the world.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,479
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,230
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

49
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,970
You get it, honey?
I mean, it's great to have dreams.

50
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,243
Yeah, just as long as you
don't believe in them too much.

51
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,053
Where the heck'd she go?

52
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:15,603
Give me your tickets right now,
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

53
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:17,388
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

54
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:20,087
Baah, baah!
What are you gonna do, cry?

55
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:25,021
- Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
- Nice costume, loser.

56
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:29,152
What crazy world are you living in
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

57
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:33,541
- Kindly return my friend's tickets.
- Come and get them. But watch out.

58
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,934
Cause I'm a fox, and like you said
in your dumb little stage play,

59
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:41,572
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct's still in our denna.

60
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:45,264
- Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.
- Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

61
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,955
You don't scare me, Gideon.

62
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,167
Scared now?

63
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,269
Look at her nose twitch,
she is scared.

64
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:56,212
Cry, little baby bunny!
Cry... Ow...

65
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:01,060
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

66
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,127
Huh!

67
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:11,243
I want you to remember this moment
the next time you think you will ever be...

68
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,541
anything more than just a
stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

69
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,702
- That looks bad.
- Are you okay, Judy?

70
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:26,298
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Here you go.

71
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:29,918
- Wow, you got our tickets!
- You're awesome, Judy.

72
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,377
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talking about!

73
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:37,678
Well, he was right
about one thing.

74
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:40,860
I don't know when to quit.

75
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,218
<font color="#55c8ff">ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY</font>

76
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:47,527
Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city limits.

77
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:51,934
Tundratown, Sahara Square,
Rainforest District, to name a few.

78
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,476
You're gonna have to master all of
them before you hit the streets.

79
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,842
Or guess what?
You'll be dead!

80
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,543
Scorching sandstorm.

81
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,601
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.

82
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,779
One thousand foot fall.

83
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,143
You're dead, carrot face.

84
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:14,413
Frigid ice wall.

85
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,534
You're dead, farm girl.

86
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:19,724
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.

87
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:22,207
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.

88
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,322
Ohhh...!

89
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,932
Filthy toilet.
You're dead, fluff butt.

90
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,263
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.

91
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:40,164
- There's never been a bunny cop. Never.
- Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

92
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:09,826
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud
to announce that my mammal inclusion...

93
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,872
initiative, has produced its first
police academy graduate.

94
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:19,272
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

95
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:23,266
Judy Hopps.

96
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:26,896
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

97
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,570
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Thank you.

98
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:36,318
Judy, it is my great privilege to officially
assign you to the heart of Zootopia...

99
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,162
Precinct One.
City Center.

100
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:40,916
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

101
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,072
Congratulations Officer Hopps.

102
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,605
I won't let you down.

103
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,411
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.

104
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:49,355
You know, it's a real proud
day for us little guys.

105
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:50,893
Bellwether, make room, will you?

106
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,120
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

107
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:54,696
Officer Hopps, look here.

108
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,751
- We're real proud of you, Judy.
- Yeah, and scared too.

109
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:04,032
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

110
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:07,782
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away, such a big city.

111
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,496
Guys, I've been working for this
my whole life.

112
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:14,180
We know. And we're just a little
exited for you, but terrified.

113
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,806
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.

114
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,001
And also bears. We have
bears to fear, too.

115
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,388
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves.
- Wolves?

116
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,115
- Weasels.
- You played cribbage with a weasel once?

117
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,527
Yeah, he cheats like
there's no tomorrow.

118
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,221
You know what?
Pretty much all predators.

119
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:28,114
- And Zootopia is full of them.
- Oh, Stu.

120
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,316
And foxes are the worst.

121
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,792
Yeah, actually, your father
does have a point there.

122
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,467
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

123
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:39,922
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was
a jerk who happens to be a fox.

124
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,792
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

125
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,966
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely.
But just in case,

126
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,789
we made you a little
care package to take with you.

127
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,384
- I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

128
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,209
- Yeah, it's safe to have that.
- This is fox repellant.

129
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,652
The deterrent and the
repellant, that's all she needs.

130
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:54,913
- Check this out!
- Oh, for goodness sake!

131
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:56,687
She has no need for
a fox taser, Stu.

132
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,717
Oh, come on.
When is there not a need for a fox taser?

133
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,455
Well, okay, look, I will take this...
To make you stop talking.

134
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,493
Terrific!
Everyone wins!

135
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:07,054
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

136
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,941
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!

137
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,596
Mmm. I love you, guys.

138
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,175
Love you, too.

139
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:26,445
- Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
- Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

140
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:28,492
Bye everybody!

141
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:33,277
Bye Judy, I love you!
Bye!

142
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,264
Bye!

143
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:46,785

I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.

175
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:25,419
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.
Luxury apartments with charm.

176
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:29,283
Complementary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key!

177
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:30,810
Thank you.

178
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,100
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor!
- Yeah? Well, we're loud.

179
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,525
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

180
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,458
Greasy walls.

181
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,284
Rickety bed.

182
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,512
Crazy neighbors.

183
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,818
I love it!

184
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,973
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!

185
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:14,041
- Excuse me!
- Hmm?

186
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,821
Down here!

187
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,763
- Hi.
- O... M... Goodness!

188
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,556
They really did hire a bunny.

189
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,658
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

190
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:29,811
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny "cute",

191
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,478
but when other animals
do it, that's a little...

192
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:36,991
Ohhh. I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

193
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:41,315
The guy everyone thinks is just
a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

194
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,035
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.

195
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,460
Oh. You've actually got...
there's a...

196
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,719
- A what?
- In your neck. The fold.

197
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,854
- The... this...
- Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

198
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:55,184
Hehehe, I should get to roll call,
so which way do I...

199
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,350
- Oh, ball pen's over there to the left.
- Great. Thank you!

200
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:01,803
Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna
get eaten alive.

201
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:17,283
Hey! Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?

202
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,654
Attention!

203
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:30,092
All right. All right.
Everybody sit.

204
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:33,104
I've got three items
on the docket.

205
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:38,452
First, we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

206
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,129
Francine.
Happy birthday.

207
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:44,836
Oh.

208
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:48,486
Number two. There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce,

209
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,098
but I'm not going to because...
I don't care.

210
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:56,936
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

211
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:01,356
All predators. From a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

212
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:05,008
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.

213
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,621
This is priority number one.
Assignments.

214
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,973
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.

215
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,519
Your team take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

216
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:20,553
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.

217
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:25,252
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.

218
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:30,795
And finally, our first bunny,
Officer Hopps.

219
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,149
Parking duty.
Dismissed.

220
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:36,455
Parking duty?

221
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,918
Chief?
Chief Bogo?

222
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:43,768
Sir. You said there were
fourteen missing mammal cases.

223
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,728
- So?
- So I can handle one.

224
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:48,962
You probably forgot but, I was
top of my class at the academy.

225
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:51,518
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.

226
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,418
Sir, I'm not just
some token bunny.

227
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,648
Well then, writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

228
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:03,267
A 100 tickets. I'm not
gonna write 100 tickets.

229
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:07,274
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.

Boom!
Two hundred tickets before noon!

235
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,984
201.

236
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,219
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

237
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,564
Huh!

238
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,639
Hmm.

239
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,099
Where'd he go?

240
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:00,786
Listen. I know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours,

241
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,285
but I don't want any
trouble in here. So hit the road!

242
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:06,674
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir...

243
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:11,587
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop.
For my little boy.

244
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:18,323
You want the red,
or the blue, pal?

245
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,664
Oh.
I'm such a...

246
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,122
- Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy.
- What?

247
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,096
There aren't any fox ice cream joints
in your part of town?

248
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,726
No, no. There are, there are.
It's just, my boy,

249
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,301
this goofy little stinker,
he loves all things elephant.

250
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:37,632
He wants to be one
when he grows up.

251
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:39,776
Isn't that adorable?

252
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,238
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?

253
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:46,430
Look, you probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says

254
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:51,935
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!
So beat it.

255
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,357
You're holding up the line.

256
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:58,082
Hello.
Excuse me.

257
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:01,311
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, meter maid.

258
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,328
Actually, I'm an officer.

259
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,012
Just have a quick question.

260
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,161
Are your customers
aware they're getting

261
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,696
snot and mucus with
their cookies and cream?

262
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,298
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,789
Well. I don't wanna
cause you any trouble,

264
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:19,573
but I believe scooping ice cream with an
ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

265
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,782
Which is kind of a big deal.

266
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:25,555
Of course I could let you off with
a warning if you were to glove those trunks

267
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,827
and... I don't know...
finish selling this...

268
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:32,417
nice dad and his son a...
What was it?

269
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:34,870
A Jumbo-Pop.
Please.

270
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:37,231
A Jumbo-Pop.

271
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:42,248
- $15.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

272
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,363
Oh no, are you kidding me...

273
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:47,370
I don't have my wallet!

274
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,689
I'd lose my head if it
weren't attached to my neck.

275
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,600
That's the truth. Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.

276
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,649
Gotta be about the
worst birthday ever.

277
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:58,856
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.

278
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:05,872
Keep the change.

279
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:10,439
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

280
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:11,998
Oh, no.
My treat.

281
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:16,599
It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks
with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

282
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:22,222
I just want to say you're a great
dad and just a real articulate fella.

283
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:24,247
Oh.
Well, that is high praise.

284
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,223
It's rare that I find
someone so non-patronizing.

285
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,465
- Officer?
- Hopps. Mr..?

286
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,542
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.

287
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:35,023
And you, little guy. You wanna
be an elephant when you grow up?

288
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,980
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.

289
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,659
Anyone can be anything.

290
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:43,887
Ahh.
I tell him that all the time.

291
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,813
All right, here you go.
Two paws.

292
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:49,934
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile,
that's a happy birthday smile!

293
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,888
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

294
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,617
Toot-toot.

295
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:57,305
- Bye, now!
- Goodbye!

296
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:15,126
Oh.

Ciao.

308
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:54,781
Well, I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

309
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:55,952
You liar!

310
00:22:55,976 --> 00:23:00,474
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar. He is.

311
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,596
Hey!

312
00:23:04,597 --> 00:23:06,889
All right, Slick-Nick.
You're under arrest.

313
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,536
Really?
For what?

314
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:10,951
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit?

315
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:13,020
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines?

316
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:16,736
- False advertizing.
- Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

317
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,240
And I didn't falsely
advertize anything. Take care.

318
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,445
You told that mouse the
Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

319
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:24,168
That's right. Red wood.
With a space in the middle.

320
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,020
Wood that is red.

321
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,485
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

322
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,526
You're gonna wanna refrain
from calling me Carrots.

323
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,488
My bad. I just naturally
assumed you came...

324
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,671
from some little carrot-choked Podunk.
No?

325
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:39,158
Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

326
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:42,518
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

327
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,460
Naive little hick with good
grades and big ideas decides

328
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:47,787
"Hey, look at me, I'm
gonna move to Zootopia...

329
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:51,138
Where predators and prey live
in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

330
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,120
Only to find, whoopsie,
we don't all get along.

331
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:58,067
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

332
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:01,780
And whoopsie number three-sie,
no one cares about her or her dreams.

333
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:05,845
And soon enough those dreams die, and our
bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

334
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,561
living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go
back home

335
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:12,930
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become...

336
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:16,888
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer?

337
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:19,171
That sound about right?

338
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,972
Oh!

339
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:24,285
Be careful now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

340
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:30,344
Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can
or can't be. Especially not some...

341
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:35,288
jerk who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

342
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:36,937
All right, look.

343
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:40,806
Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking
they can be anything they want.

344
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,242
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.

345
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,691
Sly fox.
Dumb bunny.

346
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:49,235
I'm not a dumb bunny.

347
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,763
Right.
And that's not wet cement.

348
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,961
You'll never be a real cop.

349
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:57,715
You're a cute meter maid, though.

350
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:01,440
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.

CARROTS for ONE

Mom & Dad

357
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:55,841
- Oh, hey, it's my parents!
- Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

358
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:58,789
Hey there, Jude the Dude.
How was your first day on the force?

359
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:02,872
- It was real great!
- Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

360
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:08,206
Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

361
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:10,800
- I'm really making a difference.
- Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

362
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,562
- Look at that!
- Oh, my sweet heaven!

363
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,390
Judy, are you a meter maid?

364
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:16,918
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing..

365
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,867
- It's the safest job on the force!
- She's not a real cop!

366
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:22,076
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Glorious day!

367
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,279
Ho-ho, meter maid,
meter maid, meter maid!

368
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,207
- Dad! Dad!
- Meter maid!

369
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,066
You know what,
it's been a really long day, I should...

370
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,756
- You get some rest.
- Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

371
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:34,407
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

372
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,519
Hey, bunny!
Turn down that depressing music!

373
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,659
Leave the meter maid alone,
didn't you hear her conversation?

374
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,869
- She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!

375
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,214
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

376
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:51,897
- You shut up!
- Tomorrow is another day.

377
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:54,327
Yeah, but it might be worse!

378
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:58,637
I was 30 seconds over!

379
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:01,917
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.

380
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,696
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.

381
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,012
Uncool rabbit, my tax dollars
pay your salary.

382
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,826
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

383
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:17,091
Hey, you!
Bunny!

384
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:21,031
Sir, if you have a grievance you may
contest recitation in traffic court.

385
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:23,005
What are you talking about?!
My shop!

386
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,236
It was just robbed!
Look, he's getting away!

387
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,779
Well, are you a cop or not?

388
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:31,367
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Don't worry, sir, I got this!

389
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,005
- Stop in the name of the law!
- Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!

390
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,047
Coming through!

391
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,055
This is officer McHorn.
We got a 10-31.

392
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,277
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!

393
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,146
Woo-hoo!

394
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,911
<font color="#ff8080">LITTLE
RODENTIA</font>

395
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,058
- Ah!
- Ahh!

396
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:05,784
Ha ha ha.

397
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,644
You!
Hey!

398
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:13,868
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!

399
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:16,205
Stop!

400
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,355
Ahhhh!

401
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,049
Oh.

402
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:45,772
Sorry! Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

403
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,959
Yahhh!

404
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,324
Bon voyage, flatfoot!

405
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,446
Huh!

406
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,915
- Hey! Stop right there!
- Have a donut, coppa!

407
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,776
Oh my god, did you see those
leopard print jeggings?

408
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,206
- Ah!
- Ah!

409
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:19,063
Oh!

410
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,752
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.

411
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:27,536
Heheheheh.
Come to papa!

412
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,020
Okay. You're gonna have
to be patient and wait in line

413
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:35,029
just like everyone else,
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

414
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:45,193
- I popped the weasel!
- Hopps!

415
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:52,304
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents...

416
00:29:52,305 --> 00:29:57,557
But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

417
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,889
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

418
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,315
Those are a crocus variety called
<i>midnicampum holicithias.</i>

419
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,893
They're a class C botanical, sir.

420
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:07,401
Well, I grew up in a family where plant
husbandry was kind of a thing...

421
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:11,582
- Shut your tiny mouth now!
- Sir, I got the bad guy.

422
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:12,854
That's my job.

423
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:16,208
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!

424
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:19,098
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's
here to see you again.

425
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:21,069
- Not now.
- Okay, I just need to know if you want to...

426
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,312
- take it this time she seems really upset...
- Not now!

427
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:25,408
Sir. I don't wanna
be a meter maid,

428
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,867
I wanna be a real cop.

429
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:30,610
Do you think the mayor
asked what I wanted...

430
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:32,913
- when he assigned you to me?
- But, sir...

431
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:37,925
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you
sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...

432
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:43,396
magically come true!
So let it go.

433
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,687
Chief Bogo, please!
Five minutes of your time, please.

434
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,548
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her,
she's super slippery.

435
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,012
I gotta go sit down.

436
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:55,024
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

437
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:57,402
My husband has been
missing for ten days.

438
00:30:57,426 --> 00:30:59,830
- His name is Emmitt Otterton.
- Yes. I know.

439
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:03,772
He's a florist.
We have 2 beautiful children.

440
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,691
He would never just disappear.

441
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:08,468
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.

442
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:12,097
Please. There's gotta be somebody
to find my Emmitt.

443
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:14,952
- Mrs. Otterton.
- I will find him.

444
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:21,066
Oh. Thank you!
Bless you, bless you, little bunny!

445
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,947
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.

446
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:29,270
Bring him home to me and my babies.
Please.

447
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,357
Mrs. Otterton.
Please wait out here.

448
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,421
Of course.
Oh, thank you both so much!

449
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:34,794
One second.

450
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,709
- You're fired.
- What? Why?

451
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,340
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open
this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter

452
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:49,223
you're a former meter maid with delusion
of grandeur, who will not be taking the case.

453
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,785
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case!

454
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,274
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!

455
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:56,547
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

456
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:58,864
Mayor Lionheart is
just gonna be so jazzed!

457
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:00,949
No, let's not tell
the mayor just yet.

458
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:03,184
And I sent it, and it is done,
so I did do that.

459
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,390
All right, well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.

460
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,010
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

461
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:10,361
- Like glue.
- Good one.

462
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:12,588
Just call me if you ever
need anything. Okay?

463
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:16,020
You've always got a friend at
City Hall, Judy. All right! Bye-bye!

464
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:17,561
Thank you, ma'am!

465
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:24,695
I will give you 48 hours.

466
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,614
Yes!

467
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:33,170
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
But.. You strike out, you resign.

468
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,524
Okay. Deal.

469
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:42,450
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

470
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:46,144
Here you go.
One missing otter.

471
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,722
- That's it?
- Yikes!

472
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,745
That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen. Leads, none.

473
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,757
Witnesses, none. And you're not in the
computer system yet, so...

474
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:57,055
Resources, none!
Ha ha!

475
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,462
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your
career on cracking this one.

476
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,437
Okay.
Last known sighting.

477
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:10,013
Can I just borrow?
Thank you.

478
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:15,641
- Pawpsicle?
- The murder weapon!

479
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:19,370
- "Get your Pawpsicle"...
- Yeah! Cause that...

480
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:21,298
 What does that mean?

481
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:25,915
It means I have a lead.

482
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:34,704
- Hi! Hello! It's me again!
- Hey! It's officer toot-toot.

483
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:37,290
Hoo...No.
Actually it's Officer Hopps,

484
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:39,745
and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

485
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,497
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

486
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,391
It wasn't me.

487
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:49,327
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.

488
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:53,780
This is important, sir. I think your
ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait.

489
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:57,178
Ha! I make 200 bucks
a day, fluff.

490
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,508
365 days a year,
since I was 12.

491
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:03,461
- And time is money. Hop along.
- Please just look at the picture.

492
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:05,954
You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right?

493
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:07,973
- Do you know him?
- I know everybody.

494
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:09,741
And I also know that somewhere

495
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:13,437
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,
so why don't you get back to your box?

496
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,833
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

497
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,225
- Did you just boot my stroller?
- Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

498
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:23,729
Ha. For what? Hurting
your feelings?

499
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,601
Felony tax evasion.

500
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:30,143
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12...

501
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:35,514
that's two decades, so times twenty, which is
1,460,000, I think.

502
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:38,892
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

503
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:43,747
Anyway, according to your tax forms,
you reported, let me see here, zero!

504
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:48,027
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

505
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,973
- 5 years jail time.
- Well, it's my word against yours.

506
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:57,091
<i>200 bucks a day, fluff,
365 days a year, since I was twelve.</i>

507
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:58,927
Actually it's your
word against yours.

508
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:00,587
And if you want this pen
you're going to help me

509
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,936
find this poor missing otter,
or the only place

510
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,340
you'll be selling Pawpsicles
is the prison cafeteria.

511
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,228
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

512
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:14,355
She hustled you.
Ehahaha...

513
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:18,672
She hustled you good!
You're a cop now, Nick.

514
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:21,312
You're gonna need one of these.

515
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:24,572
Have fun working with the fuzz!

516
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:27,752
Start talking.

517
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:31,419
I don't know where he is,
I only saw where he went.

518
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,754
Great, let's go!

519
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:37,276
It's not exactly a place
for a cute little bunny.

520
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,881
- Don't call me cute, get in the car.
- Okay. You're the boss.

521
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:02,092
Hi.
I'm...

522
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:07,797
Hello? Hello?
Hello?

523
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:11,424
Hello!
My name is...

524
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:14,291
You know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there.

525
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,801
Cause we're all good on
bunny scout cookies.

526
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:19,037
Uh, no.

527
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:23,198
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

528
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:27,814
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.
He may have frequented this establishment?

529
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:34,563
Yeah, old Emmitt!

530
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,069
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.

531
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:41,749
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.

532
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,670
Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate
that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

533
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:49,699
- Oh! You are naked..
- Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

534
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:55,010
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.

535
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:59,253
Nangi's just on the other side
of the pleasure pool.

536
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:11,605
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

537
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,775
Yes, there is.

538
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,994
Boy, that's the spirit.

539
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:22,182
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.
But you know what I say is weird?

540
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:26,415
Clothes on animals!
Here we go!

541
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:30,900
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

542
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:35,487
Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

543
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:36,812
- Who?
- Eh.

544
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:40,905
Emmitt Otterton. Been coming
to your yoga class for like six years.

545
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,513
I have no memory
of this beaver.

546
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,130
He's an otter, actually.

547
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,390
He was here a couple of
Wednesdays ago. Remember?

548
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,298
No.

549
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:50,244
Yeah, he was wearing a green
cable knit sweater vest,

550
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:56,126
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

551
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,764
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

552
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:04,064
Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this
big old white car with a silver trim.

553
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:08,117
Needed a tune up. The third cylinder
wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

554
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,172
No.

555
00:38:09,196 --> 00:38:13,005
Eh. You didn't happen to catch
the licence plate number?

556
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:19,555
- Did you?
- Oh, for sure. It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

557
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:22,105
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info.
Thank you.

558
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:29,185
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

559
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:35,857
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

560
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,909
I will take that pen
and bid you adieu.

561
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:40,852
The plate.
I can't run a plate.

562
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:43,152
Oomf.
I'm not in the system yet.

563
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:47,027
- Give me the pen, please.
- What was it you said?

564
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,936
Any moron can run a plate?

565
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,204
Gosh, if only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

566
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:54,820
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

567
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,793
You can't keep me
on the hook forever.

568
00:38:56,817 --> 00:39:01,164
Not forever. Well, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case.

569
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:04,012
So can you run the plate or not?

570
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:09,642
Actually, I just remembered,
I have a pal at the DMV.

571
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:12,589
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
You need something done, he's on it.

572
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,359
I hope so. We are really fighting the clock
and every minute counts.

573
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:20,426
Wait.
They're all sloths?

574
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:48,818
You said this was
going to be quick!

575
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:50,553
What, are you saying just
because he's a sloth

576
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:54,519
he can't be fast? I thought in
Zootopia anyone could be anything.

577
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,748
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

578
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:04,752
Nice to... see you... too.

579
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:06,930
Hey, Flash, I'd love
you to meet my friend.

580
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,702
Ah...Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

581
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:12,379
Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are you?

582
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,153
I am...

583
00:40:14,154 --> 00:40:17,564
doing... just..

584
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:23,381
- Fine?
- as well.. as..  I can.. be...

585
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,758
- What...
- Hang in there.

586
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:28,090
- can I... do...
- Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

587
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,396
- for you...
- Well, I was hoping you could...

588
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:32,236
...today?

589
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:39,553
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.

590
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:44,586
- Sure... What's the... plate...
- 2-9-T...

591
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:49,822
- Number?
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

592
00:40:57,323 --> 00:41:03,900
- 2... 9...
- T-H-D-0-3.

593
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:08,386
- T...
- H-D-0-3.

594
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:12,165
- H...
- D-0-3.

595
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,767
- D...
- Mm-hm. 0-3.

596
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:21,083
- 0...
- 3!

597
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:25,716
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke?
- No!

598
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,876
- Sure.
- Mmm!

599
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,431
What do you call a
three-humped camel?

600
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:38,785
I don't know.
What do you call...

601
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:44,006
-  Three-humped camel.
- a three-humped... camel?

602
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,084
Pregnant.
Ha ha ha ha...

603
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,810
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!
Can we please just focus on the task?

604
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,219
- Hey...
- Wait, wait!

605
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,645
- Priscilla!
- Oh, no!

606
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,939
- Yes... Flash?
- What... do..

607
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,277
- No...
- you call...

608
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,590
A three-humped camel?

609
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:20,074
- Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just...
- - three... humped...

610
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:34,079
- Here... you...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!

611
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,795
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- ...go.

612
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,610
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

613
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,978
A limo took Otterton! And
the limo's in Tundratown!

614
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:42,209
It's in Tundratown!

615
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:43,971
Way to hustle, bud. I love you.
I owe you.

616
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:47,471
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...
It's night?!

617
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,234
Closed.
Great.

618
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:54,169
Mm. And I will betcha
you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

619
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:57,946
- Darn it. It's a bummer.
- You wasted the day on purpose.

620
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,197
Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never
impede your pretend investigation.

621
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:07,848
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

622
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:10,340
Well, then they should have
gotten a real cop to find him.

623
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:12,972
What is your problem? Does
seeing me fail somehow make

624
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,635
you feel better about your
own sad, miserable life?

625
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,727
It does, 100%.

626
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:23,819
Now, since you're sans warrant.
I guess we're done?

627
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:28,810
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

628
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:37,305
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.

629
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:40,092
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.

630
00:43:40,093 --> 00:43:43,615
- I wish I could have helped more.
- The thing is, you don't need...

631
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:46,123
a warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

632
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:51,879
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty! Come on!

633
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:56,844
2-9-T-H-D-0-3!
This is it!

634
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:06,768
Polar bear fur.

635
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,458
- Oh my God!
- What? What?

636
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:12,949
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

637
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:17,476
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?

638
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:26,862
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

639
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:33,041
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?

640
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:35,591
- No.
- Oh, wait. Look!

641
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,909
This is him. Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.

642
00:44:42,352 --> 00:44:44,665
What do you think happened?

643
00:44:47,174 --> 00:44:50,380
Oh no, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur...

644
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:54,279
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

645
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,175
- What? Whose car is it?
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

646
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,781
They call him Mr. Big, and he does not
like me. So we gotta go!

647
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,618
I'm not leaving,
this is a crime scene.

648
00:45:02,642 --> 00:45:04,070
Well, it's gonna be an
even bigger crime scene...

649
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:07,302
if Mr. Big finds me here,
so we're leaving right now.

650
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:11,897
Raymond! And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

651
00:45:11,898 --> 00:45:15,830
And speaking of no see,
how about you forget you saw me?

652
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:17,728
Huh?
For old times sake?

653
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:19,519
That's a no..

654
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:34,576
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

655
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:38,006
I, uh... I may have sold him
a very expensive wall rug

656
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:44,348
that was made from the fur
of a skunk's butt.

657
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:47,825
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

658
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:03,383
- Is that Mr. Big?
- No.

659
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:07,216
- What about him? Is that him?
- No.

660
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:12,758
- That's gotta be him.
- Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking!

661
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:20,775
Huh.

662
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:23,141
Mr. Big, sir,
this is a simple misunder...

663
00:46:23,164 --> 00:46:24,370
Hmmph.

664
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:25,583
Yeah.

665
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:30,216
This is a simple misunderstanding.

666
00:46:30,723 --> 00:46:33,957
You come here unannounced on the
day my daughter is to be married.

667
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:36,996
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

668
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:40,106
Point is, I did not know
that it was your car,

669
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,403
and I certainly did not know about
your daughter's wedding!

670
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,815
I trusted you, Nicky.

671
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:47,770
I welcomed you into my home.

672
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,628
We broke bread together.

673
00:46:49,628 --> 00:46:52,094
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

674
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:54,697
And how did you repay my generosity?

675
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:58,693
With a rug
made from the butt of a skunk.

676
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,582
A skunk-butt rug.

677
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,216
You disrespected me.

678
00:47:02,217 --> 00:47:04,138
You disrespected my grandmama,

679
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,275
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

680
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:12,114
I told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are.

681
00:47:12,115 --> 00:47:14,549
Snooping around with this...

682
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:17,079
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?

683
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,097
- Sir, I am a co...
- Mime!

684
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:22,149
She's a mime.
This mime can not speak.

685
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,607
- You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.

686
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,803
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car!

687
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,567
So intimidate me all you want,
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

688
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:35,740
if it's the last thing I do.

689
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:39,842
Hmm.
Then I have only one request.

690
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,458
Say hello to Grandmama.

691
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:43,794
Ice 'em!

692
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:46,357
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

693
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:47,414
And you never will.

694
00:47:47,415 --> 00:47:49,500
Please!
No, no, no, no!

695
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:51,674
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!

696
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:56,015
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

697
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:00,708
Ah! What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!

698
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:03,366
I have to, baby,
daddy has to.

699
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,062
- Ice 'em.
- No, no, no!

700
00:48:05,086 --> 00:48:06,697
Wait, wait!

701
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:11,222
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut!

702
00:48:11,246 --> 00:48:13,924
- This bunny?
- Yeah. Hi!

703
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:18,390
- Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.

704
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,423
Put them down.

705
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:26,769
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.

706
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:31,161
I will take your kindness,
and pay it forward.

707
00:48:49,155 --> 00:48:50,738
Hmm.

708
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:02,870
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.

709
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:05,781
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

710
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:09,213
That's why I sent that
car to pick him up.

711
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,627
But he never arrived.

712
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:13,036
Because he was attacked.

713
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:15,791
No, he attacked.

714
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,297
Otterton?

715
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:18,579
Otterton.

716
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:21,703
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car.

717
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:26,821
Scared my driver half to death.
And disappeared into the night.

718
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:29,631
But he's a sweet little otter.

719
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:38,101
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down we are still animals.

720
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,578
You wanna find Otterton, talk to
the driver of the car.

721
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:46,959
His name is Manchas.
Lives in the Rainforest District.

722
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,596
Only he can tell you more.

723
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,679
Mr. Manchas?

724
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,568
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

725
00:49:56,592 --> 00:50:00,252
We just wanna know what happened
to Emmitt Otterton.

726
00:50:04,482 --> 00:50:09,374
You should be asking
what happened to me.

727
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:14,868
- Whoa. A teensy otter did that?
- What happened?

728
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:17,487
He was an animal.

729
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:21,471
Down on all fours.

730
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:26,792
He was a savage!

731
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:40,389
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

732
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,272
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

733
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,932
So you know about
the Night Howlers too?

734
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:50,425
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly

735
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:53,273
what we are here
to talk about. Right?

736
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:58,128
Yes, so you just open the
door and tell us what you know,

737
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:00,194
and we will tell you what we know.

738
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:01,654
Okay?

739
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:04,040
Okay.

740
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:07,225
Clever fox.

741
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:13,467
Mr. Manchas?

742
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,544
Are you okay?

743
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:24,905
Run. Run!

744
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:31,897
- What is wrong with him?!
- I don't know!

745
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:37,632
Jump!

746
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:41,190
Come on!

747
00:51:45,524 --> 00:51:47,014
Head down!

748
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,092
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

749
00:51:50,093 --> 00:51:53,398
Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest
singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

750
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:54,796
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.

751
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,466
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?

752
00:51:56,467 --> 00:52:00,594
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

753
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:04,573
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

754
00:52:04,597 --> 00:52:06,226
It's not, it's just a new app.

755
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,372
- Hold on a second.
- Clawhauser!

756
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:09,489
Clawhauser, listen to me.

757
00:52:09,513 --> 00:52:12,140
We have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

758
00:52:12,164 --> 00:52:14,917
- Vine and Tujunga!
- It's Tu-hunga!

759
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:17,734
Okay, we're sending backup!

760
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:23,003
Look, over there!
Head for the sky-trans!

761
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,616
Get in.
Carrots? Carrots!

762
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:35,799
Go!

763
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,463
Buddy, one predator to another.

764
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:49,942
Now I can tell you're a little tense,
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

765
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:58,810
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

766
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:00,635
- I'm gonna let go!
- You're gonna to what?

767
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:03,178
One, two...

768
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:11,945
Carrots, you saved my life.

769
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:16,444
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...

770
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:33,972
Well, this should be good.

771
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:38,041
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,
but it's way bigger.

772
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:40,315
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

773
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:43,133
I believe he and this jaguar,
they...

774
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:44,408
They went savage, sir.

775
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:48,644
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.
Animals don't go savage.

776
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,598
I thought so too.

777
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,999
Till I saw this.

778
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:55,371
What?

779
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:56,746
He was right here!

780
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,958
The savage jaguar?

781
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:01,296
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

782
00:54:01,297 --> 00:54:06,758
Or maybe any agressive predator
looks savage to rabbits?

783
00:54:06,782 --> 00:54:07,765
Let's go!

784
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:08,760
Wait! Sir!

785
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:11,161
I'm not the only one who saw him.

786
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:14,614
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

787
00:54:14,638 --> 00:54:16,009
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

788
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:19,959
Two days to find the otter,
or you quit.

789
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:22,639
That was the deal.

790
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:24,865
Badge.

791
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,443
- But, sir, we had...
- Badge!

792
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:38,172
Uh, no.

793
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:43,867
- What did you say, fox?
- Sorry, what I said was "no...".

794
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,291
She will not be giving you that badge.

795
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:50,301
Look, you gave her a clown vest,
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

796
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:54,278
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

797
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:56,648
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.

798
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:59,011
None of you guys were gonna help her,
were you?

799
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:00,417
Here's the thing, chief.

800
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:04,006
You gave her the 48 hours,
so technically we still have...

801
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,636
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

802
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:13,049
So if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

803
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,813
Good day.

804
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:22,184
Officer Hopps.

805
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,374
Thank you.

806
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,952
Never let them see that they get to you.

807
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:50,334
So...

808
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:52,833
Things do get to you?

809
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:54,303
I mean not, not anymore.

810
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:59,593
But I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

811
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,694
- Har har.
- No, it's true.

812
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:06,395
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

813
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:10,707
And all I wanted to do was join
the Junior Ranger Scouts.

814
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:15,150
So my mom scaped together enough money
to buy me a brand new uniform.

815
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,003
Because, by god, I
was gonna fit in.

816
00:56:18,027 --> 00:56:22,777
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop, the only fox.

817
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:25,134
I was gonna be part of a pack.

818
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:28,400
- Ready for initiation?
- Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

819
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:30,410
I was so proud.

820
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:33,091
Okay. Now raise your right
paw, and deliver the oath.

821
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:41,687
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

822
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,057
Even though you're a fox?

823
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:48,973
What?

824
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,712
No, no! What did I
do wrong, you guys?

825
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:56,994
No, please! What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

826
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,812
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle?

827
00:57:00,836 --> 00:57:03,488
You're even dumber than you look.

828
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,592
Is he gonna cry?

829
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:24,889
I learned two things that day.

830
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:26,653
One:

831
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:30,210
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.

832
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:33,508
And two?

833
00:57:33,509 --> 00:57:38,601
If the world's only gonna see
a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

834
00:57:38,602 --> 00:57:41,644
There's no point in trying
to be anything else.

835
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:45,624
Nick, you are so much more than that.

836
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:50,924
Boy, look at that
traffic down there.

837
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:52,522
How about we go up to
Chuck in traffic central?

838
00:57:52,546 --> 00:57:55,331
Chuck, how are things looking
on the jam cams?

839
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:57,755
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

840
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,934
The jam cams...

841
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,144
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, no no!

842
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:07,078
There are traffic cameras everywhere.
All over the canopy!

843
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,122
- Whatever happened to that jaguar...
- The traffic cameras would have caught it!

844
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:12,971
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

845
00:58:12,995 --> 00:58:16,531
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before,

846
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:19,924
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is
gonna let you into it now.

847
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:24,404
No. But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

848
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:28,199
Eh. Sir, if we could just review
these very important billings.

849
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,471
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir.

850
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:34,048
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,
just take care of it!

851
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:36,543
Please.
And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

852
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:38,338
Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do
have a meeting with

853
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:41,096
Herds and Gradings.
Sir, that's just, oh...

854
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,490
Oh, mutton chops.

855
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:48,687
Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
we need your help.

856
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:50,031
OFFICE OF THE
ASSISTANT
MAYOR
(PLEASE KNOCK!)

857
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,653
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

858
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:02,092
- So fluffy!
- Hey!

859
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:05,866
- Sheep never let me get this close!
- You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

860
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,764
- It's like cotton candy.
- Stop it!

861
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,252
Where to?

862
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:12,094
Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict.
Vine and Tujunga.

863
00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:14,378
There.
Traffic cams for the whole city.

864
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:16,400
This is so exiting actually.
I mean, well, you know.

865
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:18,414
I never get to do
anything this important.

866
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:20,496
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

867
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:23,154
Oh.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

868
00:59:23,178 --> 00:59:25,566
I think Mayor Lionheart just
wanted the sheep vote.

869
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,272
But he did give me that nice mug.

870
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,869
WORLD'S GREATEST
ASSISTANT MAYOR (Written with marker)
DAD (Crossed out)

871
00:59:28,893 --> 00:59:30,842
Feels good to be appreciated.

872
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:31,942
Smellwether!

873
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:34,952
Ah.
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

874
00:59:34,976 --> 00:59:38,136
I called him Lionfart once,
he did not care for that.

875
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,563
Let me tell you, it was
not a good day for me.

876
00:59:39,587 --> 00:59:41,873
- Yes, sir.
- I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

877
00:59:41,897 --> 00:59:45,230
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.

878
00:59:45,254 --> 00:59:47,604
It was really nice for me to be...

879
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:50,028
While we're young, Smellwether.

880
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,455
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?

881
00:59:53,479 --> 00:59:55,481
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams..

882
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:57,047
Tujunga.... Tujunga....

883
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,671
We're in.

884
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:08,329
- Who are these guys?
- Eh. Timberwolves.

885
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:10,753
Look at these dum-dums.

886
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:13,507
Huh!

887
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:16,297
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

888
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:17,258
And there it is.

889
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:20,643
I mean, what is it with wolves
and the howling, it's...?

890
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,655
Howlings!
Night Howlers!

891
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:26,377
That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers!

892
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:29,258
- If they took Manchas..
- I bet they took Otterton too.

893
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:32,028
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.

894
01:00:38,432 --> 01:00:39,622
Wait, where'd they go?

895
01:00:39,646 --> 01:00:43,576
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal,

896
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,568
which I never have, I would use the
maintenance tunnel 6B.

897
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:50,026
Which would put them out...
right there.

898
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,494
Well, look at you, junior detective.

899
01:00:53,518 --> 01:00:57,682
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

900
01:00:57,683 --> 01:00:59,733
Eh. How dare you.

901
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:02,226
Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass.

902
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,352
South canyon.

903
01:01:03,353 --> 01:01:05,242
Mm-hm.
They're heading out of town.

904
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:07,670
Where does that road go?

905
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:11,560
<font color="#80bfff">[ CLIFFSIDE ]</font>

906
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:51,785
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl!

907
01:01:51,785 --> 01:01:53,604
I didn't start it.

908
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,579
Come on.

909
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:11,551
You are a clever bunny.

910
01:02:26,637 --> 01:02:30,246
It looks like this was a hospital.

911
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,413
You know, after you,
you're the cop.

912
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:53,986
Okay, all clear.

913
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,423
Ha.
All this equipment is brand new.

914
01:03:02,322 --> 01:03:04,269
Carrots.

915
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:07,258
Claw marks.

916
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:10,742
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
What kind of...

917
01:03:28,396 --> 01:03:30,635
Mr. Manchas.

918
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:43,000
It's him!
We found our otter.

919
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:46,621
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

920
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,479
Your wife sent me to find you.

921
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,536
We're gonna get you out of here now.

922
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,644
Or not.

923
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,174
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

924
01:03:55,175 --> 01:03:57,447
11, 12, 13, 14.

925
01:03:57,471 --> 01:04:00,513
Not including Manchas,
it's... it's fourteen.

926
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:03,397
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

927
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:04,751
They're all here...

928
01:04:04,752 --> 01:04:08,614
All the missing mammals are right here.
Huh!

929
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:14,453
Enough!

930
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:17,025
I don't want excuses, doctor,
I want answers.

931
01:04:17,026 --> 01:04:20,228
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.

932
01:04:20,252 --> 01:04:21,285
Really?

933
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:24,705
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here
who've gone off the rails crazy,

934
01:04:24,729 --> 01:04:26,597
And you can't tell me why.

935
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:29,265
Now I'd call that awfully far
from doing everything!

936
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:32,373
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

937
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:34,317
What?
What do you mean "biology"?

938
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:36,968
The only animals going savage are predators.

939
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:40,429
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

940
01:04:40,453 --> 01:04:42,834
Hm, great idea.
Tell the public.

941
01:04:42,858 --> 01:04:47,684
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor who is a lion?!

942
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:50,319
- I'll be ruined!
- Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

943
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:56,230
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we
are going to keep it that way.

944
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:57,407
Oh, no!

945
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,944
- Someone's here.
- Sir, you need to go. Now.

946
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:02,267
Security, sweep the area.

947
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:10,771
Great, we're dead.

948
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:13,877
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead.
You're dead. Everybody's dead.

949
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:15,101
- Can you swim?
- What?

950
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,333
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

951
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,669
Aaahhhh!

952
01:05:36,827 --> 01:05:40,855
Carrots!
Hopps! Judy!

953
01:05:41,214 --> 01:05:43,416
We gotta tell Bogo!

954
01:05:43,893 --> 01:05:48,472
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

955
01:05:50,334 --> 01:05:52,068
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now.

956
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:54,205
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No!

957
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:57,200
I'm Gazelle, and you
are one hot dancer.

958
01:05:57,224 --> 01:06:01,434
You have the app too?
Ooohhh...  Chief!

959
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,397
Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

960
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,406
Oh! Yes, of course.
About that, sir.

961
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,622
Officer Hopps just called,
she found all of them.

962
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,046
Wow, I'm impressed.

963
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:16,805
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you...

964
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:19,802
You don't understand,
I was trying to protect the city!

965
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:21,886
You were just trying
to protect your job.

966
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,012
No, listen. We still don't
know why this is happening.

967
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:26,926
It could destroy Zootopia.

968
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,652
You have the right
to remain silent.

969
01:06:28,676 --> 01:06:31,810
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

970
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,458
Ladies and gentlemammals,

971
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:42,050
14 mammals went missing and
all 14 have been found...

972
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:46,091
by our newest recruit,
who will speak to you in a moment.

973
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:50,071
- I'm so nervous.
- Okay, press conference 101.

974
01:06:50,071 --> 01:06:52,685
You wanna look smart, answer their question
with your own question

975
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,842
and then answer that question.

976
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:59,016
Like this: "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.
What can you tell us about the case?"

977
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:02,691
"Well, was this a tough case?
Yes, yes it was. You see?"

978
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:04,700
You should be
up there with me.

979
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:06,058
We did this together.

980
01:07:06,082 --> 01:07:09,579
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

981
01:07:09,603 --> 01:07:11,604
Funny you should say that.

982
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:18,784
Because, well, I've been thinking.
It would be nice to have a partner.

983
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:25,832
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

984
01:07:30,669 --> 01:07:33,401
Officer Hopps.
It's time.

985
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:42,131
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer
who cracked the case.

986
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:44,545
Officer Judy Hopps.

987
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:49,275
Yes?

988
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,996
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

989
01:07:50,997 --> 01:07:55,935
Well, the animals in question...
Emm.

990
01:07:58,264 --> 01:08:03,582
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.

991
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:05,728
Okay, so what is the connection?

992
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:09,873
Oh. All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

993
01:08:09,897 --> 01:08:12,714
So predators are the
only ones going savage?

994
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:14,835
That is accu..
Yes, that is accurate, yes.

995
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:18,715
- Why? Why is this happening?
- We still don't know.

996
01:08:19,192 --> 01:08:24,202
But, emm.
It may have something to do with biology.

997
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:25,856
What do you mean, biology?

998
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,510
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.

999
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:34,098
In their DNA,
can you elaborate on that, please?

1000
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:38,752
Yes. What I mean is
thousands of years ago

1001
01:08:38,776 --> 01:08:45,929
Eh, predators survived through their...
agressive hunting instincts.

1002
01:08:45,953 --> 01:08:51,691
For whatever reason, they seem to be
reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

1003
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,400
Officer Hopps, could
it happen again?

1004
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,538
It is possible.
So, we must be vigilant.

1005
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:04,798
And we at the ZPD are prepered
and are here to protect you.

1006
01:09:04,163 --> 01:09:06,983
- Will more mammals go savage?
- What is being done to protect us?

1007
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,807
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1008
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:10,826
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1009
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:13,973
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.

1010
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,154
- Was I okay?
- Oh, you did fine.

1011
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:21,753
That went so fast, I
didn't get a chance to

1012
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:23,545
mention you or say anything
about how we...

1013
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:26,420
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1014
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:27,607
What do you mean?

1015
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:30,310
"Clearly there's a
biological component?"

1016
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:35,102
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1017
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:36,850
Are you serious?

1018
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,245
I just stated the
facts of the case.

1019
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:41,732
I mean, it's not like a
bunny could go savage.

1020
01:09:41,756 --> 01:09:43,847
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

1021
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:47,928
- Nick, stop it, you're not like them.
- Oh, there's a 'them' now?

1022
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:50,861
You know what I mean,
you're not that kind of predator.

1023
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:52,395
The kind that needs
to be muzzled?

1024
01:09:52,419 --> 01:09:56,627
The kind that makes you think you need
to carry around fox repellant?

1025
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:59,862
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that
little item the first time we met.

1026
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,609
Look. Let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1027
01:10:04,797 --> 01:10:06,964
Do you think I might go nuts?

1028
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:12,780
You think I might go savage?
You think I might try to eat you?

1029
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:13,919
Huh!

1030
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:17,946
I knew it, huh.

1031
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:22,190
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh?

1032
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:26,152
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1033
01:10:31,033 --> 01:10:33,415
No, Nick.
Nick!

1034
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:35,747
Officer Hopps, were you just
threatened by that predator?

1035
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:37,349
No, he's my friend.

1036
01:10:37,373 --> 01:10:39,325
We can't even trust our own friends?

1037
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:41,089
That is not what I said.
Please.

1038
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,971
- Are we safe?
- Have any other foxes gone savage?

1039
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:48,391
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition.

1040
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:50,891
The victim of a mauling by
a savage polar bear.

1041
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:55,386
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1042
01:10:55,410 --> 01:11:00,103
Judy Hopps connected the violence
to traditionally predatory animals.

1043
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:04,939
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by
popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1044
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:08,715
- Go back to the forest, predator!
- I am from the savannah.

1045
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,814
Zootopia is a unique place.

1046
01:11:10,815 --> 01:11:16,813
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.
Where we celebrate our differences.

1047
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:19,366
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1048
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,900
The Zootopia I know
is better than this.

1049
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:25,645
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1050
01:11:29,907 --> 01:11:32,702
We don't know why these
attacks keep happening.

1051
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:37,170
But it's irresponsible to label all
predators as savages.

1052
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,119
It's not my Emmitt.

1053
01:11:47,415 --> 01:11:49,978
We cannot let fear divide us.

1054
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:54,840
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1055
01:11:57,134 --> 01:12:00,039
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.

1056
01:12:00,063 --> 01:12:02,844
The mayor?
Why?

1057
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:05,410
It would seem you've arrived.

1058
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:11,892
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?

1059
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:16,558
Uh. They thought it would be
better if a predator

1060
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,945
such as myself wasn't the first face
that you see

1061
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,132
when you walk into the ZPD.

1062
01:12:22,156 --> 01:12:23,550
What?

1063
01:12:23,593 --> 01:12:27,700
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1064
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:29,797
It's by the boiler.

1065
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,927
Hopps1

1066
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:38,227
<font color="#ffaa82">Integrity
Honesty
Bravery</font>

1067
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:41,027
Emm.
I don't understand.

1068
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:43,621
Our city is 90% prey, Judy,

1069
01:12:43,645 --> 01:12:47,145
and right now
they're just really scared.

1070
01:12:47,169 --> 01:12:50,128
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.

1071
01:12:50,152 --> 01:12:56,992
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1072
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:06,117
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.

1073
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:09,784
I came here to make the world
a better place. But...

1074
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:11,596
... I think I broke it.

1075
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,462
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1076
01:13:15,486 --> 01:13:19,696
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1077
01:13:20,603 --> 01:13:22,612
Like you.

1078
01:13:23,557 --> 01:13:31,702
With all due respect, sir,
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1079
01:13:31,726 --> 01:13:36,202
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.

1080
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,288
- I don't deserve this badge.
- Hopps.

1081
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:46,300
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.

1082
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,574
It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid.

1083
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:50,662
You can't quit.

1084
01:13:50,686 --> 01:13:53,086
Thank you for the opportunity.

1085
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:14,038
A dozen carrots.
Have a nice day.

1086
01:14:14,062 --> 01:14:15,322
Come on.

1087
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:23,367
Hey there, Jude.
Jude the Dude.

1088
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:26,473
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1089
01:14:26,497 --> 01:14:30,184
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1090
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:33,088
Why did I think I could
make a difference?

1091
01:14:33,112 --> 01:14:36,824
- Because you're a trier, that's why.
- You've always been a trier.

1092
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,577
Oh, I tried.

1093
01:14:38,578 --> 01:14:42,708
And it made life so much worse
for so many innocent predators.

1094
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:46,376
Oh, not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1095
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,396
Is that Gideon Grey?

1096
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,530
Yeah, it sure is.
We work with him now.

1097
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,849
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it,

1098
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,827
- had you not opened our minds.
- That's right.

1099
01:14:56,851 --> 01:15:00,539
I mean, kid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1100
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:06,169
That's...
That's really cool, you guys.

1101
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,560
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1102
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:14,032
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1103
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:17,086
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself

1104
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,740
in the form of unchecked
rage and agression.

1105
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:22,197
I was a major jerk.

1106
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:25,843
Well, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.

1107
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:30,579
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1108
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:33,908
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that
<i>midnicampum holicithias.</i>

1109
01:15:33,932 --> 01:15:34,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1110
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:36,986
Well, now. There's a
four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1111
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:40,053
My family always just
call them Night Howlers.

1112
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:42,449
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

1113
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,340
Oh.
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1114
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:47,709
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1115
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:49,239
on acoount of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1116
01:15:49,263 --> 01:15:52,388
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids
and went completely nuts.

1117
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:54,878
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1118
01:15:54,879 --> 01:15:57,344
A bunny can go savage.

1119
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:00,675
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1120
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:04,593
Well, sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1121
01:16:04,617 --> 01:16:07,915
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers.

1122
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,870
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1123
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:13,272
That's it! That's what
I've been missing!

1124
01:16:13,296 --> 01:16:16,124
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hurry, come on!

1125
01:16:16,148 --> 01:16:19,449
Oh. Thank you!
I love you, bye!

1126
01:16:23,836 --> 01:16:25,946
- You catch any of that, Bon?
- Not one bit.

1127
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,456
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1128
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,295
I thought she was talking in
tongues or something.

1129
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,763
Who is it?

1130
01:16:47,787 --> 01:16:50,726
I need to find Nick.
Please.

1131
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,375
Nick?

1132
01:16:53,594 --> 01:16:55,351
Nick?

1133
01:16:57,086 --> 01:16:58,942
Oh, Nick.

1134
01:16:58,943 --> 01:17:03,011
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're toxic flowers.

1135
01:17:03,012 --> 01:17:07,154
I think someone is targetting predators
on purpose and making them go savage.

1136
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:11,647
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?

1137
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,817
Wait, please don't..
I know you'll never forgive me.

1138
01:17:16,818 --> 01:17:18,706
And I don't blame you.

1139
01:17:18,707 --> 01:17:21,107
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1140
01:17:21,335 --> 01:17:26,617
It was ignorant, and irresponsible,
and small-minded.

1141
01:17:27,453 --> 01:17:30,530
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.

1142
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,249
I have to fix this.

1143
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,801
But I can't do it without you.

1144
01:17:36,299 --> 01:17:39,886
And...
And after we're done...

1145
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:43,220
you can hate me.
And...

1146
01:17:43,244 --> 01:17:44,869
And that'll be fine.

1147
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:50,133
Because I was a horrible
friend and I hurt you.

1148
01:17:50,157 --> 01:17:55,790
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right. All along.

1149
01:17:56,122 --> 01:17:59,869
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1150
01:18:03,623 --> 01:18:07,088
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1151
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:12,168
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1152
01:18:12,169 --> 01:18:16,922
Don't worry, Carrots,
I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.

1153
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,122
All right, get in here.

1154
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:26,968
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.

1155
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:29,392
There we go, deep breath.

1156
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,655
Are you-Are you just
trying to steal the pen?

1157
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,522
Is that what this is?

1158
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:37,151
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off!
- I'm sorry.

1159
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:39,312
<font color="#ffc891">HOPPS
FAMILY FARM</font>

1160
01:18:41,486 --> 01:18:45,080
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Mmph.

1161
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:48,022
- What's your plan?
- We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1162
01:18:48,046 --> 01:18:49,370
Okay, how?

1163
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:52,786
- Know this guy?
- Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody.

1164
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:55,313
Ha-ha. Well, hello!
Step right up.

1165
01:18:55,337 --> 01:18:57,206
Anything you need, I got it.

1166
01:18:57,207 --> 01:18:58,776
All your favorite movies.

1167
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:01,274
I've got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1168
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,086
Hey, 15% off.
20!

1169
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,971
Make me an offer.
Come on!

1170
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:08,364
Well, well, look who it is,
the Duke of Bootleg.

1171
01:19:08,388 --> 01:19:09,505
What's it to you, Wilde?

1172
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:11,406
Shouldn't you be melting down
a Pawpsicle or something?

1173
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:13,865
Hey, if it isn't
flopsy the copsie.

1174
01:19:13,889 --> 01:19:16,947
We both know those weren't only
onions I caught you stealing.

1175
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,213
What were you gonna do with
those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1176
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:23,357
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton.
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1177
01:19:23,381 --> 01:19:26,103
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1178
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,321
Ice him.

1179
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:31,207
Ahhh!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah!

1180
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:33,787
You dirty rat, why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1181
01:19:33,788 --> 01:19:36,679
And the godmother to
my future granddaughter.

1182
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,361
- I'm gonna name her Judy.
- Ohhhh...

1183
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:41,339
Heh heh heh.
Ice this weasel.

1184
01:19:41,363 --> 01:19:43,950
Aww! All right, all right!
Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1185
01:19:43,974 --> 01:19:45,627
I stole the Night Howlers
so I could sell them.

1186
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:48,618
They offered me what I
couldn't refuse: Money.

1187
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:50,636
And to whom did you sell them?

1188
01:19:50,637 --> 01:19:53,600
A ram named Doug. We got
a drop spot underground.

1189
01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:56,986
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1190
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:59,252
He's unfriendly.

1191
01:20:08,632 --> 01:20:10,001
Come on.

1192
01:20:22,413 --> 01:20:24,167
The weasel wasn't lying.

1193
01:20:24,191 --> 01:20:27,523
Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1194
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:12,358
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?

1195
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:17,163
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.

1196
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:19,984
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast,
I can hit him.

1197
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:24,850
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter
through the open window of a moving car.

1198
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:40,594
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.

1199
01:21:40,618 --> 01:21:42,594
You know, whichever comes first.

1200
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:45,770
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1201
01:21:45,794 --> 01:21:49,148
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1202
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:51,147
Hey. Wait, where you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!

1203
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:53,312
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1204
01:21:53,673 --> 01:21:55,217
What are you looking at?
Hey!

1205
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:56,904
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it.

1206
01:21:56,928 --> 01:22:00,085
Carrots.
Carrots.

1207
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:01,932
You better have the
extra foam this time.

1208
01:22:01,956 --> 01:22:02,944
HA!

1209
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:06,094
Hey!
Open up!

1210
01:22:06,118 --> 01:22:08,552
What are you doing? You
just trapped us in here!

1211
01:22:08,576 --> 01:22:10,467
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD.

1212
01:22:10,491 --> 01:22:13,564
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it.
- No, all of it.

1213
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:15,072
Wait, what?

1214
01:22:17,659 --> 01:22:19,617
Oh, great, you're a
conductor now, huh?

1215
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:23,941
Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle
to get this rustbucket going.

1216
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,616
Well.
Hallelujah.

1217
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,636
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!

1218
01:22:32,432 --> 01:22:33,728
Mission accomplished.

1219
01:22:33,752 --> 01:22:36,154
Would it be premature for me to
do a little victory toot-toot?

1220
01:22:36,178 --> 01:22:38,867
All right.
One toot-toot.

1221
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,027
Well, I can cross that off
the bucket list.

1222
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,269
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.

1223
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,766
Maybe that's just hail.

1224
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,223
Back off!

1225
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,352
Incoming!

1226
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:15,155
- Carrots!
- Don't stop! Keep going.

1227
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:16,530
No, stop.
Please stop!

1228
01:23:16,554 --> 01:23:18,667
Do not stop this car!

1229
01:23:18,691 --> 01:23:20,260
Ahhh!

1230
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:22,783
Owww!

1231
01:23:26,898 --> 01:23:28,062
Whoa!

1232
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:42,548
- Speed up, Nick. Speed up!
- There's another train coming!

1233
01:23:42,572 --> 01:23:44,879
Trust me, speed up.

1234
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:50,039
Stop the train!

1235
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,498
Hey.
Need some help?

1236
01:23:56,603 --> 01:24:00,121
Oh, no. Oh, no no no.
Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1237
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:13,522
I think this is our stop.

1238
01:24:21,379 --> 01:24:25,142
Okay, maybe...
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1239
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,809
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.

1240
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:40,966
Yeah. All, except for this.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

1241
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,824
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
- Ow.

1242
01:24:42,848 --> 01:24:45,525
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.

1243
01:24:45,549 --> 01:24:47,898
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1244
01:24:58,753 --> 01:25:02,629
- There it is.
- Judy. Judy!

1245
01:25:03,077 --> 01:25:04,905
Mayor Bellwether.

1246
01:25:04,929 --> 01:25:08,218
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1247
01:25:08,242 --> 01:25:09,928
That's what's making them go savage.

1248
01:25:09,952 --> 01:25:13,218
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job.

1249
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:14,859
Thank you, ma'am.

1250
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:20,710
How did you know
where to find us?

1251
01:25:20,734 --> 01:25:22,344
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.

1252
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:27,813
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1253
01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:33,097
- Run.
- Run.

1254
01:25:33,956 --> 01:25:35,380
Get them!

1255
01:25:38,743 --> 01:25:40,189
Ah....

1256
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:42,358
Carrots!

1257
01:25:42,382 --> 01:25:43,429
Aww.

1258
01:25:43,453 --> 01:25:45,712
Here, I got you.
Get in here.

1259
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,908
Okay.
Now, just relax.

1260
01:25:49,909 --> 01:25:50,979
Whoops.

1261
01:25:51,003 --> 01:25:53,403
- Blueberry?
- Pass.

1262
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:57,105
Come on out, Judy.

1263
01:25:57,129 --> 01:25:59,287
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.

1264
01:25:59,311 --> 01:26:01,102
I'm not gonna leave you behind,
that's not happening.

1265
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:03,626
- I can't walk.
- Just.. We'll think of something.

1266
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:06,372
We're on the same team, Judy.

1267
01:26:06,373 --> 01:26:10,178
Underestimated.
Underappreciated.

1268
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:12,730
Aren't you sick of it?

1269
01:26:15,118 --> 01:26:18,736
Predators.
They may be strong and loud.

1270
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,531
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1271
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:31,678
Think about it. 90% of the population
united against a common enemy.

1272
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,079
We'll be unstoppable.

1273
01:26:36,921 --> 01:26:38,119
Huh?

1274
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:40,816
Over there!

1275
01:26:44,517 --> 01:26:45,581
Oh!

1276
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:48,529
Ah!

1277
01:26:56,555 --> 01:26:59,262
Well, you should have just
stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1278
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:02,246
It really is too bad,
I did like you.

1279
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:04,482
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

1280
01:27:04,506 --> 01:27:07,714
Oohhh.
No, of course not.

1281
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:09,170
He is.

1282
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,946
No!
Oh, Nick?

1283
01:27:12,123 --> 01:27:16,565
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the
Natural History Museum!

1284
01:27:16,589 --> 01:27:19,293
Officer Hopps is down.
Please hurry!

1285
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,257
No, Nick.
Don't do this. Fight it.

1286
01:27:21,281 --> 01:27:24,418
Oh, but he can't help it.
Can he?

1287
01:27:24,442 --> 01:27:29,680
Since predators are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1288
01:27:36,648 --> 01:27:37,885
Get back!

1289
01:27:39,556 --> 01:27:42,334
Gosh!
Think of the headline!

1290
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:46,267
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1291
01:27:46,923 --> 01:27:50,936
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1292
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,282
Yeah.
Pretty much.

1293
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:53,778
It won't work.

1294
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:56,059
Fear always works.

1295
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:59,630
And I'll dart every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way.

1296
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:00,631
Ah!

1297
01:28:02,395 --> 01:28:05,087
Oh, Nick.
No.

1298
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:09,406
Bye-bye, bunny.

1299
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:15,088
Blahhh...

1300
01:28:15,112 --> 01:28:19,160
Blood, blood, blood!
And death.

1301
01:28:19,184 --> 01:28:20,391
All right, you know you're milking it.

1302
01:28:20,415 --> 01:28:22,019
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

1303
01:28:22,043 --> 01:28:24,306
We got it up there,
thank you, yakety-yak.

1304
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:26,087
You laid it all out beautifully.

1305
01:28:26,111 --> 01:28:26,962
What?

1306
01:28:26,963 --> 01:28:29,897
Yeah. Oh, are-are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.

1307
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:31,454
What you've got
in the weapon there,

1308
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:34,234
those are blueberries,
from my family's farm.

1309
01:28:34,258 --> 01:28:37,501
Mmmuch. They are delicious.
You should try some.

1310
01:28:37,502 --> 01:28:40,545
I framed Lionheart,
I can frame you too.

1311
01:28:40,546 --> 01:28:42,783
It's my word against yours.

1312
01:28:42,807 --> 01:28:44,843
Ooo.
Actually...

1313
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:47,999
<i>And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

1314
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:50,580
- It's your word against yours.
- Huh?

1315
01:28:50,604 --> 01:28:53,983
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
Boom!

1316
01:29:00,363 --> 01:29:02,922
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today,

1317
01:29:02,946 --> 01:29:06,938
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1318
01:29:06,962 --> 01:29:10,876
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1319
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,387
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.

1320
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:15,826
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1321
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,261
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.

1322
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:20,906
It was a classic doing the wrong thing
for the right reason kind of a deal.

1323
01:29:20,907 --> 01:29:25,133
In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers'
antidote is proving effective

1324
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:28,176
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1325
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:35,326
Oh, Emmitt!

1326
01:29:38,017 --> 01:29:39,953
Thank you.

1327
01:29:41,865 --> 01:29:43,716
When I was a kid,

1328
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:47,263
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1329
01:29:47,287 --> 01:29:49,065
Where everyone got along,

1330
01:29:49,089 --> 01:29:52,458
and anyone could be anything.

1331
01:29:52,656 --> 01:29:58,543
Turns out, real life is a little bit more
complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1332
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:01,345
Real life is messy.

1333
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:04,097
We all have limitations.

1334
01:30:04,121 --> 01:30:05,626
We all make mistakes.

1335
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:09,776
Which means, hey, glass half full,
we all have a lot in common.

1336
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,774
And the more we try to
understand one another.

1337
01:30:12,798 --> 01:30:15,581
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1338
01:30:16,598 --> 01:30:18,926
But we have to try.

1339
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:22,051
So no matter what type
of animal you are.

1340
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:27,555
From the biggest elephant,
to our first fox.

1341
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:30,704
I implore you.

1342
01:30:30,705 --> 01:30:35,589
Try.....
Try to make the world a better place.

1343
01:30:35,982 --> 01:30:37,152
<font color="#ffff80">OFFICER
Nicholas P. Wilde</font>

1344
01:30:37,176 --> 01:30:43,010
Look inside yourself and recognize
that change starts with you.

1345
01:30:43,933 --> 01:30:49,826
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.

1346
01:30:52,237 --> 01:30:54,352
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

1347
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,863
All right, all right, enough.
Shut it!

1348
01:31:00,385 --> 01:31:03,327
We have some new recruits
with us this morning.

1349
01:31:03,351 --> 01:31:07,012
Including our first fox.
Who cares.

1350
01:31:07,036 --> 01:31:09,838
Hah. You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1351
01:31:09,862 --> 01:31:11,723
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1352
01:31:11,747 --> 01:31:13,211
Assignments.

1353
01:31:13,212 --> 01:31:17,920
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Tundratown SWAT.

1354
01:31:17,921 --> 01:31:21,792
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard.
Undercover.

1355
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:25,974
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.

1356
01:31:26,005 --> 01:31:27,702
Dismissed.

1357
01:31:28,032 --> 01:31:29,779
Just kidding!

1358
01:31:29,803 --> 01:31:33,325
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1359
01:31:33,366 --> 01:31:35,662
Find him.
Shut him down.

1360
01:31:35,686 --> 01:31:39,744
So are all the rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1361
01:31:40,773 --> 01:31:43,167
Oops.
Sorry.

1362
01:31:43,287 --> 01:31:45,410
Heh heh.
Sly bunny.

1363
01:31:45,434 --> 01:31:46,813
Dumb fox.

1364
01:31:46,837 --> 01:31:48,370
You know you love me.

1365
01:31:48,394 --> 01:31:50,016
Do I know that?

1366
01:31:50,017 --> 01:31:52,994
Yes.
Yes, I do.

1367
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:10,708
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,
I hope you have a good explanation.

1368
01:32:11,562 --> 01:32:15,368
Flash, Flash.
Hundred Yard Dash!

1369
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,676
Nick...

1370
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,769

1371
01:32:24,793 --> 01:32:27,166
