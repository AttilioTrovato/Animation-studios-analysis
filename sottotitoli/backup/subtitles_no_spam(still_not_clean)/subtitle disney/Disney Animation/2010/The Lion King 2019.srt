1
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,274
From the day we arrive

2
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,352
On the planet

3
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,235
And blinking
Step into the sun

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,468
There's more to see
than can ever be seen

5
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,674
More to do
than can ever be done

6
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,231
There's far too much
to take in here

7
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,717
More to find
than can ever be found

8
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,350
But the sun rolling high

9
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,395
Through the sapphire sky

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,235
Keeps great and small
on the endless round

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,915
It's the circle of life

12
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,668
And it moves us all

13
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,515
Through despair and hope

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,676
Through faith and love

15
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,437
Till we find our place

16
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,597
On the path unwinding

17
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,394
In the circle

18
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,676
The circle of life

19
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,075
It's the circle of life

20
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,556
And it moves us all

21
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,677
Through despair and hope

22
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,199
Through faith and love

23
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,917
Till we find our place

24
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,156
On the path unwinding

25
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,670
In the circle

26
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,069
The circle of life

27
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,475
Life's not fair

28
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,596
is it, my little friend?

29
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,512
While some are
born to feast

30
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,398
others spend their lives
in the dark,

31
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,151
begging for scraps.

32
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,110
The way I see it

33
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,394
you and I
are exactly the same.

34
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,389
We both want to
find a way out.

35
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,038
The king approaches!

36
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,639
This is not a drill.

37
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,437
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

38
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,069
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

39
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,673
Zazu

40
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,675
you've made me lose my lunch.

41
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,076
You will answer to Mufasa

42
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,576
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

43
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,908
I answer to no one.

44
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,992
Scar? Scar. Scar.

45
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,196
No, no.
Don't look at me like that.

46
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,749
Are you hungry, Zazu?

47
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,716
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

48
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
You can't eat me!

49
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,430
It is forbidden to eat
a member of the king's court!

50
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,954
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

51
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,997
Scar!

52
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,194
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

53
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,468
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

54
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,752
Was that today?

55
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,829
Must've slipped my mind.

56
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,672
Of course
I meant no disrespect

57
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,115
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

58
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,435
As you know, I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

59
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,627
As the king's brother,

60
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,437
you should've been
first in line.

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,158
I was first in line.

62
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,518
Or don't you remember?

63
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,915
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

64
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,112
Don't turn your back on me,
Scar.

65
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,507
Oh, no, Mufasa,

66
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,988
perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

67
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,629
Is that a challenge?

68
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,156
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

69
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,149
A wise decision.

70
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,550
You are no match
for His Royalness.

71
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,956
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,718
But when it comes
to brute strength,

73
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,870
I'm afraid my big brother

74
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,713
will always rule.

75
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,154
Not always, Scar.

76
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,591
One day,
it'll be my son who rules.

77
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,875
Simba will be your king.

78
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,068
Then long live the king.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,514
What am I gonna do with him?
Oh, come on.

80
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,855
We both know he should've been

81
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,313
expelled from the Pride Lands
long ago.

82
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,392
He's my brother, Zazu.
This is his home.

83
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,188
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

84
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,032
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

85
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,429
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

86
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,437
He slammed his head
into trees,

87
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,775
and our beaks
aren't built for it.

88
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,633
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

89
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,836
Uh, sire, coming back!

90
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,278
Simba.

91
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,076
Dad, you awake?

92
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,277
Dad, wake up!

93
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,438
Dad!

94
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,429
Dad, Dad, Dad!

95
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,318
Your son's awake.

96
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,629
Before sunrise, he's your son.

97
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,631
Come on, Dad, let's go.

98
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,392
You said I could
patrol with you today.

99
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
And today has started.

100
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,438
You promised!
You up?

101
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,467
Let's do this!

102
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,357
Let's do this.
So, what's first?

103
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,636
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

104
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,357
Dad! You're going
the wrong way!

105
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,594
Dad?

106
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,315
I'm not supposed
to go up here.

107
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,109
Look, Simba.

108
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,073
Everything the light touches
is our kingdom.

109
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,788
You rule all of that?

110
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,432
Yes.

111
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,989
But a king's time as ruler

112
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,072
rises and falls like the sun.

113
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,831
One day, Simba

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,991
the sun will set
on my time here

115
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,754
and will rise with you
as the new king.

116
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,789
All of this will belong to me?

117
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,551
It belongs to no one,
but will be yours to protect.

118
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,676
A great responsibility.

119
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,150
Everything the light touches?

120
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,989
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

121
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,871
And that mountain?

122
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,349
And beyond those shadows?

123
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,510
You must not go there, Simba.

124
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,875
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

125
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,307
Take any territory.

126
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,437
While others search
for what they can take

127
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,432
a true king
searches for what he can give.

128
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,279
Everything you see
exists together

129
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,236
in a delicate balance.

130
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,716
As king, you need to
understand that balance

131
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,995
and respect
all the creatures

132
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,832
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

133
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,238
But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

134
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,948
Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

135
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,357
When we die,
our bodies become the grass

136
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,432
and the antelope
eat the grass

137
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,037
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

138
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,755
Sire!
Morning, Zazu.

139
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,399
Do you have
the morning report?

140
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,118
Yes, sire.

141
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,269
Ten flamingos
are taking a stand.

142
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,873
Two giraffe
were caught necking.

143
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,154
The buzz from the bees

144
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,336
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

145
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Ready for some fun?

146
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,279
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

147
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,912
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

148
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,592
Stay low to the ground.

149
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I got this.

150
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,677
Check the wind,
the shadows

151
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,674
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

152
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,975
The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

153
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,216
and now the baboons
are going ape.

154
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,309
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,514
That's what I say.

156
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,735
Do you get
I'll say it again.

157
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,351
Cheetahs never

158
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,791
Come on! It's the news!

159
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,597
That's very good!

160
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,639
Sire!

161
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,431
Sire!
Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

162
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,595
They're on the hunt!

163
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,557
Where's Sarabi?
She's leading the charge.

164
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,038
Zazu, take Simba home.

165
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,871
Dad, let me come! I can help.

166
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,556
No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

167
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,028
I am not a cub.

168
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,798
Come on.

169
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,673
Let's go home.

170
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,707
Here we are.

171
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,389
Now you go along
and play with the other cubs.

172
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,317
Great.

173
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,278
If you wish
to kill something

174
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,436
you might want
to stay downwind.

175
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,630
I know how to hunt,
Uncle Scar.

176
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,871
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

177
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,668
Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

178
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,712
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

179
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,951
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

180
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,155
Said I'm going to rule it all.

181
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,912
Is that so?

182
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,115
Think about it.

183
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,238
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

184
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,152
Tell you what to do.

185
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,150
How weird is that?

186
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,355
You've no idea.

187
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,152
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

188
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,071
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

189
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,357
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

190
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,307
And he's absolutely right.

191
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,470
An elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince.

192
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,348
An elephant graveyard? Whoa.

193
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,554
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

194
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,776
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later

195
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,519
you being king and all.

196
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,038
You've been there?

197
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,509
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

198
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,028
All those rotting bones

199
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,271
and burning pools
of oozing mud.

200
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,630
Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

201
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,076
Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

202
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,832
Now, you run along.

203
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,351
And remember

204
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,713
it's our little secret

205
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,998
Your Majesty.

206
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,550
Nala! Come on.
We have to go.

207
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,432
Where?
Watering hole.

208
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,635
Simba, she's having her bath.

209
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,631
And it's time for yours.

210
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,949
But, Mom

211
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,959
I can do it myself.

212
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,347
Hold still.

213
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,198
You're messing up my mane!

214
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,237
Come on. Behind the ears.

215
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,157
Come on, Mom!

216
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,557
See? All clean. Can we go?

217
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,234
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

218
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,311
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

219
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,517
And stay downwind.

220
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,557
And one more little thing.

221
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,517
Zazu will be going with you.

222
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,714
Zazu?

223
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,839
Zazu goes

224
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,478
or you don't.

225
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,758
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

226
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,398
Okay, buddy system.

227
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,238
So, where are we really going?

228
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
How did you know?

229
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,599
You hate the water.

230
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,910
I heard
about this place, Nala.

231
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,557
The most incredible,
amazing

232
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,438
Just tell me where.

233
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,397
An elephant graveyard.

234
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,671
Whoa. How far is it?

235
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,671
Not far. Just to the shadows.

236
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,717
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

237
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,232
We've never been
that far before.

238
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,277
What if we get lost?
Relax, Nala.

239
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,910
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

240
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,512
There's nothing
to worry about.

241
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,557
Well, there is one thing.

242
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

243
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,270
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

244
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,311
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

245
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,117
Trust me, I got this.

246
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,633
Follow me to freedom.

247
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,916
Oh, how lovely it is

248
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,277
to see the future king
with his future queen.

249
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,198
I could just molt.

250
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,991
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

251
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,992
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

252
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,958
Intended. Affianced.

253
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,193
Simba, you speak bird?

254
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,429
Married!

255
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,875
Come on.
One day you will be married.

256
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,798
To each other.

257
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,269
Ugh!
Ew!

258
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

259
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,319
Never ever.

260
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,594
Nala and I are friends.

261
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,915
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

262
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,175
And he's never eaten
an impala.

263
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,234
I've tried it once.

264
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,752
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

265
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,672
A monarch
who ignores tradition?

266
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,592
With an attitude like that,

267
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,954
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

268
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,509
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

269
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,599
what to do

270
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,953
and even who to marry.

271
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,951
There will never be a king
like me.

272
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,317
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

273
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,992
Just watch.

274
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,192
I'm gonna be a mighty king

275
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,237
So enemies beware

276
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,353
Well, I've
never seen a king of beasts

277
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,395
With quite so little hair

278
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,317
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before

279
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
I'm brushing up
on looking down

280
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,117
Working on my roar

281
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,635
Thus far
a rather uninspiring thing

282
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,555
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

283
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,836
You have rather a long way
to go, young master.

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,115
If you think

285
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,480
No one saying "do this"

286
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,880
Now, when I said that

287
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,278
No one saying "be there"

288
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
What I meant was

289
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,471
No one saying
"stop that"

290
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,153
No one saying "see here"

291
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,509
Now see here!

292
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,672
Free to run around
all day

293
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,239
Well,
that's definitely out.

294
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,836
Free to do it all my way

295
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,993
I think it's time
that you and I

296
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,876
Arranged a heart-to-heart

297
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,230
Kings don't need advice

298
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,880
From little hornbills
for a start

299
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,711
If this is where the monarchy
is headed, count me out

300
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,308
Out of service
Out of Africa

301
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,670
I wouldn't hang about

302
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,476
This child is getting
wildly out of wing

303
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,599
Simba!

304
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,752
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

305
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,827
Simba!

306
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,719
I can't see you, Simba.

307
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,637
You must be in my sight
at all times.

308
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,028
I've lost him!

309
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,989
I know what you're doing!

310
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,832
Where are you going, Simba?

311
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,432
Come on!

312
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,635
You can't hide from me, Simba.

313
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,439
It is my sworn duty
to keep you safe.

314
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,074
You listen to me right now.

315
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,135
I'm sorry to flutter about
in your face,

316
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,194
have you seen

317
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,515
He's a little lion.

318
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,637
He's small,
but he's cute.

319
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,589
Everybody look left

320
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,910
Everybody look right

321
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,396
Everywhere you look I'm

322
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,311
Standing in the spotlight

323
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Not yet.

324
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,075
Let every creature go
for broke and sing

325
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,278
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

326
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,400
I see you down there!
I see you down there!

327
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,910
It's gonna be King Simba's
finest fling

328
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,951
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

329
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,075
Simba!

330
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,232
He just can't wait to be king

331
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,471
Oh, I just can't wait

332
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,074
Just can't wait

333
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,750
To be king

334
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,628
I've lost him!

335
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,711
Mufasa's gon na have
my feathers.

336
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,551
This is not good!

337
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,438
Simba, we really lost him.

338
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,952
I know what you're thinking.

339
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,394
"The future king is a genius."

340
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,834
You can't be serious.

341
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,308
You would've never gotten away
without your queen.

342
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,833
Aren't you
forgetting something?

343
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,637
There is no queen.

344
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,799
You could say that again.

345
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,313
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

346
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,192
Good luck finding one
that will say yes.

347
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,056
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

348
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,911
Give it your best shot.

349
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Pinned ya!

350
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,352
You owe me an apology.

351
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,794
Never!

352
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,837
Pinned ya.
Again.

353
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,233
Nala, stop!

354
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
What is that?

355
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,077
You're not gonna trick me,
Simba.

356
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,434
I know that there's nothing

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,672
This must be it.

358
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,107
Come on!

359
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,036
Simba, we're way
beyond the Pride Lands.

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,509
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

361
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,078
It means we can go home.

362
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,391
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

363
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,828
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

364
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,318
Danger?

365
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,675
I laugh in the face of danger.

366
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,909
Cool!

367
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,468
You hear that, Nala?

368
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,597
Simba, come on!

369
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,397
You've proved
how brave you are.

370
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,674
Now the sun is going down,

371
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,715
I'm not just
gonna sit here and

372
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,869
Well, look at this.

373
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,029
We weren't
expecting guests today.

374
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,555
Would you two cubs

375
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,679
like to stay for dinner?

376
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,717
Yeah, stay for dinner.

377
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,154
'Cause you look
like a midnight snack!

378
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,016
Can you just give me
a little bit of space?

379
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,075
I'm helping.

380
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,712
We have talked
about this before.

381
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,994
I come in alone.

382
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,430
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

383
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,795
Okay, okay. Sorry.

384
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,592
Don't be sorry.
Just do it.

385
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,990
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

386
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,755
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

387
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,480
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

388
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,999
Who rules you-know-where?

389
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,673
Mufasa does not rule me!

390
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,709
You can't do anything to me!

391
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,711
'Cause I'm the future king!

392
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,357
He's telling me what to do.

393
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,034
His father's strength
flickering inside.

394
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
I wonder

395
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,155
how all that bravery
will taste.

396
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,234
Let them go, Shenzi!

397
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,834
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

398
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,952
But if you do this, you will
start a war with Mufasa!

399
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,791
Hyenas and lions
have been at war

400
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,597
since the beginning of time.

401
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,030
But Mufasa's bloodline
will end here!

402
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,519
Run!

403
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,550
Don't let them get away!

404
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Come on!

405
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,272
Did you hear that?

406
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,919
The future king!

407
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,553
Oh, don't hurt me!

408
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,311
Do it again!

409
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,039
If you ever come
near my son again

410
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,192
No, Mufasa. Never.

411
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,028
Never again.

412
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,867
You've been warned, Shenzi.

413
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,473
I thought
you were very brave.

414
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,108
Zazu?

415
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,316
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

416
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,311
Yes, sire.

417
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,471
Don't be too hard
on him, sire.

418
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,950
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub

419
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,997
who was always getting
into scrapes.

420
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,798
And he achieved
some prominence,

421
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,914
did he not, sire?

422
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,993
I have to teach my son
a lesson.

423
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,510
Nala, come along.

424
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,550
Simba?

425
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,311
You deliberately disobeyed me.

426
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,595
I know.

427
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,518
You could
have been killed.

428
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,429
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

429
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,028
Do you understand
what's at stake?

430
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,628
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

431
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,872
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

432
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,996
That I could be brave
like you.

433
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,355
I'm only brave
when I have to be,

434
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,351
when there's no other choice.

435
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,875
But you're not scared
of anything.

436
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,878
I was today.

437
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,079
You were?

438
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,232
Yes. I thought
I might lose you.

439
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,031
I guess
even kings get scared, huh?

440
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,630
More than you could ever know.

441
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,636
But guess what?
What?

442
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,469
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

443
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,557
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

444
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,868
Come here.

445
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,875
Dad?
Uh-huh?

446
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,679
We're pals, right?
Right.

447
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,115
And we'll always
be together

448
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,792
right?

449
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,630
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

450
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,711
Look at the stars.

451
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,308
The great kings of the past

452
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,471
look down on us
from those stars.

453
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,910
Really?
Yes.

454
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,388
So whenever you feel alone

455
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,353
just remember
that those kings

456
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,278
will always be up there
to guide you.

457
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,030
And so will I.

458
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,310
But I can't see them, Dad.

459
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,635
Keep looking, son.

460
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,518
Keep looking.

461
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,636
Mufasa is strong.

462
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,711
Like, way stronger than us.

463
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,438
Please give me some space.
What?

464
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,317
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

465
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,736
Where do you want me to
I need some personal space.

466
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,511
Okay?
Okay.

467
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

468
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,759
But he is

469
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,655
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

470
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,147
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

471
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,336
Now you're just
being spiteful.

472
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,359
Good posture.

473
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,634
Next time I see Mufasa

474
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

475
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,710
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

476
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,313
Mufasa?

477
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,275
That's not the king.

478
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,550
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

479
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,711
And yet I send
two little cubs your way

480
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,393
and they come back alive.

481
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,313
I guess
we'll have to eat you instead.

482
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,036
Why eat one meal

483
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,351
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

484
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,871
What could you possibly
offer us?

485
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,679
A place where you can fill
your bellies.

486
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,670
Where everything
the light touches

487
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,829
is yours for the kill.

488
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,070
The Pride Lands
are not yours to give.

489
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,628
The king controls
those hunting grounds.

490
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,467
That's why
we're going to kill him.

491
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint

492
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,635
when it comes to hunting.

493
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,356
When I am king

494
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,670
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

495
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,512
Because a hyena's belly
is never full.

496
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,673
Mufasa's far too powerful
to challenge.

497
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,831
Mufasa is yesterday's message

498
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,909
A clapped-out,
distracted regime

499
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,793
Whose failings
undoubtedly presage

500
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,878
The need for a dif'rent dream

501
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,996
Yes, leonine times
are a-changing

502
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,231
Which means
that hyenas must too

503
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,199
My vision is clear
and wide-ranging

504
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,199
And even encompasses you

505
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,989
So prepare
for the coup of the century

506
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,032
Prepare for the murkiest scam

507
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,836
Meticulous planning

508
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,911
Tenacity spanning

509
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,594
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll

510
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,951
Be king
Undisputed

511
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,030
Respected
Saluted

512
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,237
And seen for the wonder I am

513
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,719
Yes, my teeth
and ambitions are bared

514
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,757
Be prepared

515
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,394
Be prepared
Be prepared

516
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,197
Be prepared
Be prepared

517
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,396
Be prepared
Be prepared

518
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,197
Be prepared
Be prepared

519
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,148
Be prepared

520
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,436
Be prepared

521
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,518
Yes, our teeth and ambitions
are bared

522
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,070
Be prepared

523
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,909
My dad was pretty upset
with me.

524
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,150
That's why we're here, Simba.

525
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,197
I think I know a way for you
to make it up to him.

526
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,750
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

527
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,797
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

528
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,518
Your roar.

529
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,679
My roar?

530
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,193
Yes!

531
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,797
Did you hear that?

532
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,789
This gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar.

533
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
All lions?

534
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,753
Even my dad?

535
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,112
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

536
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,679
Refused to leave

537
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,719
until his roar could be heard
above the rim.

538
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,958
All the way up there?

539
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,996
That's when you know
you've found it.

540
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,911
With a little practice

541
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,913
you'll never be called
a cub again.

542
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,237
Watch this.

543
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,356
You'll get it, Simba.

544
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,715
Just takes time.

545
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,552
I'll check on you later.

546
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:19,079
Dad will be so proud,
won't he?

547
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,878
It's a gift
he'll never forget.

548
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,791
Mufasa! Quick!

549
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,632
Stampede in the gorge!

550
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,989
Simba's down there!

551
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,387
Simba?

552
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,592
I'll find him.

553
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Zazu!

554
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,594
Hold on!
Help is coming!

555
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,074
There he is!
On that tree!

556
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,954
I'm coming, Simba!
Hold on!

557
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,034
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

558
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,427
Go!

559
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,235
Dad!

560
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,235
Simba!

561
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,717
Come to me, son.

562
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,353
Jump!

563
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,994
Dad!

564
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,588
Scar!

565
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,759
Help me.

566
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:18,070
Long live the king!

567
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:27,034
No!

568
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:46,748
Dad?

569
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,719
Dad?

570
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,278
Dad?

571
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,833
Dad?

572
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,550
Come on, wake up.

573
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,157
Help! Somebody help!

574
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,032
Simba!

575
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,710
What have you done?

576
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,476
It was a stampede.

577
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,039
He tried to save me.

578
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,394
It was an accident.

579
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:40,472
I didn't mean for it to
Of course you didn't.

580
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,076
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

581
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:45,958
But the king is dead

582
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,757
and if it weren't for you

583
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,635
he'd still be alive.

584
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,552
Your father had such hopes
for you

585
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,871
gave you so many chances.

586
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,996
And this is how you repay him.

587
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,278
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

588
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,317
Oh, what will
your mother think?

589
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,835
A son who causes
his father's death.

590
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,596
A boy who kills a king.

591
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,590
What am I gonna do?

592
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:18,947
Run.

593
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,313
Run away, Simba.

594
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,190
Run away and never return!

595
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,550
Kill him.

596
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,271
Go down
and make sure he's dead.

597
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,432
Seriously?

598
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,271
Oh, I'm sorry.

599
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,159
That's a good distance
right there.

600
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,235
Okay.

601
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,960
No little cub
could survive that fall.

602
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,072
Listen,
we're gonna tell her

603
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,197
we went down there
and we ate him.

604
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,110
Uh-huh. That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

605
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,838
We're not gonna eat him.

606
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,148
Simba is dead.

607
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,753
That's all she ever
has to know.

608
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:57,998
Works for me.

609
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,309
Mufasa's death
is a terrible tragedy.

610
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,478
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

611
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:03,150
To lose a brother

612
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:08,269
such a deep, personal loss.

613
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,994
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

614
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,708
A cub whose blood
held our future.

615
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,030
It's almost too much
to endure.

616
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,197
I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time

617
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,396
been there to save them.

618
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,030
And so it is
with a heavy heart

619
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,829
that I must assume the throne.

620
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,119
Mufasa and Simba are gone

621
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,193
which means I am your king.

622
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,119
But I must admit

623
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,032
I cannot bear
this burden alone.

624
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,675
And I will need some help

625
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,871
to ensure

626
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,996
the safety of the pride.

627
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,516
Nala, stay close.

628
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,838
And so, from the ashes
of this tragedy

629
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,197
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

630
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,958
A great

631
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,036
and glorious future!

632
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,351
Oh, dear.

633
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,914
I missed 'em!

634
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,800
I'm gonna get one of
those vultures one day.

635
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
I'm gonna get one!

636
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:26,679
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

637
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,030
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

638
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,190
Oh, no.
It's a little lion!

639
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
That is not a lion.
Well then, go check it out.

640
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,496
What is it?
That is not a lion,

641
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,554
it's a furry bird!

642
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:36,867
It looks like a lion!

643
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:39,759
That's not a lion. Let me get
a closer look. Excuse me.

644
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,434
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

645
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,599
It's a lion!

646
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,255
Run for your life, Pumbaa!
Wait! Hey, Timon.

647
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,998
Wait, Timon, wait!
It's a little lion!

648
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:49,353
It gets bigger.

649
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,356
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

650
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,440
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

651
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,016
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

652
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,108
You'll be his little mess!

653
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,440
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

654
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,476
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

655
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,788
he'll be on our side!

656
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,315
I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

657
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,673
Hear me out!

658
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,833
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

659
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,313
Well then, can we keep him?

660
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,708
Yes, of course
we can keep him!

661
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

662
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,396
We're gonna name him Fred!

663
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,311
Who are you?

664
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,576
Uh, we're the guys
who saved your life.

665
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,599
Yes.

666
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:24,914
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

667
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,717
Hordes of them. Flocks.

668
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,199
I'm Pumbaa.

669
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,634
This is Timon.
Did I mention

670
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:30,947
that we saved your life?

671
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,155
It doesn't matter.

672
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,190
Whoa. How bleak is that?

673
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,416
It doesn't even matter?

674
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,590
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

675
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,159
Now his problems
are my problems?

676
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,440
But we can help him. We're
in a position to help him.

677
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,514
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

678
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,871
I did something terrible.

679
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,876
I don't wanna talk about it.

680
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,673
Look, kid,
we've all made mistakes.

681
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,478
Uh, there must be something
we can do, right?

682
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,630
Not unless you can change
the past.

683
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,215
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask

684
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,335
That's pretty hard.
That's a biggie.

685
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,416
if I'm being honest.

686
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,135
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

687
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,831
Yeah, so you can't
change that.

688
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,280
But you know
what you can change?

689
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,315
The future.
That's our specialty.

690
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,833
Kind of our thing.

691
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,434
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

692
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:18,670
Well, to change the future,

693
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,193
you gotta put your past
behind you.

694
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Way behind.

695
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,755
Look, kid, bad things happen

696
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,989
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

697
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,079
Right.

698
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:29,800
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you

699
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,757
you turn your back
on the world!

700
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,157
And only embrace what's next!

701
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,197
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

702
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,476
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

703
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:40,516
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

704
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,150
Repeat after me, kid.
Hakuna matata.

705
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,670
What?
Hakuna matata.

706
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,193
Hakuna matata.

707
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,456
Most people
get a bigger reaction

708
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,594
when we say it the first

709
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,159
Okay, well anyway.
Hakuna matata.

710
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:54,775
Some people
start clapping immediately.

711
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,030
It means "no worries."
One and a

712
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,235
I do the counting here.

713
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,280
I wanna count!
Why don't we count together?

714
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,896
Okay, that's a good idea.
All right.

715
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,318
One and a two and a

716
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,478
Hakuna matata

717
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,789
What a wonderful phrase

718
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,351
Hakuna matata

719
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,356
It ain't no passing craze

720
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,469
It means no worries
For the rest of your days

721
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,675
It's our problem-free

722
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,635
Philosophy

723
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,992
Hakuna matata

724
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,873
Hakuna matata?
Yeah, it's our motto.

725
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,552
What's a motto?

726
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,096
Nothin'.
What's-a-motto with you?

727
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:39,235
Nice.
Boom!

728
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,829
Those two words
will solve all your problems.

729
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,434
Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.

730
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,349
Why,
when he was a young warthog

731
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:51,717
When I was a young warthog

732
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,550
How are you feeling?
It's an emotional story.

733
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,358
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal

734
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:01,398
He could clear the savannah
after every meal

735
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,596
I'm a sensitive soul

736
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,195
Although I seem thick-skinned

737
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,148
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

738
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,594
I was always here for you
and I resent that.

739
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,228
And, oh, the shame
Yes, he was ashamed

740
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,958
I thought of changing my name

741
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,632
I mean, to what, "Brad"?

742
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,518
And I got downhearted

743
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,434
Ev'ry time that I farted

744
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,873
Are you gonna stop me?

745
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,918
No, I'm not! You disgust me!

746
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,751
Hakuna matata

747
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,153
What a wonderful phrase

748
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,478
Hakuna matata

749
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:42,394
Ain't no passing craze

750
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,791
It means no worries
For the rest of your days

751
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,188
Yeah, sing it, kid

752
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,431
It's our problem-free

753
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,829
Philosophy

754
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,876
Hakuna matata

755
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,751
Welcome to
our humble home.

756
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,148
You live here?

757
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,775
Well, we live
wherever we want.

758
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,074
We do as we please.

759
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,309
It's beautiful.

760
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,471
Yeah,
it's really nice, huh?

761
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,913
Everyone, this is Simba.

762
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,996
That, my friend, is a lion.

763
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,315
What about food?

764
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,655
Have you thought
about feeding that thing?

765
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:21,193
Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

766
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,349
Here we go.

767
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,313
Uh, no, no, no, kid,
we're fresh out of zebra.

768
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,628
Any antelope?

769
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,552
Uh-oh.
No, listen, kid

770
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,835
if you want to live with us,
you have to eat like us.

771
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,878
And most importantly,
not eat us!

772
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,431
This looks like a good
spot to rustle up some grub!

773
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
Yeah!
It's perfect!

774
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:41,880
Step aside, fellas!

775
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,313
Ugh. What's that?

776
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:44,639
Ooh. Too chewy.

777
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:46,119
This one's got some nuttiness!

778
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,760
Mmm. Now that's what
I call umami!

779
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,307
Slimy, yet satisfying.

780
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,440
Mmm. Extra crunchy.

781
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,000
They're local.
Yeah. Oh, are they?

782
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:55,235
They're from right there.

783
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,630
I'm telling ya, kid,
this is the great life.

784
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
No rules.

785
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,836
No responsibilities.

786
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,559
Ooh!
The little cream-filled kind.

787
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:04,789
I love these!

788
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,016
Those are good.
I love these.

789
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,039
Those are the best.

790
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,175
Can I have the head?

791
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:09,199
Well, kid?

792
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,793
Oh, well.

793
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,597
Hakuna matata.

794
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,398
Slimy

795
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,958
yet satisfying.

796
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,711
That's it!
We didn't lie!

797
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,518
Egg sac!
I got an egg sac!

798
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,034
Hakuna matata

799
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:37,557
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata

800
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:39,152
Hakuna matata

801
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,708
It means no worries
For the rest of your days

802
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,791
It's our problem-free

803
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,355
Philosophy

804
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,478
Hakuna matata, oh
Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

805
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,108
Hakuna matata, yeah
Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

806
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,476
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

807
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,835
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata

808
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,036
It means no worries
Hakuna matata

809
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,713
For the rest of your days
Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

810
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,835
Hakuna

811
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,672
It's our problem-free

812
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,989
Philosophy

813
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,630
Hakuna matata

814
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
One more time.

815
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,056
Oh, no,
I think we did it. Yeah.

816
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,175
I think we got this one.

817
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,295
But we're just getting
in the groove, guys.

818
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,456
No, let's leave 'em
wanting more.

819
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,175
Yeah, you've grown
400 pounds since we started.

820
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,838
Meanwhile I look
exactly the same.

821
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:27,215
It means no worries

822
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,335
Will you tell him
to stop?

823
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,456
But you insisted
we sing the song.

824
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,615
I insisted?
You started singing it!

825
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:31,695
Well,
it's our signature song

826
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:32,856
we shouldn't be sharing it
with everyone.

827
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,936
Look at that sunset.

828
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,096
But it's our signature
song, so we have to.

829
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,155
Look, just tell him to stop.

830
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,833
It means no worries

831
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,096
Oh, now he's riffing,
Pumbaa.

832
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,155
This is a nightmare.

833
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:43,199
It actually is
becoming better and better.

834
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,952
Nala.

835
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:20,719
Come.

836
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,438
Sit with us.

837
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,068
Zazu, where have you been?

838
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,916
I'm sorry, Nala.
I came as soon as I could.

839
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,072
The morning report, Zazu.

840
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,472
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands
are in imminent danger.

841
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:50,597
The hyenas are chasing off
the last of the herds.

842
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,829
The bird's back!

843
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,913
Get him!

844
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,956
Don't come here again,
unless you want to be eaten!

845
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,311
We have to do something,
Sarabi. We have to fight!

846
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:32,068
Nala. Scar is the king.

847
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,871
But you are our queen!

848
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,150
We should leave
before it's too late!

849
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,438
We must all stay together
and protect the Pride Lands.

850
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,148
This is our home.
We must never abandon it.

851
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,311
This isn't the home
I remember.

852
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,199
Our time will come, Nala.

853
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,588
Be patient.

854
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,159
Sarabi.

855
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,677
The king wishes to see you.

856
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,112
Don't go.

857
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,748
I'm not afraid of him.

858
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,275
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

859
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,317
There's plenty to go around.

860
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,351
You're overhunting, Scar.

861
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:25,556
I've simply perfected
the kill.

862
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,992
With the help of my army.

863
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:30,309
You're killing everything.

864
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,956
Don't you see? There is nobody
to challenge me.

865
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:36,509
We can finally take
whatever we want.

866
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,552
We?

867
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,349
Long ago
you chose Mufasa over me.

868
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:44,476
But now there is a new king.

869
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,115
So stop being so selfish.

870
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,311
You are the selfish one.

871
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,436
The other lions look to you.

872
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,512
As long as you resist
they will reject me.

873
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,916
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

874
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,398
I will never be your queen!

875
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:06,831
Then from now on

876
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,117
the lions will eat
after the hyenas.

877
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,954
And they don't
leave much behind.

878
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,976
Just what do you think

879
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,956
you are doing, young lady?

880
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,518
Go away, Zazu.

881
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,398
I'm going to find help.

882
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,311
I will very much not go away.

883
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,916
I am sworn to protect you and
must order you back to bed.

884
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:58,759
I don't need
protecting anymore.

885
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,833
Uh, Scar!
Uh, wonderful to see you.

886
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,990
Uh,
sorry to drop in like this!

887
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,114
Ah!

888
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:58,432
Have I ever told you
about my brother

889
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,635
who thought he was
a woodpecker?

890
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,871
Nala

891
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,360
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

892
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,157
I'm gonna get ya!
Oh, I got ya!

893
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:44,753
Oh.

894
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,797
Simba! It's you!

895
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,233
Did you see that?

896
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,719
Man, that butterfly
was right there!

897
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,994
I almost had him.

898
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,634
I thought it was a lion.

899
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:54,440
You know,
the other kind of lion.

900
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:55,838
You know, a real lion?

901
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,592
I mean, not that
you're not a real lion.

902
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:59,510
But you know,
the kind that eats

903
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:00,873
I'm gonna go.

904
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,438
Hey, where you going?

905
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,795
You wanna get some grubs?

906
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,351
What's up with that guy?

907
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Um, Simba

908
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:13,911
How can I say this?

909
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,831
He's prey.
Yeah.

910
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,072
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

911
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,195
No. You two will never frolic.

912
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,032
Why not?

913
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,431
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

914
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:30,476
Oh, yeah. The circle of life.
I know that.

915
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,231
No.
No, no, no.

916
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,456
I don't know where
you're getting "circle" from.

917
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,480
No, yeah.

918
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:35,599
There's no circle of life.

919
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:36,775
No, it's no circle.
No, not at all.

920
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,949
In fact, it's the opposite.
Yeah.

921
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,280
It's a line.
Yeah.

922
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,907
It's a meaningless line
of indifference.

923
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,509
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

924
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,956
And then one day we'll reach
the end, and that'll be it.

925
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,335
That's it.
Line over!

926
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,112
Nothing.
Nada.

927
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,519
And you can really
just kinda

928
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,318
do your own thing
and fend for yourself

929
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,416
'cause your line doesn't
affect anyone else's lines.

930
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,635
You're alive and then
you're not. Like this guy.

931
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,954
Mmm.

932
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:02,878
You sure it's not a circle?

933
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,038
That we're all connected?

934
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,429
A circle would mean
we're all this.

935
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:09,914
That would mean
what I do affects him

936
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,599
affects that thing,
affects that thing.

937
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:13,239
Yeah. No.
That's not how it goes.

938
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,918
Which would make
doing whatever we wanted

939
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,194
not that cool.

940
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,832
Let me simplify this for you.

941
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,717
Life is meaningless.
Yes.

942
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,760
That's why you just gotta
look out for yourself.

943
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,279
That's why you do you, Simba.

944
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,635
Yeah, Simba,
for the first time

945
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,109
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

946
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,873
This is important. Think about
all you've been taught.

947
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,036
What do you wanna do?

948
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:36,877
Absolutely nothing.

949
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,037
Whoo-hoo!
Exactly! He gets it!

950
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,872
Jackpot!

951
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,095
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

952
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,759
Crunchy!
All right! Time to eat!

953
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:58,395
Oh.

954
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,550
Hello!

955
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,551
Nice one, Simba.

956
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,359
Oh, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

957
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,350
Or the crickets.

958
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,479
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

959
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:13,957
Hey, Timon.

960
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:15,347
Do you ever look up there

961
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,748
and wonder
what those sparkly dots are?

962
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,635
Oh, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

963
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,831
Really? What are they?

964
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:25,717
They're fireflies.

965
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,872
Fireflies that got stuck on
that big, bluish-black thing.

966
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Oh.

967
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:32,387
I guess that makes sense.

968
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,555
I always thought
they were balls of gas

969
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,710
burning
billions of miles away.

970
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,189
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

971
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:40,798
I know.

972
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,792
What do you think, Simba?
Yeah.

973
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,189
Oh, I don't know.

974
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:48,270
But somebody once told me

975
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,635
the great kings of the past
are up there

976
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,837
and they're all
watching over us.

977
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,795
That's a good one!
That's insane!

978
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,791
That's insane!

979
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,951
Royal dead guys
watching over us!

980
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,076
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

981
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,800
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

982
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,279
Oh, that would be a mess.

983
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:14,509
Oh, man!

984
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,735
I mean, Simba,
think about it.

985
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,069
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

986
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,230
We're outcasts.
Royal warthogs!

987
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:22,953
I can't! I can't!
I can't! I actually can't.

988
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,748
I can't.
No, you can. I can't.

989
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,872
Yeah. Yeah.

990
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:33,070
Yeah.

991
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:34,752
That's stupid.

992
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,958
I'm gonna go get some grubs
or something.

993
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,474
What did you say to him?
I don't know.

994
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,908
As you were saying it,

995
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,353
I thought,
"This won't end well."

996
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,795
You just start laughing.
You laughed too.

997
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,350
I did not. I would never.

998
01:10:57,479 --> 01:10:59,470
Man, I blew it.

999
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:06,671
Simba.

1000
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,555
Simba is alive!

1001
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:45,149
A- weema-weh
A- weema-weh

1002
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,314
A- weema-weh
A- weema-weh

1003
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:52,631
Wee

1004
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,877
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh

1005
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:59,635
Wee

1006
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,951
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh

1007
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,475
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle

1008
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,916
The lion sleeps tonight

1009
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:13,310
In the jungle,
the quiet jungle

1010
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:16,836
The lion sleeps tonight

1011
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:20,311
Wee

1012
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,278
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh

1013
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,430
Wee

1014
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,319
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh

1015
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,753
Near the village,
the peaceful village

1016
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,868
The lion sleeps tonight

1017
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,275
Near the village,
the quiet village

1018
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,351
The lion sleeps tonight

1019
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,195
Wee

1020
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:51,476
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh

1021
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,315
Wee

1022
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,800
Pumbaa!

1023
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:03,315
Run for your life!

1024
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,034
Run, Pumbaa, run!

1025
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Timon, help!

1026
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:16,399
Pumbaa!

1027
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,349
Pumbaa?

1028
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,518
I'm gonna die!

1029
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,271
I'm coming, Pumbaa!
Hang in there!

1030
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,037
Move! Move! Move!

1031
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
No!

1032
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,279
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1033
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
No!

1034
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:03,399
Nala?

1035
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,911
Simba?

1036
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,271
Is that really you?

1037
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:09,634
Yeah.

1038
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,631
It's me, Simba!

1039
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,015
Nala, what're you doing?
Oh, my

1040
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:16,039
I don't believe it!

1041
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,519
Look at you!

1042
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Pumbaa

1043
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,318
I don't think
you're getting eaten.

1044
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,358
Oh, where have you been?

1045
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,953
I thought you were dead!

1046
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,997
You thought he was
dead. I thought I was dead!

1047
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,190
I thought
you were gonna eat me.

1048
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:31,315
What fun!

1049
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:33,356
I'm so sorry,
before we move on,

1050
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:34,640
how do you two
know each other?

1051
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,875
Timon, Pumbaa

1052
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:37,951
I want you to meet
my best friend, Nala.

1053
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,429
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

1054
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,198
Nala, you're gonna
love it here!

1055
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:43,359
This place is amazing.

1056
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,032
It's everything
you could ever want.

1057
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,396
Simba, we need to leave.

1058
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,557
Scar has taken over
with the hyenas.

1059
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:53,752
You have to take your place
as king.

1060
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,194
King? Simba?

1061
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,868
We kneel before you
as loyal servants.

1062
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,996
Pumbaa, relax.
She's wrong.

1063
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,560
Lady, you've got
your lions crossed.

1064
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Nice.

1065
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,238
Seeing you again,

1066
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:06,197
you don't know what this will
mean to everyone.

1067
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:08,430
What this means to me.

1068
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,671
You have to come home.

1069
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,871
This is my home.

1070
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,958
Please stay.

1071
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:16,599
This place is incredible.

1072
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,398
I know you'll love it.

1073
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,958
I can't.

1074
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:21,394
Come on!

1075
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,356
At least
let me show you around.

1076
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,511
Where are you going?

1077
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,759
Simba, it's so beautiful.

1078
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,792
I can see what's happening

1079
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,960
I can't. What?

1080
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:41,792
And they don't have a clue

1081
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,914
Who's "they"?

1082
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,355
They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line

1083
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,711
Our trio's down to two

1084
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,800
Oh, I get it.

1085
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,631
The sweet caress of twilight

1086
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,720
Yeah.

1087
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,596
There's magic ev'rywhere

1088
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,835
It's ev'rywhere.

1089
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:59,873
And with all this
romantic atmosphere

1090
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,951
Disaster's in the air

1091
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,793
Can you feel the love tonight?

1092
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,872
The peace the evening brings

1093
01:19:21,079 --> 01:19:27,269
The world for once
in perfect harmony

1094
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:31,990
With all its living things

1095
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,518
So many things
to tell her

1096
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,636
But how to make her see
The truth about my past?

1097
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,908
Impossible

1098
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,990
She'd turn away from me

1099
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,079
He's holding back,
he's hiding

1100
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,869
But what, I can't decide

1101
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,077
Why won't he be the king
I know he is?

1102
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,073
The king I see inside?

1103
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,828
Can you feel
the love tonight?

1104
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,155
The peace the evening brings

1105
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:19,315
The world for once
in perfect harmony

1106
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,912
With all its living things

1107
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:31,514
Can you feel the love tonight?

1108
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:38,149
You needn 't look too far

1109
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,153
Stealing through
the night's uncertainties

1110
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,831
Love is where they are

1111
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:57,470
And if he falls
in love tonight

1112
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,112
It can be assumed

1113
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,153
His carefree days
with us are history

1114
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:17,358
In short, our pal is doomed

1115
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:33,635
I told you.
Isn't it great here?

1116
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,676
You know, maybe it could be
like this forever.

1117
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,671
It's amazing.

1118
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:41,317
But there's something
I don't understand.

1119
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,710
If you've been alive
all this time

1120
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,791
why haven't you come home?

1121
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,069
We've really needed you.

1122
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,639
They're fine, all right?

1123
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,158
Nobody needs me.

1124
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:53,037
You're the king.

1125
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,872
Nala, Scar is the king.

1126
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:58,917
Simba, he's decimated
the Pride Lands.

1127
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:00,877
There's no food, no water

1128
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:02,951
There's nothing I can do.

1129
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:04,677
What about your mother?

1130
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,796
This is your responsibility.

1131
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,359
You need to challenge Scar.

1132
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,353
I can't go back. Ever.

1133
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,713
Why?

1134
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,631
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1135
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,914
Scar told us that

1136
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:17,307
You wouldn't understand!

1137
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,878
None of it matters. Okay?

1138
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:20,393
Hakuna matata.

1139
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
What?

1140
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,471
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1141
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,278
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1142
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:26,997
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1143
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:28,592
So, why worry?

1144
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,711
Why worry?

1145
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,796
What happened to you?

1146
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,234
You're not
the Simba I remember.

1147
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,113
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1148
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:39,997
No, I'm disappointed.

1149
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,279
You know, now you're starting
to sound like my father.

1150
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:45,113
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1151
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,189
You have no idea
what I've been through!

1152
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:50,960
I came here looking for help.

1153
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,149
I guess I made a mistake.

1154
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:57,952
Goodbye, Simba.

1155
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,073
"Disappointed"?

1156
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,869
She wants me to go home?

1157
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:20,996
I am home.

1158
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,036
"Best friend"?

1159
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,509
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1160
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:27,479
Never did.

1161
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:56,430
Go away.

1162
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,159
Going away will not
answer the question.

1163
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:01,958
What question?
Who are you?

1164
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:04,315
I know exactly who I am.

1165
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,913
The question is, who are you?

1166
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,389
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1167
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,719
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1168
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:17,911
Yeah,
I think you're confused.

1169
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:20,597
I am confused?

1170
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:23,600
You don't even know
who you are.

1171
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,716
Oh. And I suppose you do?

1172
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,949
I held the son of Mufasa.

1173
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:33,594
You knew my father?

1174
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,680
Correction.

1175
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,597
I know your father.

1176
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,949
He died a long time ago.

1177
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:40,632
He's alive!

1178
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,877
And I can take you to him.

1179
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:44,992
Follow me. I will show you!

1180
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:46,159
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1181
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,319
If you can keep up!

1182
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:49,472
Wait!

1183
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:00,597
Follow me!

1184
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:09,753
Quickly, quickly!
Come through!

1185
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,238
Hey! Slow down!

1186
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,399
Hey, you better hurry.

1187
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,319
Hold on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1188
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:44,679
Come.

1189
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:57,313
Your father is waiting.

1190
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:11,270
Do you see him?

1191
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,716
I don't see anything.

1192
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,118
Look closer.

1193
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:25,270
You see?

1194
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,039
He lives in you.

1195
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,438
Simba.

1196
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,958
Dad?

1197
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,351
Simba.

1198
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,310
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1199
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,920
I can't.

1200
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,957
You must remember who you are.

1201
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:56,509
The one true king.

1202
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,748
I'm sorry.

1203
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,951
I don't know
how to be like you.

1204
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,599
As king, I was most proud
of one thing.

1205
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,319
Having you as my son.

1206
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,716
That was a long time ago.

1207
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:17,033
No, Simba. That is forever.

1208
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,559
Please.

1209
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,471
Don't leave me again.

1210
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,916
I never left you.

1211
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,195
And never will.

1212
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,239
Remember who you are.

1213
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,869
Remember.

1214
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:48,993
And so, I ask again.

1215
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,234
Who are you?

1216
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,789
I am Simba.

1217
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,234
Son of Mufasa.

1218
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:26,359
Yeah
Spirit

1219
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:30,828
Watch the heavens open

1220
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,909
Yeah

1221
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:38,516
Spirit

1222
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:42,795
Can you hear it calling?

1223
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:46,668
Yeah

1224
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:50,435
Simba?

1225
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,954
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

1226
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:54,672
Let's go home!

1227
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:02,590
Spirit

1228
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:07,916
Watch the heavens open, open

1229
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:10,832
Yeah

1230
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,109
Your destiny is coming close

1231
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,393
Stand up and fight

1232
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:28,310
So, go in to a far-off land

1233
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:34,873
And be one with the great I am

1234
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,715
I didn't wanna believe you.

1235
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,949
So, what are you gonna do?

1236
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,872
My father
once told me to protect

1237
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,712
everything the light touches.

1238
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,599
If I don't fight for it,
who will?

1239
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:01,597
I will.

1240
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,318
It's going to be dangerous.

1241
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:05,435
Danger? Ha!

1242
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,716
I laugh in the face of danger.

1243
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:14,516
It can't be!

1244
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,511
Hello, Zazu.

1245
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,671
Your Majesty.

1246
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,599
Welcome home.

1247
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,920
We're here!

1248
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,557
Oh, everyone, calm down.
We're here.

1249
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,391
The backup has arrived!

1250
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,073
What are you guys doing here?

1251
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,515
Um, we were not worried!
Um No, not worried.

1252
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,279
'Cause no worries.
Nope. Hakuna matata.

1253
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,750
We were concerned, because
Because, you know

1254
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,238
You're our friend.

1255
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:43,158
What about the meaningless
line of indifference?

1256
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:44,667
Well, we were thinking

1257
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,960
maybe it curves a little bit.
That's a good point.

1258
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:48,274
I mean, Simba, look,

1259
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,270
I'm happy to admit
when Pumbaa's wrong

1260
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:51,496
and this is
one of those instances.

1261
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,600
What? That wasn't my thing.

1262
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,868
You told me about the line.

1263
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:55,039
Wait, hold on.

1264
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:57,993
Now, this is the place
you're fighting for?

1265
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,390
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.

1266
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,750
Is it behind
that terrifying rock?

1267
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,796
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1268
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,313
I like what
you've done with it,

1269
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,118
although a bit heavy
on the carcass.

1270
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:09,917
Hey, hey, look. A bird.

1271
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:12,673
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1272
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:15,037
Oh, wow! It's a puffin.

1273
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:16,559
Charming.

1274
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:20,708
Simba, we are with you
until the end.

1275
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,109
We are at your service,
my liege!

1276
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,198
Follow me.

1277
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:40,912
Hyenas everywhere.

1278
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,354
I hope it's a quick death.

1279
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:43,840
You know,
just not a lot of chewing.

1280
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,055
What's your plan
for getting us

1281
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:46,229
past the slobbering guards?

1282
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,791
Live bait.

1283
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:54,712
That's a great idea.

1284
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,154
Those guys could never
resist fresh meat.

1285
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:00,351
So all we need to do is find
something that's, like, big

1286
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,555
and plump, and juicy.

1287
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,836
Maybe like a gnu?

1288
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,355
Why is everyone looking at me?

1289
01:32:14,119 --> 01:32:16,314
It is with deepest pride

1290
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:18,435
and greatest pleasure

1291
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,751
that we proudly present

1292
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,478
your dinner.

1293
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:29,828
Be our guest

1294
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:35,673
It's working, Pumbaa!

1295
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,673
My old friend.

1296
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,550
Sarabi,
why put yourself through this?

1297
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,347
All you have to do
is be my queen.

1298
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,953
You're suffering for what?

1299
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:19,951
The memory of a life
you once knew?

1300
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:22,110
A king you once loved?

1301
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:26,676
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1302
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,515
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1303
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,750
I am ten times
the king Mufasa was!

1304
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,520
You are nothing
compared to Mufasa!

1305
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,154
Mufasa?

1306
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:50,354
It can't be.

1307
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,836
Get away from my mother.

1308
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:56,838
Simba.

1309
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:01,275
You're alive?

1310
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:03,748
How can that be?

1311
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,036
I'm here, Mother.

1312
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,239
I'm home.

1313
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:08,798
Simba

1314
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:11,235
I'm so happy to see you.

1315
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,319
Alive.

1316
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,759
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1317
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,029
I can give you more than one.

1318
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:21,314
You see

1319
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,556
they think I'm king.

1320
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,751
Well, we don't.

1321
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,956
Your reign is over, Scar.

1322
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,520
Simba is the rightful king!

1323
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:38,194
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1324
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:40,435
Are you with me, lions?

1325
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,587
The choice is yours, Scar.
Step down or fight.

1326
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,679
Must this all end in violence?

1327
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:55,590
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1328
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,073
To feel the shame
of knowing

1329
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:01,548
I took the life
of someone I love.

1330
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:03,552
I put all that behind me.

1331
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,957
But have they
put it behind them?

1332
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,917
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1333
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:11,592
What is he talking about?

1334
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,036
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1335
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:17,555
Well, Simba

1336
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,992
now's your chance to confess.

1337
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:24,796
T ell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1338
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,831
It was me.

1339
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,030
It's not true.

1340
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,036
Tell me it's not true.

1341
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:41,917
It's true. I'm sorry.

1342
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:43,877
He admits it.

1343
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:45,039
Murderer!

1344
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,077
No, no.
It was an accident.

1345
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:49,150
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1346
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:51,880
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1347
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:53,039
I'm not a murderer.

1348
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:55,873
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a father?

1349
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,474
We should believe a son
who takes the life of a king?

1350
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,956
A son who abandons his mother?

1351
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:02,639
No. I'm

1352
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,712
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1353
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,029
No. No, I'm

1354
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:08,615
Are you the king?
No, I'm

1355
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,311
You're what? Say it!
I'm

1356
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,954
I'm nothing.

1357
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:14,792
Then bow to your king!

1358
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,748
Simba!

1359
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,435
This looks familiar.

1360
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:40,917
Where have I seen this before?

1361
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:44,033
Oh, yes, I remember.

1362
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,032
This is the way Mufasa looked
before he died.

1363
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:51,237
I looked down

1364
01:36:51,399 --> 01:36:53,993
saw the fear in his eyes.

1365
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,957
And here's my little secret.

1366
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,997
I killed Mufasa.

1367
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,238
No!

1368
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:19,159
My father!

1369
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,520
Your own brother!

1370
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,668
How could you?

1371
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,557
First he kills Mufasa

1372
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:25,519
and now he wants to kill me!

1373
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,908
You killed him!

1374
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:28,399
Tell them the truth!

1375
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,073
Don't believe his lies!

1376
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:31,474
Scar

1377
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,837
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1378
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:36,507
That's true!

1379
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,831
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1380
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,998
Murderer!

1381
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,118
Kill them all!

1382
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,439
Lions, attack!

1383
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:09,997
Simba!

1384
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,591
Pumbaa, I think we lost them.
That was terrifying.

1385
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,631
Do you hear a low growl?

1386
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,073
Looks like we'll be
having pig for dinner.

1387
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:27,195
Plump and chubby.

1388
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,948
Chubby?

1389
01:38:29,319 --> 01:38:31,355
Did he just call me chubby?
Uh-oh.

1390
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:33,953
It sounded a lot like
he just said "chubby".

1391
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:35,917
Which would be
a mistake because

1392
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:38,354
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1393
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:39,439
Oh, boy.

1394
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,317
I may run from hyenas

1395
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:43,630
but I will always
fight a bully!

1396
01:38:52,119 --> 01:38:53,519
You feel better, Pumbaa?
I do.

1397
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,695
You got that
out of your system?

1398
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,720
I did.

1399
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:13,590
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

1400
01:39:14,439 --> 01:39:16,748
I've been waiting too.

1401
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,876
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1402
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:26,155
For king and country!

1403
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,835
It's the bird!

1404
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,399
I got him! I got him!

1405
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,279
Tally-ho!

1406
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:35,520
Oh! No! He's got me!

1407
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,793
He's got me! Ooh!

1408
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,479
Get that bird!

1409
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:48,708
Please! Let's discuss this.

1410
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,717
That never gets old!

1411
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:36,234
It's over, Scar.

1412
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:41,798
Have mercy.
I beg you.

1413
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,393
Mercy?

1414
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,833
After what you did?

1415
01:41:45,319 --> 01:41:47,117
It was the hyenas.

1416
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:49,635
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1417
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,916
I was planning
on killing them all.

1418
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:54,759
You fooled the hyenas.

1419
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,271
Just like you fooled me.

1420
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:01,554
Simba

1421
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,876
you wouldn't kill
your only uncle.

1422
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,755
No, Scar.

1423
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:10,037
I'm not like you.

1424
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,671
Oh, Simba

1425
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,114
you are truly noble.

1426
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:16,997
And I will make it up to you.

1427
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:20,037
Just tell me how
I can prove myself.

1428
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:22,793
Tell me what
you want me to do.

1429
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:26,359
Run.

1430
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,836
Run away, Scar.

1431
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:34,471
Run away and never return.

1432
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:37,399
Yes.

1433
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:40,190
Of course.

1434
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,114
As you wish

1435
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:44,507
Your Majesty.

1436
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,914
Aah!

1437
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:58,719
You can't win, Scar!

1438
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,359
This is my kingdom!

1439
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,747
My destiny!

1440
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,279
My friends.

1441
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:57,838
It will take some time,

1442
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,394
but together
we will build our army.

1443
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,958
"Friends", huh?

1444
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:06,114
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1445
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:09,192
Yeah.
That you wanted to kill us?

1446
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:10,359
No.

1447
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:11,673
No, let me explain.

1448
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:14,708
I was trying to fool him.

1449
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,313
We will rule together!

1450
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,671
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1451
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,996
"A hyena's belly

1452
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:27,070
"is never full."

1453
01:44:33,159 --> 01:44:34,229
No!

1454
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:29,315
Your Majesty.

1455
01:46:23,239 --> 01:46:25,355
Remember.

1456
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,037
Till we find our place

1457
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:24,873
On the path unwinding

1458
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:30,510
In the circle

1459
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:34,992
The circle of life

1460
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,872
Circle of life

1461
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:29,670
It's never
too late to turn things around

1462
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,752
Recover, unravel the path
to confound

1463
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,548
The doubters and losers
that line up despair

1464
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,394
Who tell you it's over,
you're goin' nowhere

1465
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:46,314
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late

1466
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:53,078
It's never too late
to get back on track

1467
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:56,948
To get at least some,
if not all of it back

1468
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:00,748
I thought I was happy,
and sometimes I was

1469
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,310
But sadness is just
as important because

1470
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:07,631
Got to carry the weight
and hope

1471
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,198
It's never too late

1472
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,438
Never too late
to fight the fight

1473
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,636
Never too late
to cheat the night

1474
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,516
Never too late to win the day

1475
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,318
Never too late to break away

1476
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:22,277
Time will start
to move too fast

1477
01:49:22,359 --> 01:49:24,032
But time is now,
my friend

1478
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:27,755
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end

1479
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:32,511
Oh, no, it's never too late

1480
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,554
It's never too late
to get up off the ground

1481
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:43,314
Don't have to be noticed,
don't have to be crowned

1482
01:49:43,399 --> 01:49:47,234
I did what I've done,
and I don't try to hide

1483
01:49:47,319 --> 01:49:51,198
I've lost many things,
but never my pride

1484
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:56,229
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

1485
01:49:59,079 --> 01:50:00,957
Never too late
to fight the fight

1486
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:03,030
Never too late
to cheat the night

1487
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,030
Never too late to win the day

1488
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:06,957
Never too late to break away

1489
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:08,757
Time will start
to move too fast

1490
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,557
But time is now,
my friend

1491
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,474
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end

1492
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,037
Oh, no, it's never too late

1493
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:26,712
Never too late

1494
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,716
I used to say
I don't have time

1495
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,518
I'm sleepin' tonight

1496
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:41,479
A day doin' nothin'
is doin' it right

1497
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:45,314
No hurry, no hurry,
it takes as long as it takes

1498
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:46,912
You might as well sleep

1499
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,911
for all the difference
it makes

1500
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,753
I didn't find love
or peace on the breaks

1501
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,627
These aren't excuses,
but a string of mistakes

1502
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,597
I won't go back there

1503
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:03,471
Not going back there

1504
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,876
Never too late
to fight the fight

1505
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,837
Never too late
to cheat the night

1506
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,831
Never too late to win the day

1507
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,751
Never too late to break away

1508
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,671
Never too late
to fight the fight

1509
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,511
Never too late
to cheat the night

1510
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,555
Never too late to win the day

1511
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,391
Never too late to break away

1512
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:24,198
Time will start
to move too fast

1513
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:26,117
But time is now, my friend

1514
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,630
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end

1515
01:51:30,279 --> 01:51:35,114
Oh, oh, it's never too late

1516
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,676
It's never too late

1517
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,195
Oh, never too late

1518
01:51:44,119 --> 01:51:46,110
Oh, it's never too late

1519
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:50,073
No, it's never too late
