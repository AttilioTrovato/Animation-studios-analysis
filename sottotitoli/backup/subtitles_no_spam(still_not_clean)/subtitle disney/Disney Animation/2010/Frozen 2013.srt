You're okay, Anna.
I got you.

68
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,168
Elsa,
what have you done?

69
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,505
This is getting
out of hand.

70
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:46,641
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

71
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,641
Oh. She's ice cold.

72
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,980
I know where we have to go.

73
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:10,699
Ice?

74
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,737
Faster, Sven.

75
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:16,605
Sven!

76
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,884
Please! Help!
It's my daughter.

77
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,223
It's the king.

78
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,127
Trolls?

79
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,095
Shush!

80
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,964
I'm trying to listen.

81
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,668
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

82
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,704
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,805
Born with the powers,
or cursed?

84
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,809
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

85
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:55,545
Here, here.

86
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,814
You are lucky
it wasn't her heart.

87
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:02,851
The heart is not
so easily changed.

88
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:05,252
But the head can
be persuaded.

89
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,654
Do what you must.

90
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,524
I recommend
we remove all magic.

91
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,596
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.

92
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:18,769
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

93
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:25,740
She will be okay.

94
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,142
But she won't remember
I have powers?

95
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,077
It's for the best.

96
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:33,817
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

97
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,817
There is beauty in it...

98
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,555
But also great danger.

99
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:42,125
You must learn
to control it.

100
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,728
Fear will be your enemy.

101
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,632
No!

102
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:52,233
We'll protect her.

103
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,202
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

104
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,904
 Until then...

105
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:57,971
 We'll lock the gates.

106
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,574
 We'll reduce the staff.

107
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,144
 We will limit her contact
with people,

108
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,182
 and keep her powers
 hidden from everyone.

109
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,185
 Including Anna.

110
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:19,862

Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

342
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,897

354
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:06,153
Well,
he was sprightly.

355
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:07,921
Especially
for a man in heels.

356
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:08,921

361
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:24,569
Why not?

362
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:24,442
It just can't.

363
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:31,516
Excuse me for a minute.

364
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:39,152
I'd be honored.

365

Oop.

368
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,502

Sorry.

372
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:01,141
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

373
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,011
Ah.

374
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,115
What's this?

375
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:09,883
Uh, I was born with it.

376
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:12,051
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

377
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,686
I like it.

378
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:14,686
Yeah, the whole thing.

379
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,057
You got it.

380
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,559
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have
how many brothers?

381
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,028
Twelve older brothers.

382
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,096
Three of them
pretended I was invisible,

383
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:26,165
literally, for two years.

384
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,701
That's horrible.

385
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,169
It's what brothers do.

386
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,605
And sisters.

387
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,640
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

388
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,910
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,

389
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,580
and I never knew why.

390
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,781
I would never
shut you out.

391
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,953
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

392
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:49,222

May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,151
Your Majesty.

447
00:25:58,151 --> 00:25:59,786
We would like...

448
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,786
Uh, your blessing...

449
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,223
Of our marriage.

450
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:05,223
Marriage?

451
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:05,359
Yes!

452
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,095
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

453
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:10,130
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

454
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,633
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

455
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,101
Of course, we'll have soup,
roast and ice cream.
And then...

456
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,868
Wait. Would we live here?

457
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,868
Here?

458
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,804
Absolutely!

459
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:18,804
Anna!

460
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:18,939
Oh!

461
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:20,272
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

462
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:22,041
What? No, no, no.

463
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,041
Of course we have the room.

464
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,377
Wait, slow down.

465
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,046
No one's brothers
are staying here.

466
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:26,881
No one is getting married.

467
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:29,650
Wait, what?

468
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,220
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.

469
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,356
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

470
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:40,059
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

471
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,128
You can if it's true love.

472
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:43,864
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

473
00:26:43,864 --> 00:26:45,265
More than you.

474
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:46,799
All you know is how
to shut people out.

475
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:51,105
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

476
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,840
Now, excuse me.

477
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,777
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...

478
00:26:56,777 --> 00:26:59,279
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

479
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,713
The party is over.
Close the gates.

480
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:01,713
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:01,748
What?

482
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:03,748
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

483
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,750
Give me my glove!

484
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,787
Elsa, please, please.

485
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:07,955
I can't live
like this anymore!

486
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:10,758
Then leave.

487
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,298
What did I ever do to you?

488
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:19,799
Enough, Anna.

489
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,001
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?

490
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,804
Why do you shut the world out?

491
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,404
What are you so afraid of?

492
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:26,907
I said, enough!

493
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:37,851
Sorcery.

494
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:39,252
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

495
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:41,855
Elsa.

496
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:49,463
There she is!

497
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,038
Yes! It is her!

498
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:58,440
Queen Elsa.

499
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,742
Our beautiful queen!

500
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:04,511
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

501
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,013
No.

502
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,224
There she is! Stop her!

503
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,126
Please, just stay away
from me. Stay away.

504
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,034
Monster. Monster!

505
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:34,778
Elsa!

506
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,913
Elsa!

507
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:48,567
Wait, please!

508
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,202
Elsa, stop!

509
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:04,503
Anna!

510
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:05,377
No.

511
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:12,597
The fjord.

512
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,597
Snow!

513
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,532
Snow?

514
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:35,067
Yes, snow.

515
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,067
Are you all right?

516
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,569
No.

517
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,872
Did you know?

518
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:39,106
No.

519
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,608
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

520
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,443
The queen has
cursed this land!

521
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:46,378
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

522
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:48,114
Wait, no!

523
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:50,383
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?

524
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,184
Are you a monster, too?

525
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,087
No, no.
I'm completely ordinary.

526
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,324
That's right, she is.

527
00:29:57,324 --> 00:29:59,358
In the best way.

528
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:00,961
And my sister
is not a monster.

529
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,628
She nearly killed me!

530
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,628
You slipped on ice.

531
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,431
Her ice.

532
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,200
It was an accident.
She was scared.

533
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,202
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

534
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:12,338
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

535
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:13,973
So, I'm the one

536
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,973
that needs
to go after her.

537
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,241
What?

538
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:17,241
Bring me
my horse, please.

539
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:17,376
Anna, no.

540
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,279
It's too dangerous.

541
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,314
Elsa is
not dangerous.

542
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:23,048
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

543
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,351
I'm coming with you.

544
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:26,887
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

545
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:28,222
On my honor.

546
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:32,359
I leave Prince Hans
in charge.

547
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,364
Are you sure
you can trust her?

548
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:38,098
I don't want you
getting hurt.

549
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:39,967
She's my sister.

550
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:41,369
She would never hurt me.

I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

606
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:08,201
Of course, none of it
would have happened

607
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:09,536
if she had just told
me her secret.

608
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:11,371

Ooh. "And sauna"!

619
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:16,702
Yoo-hoo.

620
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:16,538

621
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:20,340

of my own invention, yah?

624
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:29,016
Oh. Great. For now, um,
how about boots?

625
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,652
Winter boots and dresses?

626
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:33,023
That would be
in our winter department.

627
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:38,259
Oh. Um...

628
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:40,592
I was just wondering.

629
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,028
Has another young woman...

630
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:45,465
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,

631
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:46,932
passed through here?

632
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:48,333
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

633
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:48,333
is you, dear.

634
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:57,909
You and this fellow.

635
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,344
Yoo-hoo.

636
00:36:59,344 --> 00:36:59,914
Big summer blowout.

637
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:06,585
Carrots.

638
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:07,387
Huh?

639
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,322
Behind you.

640
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:11,659
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

641
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:14,529
Oh. A real
howler in July, yes?

642
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:17,764
Wherever could it be
coming from?

643
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:19,699
The North Mountain.

644
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,501
North Mountain.

645
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,702
That will be 40.

646
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,570
Forty? No, 10.

647
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,938
Oh, dear, that's no good.

648
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:28,007
See, this is from
our winter stock,

649
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,376
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

650
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,079
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

651
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:35,380
I sell ice for a living.

652
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,882
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

653
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,052
I mean,
that is really...

654
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:39,452
That's
unfortunate.

655
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:41,887
Still 40.

656
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,090
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

657
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,391
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

658
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,061
Yoo-hoo!

659
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:51,063
Ten is all I got.
Help me out.

660
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,632
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

661
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:54,967
Okay, just tell me
one thing.

662
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,735
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

663
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,570
Did it seem magical?

664
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,074
Yes!

665
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:03,876
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

666
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:07,581
What did you call me?

667
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,384
Okay, okay.
I'm out.

668
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:12,485
Whoa!

669
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:13,387
Bye-bye.

670
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,960
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.

671
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:23,563
But I did find us
a place to sleep.

672
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,563
And it's free.

673
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,469
I'm sorry about
this violence.

674
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:31,404
I will add
a quart of lutefisk,

675
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,405
so we have good feelings.

676
00:38:33,405 --> 00:38:33,641

This is fresh lacquer.

709
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:26,918
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?

710
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:28,820
Ugh!

711
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,820
No, I was raised
in a castle.

712
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,657
Hmm.

713
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:34,527
So, uh, tell me,

714
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:36,262
what made the queen go
all ice-crazy?

715
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:36,896
Oh. Well...

716
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,898
It was all my fault.

717
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,235
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,

718
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:45,070
because I'd only just
met him, you know, that day.

719
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,005
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

720
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:50,675
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you
just met that day?

721
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:53,679
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

722
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,579
and then she tried
to walk away,

723
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,547
and I grabbed her glove...

724
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,949
Hang on!

725
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:58,951
You mean to tell me
you got engaged

726
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,219
to someone you just
met that day?

727
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,289
Yes. Pay attention.

728
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:06,291
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time

729
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,728
so, I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

730
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:09,831
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

731
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,266
Yes, they did.

732
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:17,168
But Hans is not a stranger.

733
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,871
Oh, yeah?
What's his last name?

00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:21,606

Southern Isles."

735
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,606
What's his favorite food?

736
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,909
Sandwiches.

737
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:23,909
Best friend's name?

738
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:23,010
Probably John.

739
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,010
Eye color?

740
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,610
Dreamy.

741
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,610
Foot size?

742
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,079
Foot size doesn't matter.

743
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,146
Have you had a meal
with him yet?

744
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:29,882
What if you hate
the way he eats?

745
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:31,150
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

746
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,552
Picks his nose?

747
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:33,818
And eats it.

748
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:35,123
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.

749
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:39,123
All men do it.

750
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:39,759
Ew.

751
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:42,260
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

752
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,862
It doesn't sound
like true love.

753
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,065
Are you some
sort of love expert?

754
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:49,702
No. But, uh, I have
friends who are.

755
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:51,237
You have friends

756
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:53,606
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

757
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:55,606
Stop talking.

758
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:55,240
No, no, no. No, no.

759
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
I'd like to meet these...

760
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,876
No, I mean it.

761
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:12,791
Sven, go.

762
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,760
Go!

763
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
What are they?

764
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,027
Wolves.

765
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:16,798
Wolves?

766
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,798
What do we do?

767
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,701
I got this.

768
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,369
You just... Don't fall off,
and don't get eaten.

769
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,336
But I want to help!

770
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,336
No.

771
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,005
Why not?

772
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:26,005
Because I don't
trust your judgment.

773
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,206
Excuse me?

774
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:29,809
Who marries a man
she just met?

775
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,110
It's true love!

776
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,110
Whoa!

777
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,945
Whoa. Whoa!

778
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,614
Christopher!

779
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:36,983
It's "Kristoff"!

780
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:37,652
Ow!

781
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:42,688
Duck!

782
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:48,327
You almost set me on fire!

783
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:50,061
But I didn't.

784
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:57,402
Get ready to jump, Sven!

785
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:58,971
You don't tell him what to do.

786
00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,971
Hey!

787
00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,306
I do!

788
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:02,307
Jump, Sven!

789
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,855
Phew!

790
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:17,858
But I just paid it off.

791
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:20,059
Uh-oh. No. No.

792
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,327
No!

793
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:23,996
Ah! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

794
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:24,431
Grab on!

795
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,965
Pull, Sven. Pull!

796
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:36,876
Whoa.

797
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,416
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

798
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,123
And I understand
if you don't want
to help me anymore.

799
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:57,096
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

800
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:59,831
this whole thing has
ruined me for helping
anyone ever again.

801
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:00,932
It's this way?

802
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:03,168
"She'll die on her own."

803
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:05,168
I can live with that.

804
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:05,204
Here we go.

805
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:08,173
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."

806
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:09,842
I think, actually,
it's up.

807
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,309
Sometimes,
I really don't like you.

808
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,913
Hold up! We're coming.

809
00:44:13,913 --> 00:44:15,280
You are?

810
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,184
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.

811
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:30,496
Arendelle.

812
00:44:31,496 --> 00:44:33,496
It's completely frozen.

813
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:36,503
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

814
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,170
Will she?

815
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,005
Yeah. Now, come on.

816
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:41,507
This way
to the North Mountain?

817
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,143
More like this way.

818
00:45:18,443 --> 00:45:21,882
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

819
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,382
Yeah.

820
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:25,918
It really is beautiful,
isn't it?

821
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:27,521
But it's so white.

822
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:30,556
You know,
how about a little color?

823
00:45:30,556 --> 00:45:33,492
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

824
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:35,561
How about yellow?

825
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:37,496
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?

826
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,130
No go.

827
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:44,934
Am I right?

828
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,869
Hi.

829
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,137
You're creepy.

830
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:47,137
Whoa!

831
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:47,572
I don't want it.

832
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:49,572
Back at you.

833
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:49,074
Please don't drop me.

834
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:50,074
No.

835
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:50,442
Come on,
it's just a head.

836
00:45:50,442 --> 00:45:51,309
All right.
We got off to a bad start.

837
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:52,480
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

838
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:58,884
Wait, what am I looking
at right now?

839
00:45:58,884 --> 00:45:59,320
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

840
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,454
All right, wait one second.

841
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:04,155
Oh. Uh...

842
00:46:04,155 --> 00:46:05,490
Oh!

843
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,490
Thank you.

844
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,059
You're welcome.

845
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:07,027
Now, I'm perfect.

846
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,163
Well, almost.

847
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:12,032
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

848
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:15,867
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

849
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:17,867
Head rush!

850
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:17,402
I was just...
Are you okay?

851
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:20,572
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

852
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,907
I've always wanted a nose.

853
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,043
So cute.

854
00:46:24,043 --> 00:46:25,945
It's like a little
baby unicorn.

855
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:26,545
But... Hey! Whoa!

856
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:27,847
Oh.

857
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,315
I love it even more.

858
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:32,918
All right,
let's start this thing over.

859
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:33,853
Hi, everyone.

860
00:46:33,853 --> 00:46:35,086
I'm Olaf.

861
00:46:35,086 --> 00:46:35,556
And I like warm hugs.

862
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:38,161
Olaf?

863
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,030
That's right. Olaf.

864
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,333
And you are?

865
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,567
Oh. Um...

866
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:50,369
I'm Anna.

867
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,438
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

868
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:53,438
That's Sven.

869
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:53,005
Uh-huh.

870
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:54,641
And who's the reindeer?

871
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:57,876
Sven.

872
00:46:57,876 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things
easier for me.

873
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,481
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

874
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:05,481
I like you, too.

875
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:05,083
Olaf.

876
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,083
Did Elsa build you?

877
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,418
Yeah. Why?

878
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:08,487
Do you know
where she is?

879
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:09,487
Fascinating.

880
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:09,922
Yeah. Why?

881
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:11,056
Do you think you could
show us the way?

882
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:12,391
Yeah. Why?

883
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:14,260
How does this work? Ow!

884
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,262
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.

885
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,262
Yeah. Why?

886
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,963
I'll tell you why.

887
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:19,666
We need Elsa
to bring back summer.

888
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,666
Summer?

889
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,201
Mmm-hmm.

890
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:23,969
Oh. I don't know why,

891
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:27,472
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

892
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,643
And sun,
and all things hot.

893
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:32,510
Really?

894
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,380
I'm guessing you
don't have much
experience with heat.

895
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,347
Nope.

896
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:39,050
But sometimes
I like to close my eyes,

897
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,987
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

898
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:50,295
 ♪ Bees will buzz
 Kids will blow dandelion fuzz

899
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:54,268
 ♪ And I'll be doing
 Whatever snow does in summer

900
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:58,637

 ♪ I'll finally see

 ♪ Blow away a winter storm

906
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:12,083
 ♪ And find out
 what happens to solid water

907
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,588
 ♪ When it gets warm

908
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:18,724
 ♪ And I can't wait to see

909
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:21,327
 ♪ What my buddies
all think of me

910
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:23,461
 ♪ Just imagine
 how much cooler I'll be

911
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:25,297
 ♪ In summer!

912
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,737
 ♪ The hot and the cold
 are both so intense

913
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:35,039
 ♪ Put them together
 It just makes sense

00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:41,612

00:48:41,612 --> 00:48:42,449

 and I'll be a...

916
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:46,318
 ♪ Happy snowman!

917
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:47,652
 ♪ When life gets rough

918
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,588
 ♪ I like to hold
on to my dream

919
00:48:50,588 --> 00:48:54,628
 ♪ Relaxing in the summer sun
 Just letting off steam

920
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:58,230
 ♪ Oh, the sky

921
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,565
 ♪ Will be blue

922
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:02,168
 ♪ And you guys
 will be there, too

923
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:05,570
 ♪ When I finally do

924
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,775
 ♪ What frozen things do
 In summer!

925
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:11,775
I'm gonna tell him.

926
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:11,610
Don't you dare.

927
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,219
 ♪ In summer! ♪

928
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,387
So, come on!
Elsa's this way.

929
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:25,590
Let's go bring back summer!

930
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,590
I'm coming!

931
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:29,498
Somebody's gotta
tell him.

932
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:37,802
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.

933
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:39,670
The bark needs
to be face-up.

934
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,670
Bark down is drier.

935
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,173
Bark up!

936
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:43,173
Bark down!

937
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:43,342
Papa!

938
00:49:43,342 --> 00:49:45,077
Cloak? Does anyone
need a cloak?

939
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:48,047
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.

940
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:49,547
The castle is open.

941
00:49:49,547 --> 00:49:52,451
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

942
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,552
Here, pass these out.

943
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:55,420
Prince Hans!

944
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,157
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

945
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,826
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

946
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:02,161
Princess Anna
has given her orders.

947
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:04,630
And that's another thing!

948
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,465
Has it dawned on you
that your princess
may be conspiring

949
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:07,699
with a wicked sorceress

950
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:09,201
to destroy us all?

951
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,668
Do not question
the princess.

952
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,304
She left me in charge

953
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:13,704
and I will not hesitate

954
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:15,373
to protect Arendelle
from treason.

955
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:16,809
Treason?

956
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:23,449
Whoa! Whoa!

957
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:25,150
Whoa, boy. Easy.

958
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,684
Easy.

959
00:50:26,684 --> 00:50:28,186
It's Princess Anna's
horse.

960
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:30,222
So, where is
the princess?

961
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:30,222
Where could she be?

962
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:30,856
Where is she?

963
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:34,358
Princess Anna is in trouble.

964
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:36,862
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

965
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:38,862
I'll go.

966
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:38,297
I volunteer.

967
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:39,599
I volunteer
two men, My Lord.

968
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,434
Be prepared for anything.

969
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:45,436
And should you encounter
the queen,

970
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:47,306
you are to put an end
to this winter.

971
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,306
Do you understand?

972
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,579
Hmm.

973
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:56,449
So, how exactly
are you planning
to stop this weather?

974
00:50:57,449 --> 00:50:59,684
Oh. I am gonna
talk to my sister.

975
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,652
That's your plan?

976
00:51:01,652 --> 00:51:04,155
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

977
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:06,155
Yep.

978
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,793
So, you're not at all
afraid of her?

979
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:10,793
Why would I be?

980
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:10,128
Yeah.

981
00:51:10,128 --> 00:51:13,699
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

982
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:16,668
Oh. Look at that.

983
00:51:16,668 --> 00:51:18,740
I've been impaled.

984
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,576
What now?

985
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,311
Mmm...

986
00:51:27,311 --> 00:51:28,880
It's too steep.

987
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,182
I've only got one rope
and you don't know
how to climb mountains.

988
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:32,182
Says who?

989
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:33,253
Hmm?

990
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:35,521
What are you doing?

991
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:39,657
I'm going to see my sister.

992
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:41,559
You're gonna
kill yourself.

993
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,661
I wouldn't put
my foot there.

994
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,661
You're distracting me.

995
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,831
Or there.

996
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:47,666
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

997
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,434
All right.
I'm just blocking you out

998
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:50,471
because I gotta
concentrate, here.

999
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:53,771
You know,
most people who disappear

1000
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:54,407
into the mountains
want to be alone.

1001
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,742
Nobody wants to be alone.

1002
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,344
Except maybe you.

1003
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:01,282
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

1004
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:05,284
You mean,
the love experts?

1005
00:52:05,284 --> 00:52:06,552
Yes, the love experts.

1006
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:08,355
Ah...

1007
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:11,358
Please tell me
I'm almost there.

1008
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:15,393
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

1009
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:17,728
Hang on.

1010
00:52:17,728 --> 00:52:19,431
Hey, Sven?

1011
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,266
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem

1012
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,900
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

1013
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,369
where you wanted to go.

1014
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,304
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!

1015
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:29,420
Thanks. That was like
a crazy trust exercise.

1016
00:52:44,322 --> 00:52:45,489
Whoa.

1017
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:46,293
Now, that's ice.

1018
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,594
I might cry.

1019
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:51,664
Go ahead.
I won't judge.

1020
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,539
All right, take it easy,
boy. Come here.

1021
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:02,775
I got you.

1022
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:04,311
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.

1023
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:08,985
Flawless.

1024
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:14,255
Knock.

1025
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,889
Just knock.

1026
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:19,492
Why isn't
she knocking?

1027
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:22,297
Do you think
she knows how to knock?

1028
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,601
Huh.
It opened.

1029
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:31,869
That's a first.

1030
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:34,572
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

1031
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,572
What?

1032
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,375
The last time
I introduced her to a guy,

1033
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,842
she froze everything.

1034
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:39,978
But, but...
Oh, come on!

1035
00:53:39,978 --> 00:53:42,614
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

1036
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:43,648
Bye, Sven.

1037
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:45,817
You, too, Olaf.

1038
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:46,817
Me?

1039
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:46,719
Just give us a minute.

1040
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:48,355
Okay.

1041
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:51,657
One, two,

1042
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:53,657
three...

1043
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:53,563
Four...

1044
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:00,836
Whoa.

1045
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:06,873
Elsa?

1046
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,442
It's me, Anna.

1047
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:14,079
Anna.

1048
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:22,088
Whoa. Elsa,
you look different.

1049
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:24,023
It's a good different.

1050
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,724
And this place...

1051
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:28,393
It's amazing.

1052
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,795
Thank you.

1053
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:32,963
I never knew
what I was capable of.

1054
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,067
I'm so sorry
about what happened.
If I'd have known...

1055
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:36,001
No, no, no. It's okay.

1056
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:40,373
You don't have
to apologize, but you
should probably go.

1057
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:42,641
Please.

1058
00:54:42,641 --> 00:54:43,675
But I just got here.

1059
00:54:44,675 --> 00:54:45,344
You belong down
in Arendelle.

1060
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:47,612
So do you.

1061
00:54:47,612 --> 00:54:49,581
No, Anna,
I belong here.

1062
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:52,583
Alone.

1063
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,655
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

1064
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:59,523
Actually, about that...

1065
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,523
Sixty!

1066
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,827
Wait. What is that?

1067
00:55:01,827 --> 00:55:03,695
Hi! I'm Olaf
and I like warm hugs!

1068
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:05,731
Olaf?

1069
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:07,367
Yeah. You built me.

1070
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:09,934
Remember that?

1071
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:10,137
And you're alive?

1072
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:13,907
Um...
I think so.

1073
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:17,378
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

1074
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:20,079
Yeah.

1075
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,648
Elsa, we were so close.

1076
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:24,985
We can be like
that again.

1077
00:55:26,985 --> 00:55:27,018
- Catch me!
- Slow down!

1078
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:32,460
Anna!

1079
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,527
No.

1080
00:55:36,527 --> 00:55:39,063
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1081
00:55:39,063 --> 00:55:40,664
Elsa, wait.

1082
00:55:40,664 --> 00:55:42,833
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

1083
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,103
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1084
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:48,172

1112
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:58,943
You kind of set off
an eternal winter everywhere.

1113
00:56:58,943 --> 00:57:00,512
Everywhere?

1114
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:02,079
Well, it's okay,
you can just unfreeze it.

1115
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,215
No, I can't.
I don't know how.

00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:07,251

Are you okay?

1135
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,068
I'm okay.

1136
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:58,737
I'm fine.

1137
00:57:58,737 --> 00:57:59,938
Who's this?

1138
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:00,773
Wait, it doesn't matter.
Just...

1139
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,074
You have to go.

1140
00:58:03,074 --> 00:58:05,610
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1141
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,012
How?

1142
00:58:07,012 --> 00:58:08,213
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1143
00:58:09,213 --> 00:58:10,949
To stop me?

1144
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:12,317
Anna, I think we should go.

1145
00:58:12,317 --> 00:58:14,152
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1146
00:58:14,152 --> 00:58:15,688
Yes, you are.

1147
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:26,731
Stop! Put us down!

1148
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:27,731
Go away.

1149
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:32,871
Heads up!

1150
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:35,072
Watch out for my butt!

1151
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:39,978
It is not nice
to throw people!

1152
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:42,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
feisty-pants. Okay, relax.

1153
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:44,112
Just calm down! Calm down!

1154
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:44,648
Okay! All right!

1155
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,648
I'm okay.

1156
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,050
Just let the snowman be.

1157
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,050
I'm calm.

1158
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,318
Great.

1159
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,255
Oh! Come on!

1160
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,726
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1161
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:55,596
I'll distract him.
You guys go.

1162
00:58:57,596 --> 00:58:58,831
No, no! Not you guys!

1163
00:59:00,831 --> 00:59:01,168
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1164
00:59:04,902 --> 00:59:05,036
Look out!

1165
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:20,619
Run! Run!

1166
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:21,655
What are you doing?

1167
00:59:25,757 --> 00:59:27,291
I got him!

1168
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,994
Whoa! Stop!

1169
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:29,628
It's a 100-foot drop.

1170
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:31,795
It's 200.

1171
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:33,965
Ow!

1172
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,965
What's that for?

1173
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm digging a snow anchor.

1174
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,168
Okay. What if we fall?

1175
00:59:38,168 --> 00:59:40,070
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1176
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,405
It'll be like landing
on a pillow.

1177
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:42,907
Hopefully.

1178
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:47,978
Okay, Anna. On three.

1179
00:59:47,978 --> 00:59:49,347
- Okay.
- One...

1180
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:50,382
You tell me when.
I'm ready to go.

1181
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:51,382
Two...

1182
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:51,949
I was born ready! Yes!

1183
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:52,853
Calm down.

1184
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,222
Tree!

1185
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:58,824
What the... Whoa!

1186
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:00,762
That happened.

1187
01:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,063
Man,
am I out of shape.

1188
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,436
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1189
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:14,271
Sven! Where did
you guys go?

1190
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:15,675
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1191
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,878
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1192
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:21,246
All good things,
all good things.

1193
01:00:22,246 --> 01:00:23,682
No!

1194
01:00:27,217 --> 01:00:28,887
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1195
01:00:31,222 --> 01:00:32,690
Olaf!

1196
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,358
Hang in there, guys!

1197
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:35,460
Go. Go faster!

1198
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:38,762
Wait, what?

1199
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:38,831
Hey!

1200
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:45,170
Ow!

1201
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,737
Kristoff!

1202
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:49,809
Don't come back!

1203
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:51,911
We won't.

1204
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:03,253
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.

1205
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,356
Olaf!

1206
01:01:05,356 --> 01:01:07,492
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1207
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Those are my legs.

1208
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,496
Ooh!

1209
01:01:11,496 --> 01:01:12,831
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1210
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,099
Oh. That feels better.

1211
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:18,235
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1212
01:01:18,235 --> 01:01:20,137
Who's my cute
little reindeer?

1213
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:22,137
Don't talk to him like that.

1214
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:23,442
You're tickling me.

1215
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:25,077
Here.

1216
01:01:26,077 --> 01:01:27,211
Whoa!

1217
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:28,279
Are you okay?

1218
01:01:28,279 --> 01:01:29,048
Thank you.

1219
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:32,048
How's your head?

1220
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:32,182
Ah! Ooh!

1221
01:01:33,784 --> 01:01:35,320
It's fine. Uh...

1222
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,887
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.

1223
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:37,224
I don't have a skull.

1224
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:40,958
Or bones.

1225
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,762
So, uh...
So, now what?

1226
01:01:43,762 --> 01:01:45,262
Now what?

1227
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:46,764
Now what?

1228
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:48,199
Oh...

1229
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,068
What am I gonna do?

1230
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:52,070
She threw me out.

1231
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,105
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1232
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:55,072
And then there's
your ice business.

1233
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:57,510
Hey, hey. Don't worry
about my ice business.

1234
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,945
Worry about your hair!

1235
01:02:00,945 --> 01:02:02,514
What? I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1236
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,047
No, yours is
turning white.

1237
01:02:04,047 --> 01:02:07,251
White? It's...
What?

1238
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,454
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?

1239
01:02:09,454 --> 01:02:10,157
Does it look bad?

1240
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:13,157
No.

1241
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:13,490
You hesitated.

1242
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,425
No, I didn't.

1243
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:17,262
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1244
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:19,063
Okay! Where are we going?

1245
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:19,063
To see my friends.

1246
01:02:19,998 --> 01:02:21,398
The love experts?

1247
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,398
Love experts?

1248
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,934
Uh-huh.

1249
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,836
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1250
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:27,505
How do you know?

1251
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:29,543
Because I've seen them
do it before.

1252
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:33,878
I like to consider myself
a love expert.

1253
01:02:38,282 --> 01:02:39,585
Get it together.

1254
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:42,253
Control it.

1255
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:43,355
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1256
01:02:44,355 --> 01:02:46,157
Don't feel.

1257
01:02:46,157 --> 01:02:47,561
Don't feel!

1258
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:04,978
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1259
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:09,378
Are you cold?

1260
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:09,016
A little.

1261
01:03:13,016 --> 01:03:14,452
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1262
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:15,253
Huh?

1263
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:17,389
Ooh.

1264
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:22,559
So, uh, about my friends.
Well...

1265
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,061
I say "friends"...

1266
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,331
They're more like family.

1267
01:03:26,331 --> 01:03:29,333
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1268
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,501
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1269
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,501
They did?

1270
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,271
Yeah.

1271
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:34,606
I don't want to scare you.

1272
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:38,909
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1273
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:40,545
Very loud.

1274
01:03:40,545 --> 01:03:42,380
They are also stubborn
at times,

1275
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,914
and a little overbearing.

1276
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:46,650
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.

1277
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it.

01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:17,444
The queen.

1455
01:10:23,314 --> 01:10:24,949
Go, go!
Come on!

1456
01:10:28,418 --> 01:10:28,922
There!

1457
01:10:32,922 --> 01:10:34,358
Up there!

1458
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:35,627
Come on!

1459
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:38,063
We got her.

1460
01:10:39,063 --> 01:10:39,333
No. Please.

1461
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:45,037
Go around.
Toss it.

1462
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,672
Stay away!

1463
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:49,875
Look out!

1464
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:51,409
Fire! Fire!

1465
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:53,645
Get her!

1466
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:57,815
Ah!

1467
01:11:01,051 --> 01:11:02,623
Come on!

1468
01:11:12,496 --> 01:11:13,631
Grab his arm.

1469
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,439
Aim...

1470
01:11:45,829 --> 01:11:46,796
This way, this way!

1471
01:11:46,796 --> 01:11:47,067
Whoa!

1472
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:52,136
Queen Elsa!

1473
01:11:52,136 --> 01:11:53,704
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1474
01:12:42,653 --> 01:12:43,890
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?

1475
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:53,663
Why did you
bring me here?

1476
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:55,498
I couldn't just
let them kill you.

1477
01:12:55,498 --> 01:12:58,935
But I'm a danger
to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1478
01:12:58,935 --> 01:13:00,935
Anna has not returned.

1479
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:04,908
If you would just
stop the winter.

1480
01:13:04,908 --> 01:13:06,578
Bring back summer, please.

1481
01:13:08,578 --> 01:13:09,480
Don't you see?

1482
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,783
I can't.

1483
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:17,657
You have to tell them
to let me go.

1484
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:20,029
I will do what I can.

1485
01:13:45,515 --> 01:13:46,750
Just hang in there.

1486
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,755
Come on, buddy, faster!

1487
01:13:53,823 --> 01:13:55,125
Oh, boy!

1488
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,560
Whoa! I'll meet you guys
at the castle!

1489
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,695
Stay out
of sight, Olaf.

1490
01:13:58,695 --> 01:13:59,631
I will!

1491
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:03,631
Hello!

1492
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:03,810
It's alive!

1493
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:13,113
It's Princess Anna!

1494
01:14:22,786 --> 01:14:24,623
Are you
gonna be okay?

1495
01:14:26,623 --> 01:14:28,559
Don't worry about me.

1496
01:14:28,559 --> 01:14:29,560
Anna!

1497
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,560
You had us worried sick.

1498
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,563
My Lady.

1499
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:34,032
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1500
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:36,867
We will. Thank you.

1501
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:38,935
Make sure she's safe.

1502
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:40,804
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1503
01:14:40,804 --> 01:14:43,644
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1504
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,323
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1505
01:14:59,323 --> 01:15:01,190
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1506
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,725
If anything happens to her...

1507
01:15:02,725 --> 01:15:04,595
If anything happens
to the princess,

1508
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:06,565
you are all
Arendelle has left.

1509
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:10,100
He's in here.

1510
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,135
Prince Hans.

1511
01:15:11,135 --> 01:15:12,735
Anna.

1512
01:15:12,735 --> 01:15:14,137
You're so cold.

1513
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:15,137
Hans, you have
to kiss me.

1514
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:15,139
What?

1515
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:17,139
Now! Now!

1516
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:17,041
Slow down.

1517
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,643
We'll give you two
some privacy.

1518
01:15:19,643 --> 01:15:20,978
What happened out there?

1519
01:15:20,978 --> 01:15:22,012
Elsa struck me
with her powers.

1520
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:24,213
You said she would
never hurt you.

1521
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:25,282
I was wrong.

1522
01:15:25,282 --> 01:15:26,351
Anna.

1523
01:15:29,653 --> 01:15:31,755
She froze my heart,

1524
01:15:31,755 --> 01:15:33,626
and only an act
of true love can save me.

1525
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:36,203
A true love's kiss.

1526
01:15:47,203 --> 01:15:48,774
Oh, Anna.

1527
01:15:50,774 --> 01:15:52,077
If only there was
someone out there
who loved you.

1528
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:54,114
What?

1529
01:15:58,114 --> 01:15:59,118
You said you did.

1530
01:16:01,118 --> 01:16:02,086
As thirteenth in line

1531
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:03,921
in my own kingdom,

1532
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:05,288
I didn't stand a chance.

1533
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:07,858
I knew I would have
to marry into

1534
01:16:07,858 --> 01:16:09,225
the throne somewhere.

1535
01:16:09,225 --> 01:16:11,194
What... What are
you talking about?

1536
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:13,963
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1537
01:16:13,963 --> 01:16:15,666
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1538
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:16,666
But you...

1539
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:16,899
Hans!

1540
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:18,301
You were so desperate
for love,

1541
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:20,773
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1542
01:16:22,773 --> 01:16:24,875
I figured
after we married,

1543
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,810
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1544
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:28,912
Hans!
No. Stop.

1545
01:16:28,912 --> 01:16:31,247
But then,
she doomed herself,

1546
01:16:31,247 --> 01:16:32,949
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1547
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:34,949
Please.

1548
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,087
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1549
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:38,088
and bring back summer.

1550
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:41,158
You're no match for Elsa.

1551
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:42,161
No, you're no
match for Elsa.

1552
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:46,296
I, on the other hand,

1553
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:49,135
am the hero who is
going to save Arendelle
from destruction.

1554
01:16:51,135 --> 01:16:52,903
You won't get
away with this.

1555
01:16:52,903 --> 01:16:53,938
Oh...

1556
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:55,006
I already have.

1557
01:17:02,145 --> 01:17:03,149
Please, somebody, help.

1558
01:17:07,784 --> 01:17:09,055
Please. Please.

1559
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:15,125
It's getting colder
by the minute.

1560
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,295
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1561
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:20,130
Prince Hans.

1562
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,765
Princess Anna is...

1563
01:17:22,765 --> 01:17:24,134
Dead.

1564
01:17:24,134 --> 01:17:25,134
What?

1565
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,805
What happened to her?

1566
01:17:31,274 --> 01:17:32,277
She was killed.

1567
01:17:33,277 --> 01:17:34,778
By Queen Elsa.

1568
01:17:34,778 --> 01:17:35,113
No!

1569
01:17:36,113 --> 01:17:36,381
Her own sister.

1570
01:17:38,381 --> 01:17:39,886
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1571
01:17:42,886 --> 01:17:44,823
before she died in my arms.

1572
01:17:46,823 --> 01:17:48,826
There can be no doubt now.

1573
01:17:48,826 --> 01:17:50,226
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1574
01:17:50,226 --> 01:17:52,195
and we are all
in grave danger.

1575
01:17:52,195 --> 01:17:53,131
Prince Hans,

1576
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:55,768
Arendelle looks to you.

1577
01:17:57,768 --> 01:17:59,936
With a heavy heart,

1578
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:03,440
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1579
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,113
And sentence her to death.

1580
01:18:18,956 --> 01:18:20,224
Hurry up!

1581
01:18:20,224 --> 01:18:21,492
She's dangerous.

1582
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:22,492
Move quickly.

1583
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:22,859
Careful.

1584
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:26,528
It won't open!

1585
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:26,130
It's frozen shut.

1586
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:27,363
Put your back
into it!

1587
01:18:27,363 --> 01:18:28,998
Come on! Push!

1588
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,159
What is it, buddy?

1589
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,228
Hey, watch it.

1590
01:18:58,228 --> 01:18:59,328
What's wrong with you?

1591
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,435
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1592
01:19:05,435 --> 01:19:07,537
Stop it!
Put me down!

1593
01:19:10,006 --> 01:19:11,440
No, Sven!

1594
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,440
We're not going back.

1595
01:19:13,042 --> 01:19:14,079
She's with her true love.

1596
01:19:21,518 --> 01:19:22,221
What the...

1597
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:26,856
Anna!

1598
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:33,432
Come on!
Come on, boy.

1599
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:53,185
Help.

1600
01:19:58,387 --> 01:19:59,890
Anna!

1601
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,030
Oh, no.

1602
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:16,371
Olaf?

1603
01:20:16,038 --> 01:20:17,408
Olaf. Get away
from there.

1604
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:19,210
Wow!

1605
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,479
So, this is heat.

1606
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:24,247
I love it.

1607
01:20:24,247 --> 01:20:25,618
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1608
01:20:34,257 --> 01:20:37,627
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1609
01:20:37,627 --> 01:20:42,064
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1610
01:20:42,064 --> 01:20:43,900
But we ran
all the way here.

1611
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:47,237
Please, Olaf, you can't
stay here. You'll melt.

1612
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:48,271
I am not leaving
here until

1613
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:49,240
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1614
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,476
Do you happen to have
any ideas?

1615
01:20:53,476 --> 01:20:54,244
I don't even know
what love is.

1616
01:20:55,244 --> 01:20:56,247
That's okay, I do.

1617
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:58,082
Love is

1618
01:21:00,082 --> 01:21:03,520
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1619
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,059
Like, you know, how Kristoff
brought you back here
to Hans and left you forever.

1620
01:21:09,059 --> 01:21:11,030
Kristoff loves me?

1621
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,701
Wow, you really
don't know anything
about love, do you?

1622
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:19,002
Olaf, you're melting.

1623
01:21:20,002 --> 01:21:21,574
Some people are
worth melting for.

1624
01:21:27,444 --> 01:21:28,246
Just maybe not right
this second.

1625
01:21:31,547 --> 01:21:32,582
Don't worry,
I've got it.

1626
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:37,954
We're gonna get through...
Oh, wait.

1627
01:21:37,954 --> 01:21:38,524
Hang on,
I'm getting something.

1628
01:21:40,524 --> 01:21:42,025
It's Kristoff
and Sven!

1629
01:21:43,025 --> 01:21:43,528
They're coming back this way.

1630
01:21:44,528 --> 01:21:46,462
They... They are?

1631
01:21:46,462 --> 01:21:49,065
Wow! He's really
moving fast.

1632
01:21:49,065 --> 01:21:50,701
I guess I was wrong.

1633
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:52,537
I guess Kristoff doesn't
love you enough
to leave you behind.

1634
01:21:53,537 --> 01:21:56,073
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1635
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:58,641
No, no, no!
You need to stay
by the fire and keep warm.

1636
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:00,243
I need to get to Kristoff.

1637
01:22:00,243 --> 01:22:01,979
Why?

1638
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:04,015
Oh, I know why!

1639
01:22:05,015 --> 01:22:07,617
There's your act
of true love right there!

1640
01:22:07,617 --> 01:22:10,619
Riding across the fjords
like a valiant,
pungent reindeer king!

1641
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:11,488
Come on!

1642
01:22:14,524 --> 01:22:16,193
Look out!

1643
01:22:16,193 --> 01:22:17,494
Oh!

1644
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:26,337
Uh... Back this way.

1645
01:22:27,337 --> 01:22:28,006
We're trapped.

1646
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,755
Oh...

1647
01:22:46,323 --> 01:22:47,060
Whoa!

1648
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,197
Slide, Anna!

1649
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:02,541
We made it!

1650
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,212
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

1651
01:23:18,555 --> 01:23:19,791
Come on, buddy, faster.

1652
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:23,127
Kristoff!

1653
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:30,436
Keep going!

1654
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:34,582
Kristoff!

1655
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:47,256
Come on!

1656
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:02,202
No.

1657
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:19,756
Whoa!

1658
01:24:26,756 --> 01:24:28,759
Whoa!

1659
01:24:29,759 --> 01:24:31,568
Sven... Sven!

1660
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,511
Good boy.

1661
01:24:54,885 --> 01:24:55,487
Kristoff.

1662
01:24:57,487 --> 01:24:58,487
Kristoff...

1663
01:24:57,487 --> 01:24:58,788
Anna...

1664
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:00,426
Anna!

1665
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:07,432
Elsa! You can't
run from this!

1666
01:25:10,432 --> 01:25:12,335
Just take care of my sister.

1667
01:25:12,335 --> 01:25:14,337
Your sister?

1668
01:25:14,337 --> 01:25:16,907
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1669
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:18,841
She said that
you froze her heart.

1670
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:20,342
No.

1671
01:25:20,342 --> 01:25:21,747
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1672
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:25,516
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.

1673
01:25:27,516 --> 01:25:28,786
Your sister is dead.

1674
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:31,587
Because of you.

1675
01:25:31,587 --> 01:25:32,527
No.

1676
01:25:55,412 --> 01:25:56,713
Kristoff.

1677
01:25:57,713 --> 01:25:58,390
Anna!

1678
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:12,565
Elsa?

1679
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:21,344
No!

1680
01:26:34,717 --> 01:26:35,519
Anna!

1681
01:26:36,519 --> 01:26:37,954
Oh. Anna!

1682
01:26:38,954 --> 01:26:41,557
No, no!

1683
01:26:41,557 --> 01:26:42,894
Please, no.

1684
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:52,935
Anna?

1685
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:34,712
Anna?

1686
01:27:37,913 --> 01:27:39,783
Oh, Elsa.

1687
01:27:39,783 --> 01:27:41,619
You sacrificed yourself
for me?

1688
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:45,689
I love you.

1689
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:49,594
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."

1690
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:52,564
"Love will thaw."

1691
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:56,932
Love. Of course.

1692
01:27:56,932 --> 01:27:57,635
Elsa?

1693
01:27:58,635 --> 01:27:59,070
Love!

1694
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,018
I knew you could do it.

1695
01:28:49,018 --> 01:28:52,788
Hands down, this is
the best day of my life.

1696
01:28:52,788 --> 01:28:54,623
And, quite possibly,
the last.

1697
01:28:54,623 --> 01:28:56,092
Oh, Olaf!
Hang on, little guy.

1698
01:28:57,092 --> 01:28:58,561
Oh, oh, oh!

1699
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,400
My own personal flurry!

1700
01:29:08,604 --> 01:29:09,443
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1701
01:29:13,443 --> 01:29:14,743
Anna?

1702
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:16,912
But she froze your heart.

1703
01:29:16,912 --> 01:29:18,649
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1704
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,720
Wonderful!

1705
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:40,104
Setting course, sir.

1706
01:29:44,474 --> 01:29:46,010
I will return this scoundrel
to his country.

1707
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:50,712
We shall see
what his 12 big brothers
think of his behavior.

1708
01:29:50,712 --> 01:29:52,114
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1709
01:29:52,114 --> 01:29:54,184
This is unacceptable.

1710
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:57,052
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1711
01:29:57,052 --> 01:29:59,622
Ah! My neck hurts.

1712
01:29:59,622 --> 01:30:02,926
Is there a doctor that
I could see?

1713
01:30:02,926 --> 01:30:05,595
And I demand
to see the queen!

1714
01:30:05,595 --> 01:30:07,963
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.

1715
01:30:07,963 --> 01:30:10,033
"Arendelle will
henceforth and forever

1716
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:13,735
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown."

1717
01:30:13,735 --> 01:30:15,137
"Weselton."

1718
01:30:15,137 --> 01:30:16,137
It's Weselton!

1719
01:30:15,137 --> 01:30:16,738
Let's go.

1720
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:18,738
Come on, come on, come on!

1721
01:30:18,707 --> 01:30:20,176
Okay, okay, here I come.

1722
01:30:20,176 --> 01:30:22,176
Pole!

1723
01:30:20,176 --> 01:30:22,244
Whoops! Sorry.

1724
01:30:22,244 --> 01:30:23,880
Okay, okay.

1725
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,149
Here we are. Oh!

1726
01:30:27,951 --> 01:30:29,055
I owe you a sled.

1727
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:35,055
Are you serious?

1728
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:35,091
Yes!

1729
01:30:35,091 --> 01:30:36,826
And it's the latest model.

1730
01:30:36,826 --> 01:30:38,728
No, I can't accept this.

1731
01:30:38,728 --> 01:30:41,030
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1732
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:45,667
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master
and Deliverer.

1733
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:47,667
What? That's not a thing.

1734
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:47,670
Oh, sure it is.

1735
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:50,806
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1736
01:30:50,806 --> 01:30:53,109
Like it? I love it!

1737
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:54,109
Whoa.

1738
01:30:54,077 --> 01:30:55,845
I could kiss you!

1739
01:30:56,845 --> 01:30:58,981
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

1740
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:00,682
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1741
01:31:00,682 --> 01:31:01,819
Wait, what?

1742
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:03,220
We may.

1743
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,957
Mmm.

1744
01:31:07,957 --> 01:31:08,826
Summer!

1745
01:31:10,993 --> 01:31:13,296
Ooh...

1746
01:31:13,296 --> 01:31:15,532
Hello.

1747
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,849
Are you ready?

1748
01:31:38,887 --> 01:31:39,887
Ice!

1749
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,136
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1750
01:31:53,136 --> 01:31:54,637
Swing me.

1751
01:31:55,637 --> 01:31:57,739
Ooh...

1752
01:31:57,739 --> 01:31:59,841
I like the open gates.

1753
01:31:59,841 --> 01:32:00,145
We are never
closing them again.

1754
01:32:04,881 --> 01:32:06,949
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1755
01:32:06,949 --> 01:32:08,952
Come on!
You can do it!

1756
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:11,688
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1757
01:32:11,688 --> 01:32:12,788
I got it, I got it. I don't
got it, I don't got it.

1758
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:14,122
Hey, guys!

1759
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:15,122
That's it, Olaf.

1760
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:18,627
Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.

1761
01:32:18,627 --> 01:32:20,229
Go.

1762
01:41:43,725 --> 01:41:44,594
Oh!
