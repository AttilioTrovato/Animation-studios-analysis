1
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,318
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetie.

2
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,195
Daddy. lt's early.

3
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,234
l know. l just wanted you to know,
l'm sending you something.

4
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,790
- Does it smell nice?
- No, but it's sparkly.

5
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,712
- Does it have a receipt?
- l'm sending it to you from the store.

6
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,839
Come by. We'll have some breakfast.

7
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,235
lt would be a long trip.

8
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,674
l'm in Venice.

9
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,916
With your parole officer's approval?

10
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,999
l like the guy, Stella,
but we never really connected.

11
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,078
So l think l've paid my PO his last visit.

12
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,319
What are you into? Don't break
my heart. You said you were through.

13
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,034
After this, l am. l swear to you.

14
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,437
- ls Charlie there?
- l'm on a cellphone.

15
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,192
l'll call you tomorrow from a landline.
l love you. Go back to sleep. Bye.

16
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,035
Dad?

17
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,119
l love you, too.

18
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,274
- l sent it.
- You're supposed to shop after the job.

19
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,109
l feel so optimistic. How do you feel?

20
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,832
- Fine.
- Fine?

21
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,350
- You know what fine stands for?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

22
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,232
- Freaked-out...
- lnsecure...

23
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,635
- Neurotic...
- And emotional.

24
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,992
- See those columns behind you?
- What about them?

25
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,988
That's where they strung up
thieves who felt fine.

26
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,714
Well, after you.

27
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,588
- For after the haul.
- Hope l'll get to fire it up.

28
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,756
No word from the garbage men?

29
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,795
No. They don't show, prep's wasted
and you're out of retirement for nothing.

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,519
This is fun. You've taken over the reins,
the worries. l'm just along for the ride.

31
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,756
Glad you're enjoying yourself, John.

32
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,953
Police boat can get to us in seven, so
you've four minutes to work your magic.

33
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,756
- You told me ten and said l'd have five.
- When?

34
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,551
Do not mess with me.

35
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,070
- l will kick your ass.
- Yeah? Take your best shot.

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,554
What?

37
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,351
Come on, let's go.
What is it this time?

38
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
Da Vinci. Architect, engineer, painter.

39
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,550
- Fascinating.
- Check this out.

40
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,356
''Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex...''

41
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,314
Unlike you, my friend, l don't need
a guidebook. Can we go?

42
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,798
- Right, guvnor.
- Make yourself useful. Untie that line.

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,036
- Today.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,710
Yeah, Gilligan, if you don't mind.

45
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,154
We set?

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,511
Yeah. The viewing matrix
tracks the Cartesian coordinates

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,632
and altitude angles
to give the exact position of our baby.

48
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,515
- We're in ltaly. Speak English.
- Steve, how we looking?

49
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,032
Papa took the boat at 8.1 5,
so the garage is empty.

50
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,472
Mama left with daughter at 8.30
for pre-school, as usual,

51
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,116
so for the next 45 minutes,
we own this place.

52
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,436
Still no word from the garbage men?

53
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,792
Who got you the Budapest beekeepers?
You can trust these guys.

54
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,355
How many times must l tell you?

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,599
Trust everyone,
but not the devil inside them.

56
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,996
We're in.

57
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,434
Just tell me where to paint.

58
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,192
- Your men still not in position?
- They will be.

59
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,153
You don't know that. We should abort.

60
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
l think that's Charlie's call now.

61
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,719
Our baby's being taken away tonight.
This is our only shot.

62
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,950
- Charlie?
- Keep going?

63
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,758
- lt's up to you, kid.
- Let's go.

64
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,391
OK, Steve.

65
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,073
From the west wall,
measure 1 4 feet 8 inches.

66
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,559
- Got it.
- 8 feet 5 inches from the north wall.

67
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,513
That's the northwest corner of our baby.

68
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,792
- Got it.
- Well, it's right above you.

69
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,874
Now, paint. 2 feet 9 inches wide,
2 feet 5 inches deep.

70
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,630
OK, Left Ear, you're up.
1 4 feet 4 inches from that west wall.

71
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,598
The garbage men are in position, John.

72
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,395
They've got the safe in the boat!

73
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,555
Someone just called it in.
The police boat's heading your way.

74
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,433
Seven minutes and counting. Let's go.

75
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,670
We've got four minutes. Let's go.

76
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,032
Hey, you guys. Come here.

77
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,872
l want to propose a toast.

78
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,036
To us!

79
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,994
And l want to propose a toast to Charlie.

80
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,432
We just stole 35 million dollars worth
of gold without even holding a gun

81
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,676
because he planned this down to a T.

82
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,917
Nobody else could've done that. Charlie!

83
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,638
So, come on. Shopping lists. Who's
doing what? Spare no dirty details.

84
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,439
Come on, guys. Take a lesson from
an old man. Don't spend it. lnvest.

85
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,359
- ln what?
- ln gold.

86
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,716
- Let's get out of here first.
- What are you getting, Rob?

87
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,639
l don't know.
There's a lot of things you can buy.

88
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,756
l'm thinking of naked girls and leather
seats. l'll get the Aston Martin Vanquish.

89
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,997
There's little a girl
won't do in one of those.

90
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,275
l'm getting a NAD T7 70 digital decoder,
70-watt amps and Burr-Brown DACs.

91
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,315
lt's a big stereo with speakers so loud
they blow women's clothes off.

92
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,751
$35 million and you can't get more
creative than that?

93
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,316
l'm going to Andalusia, south of Spain,

94
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,913
get me a big house, a library
of first editions, a room for my shoes.

95
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,271
- What about you, Steve?
- l haven't decided yet.

96
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,870
You haven't decided yet?!
ls it the mountain air?

97
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,914
l liked what you said.
l'll take one each of yours.

98
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,957
Well, two of everything for Steve.

99
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,150
l loved the toast. But you could've
pulled this off with your eyes closed.

100
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,749
You were just incredible.

101
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,669
You saw the whole picture
and covered all the angles.

102
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,670
Charlie, there are two kinds
of thieves in this world.

103
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,474
The ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

104
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,752
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

105
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,318
Don't be the latter. You miss out
on what's really important in this life.

106
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,516
What are you talking about?
You've been a good father.

107
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,030
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

108
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,997
l've spent half my kid's life in prison.
Don't get to my age with only this.

109
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,559
Find somebody you want to spend the
rest of your life with. And hold on to her.

110
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,957
Hey, let's go. l'm freezing my ass off.

111
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,679
- Steve's getting cold. You, too?
- l'm all right.

112
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,077
- l love you, kid. You did really great.
- Thanks, John.

113
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,996
Let's go.

114
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,750
Rob was driving that boat
like Don Johnson!

115
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,669
- Yeah, from Brixton.
- What do you know about Brixton?

116
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,311
Look at this idiot
in the middle of the road.

117
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,158
What's this?

118
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,160
Who the hell are these guys?

119
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,311
- Take your hands off the wheel.
- Steve.

120
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,877
Just do it.

121
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,999
No, John.

122
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,193
- What the hell are you doing?
- Made a few plans of my own.

123
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,433
There's nowhere you can go
we won't find you.

124
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,517
l think that's probably right.

125
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,077
Go! Go!

126
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,913
We've got to go, Charlie.

127
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,118
- Do you always work in the dark?
- Makes me feel l'm alone.

128
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,996
Not bad, Stella.

129
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,998
- Purley couldn't crack that safe.
- Neither could Spears.

130
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,998
- You know who to call first.
- You're expensive.

131
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,670
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs, goodwill...

132
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,589
l do it for the money.
l'll send you a bill.

133
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,997
- Don't you want to see inside?
- l never look inside.

134
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,430
Have a good day. Hey, George.

135
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,793
- How long to crack it?
- Four minutes, 43 seconds.

136
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,434
- You're the man.
- What's in the line-up?

137
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,395
Todd Millikan called. He has
a prototype lock he wants you to test.

138
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,239
He added two false contact points
on the tumbler.

139
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,238
l'll pretend to be stumped
for a second or two.

140
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,594
And there's a Charlie Croker in your
office. Says you know each other.

141
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,716
- Charlie Croker.
- Hi, Stella.

142
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,791
Didn't l tell you
l never want to see you again?

143
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,314
lt was when you told me my father died
after you pulled him in for one last job.

144
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,153
We found him, Stella.
He's in Los Angeles.

145
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,672
The gold bricks he stole from us had
a Balinese dancer stamped on them.

146
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,271
My contact, Skinny Pete, says an LA
dealer's been buying those bricks.

147
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,156
- How do you know it's him?
- Skinny Pete sent me this.

148
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,158
Steve changed his last name to Frizelli.

149
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,028
- Why tell me this?
- l checked high-end safe companies.

150
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,118
Steve had a Worthington 1 000
delivered to his home office.

151
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,199
You install a Worthington 1 000 only
if you've got something big to guard.

152
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,473
No one on my crew can handle it.
l need somebody l can trust.

153
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,353
l'm a safe technician. l'm not a thief.

154
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,793
lt's not about the gold, Stella.
John was like a father to me, too.

155
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,110
l'm sorry. l can't move on
until l've set things right.

156
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,475
l've moved on.

157
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,074
Come on, then, Charlie. Come on.

158
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,632
l want to see his face
when his gold is gone.

159
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,798
He took my father, l'm taking this.

160
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,715
- She's in.
- That's a good thing?

161
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,559
She can crack the Worthington 1 000
without flinching.

162
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,194
l'm not sure
hiring a civilian's a good idea.

163
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,995
- She's got the skills and the motivation.
- Exactly.

164
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,192
She's emotional.
You know what happens then.

165
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,394
Don't kid yourself. We're all
emotional on this one. Let's go.

166
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,158
- Are you ready?
- Course l am.

167
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,038
You're not ready.

168
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,074
- That was quick.
- Where are they?

169
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,876
We're a little early.
l didn't expect us to get here that fast.

170
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,470
There. That's Lyle.
He's my computer genius.

171
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,073
He's who really invented Napster.
At least, that's how he tells it.

172
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,955
Said Shawn Fanning was his college
room-mate and stole his idea.

173
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,110
l think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

174
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,271
- You OK?
- Yeah.

175
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,949
That's Left Ear.
Demolition and explosives.

176
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,948
When he was ten he put too many
M80s in the toilet bowl.

177
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,955
- Cool! How did you do that?
- What?

178
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,233
- How did you do that?
- What?

179
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,670
What?

180
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,429
Lost hearing in his right ear.
Blown stuff up ever since.

181
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,034
Handsome Rob. Premier wheelman.

182
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,438
Once drove from LA just so
he could set the freeway chase record.

183
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,874
He got 1 1 0 love letters from women
who saw him on the news.

184
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,789
And you? l never heard
how you got your start.

185
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,312
Me? Well, l've been a thief
since l had baby teeth.

186
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,152
- OK, you both know what to do.
- Cough it up now.

187
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,912
Watch it, spas!
What's your problem, man?

188
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,792
- Hey, Charlie.
- Good to see you.

189
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,230
Good to see you.

190
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,908
- Hello, Charlie.
- You good?

191
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,429
Guys, Stella Bridger.

192
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,752
- Nice to meet you.
- Phones.

193
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,159
They're all clean, with internal chips.
Change daily, we will get heat online.

194
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,430
lDs?

195
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,396
James Hymen?
One time give me a cool name.

196
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,433
- 1 40 pounds? Try 1 65.
- Try lifting some weights.

197
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,474
- Try lifting up these.
- We leave tomorrow, all right?

198
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:15,229
- Handsome, help him with the bike.
- Help Knievel set up his next jump.

199
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,638
Out of all the places for a thief to hide,
this joker picked Hollywood.

200
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,831
He's a punk, but he ain't stupid.

201
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,875
We need a way to make a blueprint
of the inside of Steve's house.

202
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,277
- l want phone surveillance.
- l want to try something.

203
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,439
l'll fool the phone company into
thinking there's a legal tap on the line

204
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,111
and re-route the copies of the calls to us.
Been doing it to my ex for years.

205
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,711
How long...will it take? Not, how
long have you been doing it to your ex?

206
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,675
- l'll have it running by morning.
- Sorry l'm late.

207
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,919
We gotta get Steve out of the house.
How much time do you need?

208
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,873
- Five minutes flat.
- Don't be cocky.

209
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,356
lt's not the same as opening a safe
for the police.

210
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,112
Perspiration on your fingertips, heart's
pounding. Whole different ball game.

211
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,551
l appreciate your concern. l'll be fine.

212
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,070
This is the easy part.
The getaway can get us caught.

213
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,033
- What's the schedule?
- Drive to Union Station.

214
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,712
Car goes onto the train. We need to
know exactly how long to Union Station.

215
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,030
- Oh, great. Carson security system.
- How good is it?

216
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,313
Carson's hold an annual contest.
$50,000 if you can bypass the system.

217
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,958
lt's a who's who of ex-cons.
Five years running, no one's been paid.

218
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,071
Here's the status.

219
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,317
An anti-scaling fence,
hardened electro-plated steel.

220
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,478
l'll have to paint that up
with some nitromon.

221
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,879
- Security?
- A little rent-a-cop with a 9 mm.

222
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,834
That security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

223
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,316
Nitromon, chemical grenades?
That stuff's hard to come by.

224
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,548
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market... Shit!

225
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,468
This dude got dogs. l don't do dogs.
l had a real bad experience.

226
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,676
- What happened?
- l had a bad experience. l'm deaf?!

227
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,958
''Turn in your badge
and your weapon...'' Crush.

228
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,833
''l don't want you anywhere
near this investigation.

229
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,552
''...your badge and your weapon.

230
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,309
''l don't want you
anywhere near this investigation.''

231
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,397
Oi! lt's a green!

232
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,712
Green!

233
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,234
Unbelievable.

234
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,029
There he is.

235
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,828
Let's get to work.

236
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,277
lt's either bad traffic, peak traffic
or slit-your-wrist traffic.

237
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,517
Five people died from smoking
between traffic lights.

238
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,598
You could always use the metro.

239
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,395
That would be ideal for carrying
a tonne of gold.

240
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,477
What's your guesstimate?

241
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,435
From 20 journeys, l got an average
of 32 minutes and a top time of 50.

242
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,438
But with green lights,
we could do it in 1 4 minutes.

243
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,871
What, you couldn't get through traffic?

244
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,351
You could do anything
with green lights all the way.

245
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,672
l'll see what l can do.

246
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,160
You're right on time.

247
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,356
These people putting their savings
in banks, S and Ls, mutual funds...

248
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,553
Do they think when the collapse comes
they can depend on the government?

249
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,513
- l don't think so.
- Are you taping me?

250
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,429
Of course not. l never tape you.
See for yourself.

251
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,356
Governments are nothing more
than puppets on strings.

252
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,348
ln a world where NAFTA can
overrule the Supreme Court,

253
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,348
like my cousin Mashkov always says,
''This is our only refuge, baby.''

254
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,037
Gold.

255
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,314
Every time l look at these engravings...
She's so beautiful.

256
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,196
- Where did you say you got these?
- l didn't.

257
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,392
A little ''walking around'' money.

258
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,839
- l'm not walking as far as l thought.
- l can only buy two today.

259
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,396
- That wasn't the agreement.
- l'm just middleman.

260
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:49,152
- l'll buy the other two on Wednesday.
- Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

261
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,874
So, what does a man with 35 million
dollars worth of gold do at night?

262
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,270
He watches his big-ass TV.

263
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,718
That's our in.

264
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,436
Jesus!

265
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,509
- How did you get in here?
- l knocked but you didn't answer.

266
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,635
- So you just let yourself in?
- l was checking you were OK. l'm sorry.

267
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,671
Don't look.

268
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,074
OK.

269
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,270
You've got a lot of stuff.
Your dad was old school.

270
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,519
- Did the whole thing by touch.
- lt worked for him. This works for me.

271
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,915
Technology guarantees
speed and accuracy.

272
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,990
There's no guarantees in this business,
Stella. Why the headphones?

273
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,159
Just training myself. Ambient noises,
you know. Just in case.

274
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,639
- What do you want?
- We're knocking out Steve's cable.

275
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,515
- Then we send in a repair man.
- To get your video blueprint?

276
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,508
Yeah. The problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

277
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,838
Except me.

278
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,878
l'll do it, Charlie. l'm in all the way.
Whatever it takes.

279
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,991
- All right. l'll set it up.
- OK.

280
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,433
You want to get a drink with me
before l go back to my room?

281
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,830
l should finish this stuff up.
Get it all done tonight.

282
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,636
- Yeah. Sorry l scared you.
- lt's OK.

283
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,273
Goodnight.

284
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,078
Bye.

285
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,236
Then he's the media darling,
on all the magazine covers.

286
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,431
l should've been on
Wired magazine's cover.

287
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,033
He said he named it Napster because
of his nickname, his nappy hair,

288
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,028
but it's 'cause l was napping
when he stole it from me.

289
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,473
- He didn't even graduate.
- l think it's time to move on, don't you?

290
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,355
They shut him down.
l wish they'd do the same to you.

291
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,238
Here. Here we go. Cable chick.

292
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,595
Becky. Nice name.
l wonder what she calls the other one.

293
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,588
lt's such a mystery
why you don't have a girlfriend.

294
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,396
All we need is a service truck
like that, a work-shirt like hers...

295
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,551
- Think Stella can pull it off?
- l have my doubts.

296
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,320
There's no talking to Charlie, though.

297
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,439
You think he's mixing business
with pleasure?

298
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,269
He should know better.
Only l'm allowed to do that.

299
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,551
Right. Where are you going?

300
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,469
The work-shirt and the service truck.

301
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,393
Are you kidding me?

302
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,318
How does he do that? How do you
do that? What are you saying?

303
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,114
''Hey, how are you?''
''l'm good.''

304
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,279
''Nice to meet you,
l'm Handsome Rob, and you are...?''

305
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,994
''My name's Becky. lt's on my shirt.''

306
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,272
''l need your shirt and your truck.''

307
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,950
''Perfect. Would you like
my virginity as well?''

308
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,472
''lf it's on the menu.''
''You're so witty. Take advantage of me.''

309
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,559
''You're not too bright, are you?''
''No.'' ''Perfect.''

310
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,274
- Yes, Mr Frizelli.
- The cable's out.

311
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,632
The TV, the modem, everything.
Get somebody up here quick.

312
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,278
Netcom Cable.

313
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,359
l'm at 3320 East Skyway
and the cable's gone.

314
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,908
- l have a Thursday between 9 and 3.
- That's good. Thank you.

315
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,634
Guard just called the cable company.

316
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,358
- What time's the appointment?
- Thursday between 9 and 3.

317
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,840
l'm calling from Netcom Cable.

318
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,349
You set up
an appointment for Thursday?

319
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,189
We have a technician
who's free earlier than expected.

320
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,312
- Will somebody be there for an hour?
- Sure.

321
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,990
Our technician will see you then.
Have a nice day.

322
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,989
Here's all the paperwork you need.
Just get him to sign and date it.

323
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,158
Let's check out the camera.

324
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,674
Stella, you'll be going patriotic today.

325
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,358
Walk slowly or the image'll streak.

326
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,028
- l'm sorry.
- lt's OK.

327
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,118
Couldn't pin the corsage
on my prom date, either.

328
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,790
- You had a prom date?
- lt was his cousin.

329
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,278
There's cable in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom and the office.

330
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,598
You need to locate the safe in the office.

331
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,399
l think you're very brave going in there.

332
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,720
- l second that.
- lt's going to be fine.

333
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,157
What?

334
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,113
Fine stands for freaked out, insecure...

335
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,515
...neurotic and emotional.

336
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,395
- You'll be great.
- Yeah.

337
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,750
Good morning. Can l see some lD?

338
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,995
- Thanks for coming so soon.
- That's part of the job.

339
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,752
Aston Martin Vanquish.
So that bastard took my car.

340
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,040
Nasty-ass dogs.

341
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,435
Cease!

342
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,479
Relax, Jesus Christ!

343
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,638
Come on, they won't bother you now.

344
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,869
Come on. House!

345
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,755
Go on, get out of here.

346
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,273
l'm used to running
into animals on my job.

347
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,433
- Want to show me that problem?
- Of course. This way.

348
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,230
- You've a really nice house.
- 1 922. All the original tiles.

349
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,194
Every stone in that courtyard
from some monastery in Seville.

350
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,279
- What a tactic.
- Monastery for punk-ass creeps!

351
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,798
You're not impressed?

352
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,869
lt's just that lugging rocks from one
place to another isn't that interesting.

353
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,517
- lt doesn't quite do it for me.
- What does do it for you?

354
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,631
TVs.

355
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,035
l have a monster TV.

356
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,597
- lt's not working right now...
- l should check the cable modem.

357
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,519
Yeah? OK, right. Over here.

358
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,950
l paid thirty grand for some punk kid
to install it. One day it just goes out.

359
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,754
l'm going to have him strung up.

360
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,272
- Here we go.
- There's our baby.

361
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,472
- Oh, man.
- We got him.

362
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,639
- Got any wiring coming through here?
- There's no wiring in here.

363
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,440
lt's just right here?

364
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,156
Look at that. That's my NAD T7 70.
That's my stereo.

365
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,477
l bet people are surprised
when they expect the cable man

366
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,274
and find you standing there.

367
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,118
He's hitting on her.

368
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,233
There's no problem here.
l should just check the TVs.

369
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,919
You know what? l'm blowing this shit
right off the mountain right now.

370
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,519
- ABM processor.
- Only the best.

371
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,756
Check the box.

372
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,632
l'm just going to reset your system.

373
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,594
Sometimes these things
just get jammed up, you know?

374
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,917
- That should do it.
- lt's fixed?

375
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,436
- Turn her on. Let's see.
- Now.

376
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,835
Perfect.

377
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,032
Becky, huh? Have we met before?

378
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,991
No, l don't think so.
lf you can just sign there.

379
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,478
lf l asked you to dinner, would l be
the first customer to do that?

380
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,391
Did you ask your last cable guy out?

381
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,195
No, but he was 300 pounds
with a handlebar moustache.

382
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,073
- Not my type.
- lt's not a good idea.

383
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,559
- ls that some cable company rule?
- No, it's my rule.

384
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,912
l don't go out with strange men.
We just met five minutes ago.

385
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,875
l guess l have to sabotage my cable
until we get to know each other.

386
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,634
- Have a nice day.
- l'll be a perfect gentleman.

387
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:52,790
l won't even ask for your number.
l'll meet you. Anywhere you want to go.

388
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,468
Come on, break your rule. Once.

389
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,318
Just dinner.

390
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,590
ls that a yes?

391
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,308
You OK?

392
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,351
Yeah.

393
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,393
He touched my hand.

394
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,994
He came on to me.

395
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,757
Hey, at least l created
a window of opportunity, right?

396
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,994
When he goes out Friday night, we go in.

397
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,796
By the time he realises you've stood
him up, we'll be gone with that gold.

398
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,310
Shuffle them cards this time, Left.

399
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,149
Lyle, what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

400
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,558
- Quit dealing while my back's turned.
- You've got loser's paranoia.

401
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,196
He only answers
to the Napster now, Charlie.

402
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,393
- l'm not calling you the Napster.
- You call him Left Ear.

403
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,752
- And him Handsome Rob.
- Because he is Handsome Rob.

404
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,476
- Well, you can call me the Napster.
- They were at college together.

405
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,592
- Why are you encouraging this?
- lt is verifiable.

406
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,713
He was my room-mate.
He stole my ideas. l am the Napster.

407
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:28,275
All right, what is the distance between
the front door and the vault, Napster?

408
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,196
- Farther than you want to carry it.
- So, how do we get the gold to the car?

409
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,755
How wide is the hallway...Napster?

410
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,313
6 feet.

411
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,034
OK, you've got your gold.

412
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,032
We need more cars to handle the weight.

413
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,552
l'll need help with the custom work.
l know a man for the job.

414
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,433
l modified the camera with LlDAR
so we can create hi-res digital maps...

415
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,315
- Who's that?
- Rob's mechanic friend.

416
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,114
- Charlie, this is Wrench.
- What's up?

417
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,552
Rob says you're talented.
l need some bodywork done.

418
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,320
We need to pack
2,700 pounds in these Minis,

419
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,830
with enough suspension and
horsepower to outrun anything chasing.

420
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,794
- 2,700 pounds of what?
- Whatever.

421
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,231
- What do l get from this mystery?
- 1 0,000.

422
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,231
All right.

423
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,356
We didn't get a chance to meet yet.
Wrench.

424
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,919
- Ham and cheese.
- That's cold. Damn, that's cold.

425
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,398
You want all greens?
'Cause you got 'em.

426
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,513
Welcome to LA's Automated Traffic
Surveillance and Control Center.

427
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,632
They use video feeds
from intersections and algorithms

428
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,957
to predict traffic conditions
and control traffic lights.

429
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,675
l created my own kick-ass
algorithm to sneak in

430
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,440
and now we own the place.

431
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,679
- Want to do a dry run?
- Thought you'd never ask.

432
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,510
See red light? Green light.

433
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,869
- Danielson, what's up with grid 34?
- Let's check it out.

434
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,513
Oops! Did l...? But it's awesome.
ls that not awesome?

435
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,438
Can you change it back?

436
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,119
Lights are working fine.
lt's just an accident.

437
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,715
That's good.

438
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,553
- What are those?
- Unnecessary parts.

439
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,832
l lost your smog controls
and 200 pounds of fat.

440
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,679
You got a sweet ride now, Charlie.

441
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,115
Know what l'm thinking about right now?
The look on Steve's face.

442
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,276
- You're early.
- l'm in a hurry.

443
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,478
You know that the Florida vote-rigging
was a ClA and mob operation?

444
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,470
Which is not so different from when JFK
won an election with his father's help.

445
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,514
- You're uncomfortable l mention JFK?
- No, l don't like making two trips.

446
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,909
You Americans, you love your heroes.
A holiday for Columbus?

447
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,159
He makes the wrong turn
and wipes out an indigenous people.

448
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,397
- Know what he was looking for?
- Tell me.

449
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,955
Gold, supposedly for Queen lsabella.

450
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,439
Don't think the Medicis didn't want some.
What did ltaly need gold for?

451
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,713
The long-distance slave trade,
based in Venice.

452
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,832
Venice. That's where these bricks...

453
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,480
- You were saying something?
- No.

454
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,875
Don't stop. l'm interested.

455
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,958
Please, l'm confused. My English...

456
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,356
What do you know about my gold?

457
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,155
- l don't...
- Don't even think about lying to me.

458
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,592
OK. l heard a rumour
about a heist in Venice.

459
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,952
35 million, in bricks,
with a Balinese dancer imprint.

460
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,597
- Who have you told?
- No one, l swear to God!

461
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:43,391
- You swear to God?
- You're crazy. l swear to God, l didn't.

462
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,160
Well, then, l guess l believe you.

463
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,912
Let's putt it. Putt, not drive.

464
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,477
Very good. You can get it.
l know you can do it.

465
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,355
- Here to see Skinny Pete.
- He's over there.

466
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,596
Thanks, man.

467
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,989
Don't stare.
He doesn't like people staring.

468
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,952
Stare at what?

469
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,994
That was good. Try that one.
l know you'll get that one.

470
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,919
- That was great.
- Skinny Pete.

471
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,476
- Yo, Charlie.
- What's up, man?

472
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,875
Was l right about the gold?

473
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,595
l'm not here for that.
We need some supplies.

474
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,952
Baby, go relax. Go relax!

475
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,719
- Supplies.
- What's wrong?

476
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,669
Some nitromon...

477
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,351
- Some nitromon primer.
- What's wrong?

478
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,753
Nothing, l'm cool. l'm great.
l just need a big can of...

479
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,394
...nitromon primer, detonating cord,

480
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,431
two triple-charger chemical grenades
and a launcher.

481
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,918
- Right, like l had told you earlier.
- All right.

482
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:06,749
- Cost you about five Gs.
- Done. Thanks. Sorry about that.

483
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,794
- All right, man. Peace.
- Come on.

484
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,237
Get out.

485
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,195
There.

486
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,075
Vance has something to tell you.

487
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,910
Go on.

488
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,232
A couple of weeks back...

489
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,954
...l was working in your cousin's shop.

490
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,438
A guy come in asking about gold
bricks with Balinese dancer on.

491
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,714
- What did you tell him?
- That l'd seen the bricks.

492
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:14,153
- l'm sorry.
- What did this man look like?

493
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,672
He had long black hair
with tattoo on his neck.

494
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,993
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

495
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,431
l know that guy.

496
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,996
Baby, go relax.

497
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,874
- Do you know who l am?
- You're Mashkov.

498
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:16,030
Right. You were asking about the gold
bricks with the Balinese dancer on.

499
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,439
Why?

500
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,837
Steve just confirmed
his eight o'clock dinner reservation.

501
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,079
- Let's go over it.
- Gas the guards. Doors open, 8.1 5.

502
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,989
- Safe popped by 8.25.
- Loaded, 8.35. Out, 8.45.

503
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,918
Straight to Union Station.

504
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,669
Only green lights, rest of city's red.
Cops stuck in traffic.

505
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,318
Train leaves at 1 0. Cars must be
aboard by 9.30. Timing must be exact.

506
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,398
- Let's get ready.
- Let's get it.

507
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,960
Wow, that is a nice car. Sorry, Rob.
Coast is clear, guys.

508
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,318
This is it. Moment of truth.

509
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,955
What the hell is this? Shit!

510
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,596
Steve's neighbour's throwing a party.

511
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,399
- Are you here for the Baker party, sir?
- No.

512
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,675
We're not blowing any gates tonight,
guys. Too many witnesses.

513
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,749
- Stella.
- l know...

514
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,712
l'm late for my date.

515
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,313
You've got to be charming. We need
him to ask you out again. Sorry.

516
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,832
Let's get out of the street.

517
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,708
- l can't imagine you doing that.
- What's that mean?

518
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,596
Well, you don't really seem
the adventurous type, you know.

519
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,837
Don't let the cable uniform throw you.

520
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,634
l wasn't making assumptions.

521
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,914
- l've made some about you.
- Oh, really? And...?

522
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,998
You're just going to have to wait and see.

523
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,469
Why wait? Let's go back to my place.
No assumptions.

524
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,513
Not tonight. lt's late. l should go home.

525
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,479
- You have a cable company curfew?
- No.

526
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:08,199
l've made some bad calls in the past.
We should take this slower.

527
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,915
Lovely dinner, sparkling conversation.
Still don't trust me?

528
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:18,832
l trust everyone. lt's the devil
inside them l don't trust.

529
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,356
That's an interesting saying.
Where'd you pick that up?

530
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,270
- Can't remember.
- l knew a guy who said it just like that.

531
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,596
- Really?
- Yeah.

532
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:40,113
He's the only person l've ever heard
say that. His name was John Bridger.

533
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,797
- You're hurting me.
- He had a daughter about your age.

534
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,679
Let go.

535
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,394
l knew there was something familiar
about you.

536
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,116
You're exactly like your old man.
l liked him, too.

537
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,598
l liked him right up
until the minute l shot him.

538
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,870
Who are you working with?

539
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,593
She's with us.

540
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,991
- The gang's all here.
- The only thing worse than a thief...

541
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,679
...is a coward.

542
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,034
Then you should've seen the way
your daddy begged for his life.

543
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,028
- He's not worth it.
- Put a leash on your cat.

544
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,230
Not bad, Charlie.

545
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,355
You have no idea how hard it is
for me not to kill you now.

546
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,348
You know better than that.
You can't let emotion into these things.

547
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,199
lt wasn't emotion
when you shot John and left us?

548
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,109
That wasn't about emotion.
lt was about a lot of gold.

549
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,754
Anything you think you deserved,
you didn't.

550
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,556
Don't talk about right and wrong
with me. l don't give a shit. OK?

551
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,390
You got your cards, l got mine.
We made our play, l came out on top.

552
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,151
lf you want to start the game
up again, that's fine with me.

553
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,999
What is your play here, really?

554
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,078
Come on, what do you think?

555
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,876
You'll try to take out my guards?
l have five that you don't know about.

556
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,676
You'll have Lyle hack the system?
l'll change it tomorrow morning.

557
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,069
What was your final move? Have
Bridger's daughter try to crack my safe?

558
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,832
That's very poetic, but l just don't
think she'll get anywhere near it.

559
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,430
Same old Steve.
Always thinking defensively.

560
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,790
That's why you're always number two.

561
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,197
- How's that?
- You've got no imagination.

562
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,109
Couldn't even decide what to buy.
Bought what everyone else wanted.

563
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,235
- Try this. That gold is already gone.
- Bullshit.

564
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,069
lt's over, Charlie.
l'm trying to move the last two bricks.

565
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,273
You want to come after me over
a couple of lousy bricks? Be my guest.

566
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:20,998
But you're off to a bad start because
you just blew the element of surprise.

567
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,112
Surprised?

568
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,233
lt's over when l say it's over.

569
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,155
Are you all right, sir?

570
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,837
How you doing?

571
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,436
Good.

572
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:18,871
Considering the fact l'm doing
all of this for a man l barely knew.

573
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,273
You know what bothered me
all those years?

574
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:36,032
lt was that whenever he'd call me
to tell me he was on some job,

575
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,471
l knew you were right there with him.

576
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,555
You got to know him a lot better
than l did.

577
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,477
Doesn't mean he wasn't
thinking about you.

578
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,116
- Would be nice if it was true.
- lt is.

579
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,394
He always regretted not having been
a good enough father to you.

580
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,436
- How do you know?
- Because he told me.

581
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,037
What did you do to your hand?

582
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,473
- l punched Steve.
- Why do you get to punch him?

583
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,199
'Cause those hands
are way too valuable.

584
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,634
You OK?

585
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,988
There'll be nothing left of that
if you keep rubbing it.

586
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,798
Tell Mr Frizelli we'll see him at eight.

587
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,957
- He's flying the coop.
- When?

588
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,593
His security guard
called for a helicopter at 4 p.m.

589
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,155
and an armoured car at five.

590
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,309
There's a cargo plane, departing LAX
at 8 p.m. to Mexico City.

591
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,114
What if he's moving
the safe as a diversion?

592
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,836
- We crack it, the gold's somewhere else.
- Steve won't let it out of his sight.

593
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,998
lt'll be in that truck
and he'll watch it from the helicopter.

594
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,556
- The gold's headed to Mexico?
- Who knows...?

595
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,959
- Slow down. This is good news for us.
- What do you mean?

596
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,312
Now the safe has come to us.
We're going to boost it in transit.

597
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,431
He could take a dozen routes.

598
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,349
We don't know which. We can't take
out an armoured truck at rush hour.

599
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:54,112
We're already set up to do it. Gridlock
every route except the one we choose.

600
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,834
Force that truck
to go where we want.

601
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,555
Where do we want it to go?
We'd lose a shoot up.

602
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,479
We do it like The ltalian Job.

603
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,877
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

604
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,358
- Yevhen. You didn't have to clip him.
- We didn't clip anybody.

605
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,075
Yevhen's cousin is
under the impression you did.

606
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,554
Why?

607
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,274
Because you wanted
to know about the gold.

608
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,914
You told him that?

609
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,556
One thing l know,
never mess with Mother Nature,

610
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,230
mother-in-laws,
or mother-freaking Ukrainians.

611
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,590
Look, l need a favour.

612
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,038
Had a hiccup last night. Need some help.
More hands-on. lnterested?

613
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:12,473
Could be, but l don't like
to be kept in the dark. lf l'm in, l'm in.

614
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,389
- OK, you're in.
- All right.

615
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,033
- What do you think?
- This'll work. Let's go.

616
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,669
You're amazing. lt's a work of genius.

617
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,193
- You OK?
- Just give me a moment.

618
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,916
- Now?
- l'm inserting this pin into the detonator.

619
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,672
lf the brass touches the sides, we'll
both be the last people we ever see.

620
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,155
Take all the time you need.

621
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,198
- Hey, Charlie.
- What?

622
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,915
l love you, man.

623
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,117
l love you, too.

624
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,313
He's going to be on train 59
for New Orleans.

625
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,317
You sure the source is good?

626
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,953
l'm sure.

627
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,637
Check positions. Napster?

628
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,717
l'm in position.

629
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:01,950
- Handsome Rob?
- ln position. Everything's quiet, Charlie.

630
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,714
Wrench?

631
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,714
Set.

632
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,671
We've got an uninvited visitor. There's
a motorcycle guard following the truck.

633
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,836
We'll deal with it.

634
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,795
- Who are they?
- What's wrong?

635
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,437
You won't believe this.
He's brought in three armoured trucks.

636
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,835
lt's a shell game now.

637
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,873
l can't re-route
if l don't know which to re-route.

638
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,196
Follow the one Steve
follows by helicopter.

639
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,358
He'll never
let that gold out of his sight.

640
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,996
Unless he's playing us. And he is.

641
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,033
OK, let's go! Move it out!

642
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,192
Here we go. They're pulling out.

643
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,677
Napster, pull up the traffic
cameras you're watching.

644
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,348
Where's the first camera they go past?

645
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,028
- Vine and Yucca.
- See which one's riding low.

646
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,954
First in line...
First two are the same, so...

647
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,594
Houston, we have our truck.
Number 1 28.

648
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,113
We're moving out.

649
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,678
Three Kilo Bob to Two Fox Mike,
we're heading to the airport.

650
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,276
OK, guys, truck 1 28
has turned right heading west.

651
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,596
Gridlock time.

652
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,156
We've crashed.

653
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,075
lt's not a crash.

654
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,589
- We've got power.
- l can't log in.

655
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,870
They're about to hit a detour
and be sent your way.

656
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,592
You'll never shut down the real Napster.

657
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,232
What's your problem?!

658
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:38,759
- Truck 1 28, what is your progress?
- Traffic's out of control.

659
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,678
We've got to look for another route.

660
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,955
Check the police band.

661
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,197
OK, l'm opening up a space
on Highland.

662
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,516
- Get us out of here.
- l'm trying.

663
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,839
And he's taking it.

664
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,713
Police are saying computers
are down at traffic control.

665
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,515
Nice, Charlie. What are you up to?

666
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,756
Go back.

667
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,359
l now command you to turn left.

668
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,116
Come on, take the left.

669
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,993
Yeah, you did. You did.

670
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,398
Give us the flag.

671
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:13,794
Metro just passed through the station.
You are clear for 90 seconds. Go.

672
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,479
Come on, Steve.

673
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,240
30 seconds and counting.

674
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,350
1 5 seconds, you're blocked in
or you're paint on the train.

675
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,996
Come on, come on!

676
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,395
Stay on me. This'll be tight!

677
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,591
- Go, go, go.
- You're going to stop there.

678
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,589
- OK, guys, coming into position.
- Stay cool.

679
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,471
Ten, nine...

680
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,953
...eight, seven...

681
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,913
...six, five...

682
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,599
...four...

683
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,836
- Don't lose him.
- ...three...

684
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,437
...two, one...

685
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,599
What...?!

686
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,674
Damn.

687
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,590
What the fuck happened to my truck?!

688
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,197
- lt blew through the street.
- Get under there.

689
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,913
- We have another problem.
- What?

690
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,830
- This isn't the Worthington 1 000.
- What?

691
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,793
He switched safes on us.

692
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,355
- Can you do it?
- lt's lsraeli made.

693
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,075
lt's got a glass relock system.
There's a pane of glass here.

694
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,876
lf l don't drill perfectly, steel rods
snap into place and we can't open it.

695
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,753
Then we're up shit creek.

696
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:21,034
l think l just cracked the glass.
l don't think it broke, though.

697
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:26,268
l can't drill it again.
l have to do it by touch.

698
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,240
l can't get through.
The train's blocking the tunnel.

699
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,113
- Where does the Metro Rail emerge?
- Eleventh and Fig.

700
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:40,190
Meet at Eleventh and Figaro and double
back to Hollywood and Highland. Hurry.

701
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:00,669
Baggage for train 22
now available at carousel 4.

702
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,553
l can't do this. l need a drill
or a borescope to get in there.

703
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,390
- Come on, Charlie.
- You can do this.

704
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,430
Slide.

705
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,353
- Don't you want to see inside?
- Absolutely.

706
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,950
Napster, 1 3 across, 4 high, 4 deep.

707
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,990
- That's 208 bricks.
- How much?

708
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,713
- 2.7 million.
- What?!

709
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,309
No, it's 27. That's 27 million.

710
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,990
That's 27 million dollars worth of gold.

711
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,520
Got the Holy Spirit.
You should get on it, it's a good train.

712
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,394
What do you think, John?

713
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,717
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

714
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,110
We've got two motorcycles
on us, Charlie.

715
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,399
Three Minis heading east
towards the LA river.

716
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,751
Stop them
before they get to the street.

717
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,952
Shit!

718
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,869
Here we go.

719
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,914
Open your door.

720
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,270
Come on, guys. We're moving.

721
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,679
There!

722
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,514
Hey, come on. Get down!

723
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,235
Come on!

724
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,870
Where are you going?

725
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,109
l'll take Steve. Go to Union Station.
l'll meet you there.

726
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,353
Stay on him.

727
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,717
l'm opening up a spot on Lower Grand.

728
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,155
l know it's you, Charlie.

729
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,709
Take your next left.

730
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,598
Nice move, Steve.

731
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,516
Get out! Get out!

732
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,597
l said get out!

733
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,473
- You got Mini Coopers in there, right?
- Look, man...

734
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:43,231
Don't worry about them. l'll give
you five grand to put me inside.

735
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,873
Buy your girlfriend something nice.

736
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,558
Half now, half when you help me unload.

737
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,191
l've got to hand it to you.
You played this one pretty smart.

738
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:18,918
Decoy trucks, you switched safes,
the helicopter routine. Pretty good.

739
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,430
Now l've got the gold,
you've got nothing.

740
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:27,395
l've got this, so cut the crap
and give me my goddamn gold!

741
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,551
- Who are you?
- l am Mashkov.

742
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,993
- You killed my cousin Yevhen.
- You've got to have some insurance.

743
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:01,395
He was already dead when l arrived.
He dealt with unsavoury people.

744
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,594
- This guy's trying to play you.
- You were right. No imagination.

745
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:15,556
There's a lot of gold in there. Only we've
got guns. l'll make you a good deal.

746
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,671
l've already made my deal.

747
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,355
- What do you want?
- You know this was never about gold.

748
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,313
Whatever helps you sleep at night,
sweetheart.

749
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,509
Bitch. Charlie, come on, Charlie!

750
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,394
That l loved.

751
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,229
l'll double whatever he's given you,
just don't shoot me.

752
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:56,355
Don't worry, l'm not going to shoot you.
l'm going to take you to my workplace.

753
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,757
l think you'll be interested
in my machinery.

754
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,437
Oh, come on.

755
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:12,272
Guys, l want to make a toast.

756
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:18,749
To John Bridger. The most brilliant
master planner of all. Father and friend.

757
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,913
Stella was right.
lt wasn't about the money.

758
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:31,318
Of course, that didn't stop the guys
from having some fun.

759
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,750
Handsome Rob got his Aston Martin.

760
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,875
Took it for a ride to break it in.

761
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,234
He got off with a warning.

762
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,631
Left Ear got his dream house in Spain

763
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,718
with a room just for his shoes.

764
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:16,028
Lyle finally made
the cover of Wired magazine.

765
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,631
- Are you really the Napster?
- Yes, l am.

766
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,877
And he got that kick-ass stereo
he wanted.

767
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,594
Would you listen to something?

768
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,634
With speakers so loud they could
blow a woman's clothes off.

769
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,513
lf you would.

770
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,196
And me?
l took John Bridger's advice.

771
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,278
l found somebody l want to spend
the rest of my life with,

772
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,711
and l'm going
to hold on to her forever.
