1
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,488
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,039
You got a date with justice,
One-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,042
Too bad, Sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,254
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,855
I think you dropped something, mister.

6
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,690
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

7
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,275
You've reached the end of the line!

8
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,527
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

9
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,913
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

10
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,877
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

11
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,926
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,557
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,397
Hold him steady!

14
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,112
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,593
No!

16
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,312
Glad I could catch the train!

17
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,648
Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,275
To infinity and beyond!

19
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,919
Reach for the sky.

20
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,337
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

21
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,632
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

22
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,352
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

23
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,498
Evil Dr Pork Chop!

24
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,545
That's Mr Evil Dr Pork Chop to you.

25
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,006
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

26
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,924
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

27
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,557
"You're going to jail, Bart." "Watch out!"

28
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,769
Mom!

29
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,855
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I'm not here.

30
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,023
Oh, no, Molly!

31
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,818
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

32
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,613
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

33
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,908
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

34
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,286
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

35
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,165
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

36
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,917
Happy birthday!

37
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,837
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

38
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,098
""" Came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

39
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,766
"Got it, Woody."

40
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,602
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

41
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,855
"Good work, Buzz."

42
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,800
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

43
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,094
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

44
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,763
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

45
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,641
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

46
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,977
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

47
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,356
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

48
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,275
Is it hot in here?

49
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,443
Here they come!

50
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,072
Sarge, you got it?

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,532
Mission accomplished.

52
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,783
Hooray!

53
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,036
Careful. Careful!

54
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,542
All right, guys. We got one shot at this.
Everyone ready?

55
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,419
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

56
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,671
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

57
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,853
Target is on approach.

58
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,230
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

59
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,872
Hello?

60
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,375
Hello? Anyone there?

61
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,212
Molly, stay out of my room!

62
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,380
I wasn't in your room.

63
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,424
Then who was messing with my stuff?

64
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,884
It wasn't me.

65
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,559
Well, that went well.

66
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,604
He held me! He actually held me!

67
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,648
This is just sad.

68
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,150
Who we kiddin'?
The kid's 17 years old.

69
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,069
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

70
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,491
Guys, hey, hold up.

71
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,244
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

72
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,495
Not again!

73
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,706
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

74
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,083
We are gathered, Woody.

75
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,669
Okay. First off,

76
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,798
we all knew Operation Playtime
was a long shot.

77
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,299
More like a misfire.

78
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,387
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

79
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,597
Being there for Andy. We know.

80
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,182
But we can try again! Right?

81
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,603
I'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

82
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,896
What?

83
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,441
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

84
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,819
We're going into attic mode, folks.

85
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,779
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

86
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,866
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

87
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,494
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

88
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,289
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

89
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,457
Yeah, but now it's here.

90
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,877
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,295
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

92
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,007
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

93
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,134
- Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?

94
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,012
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

95
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,347
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

96
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,099
we army guys are the first to go.

97
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,727
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

98
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,939
It has been an honour serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

99
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,067
You're gonna need it.

100
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,903
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

101
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,488
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

102
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,781
How do you know?

103
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,867
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

104
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,328
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

105
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,664
<i>1 thought we were goin' to the attic.
- Hate all this uncertainty!</i>

106
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

107
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,670
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

108
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,007
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

109
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,677
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?

110
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,098
Yeah. Even Bo.

111
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,435
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

112
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,189
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

113
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,692
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

114
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:14,530
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

115
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,033
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

116
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,952
There's games up there,
and books, and...

117
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,038
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

118
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,500
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

119
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,712
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

120
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,214
Yeah.

121
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,968
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

122
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,595
And he'll play with us then, right?

123
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,389
We'll always be there for him.

124
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,725
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

125
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,269
and go out on a high note.

126
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,105
I'd better find my other eye.

127
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,190
Where'd you leave it this time?

128
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,360
Some place dark. And dusty.

129
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,822
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

130
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,534
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

131
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,602
You guarantee it, huh?

132
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,731
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

133
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,484
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

134
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,863
For infinity and beyond.

135
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,782
- Can I have your stereo?
'NO.

136
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,035
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm taking it with me.

137
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,208
- Can I have your computer?
'NO.

138
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,586
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

139
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

140
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,091
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

141
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,136
- Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

142
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,055
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

143
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,476
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

144
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,020
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

145
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,481
Why do you still have these toys?

146
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,608
Molly, out of my room!

147
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,359
Three more days and it's mine!

148
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,862
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

149
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,781
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

150
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,033
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

151
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,284
What kids?

152
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,162
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

153
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,580
What's daycare?

154
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,790
- Mom.
- No buts.

155
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,627
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

156
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,181
Poor Barbie.

157
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,516
I get the Corvette.

158
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,060
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

159
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,186
Like what?

160
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,146
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

161
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,148
- Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.

162
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,441
Maybe sell them online?

163
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,401
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

164
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,445
They're junk.

165
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,239
Fine. You have till Friday.

166
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,991
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

167
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,078
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

168
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,507
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

169
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,675
That's what's happening.

170
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,066
<i>- You need a hand?
1 got it.</i>

171
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,526
Here.

172
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,361
So, you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

173
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,822
- If 1 say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

174
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,741
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

175
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,618
I can't breathe!

176
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,995
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

177
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,174
Andy!

178
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,262
That's not trash. That's not trash!

179
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,514
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

180
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,893
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

181
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,525
Okay, boy. To the kerb!

182
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,323
No, Buster! No!

183
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,161
Get up. Buster!

184
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,221
- We're on the kerb!
- I knew it would come to this!

185
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,806
Pull, everyone! Pull!

186
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,235
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!

187
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,946
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

188
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
There's gotta be a way out!

189
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,865
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

190
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,534
Point. Point. Point!

191
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,622
Push! Push!

192
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,207
I can hear the garbage truck!

193
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,043
It's getting closer.

194
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,915
Buzz! Jessie!

195
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,177
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

196
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,013
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

197
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,932
This doesn't make any sense.

198
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,561
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

199
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,064
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

200
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,733
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

201
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,485
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

202
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,278
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

203
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,405
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

204
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,785
Fellas, I know what to do.

205
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,793
What the heck?

206
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,713
- We should've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

207
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,841
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

208
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,718
Now we need to go!

209
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,721
You're right. Come on.

210
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,099
- Buzz?
- Woody!

211
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,268
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

212
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,312
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

213
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,647
We're going to daycare!

214
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,358
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

215
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,319
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

216
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,738
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

217
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,657
Attic? So how did we
end up on the kerb?

218
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,410
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

219
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,662
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

220
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,330
And called us junk!

221
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,583
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

222
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,585
Sure thing, college boy!

223
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,504
Andy's moving on, Woody.

224
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,381
It's time we did the same.

225
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,843
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

226
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,846
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

227
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,182
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

228
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,524
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

229
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,327
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

230
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:45,040
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

231
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,378
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

232
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,714
Welcome to the club, toots.

233
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,134
Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get
back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

234
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,927
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

235
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,471
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

236
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,889
Andy doesn't want us any more.

237
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,266
He was putting you in the attic!

238
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,393
He left us on the kerb!

239
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,229
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

240
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,898
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

241
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,610
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place

242
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,863
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

243
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,618
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.

244
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,413
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

245
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,930
Can anyone see anything?

246
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,973
- There's a playground!
- Wow!

247
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,059
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

248
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,186
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

249
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,522
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

250
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,482
Perspective? This place is perfect.

251
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,653
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

252
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,116
- Hey there!
- Wow!

253
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,826
Haven't seen you in ages.

254
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,329
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

255
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,999
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

256
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,293
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

257
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,587
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

258
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,924
Not kids any more.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

259
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,592
- What?
- Can you believe it?

260
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,221
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

261
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,684
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

262
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,526
- Look!
- Wow!

263
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,236
What? What is it?

264
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,993
No, no, no.

265
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,161
What's the matter with you?

266
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,998
I can't see!

267
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,834
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

268
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,341
- So how what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

269
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,219
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

270
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,763
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

271
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,015
- I want to see!
- Hey!

272
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,224
- Rex!
- It's my turn!

273
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,398
New toys!

274
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,573
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

275
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,491
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

276
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,910
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

277
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,291
Thank you. May 1?

278
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,755
The claw!

279
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,724
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

280
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:53,270
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.

281
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,856
But please call me Lotso.

282
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,816
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

283
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,904
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

284
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,866
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

285
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,618
It's been horrible.

286
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,704
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

287
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,291
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

288
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,670
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

289
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,340
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

290
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,761
Mr Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

291
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,472
All day long. Five days a week.

292
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,474
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

293
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,351
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

294
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,688
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

295
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,232
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

296
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:43,278
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

297
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,782
No owners means no heartbreak.

298
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,829
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

299
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,330
Because we're Andy's toys!

300
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,417
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

301
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,420
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

302
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,630
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

303
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:06,009
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

304
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,470
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

305
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,769
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

306
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,397
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

307
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,898
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

308
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,368
Hi, I'm Ken.

309
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,580
Barbie. Have we ever met?

310
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,291
I would've remembered.

311
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,085
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

312
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,172
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

313
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,175
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

314
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,013
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

315
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,725
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

316
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,854
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

317
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,814
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

318
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,691
Spare parts, superglue,

319
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,195
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

320
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,530
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.

321
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,157
Well, stop your worryin'.

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,244
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

323
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,207
And this, well, this is where I live.

324
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,084
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

325
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,505
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

326
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,382
You have everything!

327
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,302
Everything except
someone to share it with.

328
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,642
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

329
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,688
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

330
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,858
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

331
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,779
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

332
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,073
Abandoned by the same owner.

333
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,034
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

334
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,412
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

335
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,581
We control our own destiny.

336
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,583
Watch out for puddles.

337
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,295
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.

338
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,256
The Caterpillar Room.

339
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,551
- Look at this place.
- Wow!

340
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,636
Holy moly guacamole.

341
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,221
Jackpot, baby.

342
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,139
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

343
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,266
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,103
It's so beautiful!

345
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,441
What the... Hey, little guy.

346
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,902
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

347
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,028
It's been years.

348
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,324
Well, just you wait.
In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring,

349
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,202
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

350
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,163
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

351
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,125
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

352
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,210
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

353
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,336
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

354
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,005
- Goodbye, Mr Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.

355
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,216
- Will I see you again?
- I'll see you tonight

356
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,801
in my dreams.

357
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,220
Ken, let's get a move on.

358
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,681
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

359
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,560
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.l. Joe,

360
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,729
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

361
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,064
- Made for each other.
- Made for each other.

362
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,859
- Yay!
- Yes.

363
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,819
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

364
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,865
This is so exciting!

365
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,706
Sounds like kids to me.

366
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,209
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

367
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,836
How many you reckon are out there?

368
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,671
They sound so sweet.

369
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,389
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

370
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,934
But we need to go home.

371
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,227
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

372
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,314
A chance to make kids happy again.

373
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,150
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

374
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,443
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

375
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,611
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

376
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,696
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

377
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,076
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

378
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,163
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

379
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,915
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

380
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,501
Now, I'm going home.

381
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,671
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

382
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,802
Buzz?

383
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,807
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

384
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,600
What?

385
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,727
And what's important now
is we stay together.

386
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,939
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

387
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,483
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

388
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,776
Whose name is written there?

389
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,072
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us any more.

390
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,950
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

391
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,702
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

392
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,662
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

393
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,874
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

394
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,796
Okay, fine. Perfect.

395
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,383
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

396
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,601
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

397
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,912
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

398
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,168
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

399
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,421
Look,

400
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,342
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

401
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,806
Bonnie?

402
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,725
Bonnie?

403
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,894
I gotta go.

404
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,066
Bonnie, you in here?

405
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,380
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

406
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
What... What the heck?

407
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,551
Now, that's better.

408
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,263
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...

409
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,349
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

410
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,333
No, no, no, no!

411
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,002
Reach for the sky!

412
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:23,381
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

413
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,307
You're my favourite deputy.

414
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,684
- Bonnie!
- Coming!

415
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,648
Great.

416
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,703
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

417
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,581
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

418
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,251
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

419
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,002
Toys are for playtime.

420
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,089
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

421
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,132
- How many?
- There must be dozens.

422
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,425
I can hardly wait!

423
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,927
Places, everyone!

424
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,652
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

425
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,530
- Rex?
- Come to papa.

426
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,961
There's a snake in my boot.

427
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:30,300
<i>I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.</i>

428
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,426
A sheriff!

429
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,971
Move over, Mr Pricklepants.

430
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,724
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

431
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:43,772
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

432
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,899
Be right back!

433
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,943
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

434
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,654
Can you tell me where ll am?

435
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,156
The guy's just asking a question.

436
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,826
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

437
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,872
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

438
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,415
Hello, I'm Trixie.

439
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,794
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
ll don't know where I am.

440
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,172
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

441
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,174
I'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

442
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,134
with life-changing news.

443
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,471
We do a lot of improv here.
Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

444
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,557
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?

445
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,397
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

446
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,608
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

447
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,195
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

448
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:41,287
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

449
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,331
"I know where to hide."

450
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,379
She'll never find us in here.

451
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,714
What's wrong?

452
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,511
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

453
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,389
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

454
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,099
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

455
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,559
There is no way out.

456
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,186
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

457
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,314
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

458
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,691
- Woody.
- Woody?

459
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,484
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

460
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,195
"Cause now's your chance to change it,
new room and all.

461
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,905
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

462
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,576
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

463
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,828
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

464
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,123
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!

465
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,417
<i>- Told ya.
- Found a spaceship!</i>

466
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,835
Showtime.

467
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,379
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

468
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,049
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

469
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,428
Three, two, one, blastoff!

470
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,394
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

471
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,655
I got a kink in my slink.

472
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,660
My tail! Where's my tail?

473
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,418
Someone need a hand?

474
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,921
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

475
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,255
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

476
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,465
Honey, the moustache?

477
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,301
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

478
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,721
Andy never played with us like that.

479
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,681
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

480
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,558
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

481
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,977
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

482
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,646
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

483
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,314
- With the big kids!
- That's right.

484
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,358
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

485
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,152
I'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

486
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,533
Blast. Try that one.

487
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,785
It's locked!

488
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,870
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

489
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,873
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

490
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,667
Finest childproof lock in the world.

491
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

492
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,212
Did anyone notice the transom?

493
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,840
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

494
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:03,346
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

495
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,181
- Three!
- Whoa!

496
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,476
Let go!

497
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,406
Go!

498
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,121
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!

499
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,623
Way to go, Buzz!

500
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,004
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

501
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,171
They might hear you.

502
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,801
- Okay, now you start.

503
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,094
- Love...
- You.

504
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,513
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

505
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,639
- Okay, okay, okay.

506
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:47,890
- Love...
- You.

507
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,976
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

508
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,728
You are so smart.

509
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,438
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

510
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,815
- I'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!

511
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,172
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

512
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,465
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.

513
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,591
- All right.
- Here we go.

514
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,677
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

515
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,303
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.

516
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,429
Come on, duck.

517
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,348
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.

518
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,517
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

519
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,143
Here is a duck.

520
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,354
- I won!
- Ah, man!

521
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,649
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

522
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,359
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

523
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,985
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.

524
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,570
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.

525
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,781
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

526
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,658
Oh, please! Landfill!

527
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,244
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

528
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,163
But that space guy, he could be useful.

529
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:38,126
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

530
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,211
Neither are you, Chunk.

531
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,964
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

532
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,508
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

533
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,510
Aw, Mr Softy over here.

534
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,679
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

535
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,975
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

536
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,685
All them toys are disposable.

537
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,604
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

538
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,487
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

539
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,906
Let me go!

540
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,658
Take him to the libary.

541
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,784
No!

542
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,776
1225 Sycamore.

543
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,736
Woody, what are you doing?

544
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,780
I gotta get outta here.

545
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,783
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

546
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

547
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,870
but, you see, I belong to someone else.

548
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,165
<i>Who's "Yid-nuh"?
1 believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."</i>

549
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,125
Guys, it says "Andy."

550
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,460
He's my Bonnie.

551
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,670
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

552
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,465
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

553
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,802
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

554
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,262
I'll fire up the computer.

555
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,687
Unhand me, you cowards!
Ll demand to talk to Lotso!

556
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,564
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

557
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,317
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

558
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,156
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

559
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,033
He got out, Lotso.

560
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:40,540
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

561
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:45,127
F-A-Oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

562
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,755
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

563
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,049
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

564
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,384
for me and my friends.

565
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,428
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

566
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,347
Well, request granted!

567
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,850
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.

568
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,228
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

569
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,438
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

570
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,441
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

571
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,406
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

572
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,325
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

573
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,452
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

574
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,122
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

575
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,583
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

576
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,585
But my friends don't belong there.

577
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,712
None of us do, I agree.

578
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,215
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

579
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,801
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

580
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,555
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear any more.

581
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,058
Well, I guess that makes sense.

582
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,897
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

583
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,774
Family man, huh? I understand.

584
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,068
Put him back in the timeout chair.

585
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,572
What are ya... Unhand me!

586
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,658
Bring in the Bookworm.

587
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,122
Here it is.

588
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,334
It was filed under "Lightyear."

589
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,590
Let's see here.

590
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,927
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.

591
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,764
"Remove screws to access
battery compartment."

592
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,057
What are you doing?

593
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,767
Stop!

594
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,268
Let go of me!

595
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:29,732
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

596
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,819
- No!
- "...slide the switch from Play to Demo."

597
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:37,406
Stop! No! No! No!

598
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,160
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

599
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,828
I'll see what it was.

600
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,166
What do you see? Anything?

601
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,795
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

602
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,505
I see Andy!

603
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,382
- What?
- That's impossible.

604
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,926
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

605
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,930
My other eye! The one I left behind.

606
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,103
This is so weird. He's packing up.

607
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:12,650
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

608
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,778
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

609
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,656
He's looking in the attic.

610
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,118
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

611
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,913
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

612
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,501
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

613
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,128
He's looking for us?

614
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,047
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

615
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,425
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

616
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,260
Well, then, Woody was telling the truth.

617
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,554
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

618
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,180
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

619
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,183
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

620
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,812
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

621
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,523
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

622
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,900
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

623
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,361
There's been a mistake. We have to go.

624
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,949
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

625
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,994
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

626
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,788
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

627
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,875
"Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

628
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,877
Just look at my pocketbook!

629
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,340
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.

630
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,802
"" Sweet potato'!
Who do you think you're talking to?

631
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:26,724
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

632
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,268
That's better.

633
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,896
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

634
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,065
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

635
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,816
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

636
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,942
Whoa there, missy.

637
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,986
You're not goin' anywhere.

638
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,906
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

639
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,493
Buzz! You're back!

640
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,078
Buzz?

641
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,121
Hey!

642
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,499
Look out!

643
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,000
What are you, nuts?

644
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,293
Buzz!

645
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,341
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

646
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,635
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

647
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,804
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

648
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,347
- Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?

649
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,473
Oh, boy.

650
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,267
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

651
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,393
Yes, sir!

652
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,614
Where do you think you're going?

653
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,659
Buzz! We're your friends!

654
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,702
Spare me your lies, temptress.

655
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,246
Your emperor's defeated,

656
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,457
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

657
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,168
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

658
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,962
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!

659
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,088
Not him.

660
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,675
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

661
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,510
Take him to the box.

662
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,304
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

663
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,806
Bad baby! Bad baby!

664
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,474
Ken? What's going on?

665
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,853
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

666
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,187
What are you doing to my friends?

667
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,064
Get in there!

668
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,484
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

669
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,028
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...

670
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,782
And give me my scarf back!

671
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,579
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

672
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,832
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

673
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,669
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

674
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,880
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

675
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,134
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

676
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,220
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

677
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,598
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

678
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,141
In the box! We get it.

679
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,353
At ease, soldier. They're neutralised.

680
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,899
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

681
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,317
Don't worry, Commander.

682
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,528
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

683
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,780
Listen up, folks.

684
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,366
We got a way of doin' things
here at Sunnyside.

685
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,536
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

686
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,872
life here can be a dream come true!

687
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,751
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

688
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:05,216
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

689
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,802
Woody! What did you do to him?

690
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,680
You all get a good night's rest.

691
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,059
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.

692
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,401
1225 Syca...

693
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,947
Who's Velocistar237?

694
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,616
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

695
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,077
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

696
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,954
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

697
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,207
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

698
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,085
Please don't be far. Please, please!

699
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,923
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

700
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:51,345
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

701
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,098
- Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

702
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,768
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

703
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,936
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

704
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,273
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

705
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,149
Well, it wasn't easy.

706
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,360
What do you mean "escape"?

707
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,115
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

708
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,702
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

709
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,037
Lotso?

710
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,790
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

711
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,625
but inside, he's a monster.

712
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,044
But... How do you know that?

713
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,047
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

714
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,805
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

715
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,976
He was a good toy. A friend.

716
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,480
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

717
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,901
! was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

718
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,072
Daisy loved us all.

719
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,741
But Lotso,

720
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,993
Lotso was special.

721
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,663
They did everything together.

722
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,834
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

723
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,670
One day, we took a drive.

724
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,924
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

725
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,011
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

726
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,855
She never came back.

727
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,279
Lotso wouldn't give up.

728
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,203
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

729
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,796
But by then, it was too late.

730
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,143
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

731
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,479
Something snapped.

732
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,981
She replaced us. Come on!

733
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,943
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

734
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,736
Didn't she?

735
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,242
She don't love you no more!

736
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,952
Now come on!

737
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:30,462
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

738
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,428
Then we found Sunnyside.

739
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,607
But Lotso wasn't my friend any more.

740
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,319
He wasn't anyone's friend.

741
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,200
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

742
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,661
So how'd you get out?

743
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,457
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

744
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,168
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

745
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,380
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

746
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,133
they don't stand a chance.

747
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,760
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

748
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,221
Returning now would be suicide!

749
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,098
But what about your Andy?

750
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,101
Isn't he leaving for college?

751
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,997
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

752
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,170
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

753
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,591
But he ain't ever comin' back.

754
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,865
Rise and shine, campers!

755
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,534
Commander Lotso, sir!

756
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,869
All quiet, nothing to report.

757
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,540
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

758
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,959
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

759
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,585
Big Baby.

760
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,467
Sweetheart!

761
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,056
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

762
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,517
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

763
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,312
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

764
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,729
Hello?

765
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,522
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

766
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:21,985
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

767
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,196
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

768
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,530
I made it out once.

769
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,492
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

770
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,994
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

771
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,663
Yeah, for how long?

772
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,914
I've been here years.

773
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,416
They'll never break me.

774
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,294
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

775
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,881
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

776
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,217
Then it's off to the dump.

777
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,011
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

778
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,223
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

779
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,518
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

780
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,814
Well, if you're gonna get out,

781
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,649
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

782
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:05,570
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

783
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,697
Got it. What else?

784
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,949
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

785
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,368
Hallway, lobby, playground.

786
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,577
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

787
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,997
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

788
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,332
You go over or under.

789
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,543
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

790
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,295
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

791
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,216
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

792
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,884
He sees everything.

793
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,137
Classrooms.

794
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,357
Hallways.

795
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,909
Even the playground.

796
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,588
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

797
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,300
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

798
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,095
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

799
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,265
Recess! Come on, kids!

800
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,773
Hey, guys.

801
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,275
- Woody?
- Woody!

802
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,735
Woody!

803
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,613
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!

804
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,948
- You're alive!
- 'Course I'm alive!

805
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,994
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

806
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,746
Lotso did something to him!

807
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,956
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

808
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,458
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

809
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,460
Return of the astro-nut.

810
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:48,298
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

811
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,009
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

812
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,346
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

813
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,681
From now on, we stick together.

814
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,517
But Andy's leavin' for college.

815
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,477
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

816
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,188
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

817
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,815
Tomorrow? But that means...

818
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,900
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

819
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,820
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

820
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,239
No, there is one way out.

821
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:13,865
One way.

822
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,245
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

823
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,836
- Springy dog.
- Present.

824
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,004
Green guys.

825
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,215
- Cowgirl.
- Here.

826
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:31,842
Horse.

827
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,427
- Piggy bank.
- Yo.

828
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,680
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.

829
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,890
- Barbie.
- Here.

830
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,851
Potato Head.

831
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,395
Potato Head?

832
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,357
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

833
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,693
Impossible!

834
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,404
Hey!

835
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,752
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

836
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,422
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

837
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,217
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

838
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,845
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

839
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,890
Yeah, and I would've got away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!

840
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,391
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

841
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,852
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

842
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,104
You're a purse with legs.

843
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,522
Take him back to the box.

844
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:31,902
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
Ll didn't mean it! I like ascots.

845
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,487
Really. No, no, no!

846
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,072
Okay, check.

847
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:40,285
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

848
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,746
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

849
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,915
Ken! Ken?

850
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,419
What do you want?

851
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,923
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

852
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,799
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

853
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,301
I was wrong.

854
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,512
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

855
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,974
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

856
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,477
Darn it, Barbie!

857
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,438
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

858
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,650
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

859
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,488
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

860
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,036
Go get the tape!

861
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,462
And this is where the magic happens.

862
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,173
Look at all your clothes!

863
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,050
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

864
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,636
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.

865
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,430
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

866
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,683
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

867
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,352
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

868
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,190
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

869
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,237
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

870
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,197
Just a few?

871
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,979
Go get the key.

872
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,648
Where is it, where is it?

873
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,650
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

874
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,205
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

875
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,208
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

876
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,043
Make a move, porky!

877
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,630
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

878
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,051
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.

879
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,302
No wonder you're extinct.

880
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,555
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

881
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,061
Help! Prison riot!

882
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,649
Get the tortilla.

883
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,607
- Ready?
- Ready.

884
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,658
Barbie?

885
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,580
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

886
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,873
And how do we switch him back?

887
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,875
You can't make me talk. You can't!

888
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,253
But I'd like to see you try.

889
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,724
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

890
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,602
Barbie! Those were vintage!

891
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,520
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

892
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,105
They're a dime a dozen.

893
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,523
Glitter tux.

894
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,403
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

895
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,697
A Nehru jacket.

896
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,282
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

897
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,077
This is from what, 19677?

898
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,745
The groovy formal collection, yes!

899
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,540
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

900
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,709
There's an instruction manual!

901
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,129
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

902
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,007
Where's that manual?

903
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,095
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

904
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,347
but here you go.

905
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,987
What's takin' so doggone long?

906
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:54,742
So how do we fix Buzz?

907
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,137
What are you looking at, feathers?

908
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,473
Hey!

909
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,647
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

910
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,777
Well, that's just great.

911
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,327
Help! Prison riot!

912
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,579
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.

913
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,082
<i>What?
- Said, "No one can hear you."</i>

914
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,127
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."

915
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,795
Shush! Will you be quiet?

916
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,422
Woody! You're back!

917
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,635
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

918
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,722
Star Command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

919
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,601
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

920
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,227
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

921
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:05,938
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

922
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,567
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

923
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,195
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

924
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,947
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

925
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,116
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!

926
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,242
What?

927
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,453
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

928
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,790
""Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

929
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,294
It's not my fault!

930
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,468
Star Log...

931
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,970
I've awakened from hyper-sleep
on a strange planet.

932
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,390
<i>- Now what did you do?
- Just did what you told me!</i>

933
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:44,435
I'm surrounded by alien creatures
of unknown intent.

934
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:45,561
Who goes there?

935
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,687
Friend?

936
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,814
Or foe?

937
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,108
Amigos! We're all amigos.

938
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,195
I must have crash-landed
and had my memory erased.

939
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,365
Anyone seen my spaceship?

940
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:58,908
We gotta switch him back.

941
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,078
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

942
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,872
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

943
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,582
My spaceship?
You know where it is?

944
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,750
Excellent!

945
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,670
Good luck, cowboy.

946
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,969
Here they come.

947
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,848
Come on, Buzz!

948
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,101
What took you so long?

949
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,437
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

950
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,896
We haven't seen him.

951
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,483
Buzz.

952
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,904
My desert flower!

953
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:41,075
I have never seen true beauty
until this night!

954
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,077
Did you fix Buzz?

955
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,329
- Sort of.
- Behind you.

956
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,956
Someone's coming.

957
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,504
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

958
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,298
Darling! Are you okay?

959
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,925
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

960
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,095
You've lost weight. And so tall.

961
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,266
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

962
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:11,814
All clear.

963
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,986
Come on. Come on.

964
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,156
We're almost there.

965
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,245
Back up. Back up!

966
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,170
Come on.

967
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:42,947
Come with me!

968
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,283
I will show you
the wonders of the galaxy...

969
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:48,578
and we shall vanquish
all evil with our love!

970
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,499
Woody!

971
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,336
Come on. We're almost there.

972
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,130
The Cowboy!

973
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,598
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

974
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,227
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

975
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,067
It is open.

976
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,320
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

977
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,785
- Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

978
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,127
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.

979
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,130
Come on down. But not all at once.

980
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,090
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."

981
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,508
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

982
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,968
- Geronimo!
- Look out!

983
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:50,848
Thanks, Jess.

984
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,475
Where's my spaceship?

985
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,601
Almost there, guys.

986
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,270
Slink, you think you can make it?

987
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,607
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

988
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,903
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.

989
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,655
Okay, climb across.

990
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,117
You lost, little doggie?

991
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,457
Well, well. Look who's back.

992
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,133
I'm sorry, cowboy.

993
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,095
They broke me.

994
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,889
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

995
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,642
He don't want you no more.

996
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:35,893
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

997
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,145
Tell me this, Sheriff.

998
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,315
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

999
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,651
You think you're special, cowboy?

1000
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:48,322
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1001
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,534
Speak of the devil.

1002
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,626
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

1003
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,337
and you need to avoid that truck.

1004
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:07,341
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1005
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,886
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

1006
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:15,307
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1007
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:19,145
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1008
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,521
not from the threat of force.

1009
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,774
If that's what you want.

1010
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,738
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1011
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:33,033
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1012
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,202
Not to me, there's not.

1013
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,373
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1014
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,753
Oh, Ken!

1015
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,045
Everyone, listen!

1016
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:48,466
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1017
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,719
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1018
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,512
and he put himself on top!

1019
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,556
Anyone concur with Ken?

1020
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:01,395
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1021
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,150
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1022
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,194
Wait! What about Daisy?

1023
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,198
I don't know what you're talking about.

1024
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,909
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1025
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,952
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.

1026
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,830
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

1027
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,749
She replaced you.

1028
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,626
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1029
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,295
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1030
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,090
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

1031
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,383
She never loved me.

1032
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,302
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1033
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,682
Mama.

1034
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,560
What? You want your mommy back?

1035
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:44,438
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1036
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,151
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1037
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:53,280
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1038
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,952
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1039
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,623
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1040
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,253
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1041
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,550
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.

1042
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,889
Come on. Hurry!

1043
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:26,897
For crying out loud!

1044
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,023
Cowboy, hurry!

1045
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,528
Woody!

1046
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:38,784
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1047
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,204
Come on!

1048
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:44,707
Barbie, no!

1049
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,379
Woody!

1050
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,509
No!

1051
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,057
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

1052
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,935
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

1053
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,439
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1054
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,943
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1055
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,241
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

1056
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,285
Miss! Where are you?!

1057
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,369
Buzz!

1058
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,048
They'll never make it!

1059
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:44,934
Look out!

1060
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:50,814
Buzz!

1061
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,574
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

1062
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,829
Buzz, you okay?

1063
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,999
Buzz! Buzz!

1064
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,552
That wasn't me, was it?

1065
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:24,682
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1066
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,309
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1067
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,645
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1068
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,898
Woody! So where are we now?

1069
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,442
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1070
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,708
Hold on, we're going in!

1071
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,725
You got all your pieces?

1072
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,393
The claw!

1073
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,980
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!

1074
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:15,441
No!

1075
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,323
Hang on!

1076
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,880
Woody! What do we do?

1077
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,673
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1078
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,593
- Woody!
- Slinky!

1079
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,138
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1080
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,016
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.

1081
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,768
You might wanna take a look at this.

1082
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,356
Quick! Grab something metal!

1083
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,030
You heard the guy.

1084
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,702
It's not working!

1085
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:15,542
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1086
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,420
Help, please! Help!

1087
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,255
Woody!

1088
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,510
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

1089
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,472
Woody!

1090
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,358
Go, go!

1091
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:46,740
Thank you, Sheriff.

1092
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,033
We're all in this together.

1093
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,451
Right, guys?

1094
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:51,954
Guys?

1095
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,414
Woody! Down here!

1096
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:59,086
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.

1097
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,423
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1098
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,259
We're gonna be okay!

1099
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,177
Hey!

1100
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,513
I don't think that's daylight.

1101
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:16,979
Run!

1102
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,874
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1103
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,000
Come on!

1104
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,212
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1105
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:50,929
Hurry!

1106
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,727
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!

1107
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,189
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1108
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:01,857
No. No!

1109
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:03,108
Lotso!

1110
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,570
No!

1111
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,796
Rex!

1112
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,930
Buzz! What do we do?

1113
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,137
The claw.

1114
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,959
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1115
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,294
I take it all back.

1116
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,338
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

1117
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,555
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1118
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:43,435
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

1119
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,104
My boys!

1120
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,397
Daddy!

1121
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:49,941
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1122
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,027
Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

1123
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,863
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1124
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:05,749
- Hey!
- What you got?

1125
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,460
I had me one of these when I was a kid.

1126
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,712
Strawberries.

1127
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,969
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1128
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,561
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1129
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,064
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

1130
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,191
What about you guys? I mean,

1131
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,861
maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

1132
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:39,908
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

1133
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,995
<i>- Just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!</i>

1134
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,789
Wait, I'll check!

1135
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:49,835
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!

1136
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,713
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

1137
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,898
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?

1138
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,692
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1139
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,818
Okay. Come on.

1140
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:19,573
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1141
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:21,575
All right. Go. Go, go!

1142
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,293
Okay. All clear.

1143
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,595
There you are.

1144
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,519
- There you go.
- Buzz.

1145
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:56,943
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1146
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,904
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1147
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:03,116
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

1148
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,785
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1149
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,662
Sure thing.

1150
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,708
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1151
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,253
<i>'Course I will. Besides, I know about</i>

1152
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,923
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

1153
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,841
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

1154
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,510
I'll get something on the way.

1155
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,095
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1156
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,654
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1157
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,323
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.

1158
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,328
Andy.

1159
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,504
Mom, it's okay.

1160
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,132
I know. It's just...

1161
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,596
I wish I could always be with you.

1162
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,517
You will be, Mom.

1163
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,034
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1164
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,287
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1165
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,248
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1166
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,006
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.

1167
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:47,220
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1168
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,471
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1169
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:52,058
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1170
01:27:58,565 --> 01:27:59,649
Hey.

1171
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:10,577
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
ll should donate these?

1172
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,913
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1173
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,611
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1174
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,947
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."

1175
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,492
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

1176
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:53,995
Mom.

1177
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:56,373
- Andy"

1178
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,249
Wow. Look at you.

1179
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,210
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1180
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,170
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1181
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,381
So, what can we do for you?

1182
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,675
I have some toys here.

1183
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,760
You hear that, Bonnie?

1184
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,304
So, you're Bonnie?

1185
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:13,807
I'm Andy.

1186
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:17,644
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1187
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:21,523
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1188
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,609
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1189
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:35,995
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1190
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:40,500
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1191
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,671
Here.

1192
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:02,897
This is Rex, the meanest,
most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1193
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:12,907
The Potato Heads. Mr and Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1194
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,201
'cause they're madly in love.

1195
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:19,289
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1196
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:22,167
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1197
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:27,464
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr Pork Chop.

1198
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,678
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1199
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,430
Pizza Planet.

1200
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,391
And this

1201
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:44,147
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1202
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,317
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1203
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:51,070
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1204
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,408
To infinity and beyond!

1205
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,537
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1206
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:05,335
They mean a lot to me.

1207
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:12,592
My cowboy!

1208
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,598
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1209
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,393
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha...?

1210
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,564
There's a snake in my boot.

1211
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:44,958
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1212
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:48,753
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1213
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,797
And kind. And smart.

1214
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:56,719
But the thing that makes Woody special
is he'll never give up on you.

1215
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,222
Ever.

1216
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,809
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1217
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,482
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1218
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:11,568
Okay then.

1219
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:26,374
Oh, no! Dr Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1220
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:29,168
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!

1221
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,795
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1222
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:33,673
And we'll actually need the rocket.

1223
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,634
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1224
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:42,724
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

1225
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,643
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1226
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,103
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1227
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:49,355
Mr and Mrs Potato Head
are in trouble.

1228
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:50,940
Get on, Woody.

1229
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,444
It's my friend Woody.

1230
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:58,114
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1231
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,060
Thanks, guys.

1232
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,650
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1233
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,193
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1234
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:51,084
So long, partner.

1235
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,425
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1236
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:02,220
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1237
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,085
New toys!

1238
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:47,682
Noses.

1239
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:11,099
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

1240
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:14,685
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1241
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,355
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."

1242
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,526
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.

1243
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,987
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.

1244
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,699
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!

1245
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,951
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!

1246
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,160
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!

1247
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:33,955
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!

1248
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,415
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1249
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,626
- Yes!
- We did it!

1250
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:40,670
High-five! Hold on.

1251
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:46,175
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1252
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,303
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!

1253
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:52,723
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.

1254
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,101
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1255
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,860
What the...

1256
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:08,573
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

1257
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:13,077
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1258
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:16,747
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1259
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,417
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1260
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,128
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1261
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:26,090
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1262
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,759
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1263
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,647
I don't know what came over me.

1264
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,650
Just go with it, Buzz.
