00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:34,447
[Barking]

2
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,712
[Barking]

3
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:03,696
[Clock Chiming]

4
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,968
My story begins
in London...

5
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:20,879
not so very long ago.

6
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,251
Yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems like an eternity.

7
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,290
At that time,
I lived with my pet...

8
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:33,384
- in a bachelor flat
just off Regents Park.
- [Piano]

9
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,929
It was a
beautiful spring day,

10
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,431
a tedious time of the year
for bachelors.

11
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:42,663
Oh... that's my pet,
Roger Radcliff,

12
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:45,706
a musician of sorts.

13
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm the one
with the spots.

14
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,206
My name's Pongo.

15
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:53,008
As far as I could see,

16
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,346
the old notion that
a bachelor's life was so...

17
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,215
glamorous and carefree
was all nonsense.

18
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:03,053
It was downright dull.

19
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,355
[Sigh]

20
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,461
It was plain to see that
my old pet needed someone.

21
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:20,633
But if it were left up to Roger,
we'd be bachelors forever.

22
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,734
He was married to his work,
writing songs.

23
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,836
Songs about romance...
of all things,

24
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:29,179
something he knew
absolutely nothing about.

25
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:35,381
Oh, he's intelligent enough,
as humans go.

26
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:39,790
And I think you could say, Roger is
a rather handsome animal in his way.

27
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,625
I could see no reason
why my pet...

28
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:45,131
didn't deserve
an attractive mate.

29
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,930
At least I was determined
to do my best.

30
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:54,474
Of course, dogs are a pretty
poor judge of human beauty.

31
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,812
But I had
a rough idea...

32
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:03,578
of what
to look for.

33
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,382
Hmm!
Unusual breed.

34
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,248
[Chuckle]
Very unusual.

35
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,625
Hmm!
Oh, surely not.

36
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,060
Well now,
what have we here?

37
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:23,569
Hmm.

38
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:27,199
Well, a little...
too short coupled.

39
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,243
Nope!

40
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,747
I say!
Well, I do say!

41
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:37,376
Now there's
a fancy breed.

42
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:42,185
Hmm.
Perhaps a little too fancy.

43
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:45,623
Yes, much too fancy.

44
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:50,656
Too old.
Too young.

45
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:57,837
It was a problem,
a real problem.

46
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:01,341
Well, now that's
a bit more like it!

47
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:04,742
The most beautiful creature
on four legs!

48
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,705
Now if only the girl...

49
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,048
Well!
She's very lovely too.

50
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,054
It was almost too good
to be true.

51
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,717
I'd never find another pair
like that,

52
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,761
not if I looked
for 100 years.

53
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,626
Ah, they're heading
for the park.

54
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,633
A perfect meeting place...
if I can only arrange it.

55
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:31,195
Uh-oh... but Roger never
stopped work 'til after 5:00.

56
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,263
That would be
too late.

57
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,080
[Barking]

58
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,216
After 5:00 already.

59
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,821
- Fancy that.
- [Barking]

60
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,598
All right, Pongo.
All right, boy.

61
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,138
[Barking]

62
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:11,068
[Yipping]

63
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,295
Pongo, boy,
take it easy!

64
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:32,025
What's all
the hurry?

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,991
[Barking]

66
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,003
[Barking]

67
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,842
Pongo, boy,
slow down.

68
00:07:56,457 --> 00:08:00,587
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.

69
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,788
Then suddenly...
I spotted them.

70
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:06,300
It was a perfect situation
if I planned it right.

71
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,495
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.

72
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,506
He'd settle on the grass, puff
his pipe and that would be it.

73
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:17,533
No, it was all
up to me.

74
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:20,240
Well.

75
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,270
At first I had
no particular plan,

76
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,602
just anything
to attract attention.

77
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:49,541
You know,
stir things up a bit.

78
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:54,110
Pongo,
you silly old thing!

79
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,912
C'mon!
C'mon, let's have it, boy.

80
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,179
- Pongo!
- [Yipping]

81
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:04,491
Pongo!

82
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,797
[Barking]

83
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:14,892
[Pongo] For awhile,
it seemed to work.

84
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,870
At least they
had seen one another.

85
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,772
Things were going along
first-rate.

86
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:24,140
But for some strange reason
they left!

87
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:30,976
C'mon, you old renegade.
We're going home.

88
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:33,782
[Pongo]
But I wasn't giving up.

89
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:38,484
I was determined that somehow
they just had to meet.

90
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,663
- Oh!
- Ohhh!

91
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,597
I beg your pardon.
Please excuse me.

92
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,328
I must say,
what on earth!

93
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,370
- Oh, really. Good heavens.
- Oh, dear.

94
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:53,236
- Ohh!
- Ahh, ahh!

95
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,276
Oh, oh.

96
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:01,975
[Gasping]

97
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,577
Oh, my new spring suit
and my new hat!

98
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:10,556
[Roger] Ah, ah...
I'm terribly sorry.

99
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,786
Please let me
help you.

100
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,454
I'm so sorry.

101
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,191
I don't know
what's come over him.

102
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:22,532
I'm so sorry. He's never
acted this way before.

103
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:25,936
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.

104
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,941
Please?
Oh.

105
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,739
Oh, I say.
Here, take mine.

106
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:35,381
Oh.

107
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,253
[Laughing]

108
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,625
Wilt thou love her,
comfort her,

109
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:59,195
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health;

110
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,605
and forsaking
all others,

111
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:06,443
keep thee only unto her
so long as ye both shall live?

112
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,778
[Roger]
I will.

113
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,110
[Pongo] For the first
six months or so...

114
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,859
we lived in a small house
near the park,

115
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:16,927
a modest little place...

116
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:21,932
but just right for two couples
who were just starting out.

117
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,265
[Piano]

118
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:30,002
Perdita, darling,
are you all right?

119
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:33,043
[Chuckle]
Oh, of course, dear.

120
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,409
After all, dogs were having
puppies long before our time.

121
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,246
[Chuckle]

122
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:47,223
[Pongo] Oh, that's Nanny,
a wonderful cook and housekeeper.

123
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,227
She's such a kind,
understanding soul.

124
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,094
You know,

125
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,725
at times she seems
almost canine.

126
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,666
Roger, dear,

127
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,330
tea time.

128
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:04,136
Tea time!

129
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:11,139
[Roger]
Be down in a minute

130
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:18,913
Ta tum ti ta tum

131
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,485
Do you like my new song

132
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,463
Ta tum ti ta tum
Such clever lyrics.

133
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,524
[Chuckle]
Melody first, my dear.

134
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:33,263
And then the lyrics,
hmm?

135
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:39,841
[Car Horn]

136
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:44,041
Oh, Pongo... it's her.
It's that devil woman.

137
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,717
[Car Horn]

138
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:54,583
[Roger] Oh, must be Cruella, your
dearly devoted old schoolmate.

139
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,627
Cruella de Vil.

140
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,889
That's it!

141
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:01,397
Cruella de Vil

142
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,900
Cruella de Vil

143
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:08,064
If she doesn't scare you
no evil thing will

144
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,233
- Oh, Roger.
- To see her is to take
a sudden chill

145
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,742
Ohh!

146
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,211
Cruella... Cruella

147
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,080
She's like a spider
waiting for the... kill

148
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:22,551
Roger,
she'll hear you.

149
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,248
Look out for
Cruella de Vil

150
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,050
Let her in, Nanny.

151
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:33,086
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?

152
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:37,100
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!

153
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,061
Where are they?
Where are they?

154
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,971
For heaven sakes,
where are they?

155
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:51,844
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.

156
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,512
No time for games.
Where are the little brutes?

157
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,181
[Trumpet]

158
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:02,522
Lt'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.

159
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:06,723
[Chuckle]
Anita, you're such a wit.

160
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,698
Here, dog, here.

161
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,929
- Here, dog.
- [Growling]

162
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:15,131
Cruella, isn't that
a new fur coat?

163
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:18,073
My only true love,
darling.

164
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:22,078
I live for furs.
I worship furs!

165
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:28,017
Is there a woman in this
wretched world who doesn't?

166
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,359
Oh, I'd like a nice fur,
but there are many other thing...

167
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:40,625
Sweet, simple Anita.
[Chuckle]

168
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,292
I know, I know!

169
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,859
This horrid little house
is your dream castle.

170
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:54,605
And poor Roger is your
bold and fearless Sir Galahad!

171
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,738
Oh, Cruella.

172
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:01,547
Then of course you have
your little spotted friends.

173
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,883
Oh yes,

174
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:08,085
I must say... such perfectly
beautiful coats.

175
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,424
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.

176
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:13,430
Let me know when
the puppies arrive.

177
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:15,830
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.

178
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,233
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks.

179
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:22,739
Cheerio, darling.

180
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,173
Ohh!

181
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:30,010
At first you think
Cruella is a devil

182
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,073
But after time
has worn away the shock

183
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,283
You come
to realize

184
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,720
You've seen
her kind of eyes

185
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:42,748
Watching you from
underneath a rock

186
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:45,955
- You're no help.
- This vampire bat

187
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,191
This inhuman beast

188
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:52,066
She ought to be locked up
and never released

189
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:57,130
The world was such
a wholesome place until

190
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,403
Cruella

191
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,445
Cruella de Vil

192
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,849
Roger,
you are an idiot!

193
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,479
[Laughter]

194
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:14,286
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.

195
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:16,883
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.

196
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,361
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.

197
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,661
- Nothing's going to happen
to our puppies.
- What does she want with them?

198
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,361
She can't possibly
love them.

199
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:28,098
Oh, Pongo.

200
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,664
I was so happy at first,
but now l...

201
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,767
[Crying]

202
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,278
Oh, l...

203
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:40,147
I wish we weren't
having any.

204
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,089
[Thunder]

205
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,122
[Pongo] Poor Perdita.
Of course, she had no choice.

206
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,166
The puppies arrived
right on schedule...

207
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:00,169
one wild and stormy night
in October.

208
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:11,405
[Footsteps]

209
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:37,166
Ohh!

210
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:40,005
Steady, boy.

211
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,545
[Nanny]
The puppies are here!

212
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:44,911
Oh... the puppies
are here!

213
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,609
H-H-How many?

214
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:48,879
- Eight.
- Eight?

215
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,251
[Barking]

216
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:55,224
By George, Pongo!
Eight puppies.

217
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,590
Ten.

218
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,994
- [Anita] Eleven.
- Eleven.

219
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:04,626
Eleven?
Eleven puppies, Pongo.

220
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:07,865
Wait a minute now,
wait a minute... thirteen!

221
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,738
No, no, no.
Fourteen.

222
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,507
- Ohh... fifteen!
- Fifteen?

223
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,016
And the mother's
doing fine, love.

224
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:23,281
You ducky thing, you.

225
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:26,123
Fifteen puppies?

226
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,124
Why, Pongo,
that's marvelous!

227
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,524
It's fabulous!

228
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:33,495
Why, you old rascal!

229
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,498
Fourteen.

230
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,435
Just fourteen.

231
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:43,701
We lost one.

232
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:47,073
Poor little thing.

233
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,654
Oh, Pongo, boy.

234
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,857
It's just one
of those things.

235
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,991
And yet?

236
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:03,662
And yet I wonder.

237
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,817
[Thunder]

238
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,825
Look, Pongo.

239
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,361
Anita!

240
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,063
Nanny.
Fifteen!

241
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,129
We still have
fifteen!

242
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:43,802
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.

243
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:46,573
See? He's just
as good as new.

244
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:50,048
Can you imagine, Roger,
fifteen puppies!

245
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:54,414
Fifteen.
Fifteen puppies!

246
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:56,615
How marvelous.

247
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,387
How marvelous,
how perfectly... ugh!

248
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,419
The devil take it.
They're mongrels... no spots!

249
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:07,558
No spots at all.
What a horrid little white rat.

250
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,602
They're not mongrels!

251
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,003
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.

252
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:16,440
That's right. They'll have
their spots in a few weeks.

253
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,139
Oh, well, in that case I'll
take them all. The whole litter.

254
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,375
Just name your price, dear.

255
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:25,976
I'm afraid
we can't give them up.

256
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:28,920
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.

257
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:33,050
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely feed yourselves.

258
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:35,356
I'm sure
we'll get along.

259
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,523
[Chuckle]
Yes, I know. I know!

260
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,830
Roger's...
Roger's songs!

261
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,927
[Laughing]

262
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,032
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you
twice what they're worth.

263
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,169
I'm being
more than generous.

264
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,305
Blast this pen.

265
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,839
Blast this wretched,
wretched pen!

266
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,352
When can the puppies
leave their mother?

267
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,755
Two weeks?
Three weeks?

268
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,386
[Roger] Never.

269
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:12,922
- What?
- We're n-n-not selling the puppies.

270
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,265
Not a single one.
Do you understand?

271
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,930
Anita, is he serious?

272
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:21,497
I really
don't know Roger.

273
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:25,511
- Cruella, he...
- Surely he must be joking!

274
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,843
No, no, no.
I-I-I mean it.

275
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:31,009
You're not getting one.
N-N-Not one.

276
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:33,780
And that's... final.

277
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:38,783
Why, you horrid man!

278
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:41,487
You... you...

279
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:44,928
All right, keep the little
beasts for all I care.

280
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:47,296
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!

281
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:51,394
But I warn you, Anita,
I'm through with all of you!

282
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:53,632
I'll get even.
Just wait.

283
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:56,676
You'll be sorry,
you fools!

284
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,836
You... you idiots!

285
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,971
[Door Slams]

286
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:04,313
[Barking]

287
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:07,444
Oh, Roger!
You were magnificent, darling.

288
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,819
He was a bloomin' hero,
ma'am!

289
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,791
Indeed he was.
A bloomin' hero!

290
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,564
Perdy?
Perdy, darling?

291
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:21,430
We're keeping the puppies,
every single one of them.

292
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,969
My ol' pet Roger, he told
that devil woman off.

293
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:26,471
He told her off, Perdy.
She's gone.

294
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,533
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.

295
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:50,096
- C'mon, Thunderbolt.
- C'mon, Thunderbolt.

296
00:22:57,537 --> 00:23:00,665
Go get him, Thunder.

297
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,868
After him, boy.

298
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,343
He'll get that
dirty ol' horse thief.

299
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:08,848
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest
dog in the whole world.

300
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:10,974
He's even better
than Dad.

301
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:14,111
No dog's better
than Dad.

302
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,280
What's he going to do,
Dad?

303
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,416
Shh, shh.
Let's just wait and see.

304
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:26,691
[Puppy] Look at him run,
the old coward.

305
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,735
That old dirty Dawson!

306
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,861
The yellow-livered
old skunk!

307
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:33,770
I'd like to tear
his gizzard out.

308
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,105
[Perdy] Why, Patch, where did
you ever hear such talk?

309
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:39,441
Certainly not
from your mother.

310
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:49,754
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.

311
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:52,656
He'll get that
yellow-livered...

312
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,593
Well, he'll get him,
all right.

313
00:23:55,662 --> 00:23:58,597
Lucky, get down.
We can't see.

314
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,293
Mother,
make him get down.

315
00:24:01,368 --> 00:24:04,337
C'mon, Lucky.
Down, dear.

316
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,474
Missed him.
Missed him by a mile.

317
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,140
I'm hungry, mother.
I'm hungry.

318
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:18,480
Rolly, you've just had
your dinner.

319
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:20,486
But I am,
just the same.

320
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:23,717
I'm so hungry I could eat...
a whole elephant.

321
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,849
Shh!

322
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:28,486
[Puppy] There he is,
behind that rock.

323
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:34,196
[Gunshot]

324
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,565
Oh, dear.
He shot poor Thunder.

325
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:41,403
He missed him. OI' Thunder's
pretending... I think.

326
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,534
[Wicked Laugh]

327
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:52,208
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.

328
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,583
- Lucky, get down.
- Ha-ha-ha!

329
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,179
[Whimpering, Yipping]

330
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,873
I'm hungry, Mother.
I really am.

331
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:24,550
[TV] Don't miss next week's episode.
Who will triumph?

332
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:26,609
OI' Thunder
always wins!

333
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:29,587
And speaking of champions,
friends,

334
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:33,183
Kanine Krunchies is the
champion of all dog biscuits.

335
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,319
Kanine Krunchies
can't be beat

336
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,329
They make each meal
a special treat

337
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:42,027
Happy dogs are those who eat
nutritious Kanine Krunchies

338
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:45,230
Perdy, we better get these
little nippers off to bed...

339
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:48,331
if we're going for a...
w-a-l-k.

340
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:51,070
- We want to go too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?

341
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,442
We never
get to go.

342
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,708
Come along, children.
Bedtime.

343
00:25:55,782 --> 00:26:00,048
But we're not a...
[Yawn]... bit sleepy.

344
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,021
We want to go
for a walk in the park.

345
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:07,116
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.

346
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:11,697
[Pongo] One, two,
three, four...

347
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:16,031
five, six...
seven...

348
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:18,229
eight, nine, ten, eleven,

00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:48,306
[Barking]

522
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,845
[Howling]

523
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:58,146
[Barking]

524
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:01,516
[Barking]

525
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,052
Towser,
what's going on?

526
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:08,560
What is it?
What's all the gossip?

527
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:13,258
'Taint no gossip, Lucy.
It be all the way from London.

528
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,860
- You don't say!
- 15 puppies stolen.

529
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:21,533
There's no puppies around here,
not since Nellie's last litter.

530
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:24,941
Well, then, we'd best
send the word along.

531
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:27,980
It be up to me
to reach the Colonel!

532
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:30,539
He be the only one
in barking range.

533
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:32,915
You'll never reach him
at this hour!

534
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,977
Well, I can try!

535
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:37,615
I'll bark all night
if I have to.

536
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:39,886
Ahem!

537
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,021
[Barking]

538
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:52,628
[Distant Barking]

539
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,405
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

540
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:03,176
Hmm... sounds like
old Towser.

541
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,912
It's an alert.
Sergeant!

542
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:09,922
Sergeant Tibs!
I say, Sergeant!

543
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,117
[Neighing]

544
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,558
Oh, yes, Captain!

545
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:17,927
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.

546
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:20,296
Righto, sir.
Right away, sir!

547
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,838
Colonel?

548
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:28,841
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir?

549
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:32,845
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?

550
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:35,381
Sergeant Tibs
reporting, sir.

551
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:38,508
Tibs? Tibs?
Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!

552
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:42,521
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea
of barging in at this hour?

553
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:43,817
But Colonel...

554
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,723
- Hold on, Sergeant. You hear that?
- [Barking]

555
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:49,762
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.

556
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,267
- We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
- Righto, sir.

557
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:58,771
- It's old Towser down
at Withermarsh, sir.
- [Barking]

558
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,569
By Jove, yes!
So it is.

559
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,973
Well, I'll see
what he wants.

560
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,978
Ahem!

561
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,640
Woof, woof, woof!

562
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:17,323
Woof, woof, woof!

563
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,154
It be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!

564
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,286
He wants the message.

565
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:25,957
You'd better make it loud
or he'll never get it.

566
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:29,001
[Barking]

567
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,802
One long howl,
two short.

568
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:36,342
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.

569
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:39,469
- What's the word?
- It's from London.

570
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:43,505
- It must be important.
- Yes, I'll get the rest of it.

571
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,016
Ahem!

572
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:49,647
Woof, woof, woof!

573
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:54,558
[Distant Barking]

574
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:01,292
Sounds like a number.
Three fives is 13.

575
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:05,304
- That's 15, sir.
- Of course, 15.

576
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:08,000
[Barking]

577
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:11,407
Yes... Dot, Spot...
Spotted puddings.

578
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:14,072
Poodles.

579
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:18,049
- No, puddles!
- Puddles, sir?

580
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:23,055
15 spotted puddles stolen?
Oh, balderdash!

581
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:29,818
- Better double-check it, Colonel.
- [Grumbling]

582
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,660
Oh, yes,
I suppose I'd better.

583
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:36,031
Woof, woof, woof!

584
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,365
[Barking]

585
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,000
Two woofs,
one yip and a woof.

586
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:46,705
- It sounds like "puppies"!
- Of course, puppies!

587
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,714
I just remembered.

588
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,717
Two nights past, I heard
puppy barking at Hell Hall.

589
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,549
The old de Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs!

590
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,055
No one's lived there
for years.

591
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:00,388
Hold on! There's smoke
coming from the chimney!

592
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,274
[Colonel] By Jove, that's strange...
strange indeed.

593
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,276
I suppose
we'd better investigate.

594
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,869
I'll send word for
ol' Towser to stand by.

595
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:14,882
Roof! Roo-roo-roof!

596
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,885
Please... stand... by.

597
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:21,150
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.

598
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:23,487
Oh... maybe the ol' boy's
found something!

599
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,426
Oh, I do hope so.

600
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:36,771
They say the ol' place is haunted or
bewitched or some such fiddle faddle.

601
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,864
Fiddle faddle
and rot, sir.

602
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:41,705
Just the same, Sergeant,
use extreme caution.

603
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,245
No telling what sort of
hocus pocus you might run into.

604
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:46,543
[Gulps]

605
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:49,880
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.

606
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:53,012
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

607
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:32,456
Psst!

608
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:37,090
- [Whispering] Rover! Spotty!
- Hmm. What?

609
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,134
Are you one of
the 15 stolen puppies?

610
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:42,432
We're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.

611
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:44,496
There's 99 of us
all together.

612
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:47,769
Ninety-nine!

613
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:56,651
How 'bout that bunch
of little ones?

614
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,120
They have names and colors.
They're not from the pet shops.

615
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:03,158
- Fifteen of 'em?
- We never counted them.

616
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:05,819
They're over there
by the tv.

617
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:13,793
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the baduns.

618
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,131
Baduns?

619
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:17,729
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.

620
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,037
They're mean ones,
they are.

621
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:25,910
[TV]

622
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:30,113
Hey, look, Horace!

623
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:33,713
Watch me pot His Lordship
smack on the conk.

624
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:38,351
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
How's that for callin' 'em, eh?

625
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:40,657
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

626
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:43,994
[Whispering]
One... two...

627
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:47,661
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.

628
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:51,638
[Mumbling]
Give us a swig,

629
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:54,403
- just a short one.
- Now, Horace,

630
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:57,274
this hogwash ain't fit
for a fancy bloke like yourself.

631
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,747
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it,
you cabbage head!

632
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:03,580
All right.

633
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:08,351
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it
gives you colly wobbles, that's what.

634
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:17,293
Hey, Jasper.
Did you...

635
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:21,535
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven...

636
00:44:21,604 --> 00:44:26,735
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!

637
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:29,209
[Yipping]

638
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:31,212
Go on, get out of here...

639
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,214
or I'll black
your other peeper.

640
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:36,547
Where was I?
Nine...

641
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,452
Nine... three more.

642
00:44:39,521 --> 00:44:43,548
Twelve and... one, two, three.
That's fifteen!

643
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:46,527
They're the ones!

644
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:50,529
- [Screeching]
- Blimey!

645
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,567
- [Barking]
- What the...

646
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:56,264
Horace, look what we got!
A tabby cat!

647
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:59,637
[Yipping]

648
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,108
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

649
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,338
How'd you like
a tabby cat stew?

650
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,644
Or a cat casserole?

651
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:10,048
A la mode!

652
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:18,154
[Howling]

653
00:45:18,227 --> 00:45:20,991
[Chiming]

654
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:26,000
[Howling And Barking]

655
00:45:34,043 --> 00:45:37,911
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- It's the great dane.

656
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,245
He has news for us.
He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.

657
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:44,684
- How'll we get out?
- The back bedroom window.

658
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:47,051
It's always open
a wee bit. C'mon.

659
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:53,687
- Woof! Woof!
- [Barking]

660
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,662
Pongos, you've made it.
Good.

661
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:59,326
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?

662
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,131
They've been located
somewhere north of here...

663
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:04,399
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.

664
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:07,533
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.

665
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:12,171
I'll go along as far as Camden Road
and give you instructions.

666
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:23,086
[Dane] When you reach
Withermarsh, contact old Towser.

667
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,683
He'll direct you to the Colonel
and the Colonel will take you...

668
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,695
to your puppies
at the de Vil place.

669
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:30,664
- De Vil!
- The de Vil place!

670
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:33,668
Oh, Pongo,
it was her!

671
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:37,638
- Oh, someone you know?
- There's no time to explain.

672
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,935
I hope we're
not too late.

673
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,606
Good luck, Pongo.

674
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:49,447
If you lose your way,
contact the barking chain.

675
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:52,180
They'll be
standing by!

676
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:15,538
[Honking]

677
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:09,728
Any news, Colonel?

678
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:11,823
Not a blasted thing.

679
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,097
They're lost or captured,
or something or other.

680
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,832
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.

681
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:20,204
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.

682
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,835
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.

683
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:26,108
But it's heading
for Hell Hall.

684
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,843
It... It's stopping
at the gate!

685
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:30,407
It is?

686
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:33,046
Blast it all!
Better see what's up.

687
00:48:33,122 --> 00:48:35,818
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.

688
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:39,459
Take over, Captain.

689
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:41,496
Righto, sir.

690
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,101
[TV Quiz Master] I'm sorry,
Mr. Simpkins. The answer is no, no, no.

691
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:52,572
Six down, four to go.

692
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:56,941
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.

693
00:48:57,012 --> 00:48:59,572
It must be a yes
or no question.

694
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:02,981
Do you understand?
Tonight!

695
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:04,985
[Horace]
But they ain't big enough.

696
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:06,942
You couldn't get half a dozen coats
out of the whole caboodle.

697
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:07,931
You couldn't get half a dozen coats
out of the whole caboodle.

698
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,205
Coats!
Dog-skin coats?

699
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:12,747
We'll settle for half a dozen!
We can't wait.

700
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:16,751
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!

701
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,878
How're we gonna do it?

702
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:21,650
Any way you like.
Poison them, drown them.

703
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:24,750
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?

704
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:27,455
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, "ee-ther."

705
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,087
"Eye-ther"!

706
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:33,794
I don't care how you kill the little
beasts, but do it... and do it now!

707
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:36,804
Aw, please, miss.
Have pity.

708
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:40,069
Can't we see the rest
of the show first?

709
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:43,009
[Horace] We want to see
"What's My Crime?"

710
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,974
[Explosion]

711
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:51,650
Listen, you idiots!

712
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,053
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done...

713
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:58,582
or I'll...
I'll call the police!

714
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,855
Do you understand?

715
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:10,462
I think she means it.

716
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,337
Ah...
We'll get on with it...

717
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:16,469
as soon as
the show's over.

718
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,848
Will you please
sign in, sir?

719
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:26,545
You'd better get out of here
if you want to save your skins.

720
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:28,556
- But how?
- Shh.

721
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:31,388
There's a hole in the wall
there by the door.

722
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,827
C'mon, shake a leg.

723
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:37,024
Psst.
Kids, follow me.

724
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:40,466
[Horace] Hey, Jasper, look!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

725
00:50:40,536 --> 00:50:42,504
It's old Meathead.

726
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:47,838
Yeah, what do you know...
old Meathead Fauncewater.

727
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,208
C'mon,
don't crowd.

728
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,905
One at a time.
One at a time!

729
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:56,507
For our last contestant,

730
00:50:56,585 --> 00:50:58,917
meet Mr. Percival Fauncewater.

731
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:04,584
If the panel fails to guess your
unusual crime in ten questions,

732
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,652
you will receive two weeks vacation
at a seaside resort,

733
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:10,357
all expenses paid.

734
00:51:10,432 --> 00:51:15,734
[Quiz Master] That is, after
you've paid your debt to society.

735
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:20,906
Who will take the first
question? Inspector?

736
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:24,309
Could your crime
be classified as larceny?

737
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:26,904
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!

738
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:30,645
Form a queue... along the wall.
Snap it up.

739
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,279
[Quiz Master] Mr. Fauncewater
is a burglar by trade,

740
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,721
but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.

741
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,850
- The answer is no.
- [Laughing]

742
00:51:37,926 --> 00:51:40,121
One down, nine to go.
Miss Birdwell?

743
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:43,358
If your crime
wasn't robbery, did you...

744
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:46,458
Oh, dear,
what I mean is...

745
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:49,333
Do something of
a violent nature, that is...

746
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:51,804
Come, Miss Birdwell,
we're running short of time.

747
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:53,808
[Miss Birdwell] So sorry.

748
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:56,845
- Did you do someone in?
- Oh!

749
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,107
[Quiz Master] I'm sorry.
The answer is no.

750
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,274
Two down,
eight to go.

751
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,648
- Mr. Simpkins?
- Psst.

752
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:06,847
Hey, kid, let's go.

753
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:11,518
[Mr. Simpkins] Could it be
a violation of a city ordinance?

754
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:13,060
No.

755
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:17,155
Hey, get out of the way,
you little runt!

756
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:20,360
[Quiz Master] Three down,
seven to go. Inspector?

757
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:22,995
[Inspector] Very confusing,
I must say.

758
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:25,505
Surely,
this crime could...

759
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:28,805
- [Buzzer]
- I'm terribly sorry.

760
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:32,813
- We've run out of time.
- [Horace] Ain't that always the way!

761
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:36,908
Would it be possible for
Mr. Fauncewater to come back next week?

762
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,215
Then we could finish
our little game.

763
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:43,452
Good night, audience.
See you next week at this same time...

764
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:45,993
on "What's My Crime?"

765
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:49,656
Ah, oh well.

766
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:52,199
C'mon, Horace.
Let's get on with it.

767
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:56,803
I'll pop 'em on the head,
you do the skinnin'.

768
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:58,806
No you don't, Jasper!

769
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:02,469
I'll pop 'em off and
you do the skinnin'.

770
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:06,476
Horace, look!

771
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:09,984
They're gone.
They flew the coop...

772
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:13,351
right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.

773
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:17,791
We'll run 'em down before
you can say "Bob's your uncle."

774
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,165
[Whimpering]

775
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:26,496
There they go, Horace,
up the stairs.

776
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,469
[Whistling]

777
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:31,665
Here puppies.

778
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,334
[Whistling]

779
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,173
Here, puppies!
C'mon now.

780
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:39,543
Don't go hiding from
ol' Uncle Jasper.

781
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:45,252
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

782
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,550
I thought we was
gonna pop 'em off.

783
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:49,955
Shut up.
Take a squint in there.

784
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,653
I'll check these
other two rooms.

785
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:57,791
[Whistling]
Here, puppies.

786
00:53:57,866 --> 00:54:01,302
Come on out.
Come out wherever you are.

787
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,304
[Screeching]

788
00:54:03,372 --> 00:54:05,237
Horace! Oh!

789
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:08,208
[Jasper] It's that mangy tabby cat.
He's the ringleader.

790
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:11,177
Head 'em off.
Head 'em...

791
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:15,876
[Yipping]

792
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:18,215
You bungling blockhead!

793
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:21,255
Back here!
Back here!

794
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:26,290
Shh.
Here they come.

795
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:29,353
Double-crossin' little twerps,
pullin' a snitch on us!

796
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:33,629
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.

797
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:36,330
It ain't fair, Jasper.

798
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:40,307
- [Whining]
- Horace, there they go!

799
00:54:43,045 --> 00:54:45,570
Sergeant?
I say, Sergeant.

800
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:48,480
No time to explain.
Busy, sir.

801
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,624
Shut that door!

802
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:01,993
We'll close in on 'em.
Enough of this "Ring Around the Rosy."

803
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,804
Oh, Pongo,
I'm afraid we're lost.

804
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:15,843
It can't be far.
[Barking]

805
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:20,942
By Jove!
It can't be the Pongos.

806
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:23,746
[Barking]

807
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:30,324
Grrr...
[Howling]

808
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:33,225
It's the Colonel.
This way.

809
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:38,733
[Barking And Howling]

810
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:42,598
Colonel?
Are you the Colonel?

811
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:45,469
Oh, Pingo!
Uh... Uh... Pongo?

812
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,065
Our puppies,
are they all right?

813
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:50,577
No time to explain.
There's trouble.

814
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:53,671
A big hullabaloo.
Come along!

815
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:55,979
Follow me!

816
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:58,986
Ah, ha-ha-ha!

817
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:02,387
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.

818
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,820
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?

819
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:09,159
C'mon, Horace.
Give 'em what for.

820
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:11,631
I'm right
behind ya, lad.

821
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,395
Uh... oh!

822
00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:16,460
You clumsy clod!

823
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:21,373
I'll knock the spots off you.
Let go!

824
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,604
Let go!

825
00:56:23,678 --> 00:56:25,703
[Barking]

826
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:30,108
Well, by George!

827
00:56:34,623 --> 00:56:38,559
[Whimpering]

828
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,720
You mangy mongrel!

829
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,198
I'll knock your
blinkin' block off.

830
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,590
Yeow!

831
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:51,939
Blast 'em, Tibs.
Give 'em what for.

832
00:56:52,007 --> 00:56:54,271
No, Colonel.
Retreat, retreat!

833
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:56,867
Yes. Yes, of course.
Retreat!

834
00:56:56,945 --> 00:57:00,830
Retreat, on the double!

835
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,726
Help, Jasper!
Get me out of here!

836
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:09,897
Horace, they're
fighting dirty!

837
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,174
Oh, oh, oh!

838
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:21,611
Oh, oh, oh!
Jasper!

839
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:23,675
Horace!

840
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:26,483
[Groaning]

841
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:34,889
C'mon, Perdy.
Let's go.

842
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:42,602
I'll skin every one
of them spotted hyenas...

843
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,368
if it's
the last thing I do.

844
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,445
[Puppies]
Dad! Mother!

845
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,673
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.

846
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,377
Oh, my darlings...
my darlings!

847
00:57:55,451 --> 00:58:00,081
- How'd you find us?
- Lucky, Patch, Pepper!

848
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:02,681
[Laughing]
Oh, Daddy.

849
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:06,855
- And Rolly, you rascal!
- Did you bring me anything to eat?

850
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:09,363
Everybody here?
All 15?

851
00:58:09,432 --> 00:58:12,026
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!

852
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:16,037
What?
Nine... 99?

853
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:18,471
[Pongo] Where did they
all come from?

854
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:21,066
[Perdy] What would she want
with so many?

855
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:23,044
She's gonna make
coats out of us.

856
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:26,741
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.

857
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:30,752
Oh, dog-skin coats!
Come now, Tibs!

858
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,685
But it's true, sir.

859
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:36,418
Horace and Jasper were gonna
pop us off and... skin us!

860
00:58:36,492 --> 00:58:39,950
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?

861
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:42,793
We have to get back
to London somehow.

862
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:46,596
What about the others?
What'll they do?

863
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:49,433
Perdy, we'll take them
home with us... all of them.

864
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,939
Our pets would
never turn them out.

865
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:54,636
Colonel, sir,
lights on the road.

866
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:56,645
It's a truck
headin' this way.

867
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:58,943
[Tibs] It's the baduns,
Horace and Jasper.

868
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:00,949
They're following
our tracks.

869
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:03,611
We've got 'em
outnumbered, Tibs.

870
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:06,280
When I give the signal,
we'll attack.

871
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:09,257
Sir, I'm afraid that
would be disastrous.

872
00:59:09,325 --> 00:59:11,486
Ahem!
Oh, think so?

873
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,256
We'd better
run for it.

874
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:15,627
Out the back,
across the pasture.

875
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:17,893
Thank you sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.

876
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:20,731
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?

877
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:24,330
Ahem! Nothing at all.
All in the line of duty.

878
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:26,637
That's right, sir...
routine.

879
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,677
Better be off.
Here they come.

880
00:59:31,714 --> 00:59:33,682
C'mon, kids, hurry.

881
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,277
- Good luck, Pongos.
- [Colonel] And never fear.

882
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:39,344
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.

883
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:42,391
[Neighing]

884
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,619
Now, what's this?

885
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,686
Out of my way,
you barkin' haystack.

886
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:50,324
Or I'll knock your
blinkin' block off!

887
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,461
[Barking And Growling]

888
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:56,732
They ain't in here.

889
00:59:56,806 --> 00:59:59,639
[Jasper] They're hiding
in the hay.

890
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:02,337
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.

891
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:05,279
Ready, Captain.
Aim,

892
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,373
fire one.

893
01:00:09,752 --> 01:00:11,686
Fire two.

894
01:00:15,057 --> 01:00:18,322
Hey, there they go,
the little sneaks.

895
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:22,023
C'mon, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.

896
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:32,670
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

897
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:36,337
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.

898
01:00:36,412 --> 01:00:39,870
What if they went down
the froze-up creek...

899
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:42,383
so's not to leave
their tracks?

900
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:44,613
Horace, you idiot!

901
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:47,884
- Dogs ain't that smart.
- [Sighs]

902
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:50,118
[Truck Engine]

903
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,097
All clear, Perdy.

904
01:00:59,168 --> 01:01:04,003
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip!
Didn't we, Dad?

905
01:01:04,073 --> 01:01:06,667
They didn't even
see us, Patch!

906
01:01:06,742 --> 01:01:10,644
[Perdy] Shh, children.
Children, shh.

907
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,956
My feet are slippery.

908
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:28,827
I wish we could
walk on the snow.

909
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:31,594
No, son, we can't
leave tracks.

910
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:47,380
[Honking, Tires Screeching]

911
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:54,315
Well, any sign
of them?

912
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,587
Not so much as
one bloomin' footprint.

913
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,187
And we've been up and down
every road in the county.

914
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:04,995
- We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
- Oh, no, you don't!

915
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:09,197
We'll find the little mongrels
if it takes 'til next Christmas.

916
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:12,173
Now get going!
Watch your driving!

917
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:15,768
Do you wanna get
nabbed by the police?

918
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:22,876
[Engine Revving]

919
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:44,767
Ninety-three,

920
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,207
ninety-four,
ninety-five, ninety-six,

921
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:51,678
ninety-seven,

922
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,375
ninety-eight...

923
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:58,045
Oh, Lucky!

924
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,214
C'mon, Lucky boy.
We can't give up now.

925
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:06,694
I'm tired and I'm hungry
and my tail's froze...

926
01:03:06,762 --> 01:03:10,220
and my nose is froze
and my ears are froze.

927
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:13,894
- And my toes are froze.
- [Barking]

928
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,530
Pongo!

929
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:20,667
Pongo! Pongo!

930
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:24,235
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you...

931
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:26,873
at the dairy barn
across the road.

932
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:29,679
Oh, thank goodness.

933
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:33,279
Perdy! Perdy!

934
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:36,325
This way, Perdy.

935
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:38,690
- The dairy barn across the road.
- C'mon, kids.

936
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:48,295
It's not far.
C'mon, this way.

937
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:51,238
[Pongo] Follow the collie.

938
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:14,796
Just look, Queenie.

939
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:18,960
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!

940
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:21,936
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor dears.

941
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:26,304
They're completely worn out
and half frozen!

942
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:31,971
- They all here, Pongo?
- Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.

943
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:36,508
The famous Pongos.
We were so worried about you.

944
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:39,611
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.

945
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,166
How did you make it
all this way?

946
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:46,498
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.

947
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:49,563
I'm hungry, Mother.
I'm hungry.

948
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:54,009
- I'm hungry too.
- Mother, we're hungry.

949
01:04:54,078 --> 01:04:57,013
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.

950
01:04:57,081 --> 01:05:01,279
Do they like warm milk?
It's fresh.

951
01:05:01,352 --> 01:05:04,480
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?

952
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:07,183
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.

953
01:05:07,258 --> 01:05:10,227
This way, children.
Around this way.

954
01:05:10,294 --> 01:05:13,525
[Perdy] Don't crowd.
You'll have to take turns.

955
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:20,533
[Perdy] Rolly, wait your turn, dear.

956
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:26,033
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.

957
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,341
Ooh!
The little darlings.

958
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:33,349
Pongo, a few scraps
I saved...

959
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:36,352
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.

960
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,514
It's not much, but it might
hold you as far as Dinsford.

961
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,649
Huh?
Dinsford?

962
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:43,990
There's a Labrador there.

963
01:05:44,061 --> 01:05:48,691
- His pet is a grocer.
- Oh, l... I'm sorry.

964
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:50,825
Quite all right.

965
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:55,235
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.

966
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,638
I don't know what
we'd have done if...

967
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:03,339
- We're honored to be of service.
- We're sorry we can't do more.

968
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:07,111
[Duchess] Anyone who would think
of hurting these puppies...

969
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:10,847
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.

970
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:14,550
I wish they could stay
with us for always.

971
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,093
[Queenie] Princess, shh.
Quiet, everyone.

972
01:06:17,161 --> 01:06:19,686
Let them sleep,
the poor things.

973
01:06:19,764 --> 01:06:24,861
They're so exhausted and they
still have such a long way to go.

974
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:51,921
[Honking]

975
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:56,023
[Honking]

976
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,934
Hurry, kids. Hurry!

978

[Screeching]

979
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:28,194
Well now,
what have we here?

980
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:34,098
Well... so they thought
they could outwit Cruella.

981
01:07:34,171 --> 01:07:37,800
- Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- [Honking]

982
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,809
Jasper!
Horace!

983
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:45,080
Here's their tracks
heading for the village.

984
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:48,141
Blimey!
It's them, all right.

985
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:51,484
Work your way south on the side roads.
I'll take the main road.

986
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:54,581
[Cruella]
See you in Dinsford!

987
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,960
[Barking]

988
01:08:07,972 --> 01:08:11,499
[Barking]

989
01:08:11,575 --> 01:08:14,806
Pongo, I've got
a ride home for you.

990
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:18,474
A ride home?
Perdy, did you hear that?

991
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:21,814
- For all of us?
- You mean we don't have to
walk anymore?

992
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:25,344
If we can manage it.
We'd better hurry.

993
01:08:25,422 --> 01:08:28,858
We've got a ride home!
C'mon, children.

994
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:38,428
See the van
down the street?

995
01:08:38,502 --> 01:08:42,165
[Labrador] It's going to London
as soon as the engine's repaired.

996
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:44,901
And there's room
for all of you.

997
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:48,433
[Perdy]
Pongo, there's Cruella.

998
01:08:57,755 --> 01:08:59,746
Yes...

999
01:08:59,824 --> 01:09:02,657
and Jasper and Horace.

1000
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:07,095
- How will we get to the van?
- I don't know, Perdy.

1001
01:09:07,164 --> 01:09:11,100
- But somehow we've got to.
- Mother, Dad,

1002
01:09:11,168 --> 01:09:14,535
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.

1003
01:09:14,605 --> 01:09:17,130
- Did not. Did not.
- Did too. Did too.

1004
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,073
Did not!

1005
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:23,078
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...

1006
01:09:23,147 --> 01:09:26,583
Perdy, I've got an idea.

1007
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:30,821
Pongo,

1008
01:09:30,888 --> 01:09:33,448
- what on earth...
- Look, I'm a Labrador!

1009
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:35,958
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.

1010
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:38,290
Say, that is an idea!

1011
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:41,297
C'mon, kids!
Roll in the soot.

1012
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:43,959
You mean, you want
us to get dirty?

1013
01:09:44,034 --> 01:09:47,265
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.

1014
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:51,240
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.

1015
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:55,608
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.

1016
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,306
[Giggling]

1017
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:01,647
[Pongo] That's the stuff.
The blacker the better.

1018
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:04,483
- I'm ready.
- Me too.

1019
01:10:04,555 --> 01:10:08,252
- How's this, Dad?
- Wait. That's enough.
Not too many at a time.

1020
01:10:08,325 --> 01:10:11,385
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.

1021
01:10:12,429 --> 01:10:15,956
Now, stay right with me.

1022
01:10:18,369 --> 01:10:21,338
We're gonna fool
the ol' mad lady.

1023
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,310
Pongo...

1024
01:10:32,383 --> 01:10:35,352
I'm so afraid.

1025
01:10:35,419 --> 01:10:40,789
Jasper, do you suppose
they disguised themselves?

1026
01:10:40,858 --> 01:10:45,420
Say now, Horace.
That's just what they did.

1027
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:49,193
Dogs is always paintin'
themselves black!

1028
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,461
You idiot!

1029
01:10:56,173 --> 01:10:58,801
Well, so far
so good.

1030
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:01,310
C'mon, Perdy.
Better get on your makeup.

1031
01:11:01,378 --> 01:11:04,006
I'll go ahead
with the next bunch.

1032
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:17,657
[Cruella]
Jasper! Horace!

1033
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:21,164
- Well?
- Be reasonable, miss.

1034
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:23,825
[Horace] We're froze to our bones.

1035
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:27,894
We've been out all night
and all day, with nothin' to eat.

1036
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:32,170
They're somewhere in this village,
and we're going to find them.

1037
01:11:32,242 --> 01:11:34,403
Now get going!

1038
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:40,746
- Do you think they've seen us?
- [Engine]

1039
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:43,446
No, but we're
running out of time.

1040
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,681
Try 'er again, mate.

1041
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:49,419
Hurry, Perdy.
The van's about to leave.

1042
01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:56,796
Better hurry.

1043
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:19,207
I'll get the rest.

1044
01:12:19,283 --> 01:12:22,252
That ought to do.
She'll get you back to London.

1045
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,153
Better get aboard, miss.

1046
01:12:29,327 --> 01:12:32,228
Hey, Jasper.

1047
01:12:35,032 --> 01:12:38,263
[Whimpering]

1048
01:12:38,336 --> 01:12:41,601
C'mon, Horace.

1049
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:49,712
Hurry, kids!

1050
01:12:56,721 --> 01:12:59,155
C'mon, kids.
Run on ahead.

1051
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:05,219
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.

1052
01:13:14,171 --> 01:13:17,299
It can't be!

1053
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,401
It's impossible!

1054
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:24,972
[Labrador] Run for it!

1055
01:13:25,049 --> 01:13:27,415
- Jasper! Horace!
- [Honking]

1056
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,921
Jasper!

1057
01:13:32,256 --> 01:13:35,623
[Cruella] There they go...
in the van.

1058
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:39,060
After them! After them!

1059
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:41,928
[Barking And Growling]

1060
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:05,182
Pongo!
There she is... Cruella.

1061
01:14:12,196 --> 01:14:14,221
Hey, lady,

1062
01:14:14,298 --> 01:14:16,858
what in thunder
are you tryin' to do?

1063
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:18,868
Crazy woman driver!

1064
01:14:38,155 --> 01:14:41,124
[Engine Revving]

1065
01:14:54,805 --> 01:14:59,071
- Pongo, look!
- Jasper!

1066
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:01,111
Ain't nothin' to it.

1067
01:15:01,178 --> 01:15:05,114
I'll give him a nudge
and shove him in the dirt.

1068
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:20,296
Perdy, watch out!

1069
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:31,337
- Jasper!
- Horace!

1070
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:45,712
You idiots!

1071
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:49,783
You fools!

1072
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,227
[Sobbing]
You imbeciles!

1073
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:56,892
- Ah, shut up!
- [Sobbing]

1074
01:15:56,967 --> 01:15:59,401
[Radio]
You've seen her kind of eyes

1075
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:02,962
Watchin' you from underneath a rock

1076
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:06,373
Cruella de Vil

1077
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:08,138
Cruella de...

1078
01:16:08,212 --> 01:16:12,581
Roger, after all,
that's your first big hit.

1079
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:15,210
It's made more money
than we ever dreamed of.

1080
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:17,015
Yes, I know.

1081
01:16:18,455 --> 01:16:20,423
I still can't believe...

1082
01:16:20,491 --> 01:16:23,255
that Pongo and Perdy
would run away.

1083
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:27,923
Here's a bit of
Christmas cheer for you,

1084
01:16:27,998 --> 01:16:31,490
If there's anything
to be cheerful about.

1085
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:35,096
Oh, those dear
little things.

1086
01:16:35,172 --> 01:16:40,007
Sometimes at night
I can hear them barking,

1087
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:44,275
- [Barking]
- But it always turns out I'm dreaming.

1088
01:16:44,348 --> 01:16:47,681
[Barking]

1089
01:16:54,258 --> 01:16:56,226
[Anita] Roger, what on earth...

1090
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:58,488
[Roger] They're labradors.

1091
01:16:58,562 --> 01:17:00,587
No, no.
They're covered with soot.

1092
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:02,598
Look, here's Lucky!

1093
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,362
Pongo, boy,
is that you?

1094
01:17:05,436 --> 01:17:08,894
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!

1095
01:17:08,973 --> 01:17:11,771
And Perdy,
my darling.

1096
01:17:11,842 --> 01:17:14,436
And Patch, and Rolly,

1097
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:17,378
and Penny, and Freckles.

1098
01:17:17,448 --> 01:17:19,848
They're all here,
the little dears.

1099
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:22,818
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!

1100
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:25,856
And look...
there's a whole lot more!

1101
01:17:25,923 --> 01:17:31,190
- Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
- There must be 100!

1102
01:17:31,262 --> 01:17:35,255
One, two, three and
four... is seven.

1103
01:17:35,332 --> 01:17:38,631
Two, four, six, and three
is nine, plus two is eleven.

1104
01:17:38,702 --> 01:17:42,069
- 36 over here.
- 36 and 11, that's 47!

1105
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:45,006
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!

1106
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:48,135
Ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen!

1107
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:53,013
- Wait... six more.
- Let's see, that's 84.

1108
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,951
And fifteen plus two...
a hundred and one!

1109
01:17:57,021 --> 01:18:01,583
A hundred and one?
Where did they come from?

1110
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:05,561
Oh, Pongo,
you old rascal!

1111
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:07,995
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.

1112
01:18:08,065 --> 01:18:12,229
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.

1113
01:18:12,303 --> 01:18:17,036
We'll have a plantation...
a dalmatian plantation.

1114
01:18:17,107 --> 01:18:19,905
Roger, that's truly
an inspiration.

1115
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:21,877
It'll be a sensation!

1116
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:25,211
We'll have
a dalmatian plantation.

1117
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,409
A dalmatian plantation,
I say.

1118
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:31,446
We'll have a dalmatian plantation

1119
01:18:31,522 --> 01:18:35,117
- Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry.

1120
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:38,958
Our whole aggregation
will love our plantation home

1121
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:42,465
Woo-woo-woo-woo

1122
01:18:42,533 --> 01:18:45,400
Oo-oo-oo

1123
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:49,428
[Yipping]

1124
01:18:49,506 --> 01:18:55,348
Dalmatian plantation home

1125
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,188
[Barking And Yipping]
