Who, me? No way.

00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:24,772
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

52
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,110
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

53
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,948
Yeah, I got this cough.

54
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,534
All right. I'm going inside.

55
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,786
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

56
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,954
OK.

57
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,248
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...

58
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,293
What? Sharks? Ariel!

59
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:46,590
Ariel, I can't... I mean...

60
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,261
Ariel, help!

61
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,181
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

62
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:55,142
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

63
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,186
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

64
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,356
I'm not a guppy.

65
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,318
This is great.

66
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,321
I mean, I really love this.

67
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:11,201
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner...

68
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:14,706
Ariel!

69
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,461
Oh, are you OK?

70
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,672
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.

71
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:22,715
Shh!

72
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:31,224
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

73
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:34,895
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

74
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,693
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?

75
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,862
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

76
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,906
What was that?

77
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,741
Did you hear something?

78
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,203
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

79
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,373
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

80
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,709
Nothing is going to happen.

81
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,836
Shark!

82
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,674
Shark! We're gonna die!

83
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,235
Oh, no!

84
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,274
You big bully!

85
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,612
Flounder, you really are a guppy.

86
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:55,280
I am not.

and ninety-two ♪

88

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,342
Mermaid off the port bow!

92
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:16,346
Ariel, how you doin', kid?

93
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,142
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

94
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,145
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

95
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,524
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.

96
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,785
Oh! Oh! Look at this.

97
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:38,288
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

98
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:42,376
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

99
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,754
Humans use these little babies...

100
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,798
to straighten their hair out.

101
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,637
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...

102
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:56,643
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

103
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,812
that humans go nuts over.

104
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,897
A dinglehopper.

105
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,691
- What about that one?
- Ah!

106
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:08,573
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

107
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:13,911
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!

108
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:19,210
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

109
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:22,548
and stare at each other all day.

110
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,592
Got very boring.

111
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:29,180
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

112
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,557
Allow me.

113
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,100
Music!

114
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,479
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

115
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,939
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!

116
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,401
The concert was today?

117
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,695
You could make
a little planter out of it.

118
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,115
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

119
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,742
Any time, sweetie!

120
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,952
Any time.

121
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:06,808
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

122
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:12,313
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

123
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:16,984
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

124
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:22,074
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

125
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:26,372
when I lived in the palace.

126
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:30,167
And now look at me.

127
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:33,045
Wasted away to practically nothing.

128
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,175
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

129
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,305
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

130
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:47,394
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

131
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,648
Flotsam! Jetsam!

132
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:54,988
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

133
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,118
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

134
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:08,002
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

135
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,670
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

136
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,841
As a result of your careless behavior...

137
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,760
Careless and reckless behavior!

138
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,054
...the entire celebration was, uh...

139
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:19,807
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

140
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,018
This concert was to be

141
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,689
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

142
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:29,526
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

143
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,195
But it wasn't her fault...

144
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,950
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

145
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,538
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

146
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,792
And... And we... Whoa!

147
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,794
And then we were safe.

148
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,630
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

149
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:48,382
Seagull?

150
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:51,176
What? Oh!

151
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,345
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

152
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,890
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

153
00:12:55,932 --> 00:13:00,188
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

154
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:04,901
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

155
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:07,529
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

156
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,575
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

157
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,161
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

158
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,914
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

159
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,461
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

160
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,423
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

161
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:27,886
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

162
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,930
Is that clear?

163
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:37,730
Hmph! Teenagers.

164
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:40,108
They think they know everything.

165
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,822
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

166
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:47,909
Do you think I was too hard on her?

167
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,120
Definitely not.

168
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,251
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

169
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,921
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

170
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,841
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

171
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,677
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

172
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,432
Ariel needs constant supervision.

173
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:10,268
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

174
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:11,437
All the time.

175
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,148

00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:11,379
Ariel, are you OK?

If only I could
make him understand.

183
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:17,179
I just don't see things the way he does.

184
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:21,434

237
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,800
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

238
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,344
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:57,373
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:59,267
Come with me, I'll take you home

241
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,769
and get you something warm to drink.

242
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:04,732
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

243
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,696
Ariel?

244
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:22,002
Ariel, what are you...

245
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,671
Jumpin' jellyfish!

246
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,513
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!

247
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:12,226
Max! Here, boy!

248
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:21,613
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

249
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,616
Come on, Max.

250
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:28,036
Good boy. Good boy.

251
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,129
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

252
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,633
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

253
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,052
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

254
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,889
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

255
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:48,935
I've never seen a human
this close before.

256
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:54,150
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

257
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,653
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

258
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,531
Not that one.

259
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:03,745
The one playing the snarfblatt.

260
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,498
Silence, silence.

261
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:09,501
It is now my honor and privilege

262
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,879
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

263
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,673
with a very special, very expensive,

264
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,593
very large birthday present.

265
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,222
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

266
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:23,183
I know.

267
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:26,062
Happy birthday, Eric.

268
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,820
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!

269
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:37,366
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.

270
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,452
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

271
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:43,498
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

272
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:46,000
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

273
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:50,298
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?

274
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,677
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.

275
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:59,391
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled with the right girl.

276
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,353
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...

277
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,397
I just haven't found her yet.

278
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,735
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

279
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,490
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

280
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:16,245
Without a doubt, it'll just...
bam... hit me, like lightning.

281
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,753
Hurricane a-comin'!

282
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:29,050

on the move here! Yo!

Is he... dead?

292
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,900
It's hard to say.

Ariel dear, time to come out.

327
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,178
You've been in there all morning.

328
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,477
What is with her lately?

329
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,818
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!

330
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:18,246
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

331
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,167
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

332
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:26,421
Ariel? In love?

333
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,132
OK. So far, so good.

334
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,344
I don't think the king knows.

something like this a secret for long.

336
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:40,686
He loves me.

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,816
Mmm. He loves me not.

338
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:48,363

00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:50,365
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:52,910

Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

343
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,630
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

344
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,384
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!

Ariel, listen to me.

346

Sebastian!

Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

406
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:38,253
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

407
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:40,505
The sea king?

408
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:44,092
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

409
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,803
Oh, he knows!

410
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:49,806
Hey, let's see now.

411
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:54,062
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

412
00:32:56,316 --> 00:33:01,112
Come in, Sebastian.

413
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,166
I mustn't overreact.

414
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,828
I must remain calm.

415
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:15,545
Yes?

416
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,633
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

417
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:21,887
I'm concerned about Ariel.

418
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:25,307
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

419
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,354
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

420
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:34,149
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

421
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,318
You haven't noticed, hmm?

422
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,197
Oh, well, I...

423
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:42,703
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

424
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:47,666
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

425
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:50,961
Keeping something?

426
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,964
About Ariel?

427
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:59,554
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

428
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:05,145
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

429
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:08,357
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

430
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,154
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

431
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,782
Humans?

432
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:21,537
Who said anything about humans?

433
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,811
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

434
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,043
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

435
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:29,757
You'll see. It's a surprise.

436
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,884
Oh, Flounder.

437
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,971
Flounder, you're the best!

438
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:40,602
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

439
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:45,732
Why, Eric, run away with you?

440
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:49,528
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

441
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,869
Daddy?

442
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,252
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

443
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:07,298
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

444
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:08,884
But, Dad, I...

445
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:12,221
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

446
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,266
I had to...

447
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,936
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

448
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,814
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

449
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:23,401
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

450
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:25,737
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

451
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:28,907
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

452
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:31,410
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

453
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,911
incapable of any feeling...

454
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:35,916
Daddy, I love him!

455
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,255
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

456
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,257
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

457
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't care.

458
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:48,013
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

459
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,975
And if this is the only way, so be it!

460
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,523
Daddy! No!

461
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:00,194
No! Please!

462
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:03,990
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

463
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,912
Daddy, no!

464
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,399
Ariel, I...

465
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,777
Just go away.

466
00:36:55,131 --> 00:37:00,721
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

467
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:05,726
She has a very serious problem.

468
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:09,107
If only there were
something we could do.

469
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,111
But there is something.

470
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:16,865
Who... Who are you?

471
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,159
Don't be scared.

472
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:22,454
We represent someone who can help you.

473
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:27,627
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

474
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,754
Just imagine...

475
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:31,800
You and your prince...

476
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:35,429
Together forever.

477
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,431
I don't understand.

478
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:43,313
Ursula has great powers.

479
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:47,358
The sea witch?

480
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:50,695
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

481
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,825
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

482
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,119
Suit yourself.

483
00:37:57,162 --> 00:38:00,458
It was only a suggestion.

484
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:11,093
Wait.

485
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:14,598
Yes?

486
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:18,979
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

487
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,878
It was an accident.

488
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,652
Ariel? Where are you going?

489
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:27,321
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

490
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,324
I'm going to see Ursula.

491
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:33,828
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

492
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,207
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

493
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,089
But... But, I... Come on!

494
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,233
This way.

495
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:21,383
Come in. Come in, my child.

496
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:26,724
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

497
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,729
One might question
your upbringing.

498
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,317
Now, then, you're here

499
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,363
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

500
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:46,037
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

501
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,623
Well, angelfish,

502
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:53,588
the solution to your problem is simple.

503
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,673
The only way to get what you want

504
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,759
is to become a human yourself.

505
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,930
Can you do that?

506
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:07,478
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

507
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,563
It's what I live for.

508

Now, here's the deal.

536
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,965
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

537
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:46,593
Got that? Three days.

538
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,430
Now, listen, this is important.

539
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,891
Before the sun sets on the third day,

540
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:56,395
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

541
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:59,357
That is, he's got to kiss you.

542
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,905
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

543
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:08,702
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

544
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:12,748
you'll remain human permanently.

545
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:16,335
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...

546
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,507
and... you belong to me!

547
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,385
No, Ariel!

548
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,804
Have we got a deal?

549
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:28,139
If I become human,

550
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,978
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

551
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,355
That's right!

552
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:36,693
But you'll have your man.

553
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:42,156
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

554
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:48,329
Oh! And there is one more thing.

555
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:50,958
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

556
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:53,087
You can't get something for nothing.

557
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,589
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

558
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,844
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

559
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:04,348
What I want from you is... your voice.

560
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:08,562
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

561
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:12,274
No more talking, singing. Zip!

562
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,318
But without my voice, how can I...

563
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:18,282
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

564
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:23,413
And don't underestimate the
importance of body language!

565
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:24,456

594
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,591
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

595
00:45:57,675 --> 00:46:01,637
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

596
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:25,498
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

597
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,209
Look at ya. Look at ya.

598
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:31,546
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

599
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:34,382
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

600
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,509
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?

601
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:40,556
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.

602
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,602
New seashells?

603
00:46:43,644 --> 00:46:46,105
No new seashells.

604
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:48,733
I gotta admit I can't
put my foot on it right now.

605
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:50,401
If I stand here long enough...

606
00:46:50,443 --> 00:46:51,902
She's got legs, you idiot!

607
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:56,366
She traded her voice to the sea
witch and got legs. Geez, man!

608
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,909
I knew that.

609
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:59,953
Ariel's been turned into a human.

610
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:04,291
She's gotta make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.

611
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:08,088
And she's only got three days!

612
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:11,134
Just look at her!

613
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:14,137
On legs! On human legs!

614
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:18,642
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

615
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:21,686
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.

616
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:24,981
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!

617
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:27,985
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now

618
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:30,615
and tell him just like I should
have done the minute...

619
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:34,160
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.

620
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,287
Maybe there's still time.

621
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,082
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,

622
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:42,628
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...

623
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:46,256
Just be...

624
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,553
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

625
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,645
All right, all right.

626
00:47:56,728 --> 00:48:00,774
I'll try to help ya find that prince.

627
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:07,864
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

628
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:09,992
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

629
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,038
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.

630
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,092
Max? What?

631
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:26,971
Huh? What? Max!

632
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:31,517
Ya look great, kid.

633
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,563
Ya look sensational.

634
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:48,996
Max!

635
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,581
Max!

636
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:53,167
Quiet, Max.

637
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,836
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

638
00:48:55,919 --> 00:48:59,549
Oh, I see.

639
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:02,721
Are you OK, miss?

640
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:05,098
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

641
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:07,392
He's harmless really, uh...

642
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:14,192
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

643
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,696
We have met. I knew it.

644
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,074
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

645
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:23,451
What's your name?

646
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:27,040
What's wrong? What is it?

647
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:33,422
You can't speak? Oh!

648
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:36,092
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

649
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:43,975
What is it? You're hurt?

650
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,728
No, no. You need help?

651
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:49,441
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

652
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:53,654
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

653
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:55,864
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

654
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,866
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.

655
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,503
Washed up from a shipwreck.

656
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:11,717
Oh, the poor thing.

657
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,054
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

658
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,936
I'll just... I'll just
get this washed for you.

659
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,484
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

660
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,487
- No!
- Gertrude says...

661
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,698
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

662
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:36,037
- Really.
- Madam, please...

663
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,540
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

664
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:41,667
If Eric's looking for a girl,

665
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:45,213
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.

666
00:50:57,478 --> 00:50:58,687
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

667
00:50:58,739 --> 00:50:59,897
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

668
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,526
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people

669
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,821
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...

670
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:09,115
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

671
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,535
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

672
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:16,874
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

673
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:26,344
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

674
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:29,430
Uh, you look wonderful.

675
00:51:29,472 --> 00:51:34,937
Come, come, come. You must be
famished. Let me help you, my dear.

676
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:37,398
There we go. That's better.

677
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:41,235
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.

678
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:46,451
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

679
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:02,343
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.

680
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,974
Oh, my.

681
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:07,892
Sorry, Grim.

682
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:12,605
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

683
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:15,275
Ah, very amusing.

684
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:17,570

Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh!

720
00:54:33,642 --> 00:54:38,148
I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.

721
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:44,237
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

722
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:46,909
- Louis!
- Ow.

723
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,998
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...

724
00:54:52,082 --> 00:54:56,294
I'm sorry, madame.

725
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:59,339
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

726
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,966
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

727
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,968
Something in the way of a tour.

728
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:07,098
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

729
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:10,269
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

730
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:12,522
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

731
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,524
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

732
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:17,819
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

733
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:19,278
Well, what do ya say?

734
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:22,449
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

735
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:27,663
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

736
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,718
Come here, boy.

737
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:58,074
This has got to be, without a doubt,

738
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:02,662
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

739
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:08,210
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

740
00:56:08,294 --> 00:56:12,339
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

741
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:17,511
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

742
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:22,101
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

743
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:27,441
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

744
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:32,863
Hmm.

745
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:42,751
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

746
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:46,463
Completely hopeless.

747
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:56,391
Any sign of them?

748
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:59,560
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

749
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:02,939
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

750
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:07,278
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

751
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,492
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

752
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,577
Yes, sire.

753
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:20,126
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

754
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:45,208
Has he kissed her yet?

755
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,711
- Not yet.
- Oh!

756
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,722
Oh, Judy!

757
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,910
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

758
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,454
No, not yet.

759
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,956
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

760
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:50,033
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

761
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:51,785
I can't see a thing.

762
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:55,038
Nothing is happening.

763
00:58:55,121 --> 00:59:00,380
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

764
00:59:00,463 --> 00:59:06,970
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

765
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:10,056
Stand back!

766
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:15,396
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

767
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:20,067
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

768
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,236
Wa, wa, wa-wa!

769
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,324
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

770
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:29,871
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.

771
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:31,915
Wa, wa, wa, wa!

772
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:35,752
You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.

00:59:35,836 --> 00:59:40,924

far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood,

Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...

863
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:17,034
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror,

864
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:20,787
and she was singin'
with a stolen set of pipes.

865
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,625
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?

866
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:29,049
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

867
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,385
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

868
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,429
I mean, when it's important?

869
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:37,015
What are we gonna do?

870
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:40,811
Before the sun
sets on the third day.

871
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:43,272
Day...

872
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,114
Ariel, grab onto that.

873
01:07:50,156 --> 01:07:53,994
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

874
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,038
I'll try!

875
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,707
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

876
01:07:58,791 --> 01:08:00,834
- What about me? What about me?
- You!

877
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:04,296
Find a way to stall that wedding!

878
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:06,298
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?

879
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,094
What? That's it!

880
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:20,065
Let's go!

881
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:22,776
We got an emergency here.

882
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:36,751
Dearly beloved...

883
01:08:36,835 --> 01:08:42,174
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

884
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:44,176
We're almost there.

885
01:08:44,218 --> 01:08:48,139
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

886
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,434
to be your lawfully wedded wife

887
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:54,103
for as long as you both shall live?

888
01:08:54,186 --> 01:08:56,356
I do.

889
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,444
It being... And do you...

890
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:08,787
Oh!

891
01:09:10,874 --> 01:09:13,501
Oh! Oh! Oh!

892
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:18,506
Then by the power...

893
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:20,675
Get away, you slimy...

894
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,346
Oh!

895
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:28,394
Oh!

896
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:33,733
Oh!

897
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:36,277
Oh, why, you little...

898
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,502
Huh?

899
01:09:57,135 --> 01:09:59,179
Ariel?

900
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,474
Eric.

901
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:04,643
You... You can talk?

902
01:10:04,726 --> 01:10:08,691
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

903
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:12,529
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

904
01:10:12,612 --> 01:10:16,741
Eric, no!

905
01:10:16,783 --> 01:10:19,744
You're too late!

906
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,414
You're too late!

907
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:32,427
So long, lover boy.

908
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,221
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

909
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:38,224
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

910
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:41,602
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

911
01:10:41,644 --> 01:10:46,984
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

912
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:50,612
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

913
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:53,868
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

914
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,372
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

915
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,127
You see?

916
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:05,505
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

917
01:11:05,589 --> 01:11:07,591
even for you.

918
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:13,139
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

919
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:18,563
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

920
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:22,817
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

921
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:26,863
for someone even better.

922
01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:28,658
Eric, what are you doing?

923
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:32,453
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

924
01:11:32,536 --> 01:11:37,124
Now, do we have a deal?

925
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,757
Ha! It's done then!

926
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:47,846
No! Oh, no!

927
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:58,524
Your Majesty.

928
01:11:58,565 --> 01:11:59,859
Daddy.

929
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:04,408
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

930
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:10,872
You!

931
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,165
You monster!

932
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,419
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

933
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,422
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

934
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:20,049
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

935
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,093
After him!

936
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:31,605
Come on!

937
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,400
Ow!

938
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:39,196
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

939
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:48,667
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

940
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:01,431
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

941
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:03,767
No, I won't leave you.

942
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:26,209
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

943
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,252
Look out!

944
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:32,966
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

945
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,639
The waves obey my every whim!

946
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:40,810
Eric!

947
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:46,608
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

948
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,924
Eric!

949
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,453
Oh! Oh!

950
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,009
So much for true love!

951
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:46,537
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

952
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:52,502
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

953
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:57,551
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

954
01:15:57,634 --> 01:15:59,553
You always say that?

955
01:16:02,472 --> 01:16:06,769
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

956
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,980
And what's that, Your Majesty?

957
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,650
How much I'm going to miss her.

958
01:17:11,552 --> 01:17:13,930
Ah-ha!

959
01:17:21,605 --> 01:17:25,694
Yes!

960
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:27,655
Thank you. Thank you.

961
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:39,251
