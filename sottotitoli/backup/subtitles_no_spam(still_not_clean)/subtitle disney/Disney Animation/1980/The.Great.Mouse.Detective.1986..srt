1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,963
You know, Daddy,
this is my very best birthday.

2
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,799
But I haven't given you
your present yet.

3
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,969
- What is it? What is it?
- Now, close your eyes.

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,971
Oh, oh, oh... Oh, now...

5
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,141
No peeking now.

6
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,280
Oh, Daddy!

7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,783
You made this just for me?

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,676
You're the most wonderful father
in the whole world!

9
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,687
- Who is that?
- I... I don't know!

10
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,192
Quickly, dear,
stay in here and don't come out.

11
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,876
- I got you, toy maker!
- Oh, no! Olivia!

12
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,262
Daddy, where are you?

13
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,765
Daddy,

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,810
where are you?

15
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:33,402
Daddy!

16
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,990
It was the eve
of our good queen's Diamond Jubilee,

17
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:25,746
and the year Her Majesty's government
came to the very brink of disaster.

18
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,789
She...

19
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,711
I... I... I'm getting ahead of myself.

20
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,256
My name is Dr. David Q. Dawson,

21
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,967
most recently of
the queen's 66th Regiment.

22
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,229
I had just arrived in London
after lengthy service in Afghanistan,

23
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,650
and was anxious to find a quiet place,

24
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,362
preferably dry, hmm...

25
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:03,325
where I could rest
and find a bit of peace.

26
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,577
Little did I know

27
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,998
that my life was
about to change forever.

28
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,724
Oh! Oh, my!

29
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,898
Are you all right, my dear?

30
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,403
Come now, come, come, come.
Here, here, dry your eyes.

31
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,119
Ah, yes. Ah, that's better.

32
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,999
Now, tell me,
what's troubling you, my dear?

33
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,043
I... I'm lost.

34
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,298
I... I... I'm trying to find
Basil of Baker Street.

35
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,843
Well, let me see here.

36
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,389
"Famous detective
solves baffling disappearance."

37
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,101
Mmm-hmm. Uh, but, uh...

38
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,270
Where are your mother and father?

39
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,065
That's why I must find Basil.

40
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,985
There, there, there, there.
Now, now, now, now.

41
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,321
Well, now, I don't know any Basil.

42
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,580
But I do remember
where Baker Street is.

43
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,332
Now, come with me.

44
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,210
We'll find this Basil chap together.

45
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,290
Good evening, madam. Is this
the residence of Basil of Baker Street?

46
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,292
I'm afraid it is.

47
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,630
He's not here at the moment,
but you're welcome to come in and wait.

48
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,049
Oh, I... I don't want to impose.

49
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,009
It's... it's just, the girl...

50
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,974
Oh, my!

51
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,354
You poor dear!
You must be chilled to the bone!

52
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,400
Oh.
But I know just the thing.

53
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,695
Let me fetch you a pot of tea
and some of my fresh cheese crumpets.

54
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,719
A-ha! The villain's slipped this time!
I shall have him!

55
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,224
Out of my way! Out of my way!

56
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,684
I say... Oh!

57
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,021
- Who are you?
- What? Oh.

58
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,443
Basil of Baker Street, my good fellow.

59
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,660
- Mr. Basil, I need your help. And...
- All in good time.

60
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,038
But you don't understand.
I'm in terrible trouble.

61
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,206
If you'll excuse me.

62
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,005
Now... Now see here!

63
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,467
This young lady is
in need of assistance.

64
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,677
- I think you ought to listen...
- Hold this, please, doctor.

65
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,887
Of course.

66
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,809
Wait just a moment.
How did you know I was a doctor?

67
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,352
A surgeon, to be exact.

68
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,356
Just returned from military duty
in Afghanistan, am I right?

69
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,736
Why...
Oh, yes. Major David Q. Dawson.

70
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,115
- Uh... But how could you possibly...
- Quite simple, really.

71
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,951
You've sewn your torn cuff together
with a Lembert stitch,

72
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,412
which, of course, only a surgeon uses.

73
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,789
And the thread is
a unique form of catgut

74
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,709
easily distinguished
by its peculiar pungency,

75
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,045
found only in the Afghan provinces.

76
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,925
- Amazing!
- Actually,

77
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,010
it's elementary, my dear Dawson.

78
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,853
What in heaven's name?

79
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,065
Oh! Oh... My...

80
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,734
My good pillows.

81
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,569
Mr. Basil!

82
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,865
- How many times have I told you...
- Mrs. Judson, it's quite all right.

83
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,408
Uh... Mmm.

84
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,120
I believe I smell some of those
delightful cheese crumpets of yours.

85
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,916
- Why don't you fetch our guests some?
- But...

86
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,042
Now,

87
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,295
I know that bullet's here somewhere.

88
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,260
- Thank you, Miss...
- Flaversham. Olivia Flaversham.

89
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,471
- Whatever.
- Yes, but you don't understand.

90
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,649
Yes.

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,776
Yes!

92
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,489
No!

93
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,949
Drat!

94
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,956
Another dead end.

95
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,337
He was within my grasp.

96
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,606
Now, will you please listen to me?

97
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,443
My daddy's gone, and I'm all alone.

98
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,448
Young lady, this is
a most inopportune time.

99
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,830
Surely your mother knows where he is.

100
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,875
I... I don't have a mother.

101
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,128
Well... Um...

102
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,506
Then perhaps...

103
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:38,178
See here, I simply have
no time for lost fathers.

104
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,972
I didn't lose him. He was taken by a bat.

105
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,268
- Did you say bat?
- Yes.

106
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,481
- Did he have a crippled wing?
- I don't know, but he had a peg leg!

107
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,984
I say, do you know him?

108
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,072
Know him? That bat,
one Fidget, by name,

109
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,617
is in the employ of the very fiend
who was the target of my experiment!

110
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:06,039
The horror of my every waking moment.
The nefarious Professor Ratigan!

111
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,421
- Uh... Ratigan?
- He's a genius, Dawson.

112
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,132
A genius twisted for evil.

113
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,885
The Napoleon of crime.

114
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,013
- As bad as all that, eh?
- Worse!

115
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,393
For years, I've tried to capture him,
and I've come close, so very close.

116
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,437
But each time,
he's narrowly evaded my grasp.

117
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,984
Not a corner of London's safe
while Ratigan's at large.

118
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,115
There's no evil scheme
he wouldn't concoct!

119
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,827
No depravity he wouldn't commit.

120
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,454
Who knows what dastardly scheme

121
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:51,793
that villain may be plotting,
even as we speak?

122
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,321
Quite an ingenious scheme,
eh, Flaversham?

123
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,908
And aren't you proud to be a part of it?

124
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,871
This whole thing is...
It... it's monstrous.

125
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:33,668
We will have our little device
ready by tomorrow evening, won't we?

126
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,338
You know what will happen if you fail.

127
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,636
I... I... I don't care!

128
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,157
You can do what you want with me.
I won't be a part of this... this...

129
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,034
...this evil any longer.

130
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,291
Very well, if that is your decision.

131
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,211
Oh, uh, by the way,

132
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:20,632
I'm taking the liberty
of having your daughter brought here.

133
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,092
- Olivia?
- Yes. Yes.

134
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,929
Yes. Yes.

135
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,431
I would spend many a sleepless night

136
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:33,019
if anything unfortunate
were to befall her.

137
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,856
You... you wouldn't.

138
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,409
Finish it, Flaversham!

139
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,338
Oh, I love it when I'm nasty.

140
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,799
Fidget.

141
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,095
Fidget!

142
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,766
Bright and alert as always.

143
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,770
Here's the list.
You know what to do, and no mistakes!

144
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,482
No mistakes, sir.

145
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,026
"Tools, gears, girl, uniforms..."

146
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,030
- Now, Fidget!
- I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

147
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:52,307
My friends, we are
about to embark on the most odious,

148
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:58,438
the most evil, the most diabolical
scheme of my illustrious career.

149
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,318
A crime to top all crimes.
A crime that will live in infamy!

150
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,324
Tomorrow evening,
our beloved monarch

151
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,160
celebrates her Diamond Jubilee.

152
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:19,167
And with the enthusiastic help
of our good friend, Mr. Flaversham,

153
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,381
it promises to be a night
she will never forget.

154
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,345
Her last night, and my first

155
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:35,183
as supreme ruler of all mousedom!

156
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,241
From the brain that
brought you the Big Ben Caper

157
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,286
The head that made headlines
in every newspaper

158
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,790
And wondrous things like
the Tower Bridge Job

159
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,335
That cunning display
that made Londoners sob

160
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,712
Now comes the real tour de force

161
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,174
Tricky and wicked, of course

162
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,678
My earlier crimes
were fine for their times

163
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,013
But now that I'm at it again

164
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,476
An even grimmer plot
has been simmering

165
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,104
In my great criminal brain

166
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,022
Even meaner?

167
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,857
You mean it?

168
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,027
Worse than the widows
and orphans you drowned

169
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,280
You're the best of the worst around

170
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,826
Oh, Ratigan

171
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,370
The rest fall behind

172
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,124
To Ratigan

173
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,793
The world's greatest criminal mind

174
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,464
Thank you, thank you.

175
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,552
But it hasn't all been
champagne and caviar.

176
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,887
I've had my share of adversity,

177
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,391
thanks to that miserable
second-rate detective,

178
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,601
Basil of Baker Street.

179
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:08,443
For years, that insufferable pipsqueak
has interfered with my plans.

180
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,863
I haven't had
a moment's peace of mind.

181
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,115
Aww...

182
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,121
But all that's in the past!

183
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:25,460
This time nothing, not even Basil,
can stand in my way!

184
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,546
All will bow before me!

185
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,758
Oh, Ratigan

186
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,802
You're tops and that's that

187
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,139
To Ratigan

188
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,767
To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat

189
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,731
What was that?

190
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,650
What did you call me?

191
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,863
- He didn't mean it, professor.
- It was just a slip of the tongue.

192
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,656
I am not a rat!

193
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,826
- 'Course you're not. You're a mouse!
- That's right. A mouse.

194
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,621
- Yeah, a big mouse.
- Silence!

195
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,669
Oh, my dear Bartholomew,

196
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,173
I'm afraid that
you've gone and upset me.

197
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,220
You know what happens
when someone upsets me.

198
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,987
Oh, Ratigan

199
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,864
Oh, Ratigan

200
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,743
You're the tops and that's that

201
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,869
Oh, dear.

202
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,873
To Ratigan

203
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,043
To Ratigan

204
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,422
The world's greatest...

205
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,477
Oh, Felicia, my precious, my baby.

206
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,064
Did Daddy's little honey bun
enjoy her tasty treat?

207
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:18,489
I trust there will be
no further interruptions.

208
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,911
And now,
as you were singing...

209
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,374
Even louder

210
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,750
We'll shout it

211
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,254
No one can doubt
what we know you can do

212
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,008
You're more evil than even you

213
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,259
Oh, Ratigan

214
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,886
- Oh, Ratigan
- Ah...

215
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,972
You're one of a kind

216
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,516
To Ratigan
To Ratigan

217
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,601
Hey.

218
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,770
The world's greatest criminal

219
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:55,693
Mind

220
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,452
This case is most intriguing

221
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:09,332
with its multiplicity of elements,
its many twists and turns.

222
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,793
Now, you're certain
you've told me everything?

223
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,796
The slightest detail may be important.

224
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,884
It's just as I said.
And then my father was gone.

225
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,802
What do you make of it?

226
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,139
Ratigan's up to something.

227
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,851
A crime of the most
sinister nature, no doubt.

228
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,814
The question is...
What would he want with a toymaker?

229
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,407
Quickly, we've not a moment to lose!

230
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,826
I'm right behind you, Basil.

231
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,251
No... No sign
of the blackguard anywhere.

232
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,963
Not quite, Dawson.
He left some rather unusual footprints.

233
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,842
They belong to the same fiend
who abducted the girl's father.

234
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,472
- Ratigan's peg-legged lackey.
- Uh... Basil?

235
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,558
A-ha!

236
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,520
Excellent work, old man.

237
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:18,192
Now there's nothing
to be afraid of, my dear.

238
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,866
- The scoundrel's quite gone.
- But not for long, Miss Flamhammer.

239
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,868
- Flaversham!
- Whatever. Now...

240
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,162
We simply pursue
our peg-legged friend

241
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,165
until he leads us to the girl's father.

242
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,377
- Then you'll get my daddy back?
- Yes!

243
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,507
And quite soon, if I'm not mistaken.

244
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,843
Now, hurry along, Dawson.

245
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,220
We must be off to Toby's.

246
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,556
- Toby's?
- Oh, you must meet him.

247
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,892
- He's just the chap for this.
- You... You want me to come?

248
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,146
I should think
a stout-hearted army mouse like you

249
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,773
would leap at the chance for adventure.

250
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,111
- Well, I am rather curious.
- Wait for me! I'm coming too!

251
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,825
What? Certainly not!
This is no business for children.

252
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,703
Are we going to take a cab?

253
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,250
My dear, I don't think you understand.

254
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,545
It will be quite dangerous.

255
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,759
Oh! Why, you... Look what...

256
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,516
Young lady, you are most definitely
not accompanying us.

257
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,269
And that is final!

258
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,280
And not a word out of you.

259
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,074
- Is that clear? I...
- Shh!

260
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,285
I observe that there's a good deal
of German music on the program.

261
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,456
It is introspective,
and I want to introspect.

262
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,834
But, Holmes, that music
is so frightfully dull.

263
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,002
Come on.

264
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:18,437
Toby?

265
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,650
Who is Toby?

266
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,152
Well, my dear, Toby is, uh...

267
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,570
Well, he's, uh...

268
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,699
I say, Basil, who is this Toby chap?

269
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,829
Ah! Here he is now.

270
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,832
Dawson, Toby.

271
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,169
Charmed, I'm sure.

272
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,217
Now, Toby, stop that!
Toby, cease! Desist!

273
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,138
Frightfully sorry, old man.

274
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,891
He has the most splendid sense
of smell of any hound I've trained.

275
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,519
But he can be deucedly frisky.

276
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,529
Hello, Toby!

277
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,824
Silly doggy!

278
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,868
Would you like a crumpet?

279
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,378
Now, Toby? To the matter at hand.

280
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,005
I want you to...

281
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,557
Good, now, Toby...

282
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,225
Toby...

283
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,562
I want you to find this fiend.

284
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,275
Yes, you know his type. A villain.

285
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,651
A scoundrel!

286
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,072
Low brow. Close-set eyes. Broken wing.

287
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,075
He's a peg-legged bat
with a broken wing.

288
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,871
Yes! That's the spirit!

289
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,708
Got his scent? Good boy!
Good boy!

290
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,714
- Miss Flamchester!
- Flaversham!

291
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,092
Whatever. Your father
is as good as found.

292
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,886
Toby,

293
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,262
sic 'em!

294
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,185
A-ha! Yoinks! Tally-ho!

295
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,242
The thrill of the hunt, eh, Dawson?

296
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,285
A-ha!
Quite!

297
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,456
Hoo-hoo! Our peg-legged quarry
can't be far now.

298
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,313
"Get the following.

299
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:11,777
"Tools." Check. I got tools.
"Gears." Double-check. I got gears.

300
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,364
"Girl." No, didn't get girl. "Uniforms."

301
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,157
I got plenty uniforms.

302
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,078
Oh, no. I gotta hide. I gotta hide.

303
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,746
I gotta hide!

304
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,672
Splendid job, Toby!

305
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,653
Now, Toby, sit.

306
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,536
- Toby, sit.
- Sit, Toby.

307
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,083
Good boy. If you'll excuse me.

308
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,712
You be good now.

309
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,381
We're going to find my father.

310
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,644
Here is our friend's entrance.

311
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:31,231
But, Basil, how could he fit
in through such a tiny...

312
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,567
Observe, doctor.

313
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,199
Basil, you astound me!

314
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,576
Shh.

315
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,386
Oh. I... I beg your pardon...

316
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,891
Oh, my.

317
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:13,023
Upon my word,
I've never seen so many toys.

318
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,485
Behind any of which could lurk
a bloodthirsty assassin.

319
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,947
So please, doctor, be very careful.

320
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,193
Oh!

321
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,407
Please!

322
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,950
Quiet.

323
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,704
Don't let this girl
out of your sight.

324
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,919
Now, Olivia, dear, stay close.

325
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,387
Hmm...

326
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,182
Checkmate.

327
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,517
A-ha!

328
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,480
Evidence of our peg-legged adversary.

329
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,735
Mmm-hmm. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

330
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:48,285
- Hmm. How very odd.
- What is it, Basil?

331
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,079
Isn't it painfully obvious, doctor?

332
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,333
These dolls have been
stripped of their uniforms.

333
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,253
And not by any child, either.

334
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,052
Hello.

335
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,391
Someone has taken the liberty

336
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,604
of removing the clockwork mechanisms
from these toys.

337
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,574
- Basil.
- Please, I'm trying to concentrate.

338
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,117
But Basil, I...

339
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,456
- Olivia!
- Gotcha!

340
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,166
Quickly, doctor!

341
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,836
Look out!

342
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,669
Bye-bye. Bye-bye!

343
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,511
Stop, you fiend!

344
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,210
Help! Uncle Basil, help!

345
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,214
I got the gears, I got the tools
I got the uniforms

346
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,590
I got the girl

347
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,848
Basil! Basil!

348
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,560
Mama, Mama.

349
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Mama.

350
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,443
- Basil! Olivia... Olivia, she's...
- Mama.

351
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,738
- Yes! She's gone, Dawson!
- Mama.

352
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,740
- Confound it!
- Mama.

353
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,410
- I told you to watch over the girl.
- Mama.

354
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,540
Now she's been spirited away
by that maniacal little monster.

355
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,419
Soon to be in the clutches of the most
depraved mind in all of London!

356
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,921
I should have known better than to...

357
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,466
Than to...

358
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,927
Eh... I... Uh... Dawson?

359
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,764
Dawson?

360
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,768
I say, Dawson, old chap?

361
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:48,650
Oh. Uh... Poor girl.
I should have watched her more closely.

362
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,697
Don't worry, old fellow.

363
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,366
It's not entirely hopeless.

364
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,789
We'll get her back.

365
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,961
Do... Do you think there's a chance?

366
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,214
There's always a chance, doctor,

367
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,177
as long as one can think.

368
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,318
Mmm.

369
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,653
"Get the following.

370
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,615
- "Tools, gears..."
- What?

371
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,367
- "...girl..."
- "Get the..."

372
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,162
Dawson, you've done it!

373
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,372
This list is precisely what we need.

374
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,167
- What?
- Quickly, back to Baker Street.

375
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,466
Mr. Flaversham...

376
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:03,183
Allow me to present
your charming daughter.

377
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,477
- Olivia!
- Father!

378
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,396
Ow! My foot! My only foot!

379
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,567
Oh, Father!
I thought I'd never find you.

380
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,613
There, there, my bairn. I'm all right.

381
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,616
I was so worried about my little girl.

382
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,954
Oh, how sweet.

383
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,999
Oh, I just love tearful reunions.

384
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:34,631
- Now, come along, my dear.
- Oh, please! Please!

385
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,843
- Olivia! Oh, please, professor!
- Father!

386
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,594
Now, now...

387
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,681
Fidget will take good care of her.

388
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:48,186
That is, as long
as we have no further delays.

389
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,691
Yes, yes, I'll finish it.
Oh, just don't hurt my daughter.

390
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:58,071
Remember, it must be ready tonight.

391
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,908
Stop! Let me go!

392
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,827
You ugly old thing!

393
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,415
- That ought to hold you!
- Help! Let me out! Let me out!

394
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,208
See how you like that.

395
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,257
Ah, the uniforms.
Fidget, I knew I could rely on you.

396
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,427
Now, you didn't forget anything?

397
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,680
No problem.

398
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,390
I took care of everything.
Everything on the list.

399
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,725
Uh-oh.

400
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,603
- What's wrong?
- The list, I know...

401
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,647
- Where is the list?
- The list, yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,900
You see, it was like this.

403
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,861
I was in the toy store
getting uniforms when I heard...

404
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,073
You're not coming through.

405
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,951
A dog came. I ran.

406
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,496
I had baby bonnet, girl in bag
and Basil chased me.

407
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,166
What? Basil on the case!

408
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,919
Why you gibbering little...

409
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:08,016
Oh, my dear Fidget. You have been
hanging upside down too long.

410
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,520
You mean, you're not mad?
I'm glad you're taking it so well.

411
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,658
Not me, you idiot.
No, stop you stupid fur ball!

412
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,705
Open up! Open up! Oh!
Ay! Ah! You're hurting my wings!

413
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:36,169
How dare that idiot Basil poke his nose
into my scheme and foul up everything!

414
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,964
Let me out! Let me out!

415
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,007
Help...

416
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,512
I can just see that insufferable grin
on his smug face.

417
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:53,687
Yes, yes, I can just see it.

418
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,526
- Felicia, release him.
- I'm too young to die!

419
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,034
Fidget, you delightful little maniac.

420
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,246
You've presented me
with a singular opportunity.

421
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:19,004
Poor Basil!
Oh, he is in for a little surprise.

422
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,805
Offhand, I can deduce very little.

423
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,392
Only that the words are written
with a broad-pointed quill pen

424
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:36,146
which has spattered, twice.
That the paper is of

425
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,941
native Mongolian manufacture,
no watermark.

426
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,653
And has been gummed,
if I'm not in error

427
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:49,576
by a bat who has
been drinking Rodent's Delight,

428
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,829
a cheap brandy sold only
in the seediest pubs.

429
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,333
- Hmm. Amazing.
- Oh, not really, doctor.

430
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,543
We still don't know where it came from.

431
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,379
Perhaps a closer inspection
will tell us something.

432
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,051
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

433
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,677
Mmm-hmm.

434
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,596
Coal dust.

435
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:14,225
Clearly of the type used in sewer lamps.

436
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,570
- But Basil...
- Shh. Don't speak!

437
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,952
Excuse me, Dawson.

438
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,580
Steady hand.

439
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,713
Yes. Yes. Good.

440
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,633
Come along, come along, come along,
come along, come along.

441
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,636
Yes, yes.
Good, good. Mmm.

442
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,807
No, bad. Good, good. Go, yeah.
Come along. Come along, come on.

443
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,684
Don't go back up.
Yes. Come along. Come on.

444
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,603
Yes... Yes!

445
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,983
We've done it, old fellow!

446
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,569
This reaction
could only have been triggered

447
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,949
by the paper's extreme saturation
with distillation of sodium chloride.

448
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,330
Salt water? Great Scott.

449
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,666
It proves, beyond a doubt,

450
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,212
this list came from the riverfront area.

451
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,339
Now, steady on there, Basil.

452
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,342
No, no. Elementary, my dear Dawson.

453
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:35,056
We merely look
for a seedy pub at the only spot

454
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,477
where the sewer connects
to the waterfront.

455
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,526
Stay, Toby. Stay.

456
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,043
Basil?

457
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:10,383
- Come, come, Dawson.
- I feel utterly ridiculous.

458
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,887
Don't be absurd.
You look perfect.

459
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,681
- Perfect? Perfectly foolish.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

460
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,748
Dawson,

461
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,171
stay close and do as I do.

462
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,448
Oh, I do beg your pardon, madam.
Quite unintentional

463
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,784
I assure you.

464
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,748
How impertinent!

465
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,167
Remember, we're low-life ruffians.

466
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,044
I was until that...

467
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,462
Shh, shh.

468
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,648
Get off, you eight-legged bum!

469
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,611
What's your pleasure, mates?

470
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:59,492
I'll have a dry sherry
with, uh... Oh, perhaps a twist of...

471
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,913
Two pints
for me and my shipmate.

472
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,917
Oh, by the way, we just got into port.

473
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,628
We're looking for an old friend of mine.

474
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,338
Maybe you know him.

475
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,050
Goes by the name of Ratigan!

476
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,850
I... uh... never heard of him.

477
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,443
Boo!

478
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,710
Dearest friends
dear gentlemen

479
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,796
Listen to my song

480
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,717
Life down here's been hard for you

481
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,387
Life has made you strong

482
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:06,726
Let me lift the mood

483
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:12,815
With my attitude

484
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,610
Hey, fellas

485
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,737
The time is right

486
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,906
Get ready

487
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,033
Tonight's the night

488
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,995
Boys, what you're hoping for
will come true

489
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:30,625
Let me be good to you

490
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,127
You tough guys

491
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,507
You're feeling all alone

492
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,094
You rough guys

493
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,472
The best o' you sailors and bums

494
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,016
All o' my chums

495
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,394
So dream on

496
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,270
And drink your beer

497
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,398
Get cozy

498
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,608
Your baby's here

499
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,945
You won't be misunderstood

500
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,199
Let me be good to you

501
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,203
Hey, fellas

502
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,457
I'll take off all my blues

503
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,961
Hey, fellas

504
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,297
There's nothing I won't do

505
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,341
Just for you

506
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:31,978
There you are, boys.
It's, uh... on the house.

507
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:36,315
I say, how very generous.

508
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,151
Dawson,

509
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,029
these drinks have been drugged.

510
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,743
Has a rather
nice bite to it.

511
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,039
Jolly good, ladies. Jolly good.

512
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,000
Dawson, get a hold of yourself.

513
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,463
Oh, bravo! Bravo!

514
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,681
- So dream on
- Whoops!

515
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,976
And drink your beer

516
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,562
If it isn't
our peg-legged friend.

517
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,691
Dawson... Oh, what luck!

518
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,360
Dawson? Dawson!

519
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,323
Your baby's gonna come through

520
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,117
Let me be good

521
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,954
To you

522
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,797
Yeah!

523
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,248
- Dawson. Dawson!
- What? Wha... What!

524
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,502
- What in heaven's name is going on?
- I've spotted our peg-legged...

525
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,256
Come on, old fellow.
There's not a moment to lose.

526
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,029
Let me be good to you

527
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,288
So dream on and drink your beer

528
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,455
- Your baby's here
- Basil?

529
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,498
Basil?

530
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,916
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

531
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,837
Follow me.

532
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,553
Great Scott.
I can't see a thing.

533
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:16,934
Grab my coat and follow along.
No, no, no, not that way.

534
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,686
Dawson, look out for your...

535
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,064
Ow! Confound it!

536
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,277
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

537
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,654
But of course. Left turn.

538
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,074
Right turn here, doctor.

539
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:41,208
A-ha! Dawson! We found it!
Ratigan's secret lair.

540
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,253
And it's filthier than I imagined.

541
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,178
Dawson, the bottle!

542
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,358
- It's stuck.
- Olivia?

543
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,694
Surprise!

544
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,285
Bravo! Bravo!

545
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,537
A marvelous performance.

546
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:27,880
Though, frankly,
I expected you 15 minutes earlier.

547
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,716
Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy?

548
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,431
Ratigan, no one can have
a higher opinion of you than I have,

549
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,352
and I think you're a slimy,
contemptible sewer rat.

550
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:50,945
By the way, Basil,
I just love your disguise.

551
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,033
Really, one would hardly recognize you.

552
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:03,207
The greatest...
...detective in all mousedom!

553
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,211
Ratigan, so help me,

554
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,964
I'll see you behind bars yet!

555
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,175
You fool! Isn't it clear to you?

556
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,469
The superior mind has triumphed.

557
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,179
I've won!

558
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,949
Oh, I love it! I love it!

559
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,953
Oh, I love it! I love it!

560
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:47,084
You don't know what
a delightful dilemma it was

561
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:52,965
trying to decide on the most
appropriate method for your demise.

562
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,761
I had so many ingenious ideas,

563
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,472
I didn't know which to choose.

564
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:04,185
So, I decided to use them all.

565
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,439
Marvelous, isn't it?

566
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,277
But here,
let me show you how it works.

567
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,820
Picture this.

568
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:19,867
First, a sprightly tune
I've recorded especially for you.

569
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:24,163
As the song plays, the cord tightens,

570
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,918
and when the song ends,
the metal ball is released,

571
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,630
rolling along its merry way until...

572
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,174
Snap!

573
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,509
Boom.

574
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,635
Twang.

575
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,928
Thunk.

576
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,516
Splat! And, so ends the short,

577
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:47,812
undistinguished career
of Basil of Baker Street.

578
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,690
- You're despicable!
- Yes.

579
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,985
- Everything's ready?
- All set, boss.

580
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,742
Oh, this is wicked!

581
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,829
So delightfully wicked.

582
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,039
Mr. Flaversham,

583
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,836
let me congratulate you
on a superb piece of craftsmanship.

584
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,382
See what you can do
with the proper motivation?

585
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,972
- You all know the plan.
- Right, professor.

586
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:30,396
It was my fond hope to stay
and witness your final scene,

587
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,899
but you were 15 minutes late,

588
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,612
and I do have an important engagement
at Buckingham Palace.

589
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,994
Now, you will remember
to smile for the camera, won't you?

590
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,620
Hmm?

591
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,873
Say, "cheese".

592
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,377
- You fiend!
- Sorry, chubby.

593
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,629
You should've chosen
your friends more carefully.

594
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,515
Goodbye so soon

595
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,019
And isn't this a crime

596
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,813
We know by now that time...

597
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:18,235
Adieu, auf wiedersehen,
arrivederci, farewell.

598
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,989
Bye, bye, Basil.

599
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,620
With time so short
I'll say so long

600
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,040
And go so soon

601
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,459
Goodbye

602
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:38,047
You followed me
I followed you

603
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,967
We were like each other's
shadows for a while

604
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,137
Now as you see
this game is through

605
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,639
So although it hurts

606
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,100
Wh... What did he mean,
an engagement at Buckingham Palace?

607
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,313
Haven't you
figured it out yet, doctor?

608
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:58,025
The queen's in danger,
and the Empire's doomed.

609
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,318
The queen?

610
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,050
Psst. Over here.
Come on. Over here.

611
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,888
Hmm.

612
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,936
- Come in.
- Begging Your Majesty's pardon.

613
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,605
A present has arrived
in honor of your jubilee.

614
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,526
A present? Oh, how wonderful!

615
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,363
I just adore jubilees.

616
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,825
Here you are, sweetheart.

617
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,621
Have you been with us long?

618
00:54:54,874 --> 00:55:00,629
"To our beloved queen,
this gift we send

619
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:04,174
"as her 60 year reign

620
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,552
"comes to an end"?

621
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,937
How extraordinary!

622
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,403
Goodness gracious!

623
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:35,456
Amazing likeness, isn't it,
Your Majesty?

624
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,916
Professor Ratigan!

625
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:42,504
Guards! Seize this despicable creature!

626
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,427
- Guards, seize this...
- Despicable creature!

627
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,851
- Oh, how dare you!
- Take her away.

628
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:01,148
Let go of me, you ruffians!

629
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,610
- Move along, honey!
- You fiends!

630
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,570
Traitors!

631
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,823
So although it hurts

632
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:14,828
I'll try to smile as I say

633
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,831
Goodbye so soon

634
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,125
And isn't this...

635
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,169
Basil?

636
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:26,423
- Basil!
- Oh, how could I have been so blind?

637
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,803
We all make mistakes.
We can't let that stop us.

638
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,137
We have to...

639
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,224
Ratigan's proved
he's more clever than I.

640
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,684
He would never have walked into
such an obvious trap.

641
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,813
Oh, pull yourself together!
You can stop that villain! Why...

642
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,148
Why...

643
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,650
So long... So long... So long

644
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,276
Basil! The record!

645
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,656
Oh, it's finally happened.
I've been outwitted.

646
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,242
- Basil, please!
- Beaten! Duped!

647
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,495
Made a fool of! Oh, ridiculed!

648
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,330
- Belittled!
- That's enough!

649
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,586
Dash it all, Basil! The queen's
in danger. Olivia's counting on us.

650
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:09,216
We're about to be splattered, and all
you can do is feel sorry for yourself.

651
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,718
Well, I know you can save us.

652
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:15,556
But if you've given up, then
set it off now and be done with it.

653
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,602
We know by now
that time knows how to fly

654
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:27,192
Set it off now.

655
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,072
Yes. We...

656
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,242
- We'll set the trap off now!
- Basil! Wait!

657
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,369
I didn't mean that we ought...

658
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,709
Angle of the trajectory,

659
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,170
multiplied by the square root
of an isosceles triangle,

660
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,383
dividing Guttermeg's principle
of opposing forces in motion,

661
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,473
and adjusting for
the difference in equilibrium...

662
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,350
Dawson, at the exact moment I tell you,

663
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,686
we must release
the triggering mechanism.

664
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,481
- What?
- Get ready, Dawson.

665
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,857
Steady.

666
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,735
Now!

667
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,419
Thank you, Dawson.

668
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,671
Smile everyone!

669
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,611
On this most august occasion,

670
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,989
we are gathered here
not only to commemorate

671
00:58:56,074 --> 00:59:00,786
my 60 years as queen,
but to honor one...

672
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,830
Of truly noble stature.

673
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,167
"I present to you
a statesman among mice.

674
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,044
"A gifted leader..."

675
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,838
A crusader for justice...

676
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,634
Over here, fatty. You're a ton, toots.

677
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,471
Here kitty, kitty. Time for mouse chow.

678
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,893
A majestic mountain of humility,

679
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,397
and my new royal consort,

680
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:32,317
Professor Ratigan.

681
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,832
Toby!

682
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,256
The game's afoot, Toby.
Our queen is in mortal danger.

683
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,846
To Buckingham Palace!

684
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,308
Thank you, Your Majesty.

685
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,769
And now, as your new royal consort,

686
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,939
I have a few slight suggestions.

687
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,360
Item one...

688
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,490
Stop it!

689
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,136
Open wide.

690
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,056
Bye-bye.

691
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,227
Down, kitty! Down!

692
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,611
Item 96...

693
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:04,284
"A heavy tax shall be levied
against all parasites and sponges,

694
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,455
"such as the elderly, the infirm,

695
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:12,876
"and especially little children."

696
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,296
That's ridiculous. You're insane.

697
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,299
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.

698
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,594
I have the power!

699
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,972
- Of course you do.
- I am supreme.

700
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,309
- Only you.
- This is my kingdom!

701
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,945
That is, of course,
with Your Highness' permission.

702
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,907
Most assuredly,

703
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,286
- you insidious fiend.
- What?

704
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,790
- You're not my royal consort.
- What a sense of humor.

705
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,168
- You're a cheap fraud and impostor.
- Flaversham!

706
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,964
A corrupt, vicious, demented,
low-life scoundrel.

707
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,467
There's no evil scheme
you wouldn't concoct.

708
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,852
No depravity you wouldn't commit.

709
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,355
You, professor,

710
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,692
are none other than
a foul, stenchus rodentus,

711
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,068
commonly known as a...

712
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,654
- Don't say it!
- Sewer rat!

713
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,324
Arrest that fiend!

714
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,238
The girl! The girl!

715
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,538
Stay where you are, or the girl dies!

716
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,374
Hurry, Dawson!

717
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,505
There he goes!

718
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,096
Dawson! Flaversham!
Gather up those balloons.

719
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,818
Just wait! Basil's smarter than you!

720
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,945
He's going to put you in jail.

721
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:50,242
He's not afraid of a big old,
ugly rat like you.

722
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,371
Would you kindly sit down and shut up!

723
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,301
Let her go, chaps!

724
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,091
We have to lighten the load.

725
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:52,137
Oh, you want to lighten the load?

726
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,431
- Excellent idea.
- No!

727
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,767
No! Not me! I can't fly! I can't fly!

728
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,485
Steady!

729
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,081
Basil, look out!

730
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:02,017
Closer, Dawson!

731
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,768
Closer!

732
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:09,482
Daddy, I can't reach!
I can't reach!

733
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,463
Basil! Over here!

734
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,972
There's no escape this time, Basil!

735
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,843
I've won!

736
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,139
On the contrary!

737
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,519
The game's not over yet!

738
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,486
Oh!

739
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,565
- Hooray!
- Hooray! It's Basil!

740
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,108
- Good fellow!
- Jolly good!

741
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:31,124
To be thanked
by the queen herself.

742
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,501
Oh, how very thrilling.

743
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:38,006
- Hey, Basil?
- All in a day's work, doctor.

744
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,301
Oh, Dr. Dawson, you were wonderful.

745
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,263
Indeed.

746
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,600
Oh, my, we're late to catch our train.

747
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:51,352
- Come along, Olivia.
- Yes, Father.

748
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:56,065
Goodbye, Basil.
I... I'll never forget you.

749
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:00,612
Nor I you, Miss... Miss Flangerhanger.

750
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:06,951
Whatever.

751
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:11,289
- Goodbye, Dr. Dawson.
- Goodbye, my dear.

752
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,461
Goodbye.

753
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,256
Well, um...

754
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:25,303
- not a bad little girl, actually.
- Not at all.

755
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:32,560
Well, it's time I was on my way, too.

756
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,437
But...

757
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:39,484
- But I thought...
- Well, the case is over.

758
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,694
Perhaps it's...

759
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,614
Well, perhaps it's best
I found my own living quarters.

760
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,368
But... Now who can that be?

761
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,541
Is this the home of the famous
Basil of Baker Street?

762
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,002
Indeed it is, miss.

763
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,630
You look as if you're in some trouble.

764
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,593
Oh, I am! I am!

765
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,805
Then, you've come to precisely
the right place.

766
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:13,184
Allow me to introduce
my trusted associate, Dr. Dawson,

767
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:17,897
with whom I do all my cases.
Isn't that right, doctor?

768
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:23,861
Wha... What? Yes, yes!
By all means.

769
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,614
Mmm.

770
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,032
As you can see,

771
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,868
this young lady has just arrived
from the Hampstead District,

772
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,870
and is troubled
about the disappearance

773
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:37,208
of an emerald ring, missing from
the third finger of her right hand.

774
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:41,379
Now, tell me your story,
and pray, be precise.

775
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:46,175
From that time on,
Basil and I were a close team

776
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:50,638
and over the years,
we had many cases together.

777
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:56,686
But I shall always look back
on that first with the most fondness.

778
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:01,774
My introduction
to Basil of Baker Street,

779
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,485
the great mouse detective.
