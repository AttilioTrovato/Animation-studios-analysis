31
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:44,163
My dear child, there are many good books

Please, sir.

Oh...

76
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:12,913
Well, after this I shall think nothing

Oh!

78
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:55,623
Goodness. What if I should fall
right through the centre of the Earth...

79
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,378
and come out the other side
where people walk upside down?

80
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,547
But that's silly. Nobody...

81
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,801

I beg your pardon.

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,256
Quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

87
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,009
- I was following...
- Rather good, what? Door knob, turn.

88
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:54,140
- Please, sir.
- One good turn deserves another.

89
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,560
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for a white rabbit.

90
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,354
- So, if you don't mind...
- Eh?

91
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,522
Oh.

92
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,858
There he is. I simply must get through.

93
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,194
Sorry. You're much too big.
Simply impassable.

94
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,240
- You mean impossible.
- No, impassable. Nothing's impossible.

95
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,619
- Try the bottle on the table.
- Table?

96
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,208
Read the directions. Directly you'll be
directed in the right direction.

97
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,420
"Drink me. " Hm.

98
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,258
Better look first, for if one drinks
much from a bottle marked "Poison",

99
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,429
it's almost certain
to disagree with one sooner or later.

100
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:38,058
- Beg your pardon?
- Just giving myself some good advice.

101
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,894
But...

102
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,731
Tastes like cherry tart.

103
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,152
Custard, pineapple, roast turkey.

104
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,446
Goodness!

105
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,823
- What did I do?
-

106
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,242
You almost went out like a candle.

107
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,454
But look. I'm just the right size.

108
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,752
No use.
I forgot to tell you. I'm locked.

109
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,171
Oh, no.

110
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,966
- But, of course, you've got the key.
- What key?

111
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,011
Don't tell me you've left it up there.

112
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,931
Oh, dear.

113
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,483
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.

114
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh!

115
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,528
"Eat me. " All right.

116
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,781

No. I suppose he must have...

175
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,057
Why. What peculiar little figures.

176
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,979
- Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
-

177
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,940
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

178
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,569
If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak to us.

179
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,745
- That's logic.
- Well...

180
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,332
It's been nice meeting you. Goodbye.

181
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,878
- You're beginning backwards.
- First thing in a visit is to say...

182
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,173
♪ How do you do and shake hands,
shake hands, shake hands

183
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,344
♪ How do you do and shake hands,
state your name and business ♪

184
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,347
- That's manners.
- Really?

185
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,558
Well my name is Alice
and I'm following a white rabbit, so...

186
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,437
- You can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.

187
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,441
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

188
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,361
- Or Button? Who's got the button?
- No, thank you.

189
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,156
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

190
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,284
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

191
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,496
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

192
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,584
- Why?
- I'm curious to know where he's going.

193
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,753
Oh, she's curious.

194
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,923
The oysters were curious, too,
weren't they?

195
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,469
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

196
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,097
Poor things.

197
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,641
Why? What did happen to the oysters?

198
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,310
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- But I am.

199
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,313
Oh, no.
You're in much too much of a hurry.

200
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,691
Well,
perhaps I could spare a little time.

201
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,110
You could? Well...

202
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,072
"The Walrus and the Carpenter. "

203
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,118
Or "The Story of the Curious Oysters. "

204
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,751
♪ The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might

205
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,089
♪ He did his very best
to make the billows smooth and bright

206
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,967
♪ And this was odd because it was

00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,553
♪ The middle of the night

♪ The beach was wide from side to side,
but much too full of sand

210
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,030
Mr. Walrus, said the carpenter

211
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,198
My brain begins to perk

212
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,620
We'll sweep this clear in half a year
if you don't mind the work

213
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,788
Work?

214
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,083
- The time has come
-  The walrus said

215
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,668
To talk of other things

216
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:06,089
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
and cabbages and kings

217
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,427
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

218
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,930
Caloo, callay, no work today

219
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,476
We're cabbages and kings

220
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,427
Oysters, come and walk with us

221
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,930
The day is warm and bright

222
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,768
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk
would be a sheer delight

223
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:05,607
And should we get hungry on the way,
we'll stop and have a bite

224
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:13,699
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
and shook her heavy head

225
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,662
She knew too well this was no time
to leave her oyster bed

226
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,457
The sea is nice, take my advice

227
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,377
- And stay right here
-  Mum said

228
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,337
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

229
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,007
But, ha-ha, the time has come,
my little friends,

230
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,385
to talk of other things

231
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,472
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax,
cabbages and kings

232
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:43,437
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

233
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,398
Caloo, callay, come run away

234
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,818
With cabbages and kings

235
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,486
Well, now, let me see.

236
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,366
Ah. A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

237
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,916
And how about some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

238
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,795
Yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Very good indeed.

239
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,634
Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear,

240
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,846
we can begin the feed.

241
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,599
-  Feed?
- Oh yes.

242
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,353
The time has come, my little friends,
to talk of food and things

243
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,856
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

244
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,276
We'll mix them all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

245
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,196
Caloo, callay, we'll eat today

246
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,117
Like cabbages and kings

247
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,458
I, er, I weep for you, I...|

248
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,962
Excuse me, I deeply sympathize

249
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:37,551
For I've enjoyed your company
much more than you realize

250
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,137
Little oysters, little oysters

251
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,140
But answer there came none

252
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:50,438
And this was scarcely odd
because they'd been eaten, every one

253
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,692
Hmm. Well, er...

254
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,322
The time has come

255
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:14,421
♪ With cabbages and kings ♪

256
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,547
The end.

257
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,216
- That was a very sad story.
- Aye.

258
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,428
- And there's a moral to it.
- Oh yes, a very good moral.

259
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,597
If you happen to be an oyster.

260
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,808
- Well, it's been a very nice visit.
- Another recitation.

261
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,977
Entitled "Father William".

262
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,520
First verse:

263
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,898
♪ You are old Father William,
the young man said

264
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,066
♪ And your hair has become very white

265
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,611
♪ And yet you incessantly
stand on your head

266
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,908
♪ Do you think at your age it is right?
Do you think at your age it is right?

267
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,411
In my youth,
Father William replied to his son

268
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,416
I'd do it again and again and again...

269
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,342
I wonder who lives here.

270
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:06,139
Mary Ann. Drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

271
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,601
- The rabbit.
- Mary Ann?

272
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,729
No use, can't wait, I'm awfully late.
Oh me, oh my.

273
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,273
Excuse me, sir,
but I've been trying to...

274
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,485
- Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?
- Mary Ann?

275
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,570
Don't just do something, stand there.

276
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,824
- No, no. Go get my gloves. I'm late.
- For what? That's just what I...

277
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,203
My gloves! At once! Do you hear?

278
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,082
Goodness. I suppose
I'll be taking orders from Dinah next.

279
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,169
Hmm. Now, let me see.

280
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,131
If I were a rabbit,
where would I keep my gloves?

281
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,758
Oh.

282
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,552
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

283
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,394
Oh, no, no. Not again.

284
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,606
Mary Ann!

285
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,027
You see here, Mary Ann.

286
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,821
Help!

287
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,703
Help!

288
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,207
Help! Monster!

289
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,043
- Help! Assistance!
-

290
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,844
-  A monster, Dodo, in my house.
- Dodo?

291
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,054
- My poor house.
- Steady, old chap.

292
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,683
- Can't be as bad as all that.
- My poor roof and rafters.

293
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,227
All my walls. There it is!

294
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,106
By jove. Jolly well is, isn't it?

295
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,191
Do something.

296
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,486
Yes, indeed.
Extraordinary situation, but...

297
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,196
But... but what?

298
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,284
But I have a very simple solution.

299
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,037
- Thank goodness.
-  What is it?

300
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,457
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Go ahead. Pull it out.

301
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,376
Who? Me? Don't be ridiculous.

302
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,212
What we need is a...

303
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,050
... a lizard with a ladder.

304
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:09,721
Oh! Bill! Bill, we need
a lazard with a lidder.

305
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,308
- Can you help us?
- At your service, guv'nor.

306
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,519
Bill, me lad,
have you ever been down a chimney?

307
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,938
Guv'nor, I been down more chimneys...

308
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:24,736
Excellent. You just pop down the chimney
and haul that monster out of there.

309
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,947
Righto, guv'nor. Monster?

310
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,626
Come now. That's better, m'lad.

311
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,045
You're passing up a golden opportunity.

312
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,171
I am?

313
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,340
- You can be famous.
- I can?

314
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,218
Of course. There's a brave lad.

315
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,346
In you go, now.
Nothing to it, old boy.

316
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,517
Simply tie your tail around
the monster's neck and drag it out.

317
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,937
- But, guv'nor...
- Good luck, Bill.

318
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,036
Well, ... there goes Bill.

319
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,498
Poor Bill.

320
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,460
Perhaps we should try
a more energetic remedy.

321
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,629
Yes, anything, anything, but hurry.

322
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,715
I propose that we...

323
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,845
- Yes, go on. Yes? Yes?
- I propose that we...

324
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,100
By jove, that's it.
We'll burn the house down.

325
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,727
Yes. Burn the house... ? What?

326
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,021

343
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:32,488
Perhaps if I eat something,
it will make... me... grow small.

344
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,366
Ow! Let go! Help!

345
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:40,955
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me, you... you... barbarian.

346
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,583
Help!

347
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,377
Monster!

348
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,546
Help!

349
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,759
I'm late. Oh, dear. I'm here.
I should be there. I'm late.

350
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,971
- I say, do you have a match?
- Must go. Goodbye, hello.

351
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,682
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait. Please wait.

352
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,435
Ah, young lady, do you have a match?

353
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,896
No, I'm sorry but... Mr. Rabbit.

354
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,357
No cooperation, no cooperation at all.

355
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,567
Well, can't have monsters about.

356
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,362
Jolly well have to carry on alone.

357
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,078
Wait. Please. Just a minute.

358
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,041
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

359
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,922
- Curious butterflies.
-  Bread-and-butterflies.

360
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,091
Yes, of course... Hm?

361
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,512
Who do you suppose... ?

362
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:46,229
A horsefly. I mean, a rocking-horsefly.

363
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:51,025
-  Naturally.
- I beg your pardon, but did you... ?

364
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,488
That's nonsense. Flowers can't talk.

365
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,949
But of course we can talk, my dear.

366
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,368
If there's anyone worth talking to.

367
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,537
Or about.

368
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,914
- And we sing, too.
- You do?

369
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,042
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
Tell It To The Tulips?

370
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,921
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy violet.

371
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,841
- Not that old thing.
- Lovely lily of the valley.

372
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,259
- A daisy duet?
- She wouldn't like that.

373
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:22,223
Girls. We shall sing Golden Afternoon.

374
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,892
That's about all of us.

375
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,270
Sound your A, Lily.

376
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,939
La!

00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,774

- That was lovely.
- Thank you, my dear.

403
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,517
What kind of garden do you come from?

404
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:15,521
- I don't come from any garden.
- Do you suppose she's a wild flower?

405
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,191
No, I'm not a wild flower.

406
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,653
Just what specie or shall we say genus
are you, my dear?

407
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:28,034
Well, I suppose you'd call me
a genus humanus Alice.

408
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,661
Ever see an Alice
with a blossom like that?

409
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,499
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?

410
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,752
And did you notice her petals?

411
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,213
What a peculiar color.

412
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,632
And no fragrance.

413
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,844
- Just look at those stems.
- Rather scrawny, I'd say.

414
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,847
- I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, Bud.

415
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:53,726
- But I'm not a flower.
- Ah-ha! Just as I suspected.

416
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,980
She's nothing
but a common mobile vulgaris.

417
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,191
Oh, no!

418
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,153
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly, a weed.

419
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,155
I'm not a weed.

420
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,659
- You wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?

421
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,828
- Well, goodness.
- Don't let her stay and go to seed.

422
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,373
- Go on.
- Please go.

423
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,710
- We don't want weeds in our bed.
- Move along.

424
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,719
All right. If that's the way
you feel about it.

425
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:33,224
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

426
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,934
And I guess that'd teach you.

427
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:46,112
You can learn a lot of things
from the flowers.

428
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,657
Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

00:31:53,328 --> 00:32:09,719

434
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,087
Well, I... I hardly know, sir.

435
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,840
I've changed so many times, you see.

436
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,718
I do not see.

437
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,139
- Explain yourself.
- I'm afraid I can't explain myself.

438
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,644
- Because I'm not myself, you know.
- I do not know.

439
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,648
I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.

440
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,943
You? Who are you?

441
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,655
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

442
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:16,285
... who you are first?

443
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,789
Why?

444
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:23,167
Oh, dear. Everything is so confusing.

445
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,253
- It is not.
-  Well it is to me.

446
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,007
- Why?
- I can't remember things as I used to.

447
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,218
Recite.

448
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,805
Hmm? Oh, yes, sir. Erm...

449
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,100
How doth the little busy bee
improve each...

450
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,268
Stop!

451
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,272
That is not spoken correcitally.
It goes:

452
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,944
How...

453
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:04,083
How doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tail

454
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:09,547
And pour the waters of the Nile
on every golden scale?

455
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:15,136
How cheer...

456
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,562
How cheerfully he seems to grin

457
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,857
How neatly spreads his claws

458
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,443
And welcomes little fishes in

459
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,113
With gently smiling jaws.

460
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,658
I've never heard it that way before.

461
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,661
I know. I have improved it.

462
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,997
Well...

463
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,292
- If you ask me...
- You?

464
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,170
Who are you?

465
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,981
You, there. Girl.

466
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,734
Wait. Come back.

467
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,653
I have something important to say.

468
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,822
Oh, dear.

469
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,534
I wonder what he wants now.

470
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,298
Well?

471
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,594
Keep your temper.

472
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,806
- Is that all?
- No.

473
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,645
Exatically what is your problem?

474
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:52,983
It's exatically... exat...
It's precisely this.

475
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,361
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

476
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,071
Why?

477
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,908
After all, three inches
is such a wretched height.

478
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,994
I am exatically three inches high

479
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,206
and it is a very good height indeed!

480
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:13,462
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't... shout!

481
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,259
Oh, dear.

482
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,178
By the way,
I have a few more helpful hints.

483
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:25,182
- One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?

484
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,227
And the other side
will make you grow shorter.

485
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,773
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

486
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,862
Hmm.

487
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,577
One side will make me grow...

488
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,371
But which is which?

489
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,835
After all that's happened,
I... I wonder if I...

490
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,004
I don't care.

491
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,425
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.

492
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,188
A serpent!

493
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,650
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

494
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,697
- But, please, please.
- Off with you. Shoo. Go away. Serpent!

495
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,198
Serpent!

496
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,576
But I'm not a serpent.

497
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,746
Indeed? Then just what are you?

498
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,875
- I'm just a little girl.
- Little? Little?!

499
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,671
Well, I am. I mean, I was.

500
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,383
And I suppose
you don't eat eggs, either.

501
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,970
- Yes, I do.
- I knew it. I knew it.

502
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,139
Serpent. Serpent!

503
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,351
For goodness' sake.

504
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,645
Hmm.

505
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:56,023
- And the other side will...
- The very idea.

506
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,860
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

507
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,791
Goodness. I wonder
if I'll ever get the knack of it.

508
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,842
There. That's much better.

509
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,305
Better save these.

510
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,353
Let's see. Where was I?

511
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,986
I wonder which way I ought to go.

Oh, my wheels and springs.

661

- But, but, but...
- Butter, of course.

662

What are you talking about?

667

- Tea?
- I never thought of tea. Of course.

668
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,087
- Not tea.
- Sugar?

669
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,423
Sugar, just two spoons. Just two spoons.

670
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,175
- Thank you.
- Please be careful.

671

- Jam. I forgot all about jam.

672

- Mustard.

673
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,725
Mustard, yes.

674
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:01,187
Mustard? Don't let's be silly.

675
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,939
Lemon, that's different.

676
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,942
There. That should do it.

677
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,197
- Look at that.
- It's going mad.

678
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,284
- Oh, dear.
- It's going mad.

679

00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,289
Look.

681
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,292

858
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,287
Oh, my fur and whiskers.

859
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:42,706
Oh, dear. Save the queen.

860
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:46,502
Someone's head
will roll for this.

861
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,880
Yours!

862
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,632
Off with her...

863
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:56,970
But, consider, my dear.
Couldn't she have a trial... first?

864
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:01,225
- Trial?
- Well, just a little trial?

865
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:09,358
Very well, then.
Let the trial begin.

866
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,245
Your Majesty, ...
members of the jury, ...

867
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,164
loyal subjects, ...

868
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:28,043
-
- ... and the king.

869
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:32,297
The prisoner is charged with enticing
Her Majesty the Queen of Hearts

870
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,552
into a game of croquet and willfully
and with malice aforethought

871
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,471
teasing, tormenting
and otherwise annoying...

872
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:44,059
Never mind all that! Get to the part
where I lose my temper.

873
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:47,563
... causing the queen to lose her temper.

874
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:52,735
Now... are you ready for your sentence?

875
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,863
Sentence? But there
must be a verdict first.

876
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:59,032
Sentence first! Verdict afterwards.

877
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,286
- But that just isn't the way...
- All ways are...

878
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,122
Your ways, Your Majesty.

879
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,624
Yes, my child.

880
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,419
- Off with her...
- Consider, my dear.

881
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,882
We've called no witnesses.
Couldn't we hear maybe one or two, huh?

882
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,050
- Maybe?
- Oh, very well.

883
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,219
But get on with it!

884
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:22,055
First witness.
Herald, call the first witness.

885
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,433
The March Hare.

886
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:31,356
What do you know
about this unfortunate affair?

887
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,650
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?!

888
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:37,988
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

889
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,157
Jury, write that down.

890
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,455
Unimportant,
Your Majesty means, of course.

891
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,666
Silence! Next witness.

892
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,668
The Dormouse.

893
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,675
- Well?
- Shh.

894
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,220
What have you
to say about this?

895
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:05,766
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder...

896
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,895
That's the most important
piece of evidence we've heard yet.

897
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,356
Write that down!

898
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,525
Twinkle, twinkle...

899
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,403
Twinkle, twinkle. What next?

900
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,572
The Mad Hatter.

901
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:28,247
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my.

902
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:32,125
Where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

903
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,795
I was home drinking tea.

904
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,130
Today, you know, is my unbirthday.

905
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,592
Why, my dear,
today is your unbirthday, too.

01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,803

- Look. There he is now.
- What? Who?

917
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,838
- The Cheshire Cat.
- Cat?

918
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,382
Cat! Cat! C-c-c-c! Cat!

919
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,385
- There he goes.
- This is terrible. Help.

920
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,222
- Stop him.
- Catch him, somebody. Help me.

921
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:31,101
- Get me the jam.
- The jam. By order of the king.

922
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,479
- The jam.
- Let me have it.

923
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:43,488
Somebody's head
is going to roll for this!

924
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,490
Ah-ha!

925
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,701

Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.

928
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:01,632
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.

929
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:08,055
Rule 42: all persons more than a mile
high must leave the court immediately.

930
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,224
I'm not a mile high,
and I'm not leaving.

931
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:14,686
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

932
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:19,024
And as for you, ... Your Majesty.

933
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,195
Your Majesty indeed.
You're not a queen.

934
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:29,368
You're just a fat, pompous,
bad-tempered old ty... tyrant.

935
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:36,625
And er... what were you saying, my dear?

936
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:41,129
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered old tyrant.

937
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,674
Off with her head!
