1
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,970
I know you

2
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:23,384
I walked with you
once upon a dream

3
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,115
I know you

4
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,320
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

5
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:34,329
Yet I know it's true

6
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:39,164
That visions are seldom
all they seem

7
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:43,672
But if I know you
I know what you'll do

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,799
You'll love me at once

9
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:53,008
The way you did
once upon a dream

10
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,445
In a faraway land
long ago...

11
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:09,453
lived a king
and his fair queen.

12
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:12,422
Many years had they
longed for a child,

13
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,118
and finally their wish
was granted.

14
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:20,096
A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora.

15
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:24,464
Sweet Aurora

16
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,639
Yes, they named her
after the dawn,

17
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:33,734
for she filled their lives
with sunshine.

18
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,303
Then a great holiday was proclaimed
throughout the kingdom...

19
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,283
so that all of
high or low estate...

20
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:44,082
might pay homage
to the infant princess.

21
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:48,455
And our story begins
on that most joyful day.

22
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:51,552
On that joyful day

23
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,465
On that joyful day

24
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,499
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come

25
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,973
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes too

26
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:07,273
We pledge our loyalty anew

27
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:11,645
Hail to the Princess Aurora

28
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:15,743
All of her subjects
adore her

29
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,086
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

30
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,527
Hail to the Princess Aurora

31
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:28,691
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

32
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:33,032
Long live the Princess Aurora

33
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:36,198
Hail Aurora

34
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:40,502
Hail Aurora

35
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:46,112
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

36
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,211
Long live the Princess Aurora

37
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:54,554
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

38
00:03:54,625 --> 00:04:01,895
Hail to the Princess Aurora

39
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:06,536
Thus, on this great
and joyous day...

40
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:11,166
did all the kingdom celebrate
the long-awaited royal birth.

41
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:15,872
And good King Stefan and his queen
made welcome their lifelong friend.

42
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:26,321
Their Royal Highnesses,

43
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,053
King Hubert
and Prince Phillip!

44
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,091
Fondly had these monarchs
dreamed one day...

45
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,156
their kingdoms to unite.

46
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,500
Thus, today would they announce
that Phillip, Hubert's son and heir,

47
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,540
to Stefan's child
would be betrothed.

48
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:48,440
And so to her
his gift he brought...

49
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:52,279
and looked unknowing
on his future bride.

50
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,097
Their most honored
and exalted excellencies,

51
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,602
the Three Good Fairies!

52
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,934
Mistress Flora,

53
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,570
Mistress Fauna...

54
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:24,581
and Mistress Merryweather!

55
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:37,756
- Oh!
- Oh!
- The little darling.

56
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,097
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.

57
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:47,126
Each of us the child
may bless with a single gift,

58
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,468
no more, no less.

59
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,669
Little Princess,

60
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,675
my gift shall be
the gift of beauty.

61
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,443
One gift

62
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:09,351
Beauty rare

63
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:12,652
Gold of sunshine

64
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:16,353
In her hair

65
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:23,527
Lips that shame
the red, red rose

66
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:26,332
She'll walk with springtime

67
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:31,068
Wherever she goes

68
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,873
Tiny Princess,

69
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,079
my gift shall be
the gift of song.

70
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:52,657
One gift

71
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,861
The gift of song

72
00:06:56,935 --> 00:07:03,101
Melody her whole life long

73
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:10,580
The nightingale's
her troubadour

74
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:19,023
Bringing his sweet serenade
to her door

75
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:28,757
Sweet Princess,
my gift shall be the--

76
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:56,118
- Why, it's Maleficent.
- What does she want here?
- Shh!

77
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:00,960
Well, quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

78
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,228
Royalty, nobility,

79
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,963
the gentry, and--

80
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:11,804
How quaint.
Even the rabble.

81
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,609
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,649
- You weren't wanted.
- Not wa--

83
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,151
Oh, dear, what
an awkward situation.

84
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:28,589
I had hoped it was merely due
to some oversight.

85
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:31,287
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.

86
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:34,957
And you're not offended,
Your Excellency?

87
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:38,763
Why, no, Your Majesty.

88
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,669
And to show
I bear no ill will,

89
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:45,334
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

90
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,671
Listen well, all of you.

91
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:56,785
The Princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

92
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:59,721
beloved by all who know her.

93
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,954
But...

94
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:07,691
before the sun sets on
her sixteenth birthday,

95
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:12,532
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel...

96
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,195
and die.

97
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,865
Oh, no!

98
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:19,034
Seize that creature!

99
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,509
Stand back, you fools!

100
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,387
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

101
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,326
Merryweather still
has her gift to give.

102
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:41,694
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?

103
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:43,426
Oh, no, Sire.

104
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,697
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.

105
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,364
But she can help.

106
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,438
- But--
- Just do your best, dear.

107
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,841
Yes, go on.

108
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,573
Sweet Princess,

109
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,345
if through this
wicked witch's trick...

110
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,886
a spindle should
your finger prick,

111
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:07,185
a ray of hope there
still may be in this,

112
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:10,192
the gift I give to thee.

113
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,922
Not in death,
but just in sleep...

114
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:15,430
the fateful prophecy
you'll keep.

115
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,899
And from this slumber
you shall wake...

116
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:21,404
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.

117
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:26,136
For true love

118
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:32,079
Conquers all

119
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,911
But King Stefan, still fearful
of his daughter's life,

120
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:41,947
did then and there decree that every
spinning wheel in the kingdom...

121
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,994
should on that very day
be burned.

122
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,462
So 'twas done.

123
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,443
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle!

124
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,986
Now, come have
a nice cup of tea, dear.

125
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,284
I'm sure it'll
work out somehow.

126
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,325
Well, a bonfire
won't stop Maleficent.

127
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,588
Of course not.
But what will?

128
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,597
- Well, perhaps if we reason with her.
- Reason?

129
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:24,634
- With Maleficent?
- Well, she can't be all bad.

130
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,669
Oh, yes, she can!

131
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:31,436
Ooh, I'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hoptoad.

132
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:34,705
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.

133
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,305
Besides, we can't. You know
our magic doesn't work that way.

134
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,839
It can only do good, dear,
to bring joy and happiness.

135
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,045
Well, that would
make me happy.

136
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,688
But there must be some way.

137
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,192
- There is!
- There is?

138
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,354
- What is it, Flora?
- I'm going to--

139
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,025
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Even walls have ears.

140
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,235
Follow me.

141
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,749
I'll turn her into a flower.

142
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,351
- Maleficent?
- Oh, no, dear. The Princess.

143
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,021
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.

144
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:29,861
Don't you see? A flower
can't prick its finger.

145
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,333
- It hasn't any.
- That's right.

146
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:36,395
- She'll be perfectly safe.
- Until Maleficent sends a frost.

147
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:40,170
Yes! Eh-- Oh, dear.

148
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:43,542
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.

149
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,947
You're right. And she'll be
expecting us to do something like that.

150
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:53,182
Oh! Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.

151
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,247
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

152
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,089
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...

153
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:02,860
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.

154
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:06,424
You know, sometimes I don't
think she's really very happy.

155
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:09,301
That's it! Of course.

156
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,967
It's the only thing she can't
understand and won't expect.

157
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,271
Now, now, now, we'll have
to plan it carefully.

158
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:21,283
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, the abandoned one.

159
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,819
Of course, the King
and Queen will object.

160
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,412
But when we explain
it's the only way--

161
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:29,583
Explain what?

162
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:33,493
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...

163
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,793
deep in the forest.

164
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:40,495
- Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them.
- Who are they?

165
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,471
Turn around.

166
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,304
- Eww!
- Why, it's us!

167
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,243
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, "we" us?

168
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,303
- Uh-huh.
- Take care of the baby?

169
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:55,147
- Why not?
- Oh, I'd like that!

170
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,652
Well, y-yes, but w-w-we'd
have to feed it a--

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,178
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.

172
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,249
- Oh, I'd love it.
- Do you really think we can?

173
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,488
If humans can do it,
so can we.

174
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:09,999
- And we'd have our magic to help us.
- That's right.

175
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:13,365
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic!

176
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,768
I'll take those wands
right now.

177
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,330
Oh, better get rid
of those wings too.

178
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:22,538
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?

179
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,343
- Uh-huh.
- B-Bu-- Now, now, we--
we don't know how.

180
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,350
We've never done anything
without magic.

181
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,818
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect--

182
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,821
- But-- But who'll wash?
- And cook?

183
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,983
- Oh, we'll all pitch in.
- I'll take care of the baby.

184
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,960
Let me have it, dear.

185
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:43,021
Come along now. We must tell
their Majesties at once.

186
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,231
- Flora?
- Flora?

187
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:58,547
So the King and his Queen
watched with heavy hearts...

188
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,176
as their most precious
possession, their only child,

189
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,516
disappeared into the night.

190
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,896
Many sad and lonely years
passed by...

191
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:23,530
for King Stefan
and his people.

192
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:27,736
But as the time for the Princess's
sixteenth birthday drew near,

193
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,576
the entire kingdom
began to rejoice.

194
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:35,243
For everyone knew that
as long as Maleficent's domain,

195
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:40,017
the Forbidden Mountains, thundered
with her wrath and frustration,

196
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,024
her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled.

197
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,495
It's incredible!

198
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,471
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her.

199
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:04,906
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!

200
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:08,969
Are you sure you
searched everywhere?

201
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,413
Yes, yes, uh, everywhere.

202
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,473
- We all did.
- Yeah, yeah!

203
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,644
Uh-huh, yeah.

204
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,518
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?

205
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,821
Yeah, we searched mountains,
uh, uh, uh, uh, forests...

206
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,521
and, uh, houses, and, uh--

207
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:27,497
Let me see.
Uh, and all the cradles.

208
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,001
- Cradle?
- Yep, yep.

209
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,196
Every cradle.

210
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:35,796
Cradle?

211
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:38,468
Did you hear that, my pet?

212
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:43,310
All these years, they've
been looking for a baby.

213
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,527
Fools!

214
00:16:57,595 --> 00:17:00,689
Idiots! Imbeciles!

215
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh, they're hopeless.

216
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:21,711
A disgrace to
the forces of evil.

217
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:28,389
My pet, you are my last hope.

218
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,223
Circle far and wide.

219
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,992
Search for a maid
of sixteen...

220
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,397
with hair of sunshine gold...

221
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:39,265
and lips red as the rose.

222
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,898
Go, and do not fail me.

223
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,606
And so, for sixteen long years,

224
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:54,110
the whereabouts of the Princess
remained a mystery.

225
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:57,306
While deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage,

226
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:01,215
the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.

227
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,982
Living like mortals, they had
reared the child as their own...

228
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:08,491
and called her Briar Rose.

229
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,998
On this, her sixteenth birthday,

230
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,329
the good fairies
had planned a party...

231
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,462
and something extra special
for a surprise.

232
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,633
- Well, now, how about this one?
- This is the one I picked.

233
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,767
Oh, she'll look
beautiful in that.

234
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,312
- Now, I thought a few changes here.
- Uh-huh.

235
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,975
- And don't forget a pretty bow.
- Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

236
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,450
- We'll make it blue.
- Oh, no, dear, pink.

237
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,453
- But--
- Of course, we'll need a few pleats.

238
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,921
Yes, but how are we gonna
get her out of the house?

239
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,117
Oh, I'll think of something.

240
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:45,992
Well, and what are
you three dears up to?

241
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:48,190
- Up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?

242
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,256
Uh, uh-- Th-Th-The--
Cr-- Uh--

243
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,666
Well, we-- Uh, we-- W-We--

244
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:56,695
- We want you to pick some berries.
- That's it, berries!

245
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:59,174
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.

246
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:03,373
- But I-I picked berries yesterday.
- Oh, w-we need more, dear.

247
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:06,507
- Lots, lots more.
- Yes!

248
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:11,012
- Now don't hurry back, dear.
- But don't go too far.

249
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:13,522
- And don't speak to strangers.
- Good-bye, dear.

250
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:17,049
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

251
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:22,020
- I wonder if she suspects.
- Of course not.

252
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:25,466
Come on!
Oh, will she be surprised.

253
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:27,629
A real birthday party.

254
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,673
With a real birthday cake.

255
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,641
Yes, and a dress
a princess can be proud of.

256
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,874
- I'll get the wands.
- Yes, you can, uh-- The wands?

257
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:39,745
- Oh, no!
- No magic!

258
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,217
But the sixteen years
are almost over.

259
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:44,481
We're taking no chances.

260
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,490
But I've never baked
a fancy cake.

261
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:49,583
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

262
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,821
I'm going to bake the cake.

263
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,557
- You?
- Oh, she's always wanted to, dear.

264
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:57,066
- And this is her last chance.
- Well--

265
00:19:57,134 --> 00:20:00,934
I'm going to make it fifteen layers
with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

266
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:03,439
And I'm making the dress.

267
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:06,567
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.

268
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:10,444
- Oh-ho-ho, it's simple!
- All you do is follow the book.

269
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:14,382
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.

270
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,943
Well, I still say
we ought to use magic.

271
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:27,363
"Flour, three cups."

272
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,423
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.

273
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:33,368
Oh.

274
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:36,600
One, two, three.

275
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:40,701
- What's that for?
- Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

276
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:44,214
That's for the feet
to go through.

277
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:49,719
- It's pink.
- Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

278
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:53,450
- But I wanted it blue.
- Now, dear,

279
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,754
we decided
pink was her color.

280
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,920
You decided!

281
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,799
"Two eggs. Fold in gently."

282
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:16,505
Fold? Uh, oh, well.

283
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:24,145
I can't breathe!

284
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,917
Let me out of here.

285
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:32,253
- It looks awful.
- That's because it's on you, dear.

286
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,765
"Now, yeast, one tsp."
"Tsp."?

287
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,097
One teaspoon.

288
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:41,160
- Oh, one teaspoon, of course!
- Hmm!

289
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:50,969
Oh, gracious,
how that child has grown.

290
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:54,381
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

291
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:57,181
Just a tiny baby.

292
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,026
- Why, Merryweather.
- What ever is the matter, dear?

293
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,619
After today,
she'll be a princess,

294
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:09,530
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.

295
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,898
- Oh, Flora!
- Now, now, now, now.

296
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:15,700
Well, we-- we all knew
this day had to come.

297
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:18,537
But why did it
have to come so soon?

298
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:22,670
After all, we've had her
for sixteen years.

299
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:25,180
Sixteen wonderful years.

300
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:32,043
Oh, gracious! We're acting
like a lot of ninnies.

301
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:36,058
Come on. She'll be back
before we get started.

302
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,161
You hear that, Samson?

303
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,698
Beautiful.

304
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,033
What is it?

305
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,699
Come on.
Let's find out.

306
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,336
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?

307
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,204
And a few carrots?

308
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,683
Hup, boy!

309
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,708
Whoa!

310
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,062
No carrots.

311
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,443
I wonder

312
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,950
I wonder

313
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:57,317
I wonder why
each little bird

314
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,050
Has a someone

315
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,218
To sing to

316
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:06,491
Sweet things to

317
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:12,002
A gay little love melody

318
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,674
I wonder

319
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,643
I wonder

320
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,341
If my heart keeps singing

321
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:28,146
Will my song go winging

322
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,518
To someone

323
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,150
Who'll find me

324
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:40,687
And bring back a love song

325
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,031
To me

326
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,005
Oh, dear.

327
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:55,944
Why do they still
treat me like a child?

328
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,443
Who?

329
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:03,647
Aunt Flora and Fauna
and Merryweather.

330
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,684
They never want me
to meet anyone.

331
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,027
But you know something?

332
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,329
I fooled them.

333
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:20,029
I have met someone.

334
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,901
Who?

335
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,134
Who? Who?

336
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,180
Oh, a prince.

337
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,314
Well, he's tall
and handsome and--

338
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,378
and so romantic.

339
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,892
Oh, we walk together
and talk together;

340
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:49,160
and just before
we say good-bye,

341
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:52,100
he takes me in his arms...

342
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,401
and then...

343
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,771
I wake up.

344
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:03,242
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

345
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:07,083
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once,

346
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,278
it's sure to come true;

347
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:12,789
and I've seen him
so many times.

348
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,231
You know, Samson,

349
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,100
there was something strange
about that voice.

350
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,766
Too beautiful to be real.

351
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:08,005
Maybe it was some mysterious
being, a wood sprite or a--

352
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:13,148
Here, stop!

353
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,846
Why, it's my dream prince.

354
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:52,016
Your Highness.

355
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,992
You know, I'm really not
supposed to speak to strangers,

356
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,465
but we've met before.

357
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:06,025
I know you

358
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:11,666
I walked with you
once upon a dream

359
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:14,370
I know you

360
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,572
The gleam in your eyes

361
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:19,980
Is so familiar a gleam

362
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,542
Yet I know it's true

363
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:28,388
That visions
are seldom all they seem

364
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,984
But if I know you

365
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,552
I know what you'll do

366
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,862
You'll love me at once

367
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:44,363
The way you did
once upon a dream

368
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,680
But if I know you

369
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,688
I know what you'll do

370
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,589
You'll love me at once

371
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,593
- The way you--
- The way you did

372
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:08,428
Once upon a dream

373
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,358
Oh! Oh!

374
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:15,769
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

375
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,364
Oh, it, uh, wasn't that.

376
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,138
It's just that you're a-- a--

377
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,442
- A stranger?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,244
But don't you remember?
We've met before.

379
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,809
- We-- We have?
- Why, of course. You said so yourself.

380
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,787
Once upon a dream.

381
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:34,449
I know you

382
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:40,293
I walked with you
once upon a dream

383
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:43,128
I know you

384
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,230
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

385
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:55,768
And I know it's true

386
00:31:55,846 --> 00:32:01,648
That visions
are seldom all they seem

387
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,155
But if I know you

388
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:07,986
I know what you'll do

389
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,323
You'll love me at once

390
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:14,091
The way you did

391
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:22,833
Once upon a dream

392
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,638
Who are you?

393
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:33,012
What's your name?

394
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,210
Hmm?

395
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,982
Oh, my name.

396
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,717
Why, it's-- it's--

397
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,624
Oh, no, no, I can't! I--

398
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,958
- Good-bye!
- But when will I see you again?

399
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,693
- Oh, never! Never!
- Never?

400
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,567
- Well, maybe someday.
- When? Tomorrow?

401
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:56,401
Oh, no! This evening!

402
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:59,909
- Where?
- At the cottage in the glen.

403
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,111
There. Ooh!

404
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,085
- Well, what do you think of it?
- Why, it's--

405
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:23,251
It's a very unusual cake,
isn't it?

406
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:27,525
Yes. Of course, it'll be
much stiffer after it's baked.

407
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:31,591
Of course, dear. Um, what
do you think of the dress?

408
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,693
Well, i-it's, uh--

409
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,365
I-It's not exactly the way
it is in the book, is it?

410
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:39,466
Oh, I improved it.

411
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:44,105
But perhaps if I added a few more
ruffles, uh-- Uh, what do you think?

412
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:49,244
Um, I think so.
What do you think, Merryweather?

413
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,255
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense!

414
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:57,919
I think we ought to think of Rose
and what she'll think of this mess.

415
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,589
I still think
what I thunk before.

416
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,224
I'm going to get those wands.

417
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:08,937
You know, I think she's right.

418
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,338
Here they are, good as new.

419
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:15,606
Ah, ah, ah!
C-C-C-C-C-Careful, Merryweather!

420
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,614
Quick, lock the doors.

421
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:23,517
Uh, Fauna, you close the windows.
Oh, block up every cranny.

422
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:27,023
We can't take any chances.

423
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,650
Now, you take care
of the cake.

424
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:32,126
- While I--
- Clean the room, dear.

425
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,653
And I'll make the dress.
Now hurry!

426
00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:37,825
Ooh!

427
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:41,537
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

428
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:44,199
Flora says clean up the room.

429
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,514
And now to make
a lovely dress...

430
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:58,452
fit to grace a fair princess.

431
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:03,658
Eggs, flour, minute--

432
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,891
Just do it like it says here
in the book. I'll put on the candles.

433
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:05,612
Oh, no, not pink.
Make it blue.

434
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,578
Merryweather!
Make it pink.

435
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,124
Make it blue.

436
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:19,252
Oh, pink!

437
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:24,429
Blue.

438
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:18,452
Ohh, now look
what you've done!

439
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:22,185
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

440
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:26,161
- It's Rose.
- She's back. Enough
of this foolishness.

441
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:33,892
Make it pink.
Now hide, quick!

442
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:39,071
- Blue.
- Aunt Flora!

443
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,206
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?

444
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:48,216
Stop, mop.

445
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,714
Aunt Flora! Fauna!

446
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:55,223
Merryweather!

447
00:37:57,294 --> 00:38:01,390
Where is everybody? Oh!

448
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:03,831
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise!

449
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,063
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, you darlings!

450
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,765
This is the happiest day
of my life.

451
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,206
Everything's so wonderful.

452
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:15,403
- Just wait 'til you meet him.
- Him?

453
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:19,506
- Rose!
- Y-You've met some stranger?

454
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,950
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.

455
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,249
- You have?
- Where?

456
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:27,756
Once upon a dream.

457
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:30,122
I know you

458
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:36,189
I walked with you
once upon a dream

459
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:38,860
- She's in love!
- Oh, no.

460
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:41,267
This is terrible.

461
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:44,603
Why? After all,
I am sixteen.

462
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:48,269
- It isn't that, dear.
- You're already betrothed.

463
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:51,075
- Betrothed?
- Since the day you were born.

464
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:55,107
- To Prince Phillip, dear.
- But that's impossible.

465
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:58,120
How could I marry a prince?
I'd have to be--

466
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:00,713
- A princess.
- And you are, dear.

467
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,918
Princess Aurora.

468
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:06,793
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.

469
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:09,331
But-- But I can't.

470
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:12,766
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.

471
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:17,967
I'm sorry, child, but you must
never see that young man again.

472
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,067
Oh, no! No!

473
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:25,342
I can't believe it! No! No!

474
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:33,146
And we thought
she'd be so happy.

475
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,171
No sign of her yet, Hubert.

476
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,438
'Course not. It's a good
half hour 'til sunset.

477
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,277
Ah, excellent bird.

478
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:06,087
Oh, now, come, man!

479
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,589
Buck up! Battle's over!

480
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:11,126
Girl's as good as here.

481
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:14,391
I'm sorry, Hubert,
but after sixteen years...

482
00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:16,830
of worrying, never knowing--

483
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:19,663
The past! All in the past.

484
00:40:25,741 --> 00:40:29,177
Tonight, we toast
the future...

485
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:32,839
with something I've been saving
for sixteen years.

486
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,242
Here. To the future!

487
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,914
Right, Hubert.
To the future.

488
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,256
- Skumps, skumps
- Skumps

489
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:50,992
- A toast to this night
- The outlook is rosy

490
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:52,897
The future is bright

491
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:57,029
Our children will marry
Our kingdoms unite

492
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,596
Skumps, skumps

493
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:02,269
Skumps

494
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:08,448
Ah, excellent vintage.

495
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:17,250
- And now, to the new home, eh?
- New home?

496
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:19,794
Children need a nest
of their own, what?

497
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:23,263
Place to raise
their little brood, eh?

498
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:25,596
Well, I suppose in time--

499
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,295
Of course! To the home!

500
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,133
- Skumps
- Skumps

501
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:33,436
- A toast to the home
- One grander by far

502
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:35,477
Than a palace in Rome

503
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:39,537
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
That glass was all foam.

504
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:42,106
Skumps, skumps

505
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:44,550
Skumps

506
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,921
The plans!

507
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:02,926
Well, what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.

508
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:06,907
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.

509
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,240
You-- You mean, you're
building it already?

510
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:14,009
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

511
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:18,576
Tomorrow? But, Hubert,
they're not even married yet.

512
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:21,487
Take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!

513
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:25,288
Now hold on, Hubert. I haven't
even seen my daughter yet,

514
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,328
and you're taking her
away from me.

515
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:29,762
- Getting my Phillip, aren't you?
- Yes, but--

516
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:32,095
Want to see our grandchildren,
don't we?

517
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,795
- Of course, but, uh--
- There's no time to lose.

518
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,203
Getting on in years.

519
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:41,709
- To the wedding!
- Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

520
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:45,508
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.

521
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:51,281
- Well?
- Well, it-- it may come
as quite a shock.

522
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:54,880
Shock? My Phillip, a shock?

523
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:57,653
What's wrong
with my Phillip?

524
00:42:57,726 --> 00:43:00,194
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant--

525
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:03,390
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?

526
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:06,559
- Now, now--
- I'm not so sure...

527
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:09,399
my son likes your daughter!

528
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:12,963
- Now, see here.
- I'm not so sure my grandchildren...

529
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,475
want you for a grandfather!

530
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:18,240
Why, you, you unreasonable,

531
00:43:18,313 --> 00:43:21,544
- Huh? Who? Uh--
- pompous, blustering, old windbag!

532
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,916
Unreasonable, pompous--
On guard, sir!

533
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:27,547
I warn you, Hubert,
this means war.

534
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:30,820
Forward! For honor!
For country!

535
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:33,827
Oh! Ohh!

536
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:41,734
- Hey.
- What's this all about, anyway?

537
00:43:41,803 --> 00:43:45,569
No-- Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing!

538
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:48,269
Eh, children bound to fall
in love with each other.

539
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:51,744
Yeah. Precisely.
And as for grandchildren,

540
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:55,715
I'll have the royal woodcarvers
start work on the cradle tomorrow.

541
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:58,719
Splendid!
King-size, of course.

542
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,915
Certainly.
To the woodcarvers guild.

543
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,739
His Royal Highness,
Prince Phillip!

544
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:22,276
Phillip?

545
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:30,910
Oh, Phillip! Phillip!

546
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:33,079
Phillip! Ho, Phillip!

547
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:41,487
H-Hurry, boy, hurry!

548
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:43,622
Uh, change into
something suitable.

549
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:46,098
Can't meet your future bride
looking like that.

550
00:44:46,168 --> 00:44:49,604
- But I have met her, Father.
- Yeah-- You have? Where?

551
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:51,969
Once upon a dream.

552
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,669
Oh, Phillip! Stop it!
Stop that! Wa-- Phillip!

553
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:57,678
Phi-- Put me down!

554
00:44:57,746 --> 00:45:00,943
Now, what's all
this "dream" nonsense?

555
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:03,780
It wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.

556
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:07,310
Oh, the Princess Aurora? Good
heavens, we must tell Stefan.

557
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:10,358
- Why, this is the most amazing--
- I-I didn't say it was Aurora.

558
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:12,359
You most certainly did.
You-- You said--

559
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:15,828
I said I met the girl I was going
to marry. I don't know who she was.

560
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:19,458
- A peasant girl, I suppose.
- A-- A peasant g-girl?

561
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:21,695
You-- You're going
to marry a g--

562
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,830
Why, Phillip, you're joking.

563
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:31,768
Isn't he?

564
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:35,146
Oh! Y-Y-You can't
do this to me.

565
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:40,177
Give up the throne, the kingdom,
for some-- some nobody?

566
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,689
By Harry, I won't have it!

567
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:46,284
You're a prince, and you're
going to marry a princess!

568
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:48,454
Now, Father,
you're living in the past.

569
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,555
This is the fourteenth century.
Nowadays--

570
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:55,069
Nowadays I'm still the king! And I
command you to come to your senses!

571
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,070
- And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!

572
00:45:57,138 --> 00:46:00,904
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you-- No, no!

573
00:46:00,976 --> 00:46:03,570
No, no, Phillip!
Stop! Come back!

574
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:05,909
Oh, Phillip!

575
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:13,253
Phillip!

576
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:37,567
How-- How will I
ever tell Stefan?

577
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:25,742
Come along now.

578
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:39,833
All right. In here, dear.

579
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:46,340
- Oh!
- Bolt the door, Merryweather.

580
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:49,342
Fauna, pull the drapes.

581
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,211
And now, dear,
if you'll just sit here.

582
00:47:54,282 --> 00:47:58,844
This one last gift,
dear child, for thee,

583
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,980
the symbol of thy royalty:

584
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:05,719
a crown to wear
in grace and beauty,

585
00:48:05,793 --> 00:48:08,887
as is thy right
and royal duty.

586
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:16,634
- Now, dear--
- Come.

587
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:22,574
Let her have
a few moments alone.

588
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:24,908
It's that boy she met.

589
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,708
What ever are we going to do?

590
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:12,551
Ohh! I don't see why she
has to marry any old prince.

591
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:15,886
Now, that's not for us
to decide, dear.

592
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,998
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.

593
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:33,973
- Well, why don't we?
- Listen!

594
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,306
Maleficent! Rose!

595
00:49:36,378 --> 00:49:38,346
- Rose!
- Rose!

596
00:49:38,413 --> 00:49:41,507
- Oh, why did we leave her alone?
- No! No!
- Rose!

597
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:43,517
Rose!

598
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:06,301
- Here.
- Rose!
- Rose!

599
00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:08,535
- Rose! Rose, where are you?
- Rose!
- Rose!

600
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,204
Where are you?

601
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:19,853
Rose! Rose! Rose!

602
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:34,900
- Rose! Rose!
- Rose!

603
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:47,171
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Rose!

604
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:01,990
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Don't touch anything!

605
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:04,088
Anything! Anything!

606
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:08,101
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say.

607
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,868
You poor, simple fools,

608
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:18,776
thinking you could defeat me.

609
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:22,283
Me, the mistress of all evil!

610
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:27,587
Well, here's your
precious princess.

611
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:37,286
- Rose!
- Oh, Rose!

612
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:42,393
Oh, I'll never
forgive myself.

613
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,303
We're all to blame.

614
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:57,816
Stefan, th-there's-- there's something
important I have to tell you.

615
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:59,877
Uh, not now, Hubert.

616
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:02,047
But-- But it's a-about Phillip.

617
00:52:02,123 --> 00:52:05,286
Phillip? Oh, yes,
of course, Phillip.

618
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,296
- Why, where is the boy?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

619
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:11,396
- Well, send for him immediately.
- But--

620
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:13,558
Shh!

621
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:17,597
The sun has set.

622
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:21,004
Make ready to welcome
your princess.

623
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:25,572
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.

624
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,540
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.

625
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,203
- They're not going to.
- They aren't?

626
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:38,411
- But--
- We'll put them all to sleep
until Rose awakens.

627
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:48,154
Come.

628
00:53:55,735 --> 00:54:02,038
Sleeping Beauty fair

629
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:07,203
Gold of sunshine

630
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,273
In your hair

631
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:15,412
Lips that shame

632
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:19,288
The red, red rose

633
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:24,190
Dreaming of true love

634
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:30,203
In slumber repose

635
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,400
One day

636
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:38,467
He will come

637
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:47,249
Riding out of the dawn

638
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,312
And you'll awaken

639
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,327
To love's first kiss

640
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,795
'Til then

641
00:54:57,864 --> 00:55:00,389
Sleeping Beauty

642
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:04,596
Sleep on

643
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:09,737
One day you'll awaken

644
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,438
To love's first kiss

645
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:18,008
'Til then

646
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:22,817
Sleeping Beauty

647
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:28,521
Sleep on

648
00:55:36,669 --> 00:55:39,832
Well, just been talking
to Phillip.

649
00:55:39,906 --> 00:55:44,639
Seems he's fallen in love
with some-- peasant girl.

650
00:55:44,711 --> 00:55:47,271
Peasant girl?

651
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:50,612
Yes? Yes?

652
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:53,618
The peasant girl? Who is she?
Where did he meet her?

653
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:57,486
Uh, just some
peasant girl he met--

654
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,491
Where? Where?

655
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,552
Once upon a dream.

656
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,657
Once upon a dre--
Rose! Prince Phillip!

657
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:10,396
Oh! Oh!

658
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:16,539
Come on. We've got to
get back to the cottage.

659
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:06,184
Come in.

660
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,885
Well!

661
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:41,392
This is a pleasant surprise.

662
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,157
I set my trap for a peasant,
and lo,

663
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,391
I catch a prince.

664
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:52,629
Away with him.

665
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:55,902
But gently, my pets.
Gently.

666
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,277
I have plans
for our royal guest.

667
00:58:34,513 --> 00:58:35,980
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

668
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:38,778
She's got Prince Phillip!

669
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,786
At the Forbidden Mountain.

670
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:44,345
But we can't--
we can't go there.

671
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:48,359
We can, and we must!

672
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:12,595
What a pity Prince Phillip
can't be here...

673
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,469
to enjoy the celebration.

674
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:21,445
Come. We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.

675
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,351
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

676
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:21,193
Why so melancholy?

677
01:02:21,266 --> 01:02:24,565
A wondrous future
lies before you.

678
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:27,537
You, the destined hero...

679
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:30,870
of a charming fairy tale
come true.

680
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:39,405
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

681
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:42,112
And in yonder topmost tower,

682
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:44,883
dreaming of her true love,

683
01:02:44,956 --> 01:02:47,891
the Princess Aurora.

684
01:02:49,194 --> 01:02:52,391
But see the gracious
whim of fate.

685
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:55,796
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...

686
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:59,803
who won the heart of
our noble prince but yesterday.

687
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,004
She is indeed
most wondrous fair,

688
01:03:08,246 --> 01:03:11,079
gold of sunshine
in her hair,

689
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:15,586
lips that shame
the red, red rose.

690
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:19,919
In ageless sleep,
she finds repose.

691
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:24,787
The years roll by.

692
01:03:24,862 --> 01:03:29,925
But a hundred years to
a steadfast heart are but a day.

693
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:33,801
And now, the gates
of a dungeon part,

694
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:38,501
and our prince
is free to go his way.

695
01:03:38,576 --> 01:03:42,603
Off he rides
on his noble steed--

696
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:47,014
a valiant figure,
straight and tall--

697
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:49,315
to wake his love...

698
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:52,823
with love's first kiss...

699
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:58,123
and prove that true love
conquers all!

700
01:04:01,532 --> 01:04:04,296
Why, you, you, y--

701
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:11,471
Come, my pet. Let us leave
our noble prince...

702
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:14,978
with these happy thoughts.

703
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:21,746
A most gratifying day.

704
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:29,688
For the first time
in sixteen years,

705
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:32,924
I shall sleep well.

706
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:51,173
Shh! No time to explain.

707
01:05:00,091 --> 01:05:02,855
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love...

708
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:05,953
may be barred by still
many more dangers...

709
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,260
which you alone
will have to face.

710
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:13,202
So arm thyself with this
enchanted shield of virtue...

711
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:16,536
and this mighty
sword of truth,

712
01:05:16,607 --> 01:05:20,873
for these weapons of righteousness
will triumph over evil.

713
01:05:20,945 --> 01:05:23,607
Now, come. We must hurry.

714
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:12,788
Phillip, watch out!

715
01:07:09,253 --> 01:07:13,485
Silence! You, tell
those fools to--

716
01:07:13,557 --> 01:07:16,993
No! No!

717
01:07:20,464 --> 01:07:23,661
Watch out, Phillip!

718
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:33,673
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

719
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:49,024
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb,

720
01:07:49,093 --> 01:07:52,551
borne through the skies
on a fog of doom!

721
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:56,122
Now go with a curse
and serve me well.

722
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,034
'Round Stefan's castle
cast my spell.

723
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:53,517
No! It cannot be!

724
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:03,288
Now shall you deal
with me, O Prince,

725
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:06,097
and all the powers of hell!

726
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,975
Up! Up this way!

727
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:12,497
Now, sword of truth,
fly swift and sure...

728
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:16,061
that evil die
and good endure!

729
01:11:58,341 --> 01:12:00,434
Ehhh-- Oh, oh, uh--

730
01:12:00,509 --> 01:12:04,605
Forgive me, Hubert.
Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh--

731
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,648
You, uh, were saying?

732
01:12:06,716 --> 01:12:10,652
Huh? I-I was?
Oh! Oh, yes.

733
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,487
Well, after all, Stefan,
this is the fourteenth century.

734
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,823
Yes. You, uh, you said that
a moment ago.

735
01:12:18,895 --> 01:12:21,955
Well, to come
right to the point,

736
01:12:22,031 --> 01:12:24,829
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry--

737
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:53,325
It's Aurora! She's here!

738
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,530
A-And-And-And Phillip!

739
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:17,518
Wh-- What does this mean, boy?

740
01:13:17,586 --> 01:13:20,350
I-I don't under--

741
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:25,957
B-Bu-- But-But, uh--

742
01:13:31,933 --> 01:13:34,527
I-I don't understand.

743
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:01,988
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?

744
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:05,897
Oh, I just love
happy endings.

745
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:09,835
Yes, I do too-- t--

746
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:12,169
Blue!

747
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:19,436
- Pink.
- I know you

748
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:24,816
- I walked with you once upon a dream
- Blue.

749
01:14:24,886 --> 01:14:27,446
I know you

750
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:29,490
The gleam in your eyes

751
01:14:29,558 --> 01:14:32,823
Is so familiar a gleam

752
01:14:32,894 --> 01:14:35,863
Yet I know it's true

753
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:40,766
That visions are seldom
all they seem

754
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:43,201
But if I know you

755
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,432
I know what you'll do

756
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:47,498
You'll love me at once

757
01:14:47,576 --> 01:14:49,669
The way you did once

758
01:14:49,744 --> 01:14:52,304
Upon

759
01:14:52,380 --> 01:15:00,879
A dream
