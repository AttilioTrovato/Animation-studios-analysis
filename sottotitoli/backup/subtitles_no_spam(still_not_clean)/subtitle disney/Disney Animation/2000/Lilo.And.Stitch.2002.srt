1
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,864
Read the charges.

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,491
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

3
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,828
lead scientist of Galaxy
Defense Industries,

4
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,372
you stand before this council

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,294
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

6
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,510
How do you plead?

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,054
Not guilty!

8
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:00,684
My experiments are only theoretical,
completely within legal boundaries.

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,064
We believe you actually
created something.

10
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,399
Created something? Ha!

11
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,195
But that would be
irresponsible and unethical.

12
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,322
I would never, ever...

13
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,742
make more than one.

14
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,668
What is that monstrosity?

15
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,462
Monstrosity?

16
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:33,467
What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

17
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,471
I call it experiment 6-2-6.

18
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,308
He is bulletproof, fireproof

19
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,103
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

20
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:49,233
He can see in the dark and move
objects 3,000 times his size.

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:54,238
His only instinct, to destroy
everything he touches!

22
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,033
So, it is a monster.

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,368
Hey, just a little one.

24
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,621
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!

25
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:07,459
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:13,799
Experiment 6-2-6, give us some
sign you understand any of this.

27
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,470
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

28
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,394
Meega, nala kweesta!

29
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,648
So naughty!

30
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,819
I didn't teach it that.

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,655
Place that idiot
scientist under arrest!

32
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:41,535
I prefer to be called
evil genius!

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,662
And as for that abomination...

34
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,291
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

35
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,210
It has no place among us.

36
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,422
Captain Gantu, take him away.

37
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,506
With pleasure.

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,821
Uncomfortable?

39
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,199
Oh, good!

40
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,453
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,623
So, relax, enjoy the trip,

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,042
and don't get any ideas.

43
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,503
These guns are locked onto
your genetic signature.

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,964
They won't shoot anyone but you.

45
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,300
Ow! Why, you...

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,554
May I remind the Captain
that he is on duty.

47
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,724
Secure the cell!

48
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,309
Aye, Captain.

49
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,731
Captain on deck.

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,651
All ahead full.

51
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,950
Does this look infected
to you?

52
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,980
Quiet, you.

53
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,944
- Gunfire in the cell bay!
- Open a channel.

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,747
He's loose on Deck C!

55
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,040
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

56
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,384
Security, converge on Door 7!

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:07,097
Deadly force authorized.
Fire on sight! Fire on sight!

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,598
There he is!

59
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,271
Security to bridge.

60
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,064
It's in the ventilation system.

61
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,902
He's headed for the power...

62
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,196
grid.

63
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,284
What was that?

64
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,828
I don't think he's
on the ship anymore.

65
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,205
Confirmed. He's taken
a police cruiser.

66
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,543
Yeah. He took the red one.

67
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,360
That's it!
We got it. We got it!

68
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,532
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.

69
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,659
He's engaged his H-drive!

70
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,037
Warning, guidance is not
functional.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,040
Pursuit Commander, that crazy
trog is about to make a jump!

72
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,626
Break formation!
Get clear of that ship!

73
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,671
Navigation failure.
Do not engage hyper...

74
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,392
Get me Galactic Control.

75
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,561
Where is he?

76
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,063
He's still in hyperspace.

77
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,398
Where will he exit?

78
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,732
Calculating now.

79
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,903
Quadrant 17, section
0-0-5, area 51.

80
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,572
A planet called Ee-arth.

81
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,534
I want an expert on this
planet in here now!

82
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,370
What is that?

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,330
Water. Most of the
planet is covered in it.

84
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,084
He won't survive in water. His
molecular density is too great.

85
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,173
No...

86
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,763
Of course.

87
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,266
How much time do we have?

88
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,894
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,646
Oh, we have to gas the planet.

90
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,941
Hold it! Hold everything!

91
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,777
Earth is a protected
wildlife reserve.

92
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,989
Yeah. We've been using it to
rebuild the mosquito population

93
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,367
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

94
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,245
Am I to assume you
are the expert?

95
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,039
Oh, I don't know about expert.

96
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,668
Agent Pleakley at your service.

97
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,545
Can we not simply
destroy the island?

98
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,338
No! Crazyhead!

99
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,633
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms,

100
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,303
have colonies all
over that planet.

101
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,637
Are they intelligent?

102
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,140
No, but they're very delicate.

103
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,267
In fact, every time an
asteroid strikes their planet,

104
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,269
they have to begin life
all over.

105
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,856
It's fascinating, isn't it? With
this, I've been able to study...

106
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,984
What if our military
forces just landed there?

107
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,694
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

108
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,906
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

109
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,992
Landing there would create mass
mayhem and planet-wide panic!

110
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,995
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 6-2-6

111
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,622
that we do not possess!

112
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,084
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would
you send for his extraction?

113
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,546
Does he have a brother?

114
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,882
Close grandmother, perhaps?

115
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,763
Friendly cousin?

116
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,681
Neighbor with a beard?

117
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,871
He got away?

118
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,374
I'm sure this comes as
no surprise to you.

119
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,877
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

120
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,672
Which is precisely why you
must now bring him back.

121
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,048
What? Me?

122
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,050
And to reward you,

123
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,888
we are willing to trade your
freedom for his capture.

124
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,227
6-2-6 will not come easily.

125
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,481
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...

126
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,277
Plasma cannon granted. Do we
have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

127
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,363
But it's a delicate planet!

128
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,949
Who's going to control him?

129
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,951
You will.

130
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,370
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...

131
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,622
You're not joking!

132
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,835
So, tell me, my
little one-eyed one,

133
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,548
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

134
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:57,095
has my monstrosity
been unleashed?

135
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,077
One, two, three, four...

136
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,412
Stop. Stop.

137
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,957
Lilo, why are you all wet?

138
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,751
It's sandwich day.

139
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,257
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the
fish a peanut butter sandwich.

140
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,759
Pudge is a fish?

141
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,428
And today we were out
of peanut butter!

142
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,891
So I asked my sister what to give
him and she said a tuna sandwich.

143
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,268
I can't give Pudge tuna!

144
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,354
Do you know what tuna is?

145
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,857
- Fish?
- It's fish!

146
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,944
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

147
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,113
I'm late because I had
to go to the store

148
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,242
and get peanut butter 'cause
all we have is stinkin' tuna!

149
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,454
Lilo, Lilo, why is this
so important?

150
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,664
Pudge controls the weather.

151
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,418
You're crazy.

152
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,256
Please! Please!

153
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,300
Everybody calm down!

154
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,511
Girls...

155
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,682
- Lilo...
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

156
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,184
I won't do it again!

157
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,478
Maybe we should call
your sister.

158
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,981
No! I'll be good!
I want to dance.

159
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,067
I practiced.

160
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,402
I just want to dance.

161
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,238
I practiced.

162
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,366
Ooh, she bit me.

163
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,501
I called your sister.

164
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,420
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

165
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,507
We'll try again on Sunday.

166
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,432
Does this look infected to you?

167
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah.

168
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,229
You better not have rabies.

169
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,858
If you have rabies, the dogcatcher
is going to have to cut...

170
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,652
Are you going to play dolls?

171
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,196
You don't have a doll.

172
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,447
This is Scrump.

173
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,868
I made her, but her
head is too big.

174
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,371
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset

175
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,332
because she only has a
few more days to...

176
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,228
Lilo!

177
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,872
Lilo?

178
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,322
Oh, no.

179
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,743
You better be home.

180
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,832
Hey! Watch where you're going!

181
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,334
Stupidhead!

182
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,844
Oh, Lilo!

183
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,430
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

184
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,640
Go away.

185
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,603
Lilo? We don't have
time for this.

186
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,689
Leave me alone to die.

187
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,568
Come on, Lilo that social worker's
going to be here any minute!

188
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,049
You are so finished
when I get in there!

189
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,724
Oh, I'm going to stuff you in
the blender, push puree,

190
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,143
then bake you into a pie and
feed it to the social worker!

191
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,349
And when he says, mmm, this is great.
What's your secret? I'm going to say...

192
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,402
Love and nurturing.

193
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,654
Hi...

194
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,865
You must be the...

195
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,283
The stupidhead.

196
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,080
Oh, you know, I'm
really sorry about that

197
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,524
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

198
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:43,960
I can pay for that.

199
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,503
It's a rental.

200
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,296
Are you the guardian
in question?

201
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,841
Yes. I'm Nani.

202
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,343
Nice to meet you, Mister...

203
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,469
Bubbles.

204
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,638
Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange...

205
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,931
Yes, I know.

206
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,559
Are you going to
invite me in, Nani?

207
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,312
I thought we could sit
out here and talk.

208
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,356
I don't think so.

209
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,483
Right...

210
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,486
This way.

211
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,540
Wait here.

212
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,590
Hey!

213
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,303
So, lemonade?

214
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,306
Do you often leave your
sister home alone?

215
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,766
No. Never.

216
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,644
Well, except for just now.

217
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,622
I had to run to the store
to get some...

218
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,445
You left the stove on
while you were out?

219
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,572
Low heat! Just a simmer.

220
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,366
It's coming along great.

221
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,786
I found that this morning.

222
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,996
Lilo! There you are.

223
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,626
Honeyface, this is Mr. Bubbles.

224
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,419
Nice to meet you.

225
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,505
Your knuckles say Cobra.

226
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,885
Cobra Bubbles.

227
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,180
You don't look like
a social worker.

228
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,432
I'm a special classification.

229
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,935
Did you ever kill anyone?

230
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,605
We're getting off the subject.

231
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,441
Let's talk about you.
Are you happy?

232
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm adjusted. I eat
four food groups

233
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,825
and look both ways before
crossing the street

234
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,744
and take long naps
and get disciplined.

235
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,955
Disciplined?

236
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:48,417
Yeah. She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.

237
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,002
- With bricks.
- No...

238
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,170
Bricks?

239
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:52,713
In a pillowcase.

240
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,508
Okay! That's enough
sugar for you.

241
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,802
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie.

242
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,973
The other social workers just
thought she was a scream.

243
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,266
Thirsty?

244
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,979
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

245
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,356
in which you have found
yourself.

246
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,320
I am the one they call
when things go wrong,

247
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,199
and things have
indeed gone wrong.

248
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,011
My friends need to be punished.

249
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,143
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

250
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,394
Yep.

251
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,565
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

252
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,861
You have three days
to change my mind.

253
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,706
Lilo!

254
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,819
Why didn't you wait
at the school?

255
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,363
You were supposed to wait there!

256
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,447
Lilo!

257
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,618
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

258
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,703
Answer me!

259
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,789
- No!
- No, you don't understand?

260
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,916
- No!
- No, what?

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,751
No!

262
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,928
You're such a pain!

263
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,139
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?

264
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,892
At least a rabbit would
behave better than you!

265
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,980
Go ahead! Then you'll be happy because
it'll be smarter than me too!

266
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,898
And quieter!

267
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,734
You'll like it, 'cause
it's stinky, like you!

268
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,946
Go to your room!

269
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm already in my room!

270
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,881
Hey.

271
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,553
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

272
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,140
We're a broken family,
aren't we?

273
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,642
No.

274
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,062
Maybe, a little.

275
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,191
Maybe a lot.

276
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,319
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

277
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,155
We're sisters. It's our job.

278
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,157
Yeah, well, from now on...

279
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,993
I like you better as
a sister than a mom.

280
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,662
Yeah?

281
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,416
And you like me better as a
sister than a rabbit, right?

282
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,630
Yes.

283
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,632
Yes, I do.

284
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,636
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

285
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,013
You hit her?

286
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,639
Before I bit her.

287
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,684
You bit her.
Lilo, you shouldn't...

288
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,728
People treat me different.

289
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,899
They just don't know
what to say.

290
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,067
I'll tell you what.

291
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,778
If you promise not
to fight anymore

292
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,616
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

293
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,911
Tuesdays and bank
holidays would be good.

294
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,537
Yeah? Would that be good?

295
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,083
Oh! My camera's full again.

296
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,919
Aren't they beautiful?

297
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,348
A falling star!

298
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,023
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!

299
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,983
Can't you go any faster?

300
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,528
Oh, no! Gravity is
increasing on me.

301
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,987
No, it's not!

302
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,949
It is too, Lilo. The same
thing happened yesterday.

303
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,786
You rotten sister! Your
butt is crushing me!

304
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,579
Why do you act so weird?

305
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,669
It's me again.

306
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:47,925
I need someone to be my friend.
Someone who won't run away.

307
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:53,431
Maybe send me an angel.
The nicest angel you have.

308
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,147
What we when hit?

309
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,486
There it is. It stay
jammed under the fender.

310
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,740
We better call somebody.

311
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,676
We're looking for something
that can defend itself...

312
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,305
Something that won't die.
Something sturdy, you know?

313
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,556
Like a lobster.

314
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,351
Lilo, you lolo. Do we
have a lobster door?

315
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,145
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.

316
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,446
So nice to see your pretty
face again!

317
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,572
Jumba?

318
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,117
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

319
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,247
The kennel's back this way.

320
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,123
Go. Pick someone out.

321
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:51,006
Hello?

322
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,511
Are there any aminals in here?

323
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,728
Hello!

324
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,699
Hi.

325
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,916
Oh, yes. All of our dogs
are adoptable.

326
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,043
Except that one!

327
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,420
What is that thing?

328
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,131
A dog, I think. But it
was dead this morning.

329
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,757
It was dead this morning?

330
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,427
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

331
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,096
I like him!
Come here, boy.

332
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,145
Wouldn't you like a
different dog?

333
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,439
We have better dogs, dear.

334
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,192
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.

335
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,613
Dogs can't talk, dear.

336
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,697
He did.

337
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,199
Does it have to be this dog?

338
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,789
Yes, he's good. I can tell.

339
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,208
You'll have to think of
a name for him.

340
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,086
His name is Stitch.

341
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,072
Now, that's not a real name...

342
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,384
in Iceland, but here,
it's a good name.

343
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,886
Stitch it is.

344
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,554
And there's a two
dollar license fee.

345
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,306
I want to buy him!

346
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,516
Can I borrow two dollars?

347
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,982
He's all yours.

348
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,652
You're all mine.

349
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,861
Well, what's he doing?

350
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,198
Keep quiet.
He's listening for us.

351
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,953
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...

352
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,921
Why don't you run?

353
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,966
Coming! I'm coming!

354
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,259
Stop!

355
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,097
I have just determined this
situation to be far too hazardous!

356
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,682
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

357
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,936
No! That girl is a part of
the mosquito food chain.

358
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,188
Here! Educate yourself.

359
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,860
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low, even for you!

360
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,032
Tear him apart with all
both my bare hands!

361
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,575
Have you lost your mind?

362
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,828
What is it, Stitch?

363
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,996
We cannot be seen!

364
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,375
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

365
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,380
You can't shoot, and
you can't be seen.

366
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,423
Look at you!

367
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,216
You look like a monster.

368
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,759
We have to blend in.

369
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,846
Okay, I got to get to work.

370
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,515
Stick around town and stay
out of the roads, okay?

371
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,559
I'll meet you at 1:00.

372
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,737
Okay, I guess we should be going.

373
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,865
What about Stitch?

374
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,165
My friends!

375
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,045
What do you want?

376
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:22,009
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your
hair and punched you in the face.

377
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,219
Apology not accepted.

378
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,972
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

379
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,559
I got a new dog.
His name is Stitch.

380
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,772
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

381
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,443
Eww! Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!

383
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,116
Somebody do something!

384
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,910
Oh, great! He's loose.

385
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,537
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

386
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,457
He will be irresistibly
drawn to large cities

387
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,125
where he will back up sewers,

388
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,920
reverse street signs and
steal everyone's left shoe.

389
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,817
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

390
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,489
Are you okay?

391
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,191
Hey, over here, little buddy.

392
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,731
When you're ready to give
up just let us know, heh?

393
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,568
Yeah!

394
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,023
This is you.

395
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,651
This is your badness level.

396
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,154
It's unusually high for
someone your size.

397
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,697
We have to fix that.

398
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,574
Ay-yi-yi, Lilo!

399
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,618
Your dog cannot sit
at the table.

400
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,704
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.

401
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,873
Oh, you didn't even eat
your sweet potato.

402
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,416
I thought you liked them.

403
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,793
Desserts!

404
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,007
David!

405
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,801
I got a new dog.

406
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:54,062
You sure it's a dog?

407
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,391
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

408
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,205
Hey...

409
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,489
Howzit, Nani?

410
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,617
Did you catch fire again?

411
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,494
Nah, just the stage.

412
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,373
Listen, I was wondering if you're
not doing anything this...

413
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,543
David, I told you, I can't.
I...

414
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,005
I got a lot to deal with
right now.

415
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,424
I know. I just figured you
might need some time...

416
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,634
You smell like a lawn mower.

417
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,595
Look, I got to go.

418
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,848
The kid at Table 3's
throwing poi again.

419
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,058
Maybe some other time, okay?

420
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,144
Don't worry.

421
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,521
She likes your butt
and fancy hair.

422
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,940
I know. I read her diary.

423
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,608
She thinks it's fancy?

424
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,209
Aha! Look what I find!
Get restraints!

425
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,962
- Right.
- Take that! Hurry!

426
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,339
Hold still just a...

427
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,690
Hey, Nani!

428
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,736
Is that your dog?

429
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,071
All is well.

430
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,406
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

431
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,076
Oh, your head looks swollen.

432
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,244
Actually, she's just ugly.

433
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,664
Darling. He's joking.

434
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,957
Ugly, look at me...

435
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:49,002
This is not working out.

436
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,421
But...

437
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,923
Yeah?

438
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,884
Well, who wants to
work at this stupid...

439
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,677
fakey luau anyway.

440
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,679
Come on, Lilo.

441
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,938
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

442
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,607
Nah. The manager's
a vampire

443
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,236
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

444
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,779
I knew it.

445
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,617
This is a great home.
You'll like it a lot.

446
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,994
See?

447
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,454
Lilo...

448
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,705
Comfy.

449
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,250
- Hey!
- Hey!

450
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,626
What is the matter with you?

451
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,420
Be careful of the little angel!

452
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,173
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.

453
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,550
We just have to take
him back.

454
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,219
He's just cranky because
it's his bedtime.

455
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,595
He's creepy, Lilo.

456
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,515
I won't sleep while he's
loose in the house.

457
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,310
You're loose in the house all
the time and I sleep just fine!

458
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,063
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop that, Stitch!

459
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,399
Hey!

460
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,610
Look at him, Lilo.

461
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,029
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

462
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,948
We have to take him back.

463
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,617
He was an orphan and
we adopted him!

464
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,327
What about ohana?

465
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,204
He hasn't been here that long.

466
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,958
Neither have I.
Dad said ohana means family.

467
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,256
Ohana means family.

468
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,382
Family means...

469
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,426
Nobody gets left behind.

470
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,594
Or?

471
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,970
Or forgotten.

472
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,349
I know. I know. I hate it when
you use ohana against me.

473
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,773
Don't worry,
you can sleep right next to me.

474
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,907
Look how curious the puppy is.

475
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,202
This is my room, and
this is your bed.

476
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,788
This is your dolly and bottle.

477
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,999
See? Doesn't spill.

478
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,251
I filled it with coffee.

479
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,879
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

480
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,674
Hey! That's mine!

481
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,887
Down!

482
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,436
Be careful of that! You don't
touch this! Don't ever touch it!

483
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,613
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.

484
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,660
No! That's from my blue period.

485
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,959
There.

486
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,254
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

487
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,257
Why not try and make
something for a change?

488
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,775
Wow. San Francisco.

489
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,329
Save me!

490
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,711
No more caffeine for you.

491
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,008
This little girl is wasting
her time.

492
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,886
6-2-6 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

493
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,350
Push that over.

494
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,313
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

495
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,274
- Say, I want to try it on.
- No!

496
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,525
Share! Let me try it!

497
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,194
Hey! Ow! You're just
jealous 'cause I'm pretty!

498
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,866
Don't move. A mosquito has
chosen me as her perch.

499
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,076
She's so beautiful.

500
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,954
Look, another one.

501
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,916
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

502
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,168
And they like me!

503
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,837
They're nuzzling my
flesh with their noses.

504
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,173
Now, they're, they're...

505
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,181
I think it might be a koala.
An evil koala.

506
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,682
I can't even pet it.

507
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,018
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

508
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,608
Hello?

509
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,859
Nani?

510
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,029
Hello?

511
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,573
Are you there?

512
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,372
- Now, this is interesting.
- What?

513
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,208
6-2-6 was designed
to be a monster

514
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,127
but now he has
nothing to destroy.

515
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,383
You see, I never gave
him a greater purpose.

516
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,428
What must it be like
to have nothing...

517
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,849
Not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

518
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,968
That's the Ugly Duckling.

519
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:34,806
See? He's sad because he's all
alone and nobody wants him

520
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,434
but on this page, his
family hears him crying

521
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,977
and they find him.

522
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,187
Then the Ugly Duckling
is happy

523
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,731
because he knows
where he belongs.

524
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,285
Want to listen to the King?

525
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,705
You look like an Elvis fan.

526
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,627
Nani.

527
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,795
Nani!

528
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,047
Yeah?

529
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,299
Look.

530
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,932
<i>We can't go on together</i>

531
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,767
<i>With suspicious minds...</i>

532
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,145
<i>Cious minds...</i>

533
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,190
<i>Can build our dreams...</i>

534
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,992
<i>On suspicious minds...</i>

535
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,824
Heard you lost your job.

536
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:39,412
Well, actually, I just quit
that job because, you know,

537
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,457
the hours are just not conducive to
the challenges of raising a child...

538
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,626
Hey!

539
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,878
I am so sorry about that.

540
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,755
What is that thing?

541
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,423
That's my puppy.

542
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,716
Really?

543
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:00,266
Thus far, you have been adrift in the
sheltered harbor of my patience,

544
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,228
but I cannot ignore
you being jobless.

545
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,939
Do I make myself clear?

546
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,565
Perfectly.

547
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,403
And next time I see this dog, I expect
it to be a model citizen. Capisce?

548
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:15,198
Yes?

549
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,533
New job.

550
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,618
Model citizen.

551
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,121
Good day.

552
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,545
Mrs. Hasagawa?

553
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,630
I'm here to answer
your newspaper ad.

554
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,114
Elvis Presley was a model
citizen.

555
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,344
I've compiled a list of his
traits for you to practice.

556
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,055
Number one is dancing.

557
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,682
I can't talk now, dear.

558
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,017
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

559
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,561
That's why I'm here.

560
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,062
Hands on your hips.

561
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,647
Now follow my lead.

562
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,822
Ah! That's my want ad.

563
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,156
I know!

564
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,625
Why is everything so dark?

565
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,128
I am all about coffee.

566
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,073
Let's move on to step two.

567
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,341
Elvis played guitar. Here.

568
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,678
Hold it like this, and
put your fingers here.

569
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,889
See? Now you try.

570
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,519
And I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

571
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,022
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy

572
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,316
and with tourist season
ending...

573
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,312
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

574
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,041
I just love to answer phones...

575
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,877
This is the face of romance.

576
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,963
She looks like she could
use some lovin'.

577
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,886
Oh, we might have something.

578
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,638
Good. Now kiss her.

579
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,852
I'm sure Elvis had
his bad days too.

580
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,229
I'm all about saving people?

581
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,357
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

582
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,275
- Really?
- Okay, this is it.

583
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,653
Time to bring it all together.

584
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,071
Oh, that'd be so great!

585
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,490
You have no idea how
badly I need this job.

586
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,663
It's all you!
Knock 'em dead!

587
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,645
Don't crowd him!

588
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,569
Hey, knock it off!

589
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,192
Hey, Lilo!

590
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,570
Howzit, Nani?

591
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,406
We've been having
a bad day.

592
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,206
Hey, I might not be a doctor

593
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,626
but I know that there's no
better cure for a sour face

594
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,213
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

595
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,840
What you think?

596
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,093
I think that's a great idea.

597
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,465
Oh, can't complain, Mom.

598
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,301
I'm camping out with
a convicted criminal

599
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,220
and, oh, I had my head
chewed on by a monster!

600
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,223
Wait...
Something is not right.

601
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,726
6-2-6 is returning
willingly to water.

602
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,437
Oh, hold on, Mom,
another call.

603
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,483
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.

604
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,152
Oh, things are going well.

605
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,403
He cannot swim!

606
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,447
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?

607
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,407
Why will he risk drowning?

608
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,493
Jumba?
Jumba, help me out here.

609
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,080
I would have expected you back
by now, with 6-2-6 in hand.

610
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,876
Just a few things left to
pack and we'll be...

611
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,919
Hang up.

612
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,496
We are going swimming.

613
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,169
Yeah!

614
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,514
Lilo!

615
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,100
What happened?

616
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,062
Oh, some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

617
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,355
Where's Stitch?

618
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,317
Get off of her!

619
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,528
What happened?

620
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,613
Stitch dragged her down.

621
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,456
We lost Stitch!

622
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:33,362
Lilo? Lilo, look at me. Look
at me, baby. Are you hurt?

623
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,613
No.

624
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,495
He's unconscious, but
I think he's alive.

625
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,219
David, take Lilo.

626
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:03,184
This isn't what it looks like.
We were... It's just that...

627
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,398
I know you're trying, Nani,

628
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,277
but you need to think about
what's best for Lilo...

629
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,489
Even if it removes you
from the picture.

630
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,621
I'll be back tomorrow
morning for Lilo.

631
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,248
I'm sorry.

632
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,883
Nani? Is there
something I can do?

633
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,052
No, David.

634
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,431
I need to take Lilo home now.

635
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,519
We have a lot to talk
about, you know.

636
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,812
Thanks.

637
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,528
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

638
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,365
Then you came along.

639
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,227
Lilo, honey...

640
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,439
We have to...

641
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,987
Don't worry. You're nice, and
someone will give you a job.

642
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,739
I would.

643
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,494
Come here.

644
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,988
<i>One fond embrace</i>

645
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:28,370
<i>Until we meet again</i>

646
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,352
That's us before...

647
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,397
It was rainy, and they
went for a drive.

648
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,318
What happened to yours?

649
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,365
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?

650
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,538
I know that's why you
wreck things and push me.

651
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,633
Our family's little now and
we don't have many toys,

652
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,803
but if you want, you
could be part of it.

653
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,391
You could be our baby and
we'd raise you to be good.

654
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,981
Ohana means family.

655
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,610
Family means nobody
gets left behind

656
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,573
but if you want to
leave, you can.

657
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,623
I'll remember you though.

658
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,545
I remember everyone
that leaves.

659
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,995
Lost.

660
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,838
I'm lost.

661
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,513
Help!

662
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,349
I don't like the ocean!

663
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,686
Oh, look, a friendly
little dolphin.

664
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,439
They helped sailors
in the war...

665
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,609
It's a shark! It's a shark,
and it ain't friendly!

666
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,487
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

667
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,738
Oh, octopus, come and help me?

668
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,698
An octo... octopus is
worse than a shark!

669
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,533
I hate this planet!

670
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,045
Little monster!

671
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:31,553
Agent Pleakley here.

672
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,889
I have lost patience
with you both.

673
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,476
Have you captured 6-2-6 or not?

674
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,398
Consider yourselves
fired and prisonbound.

675
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,609
Your incompetence is nothing
short of unspeakable!

676
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,000
But...

677
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,825
We're fired!

678
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,661
Now we do it my way!

679
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,787
Your way?

680
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,039
Oh, wait!

681
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,167
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

682
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,294
Jumba and Pleakley.

683
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,964
Whatever. The mission
is in jeopardy.

684
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:12,052
This could be your chance to
redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

685
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,097
How soon will you be
prepared to leave?

686
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,433
Immediately.

687
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,200
Don't run.
Don't make me shoot you.

688
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,035
You were expensive.

689
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,331
Yes. Yes, that's it.
Come quietly.

690
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:44,918
Waiting.

691
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,211
For what?

692
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,799
Family.

693
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,012
You don't have one.

694
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,639
I made you.

695
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,310
Maybe I could...

696
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,312
You're built to destroy.

697
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,148
You can never belong.

698
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,236
Now come quietly and we
will take you apart.

699
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,780
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!

700
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,506
Lilo.

701
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,926
I didn't hear you get up.

702
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,471
Baby, what's wrong?

703
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,348
Stitch left.

704
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,974
Really?

705
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,851
It's good he's gone.

706
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,812
He didn't want to
be here anyway.

707
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,940
We don't need him.

708
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,153
Lilo...

709
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,698
Sometimes you try your hardest

710
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,369
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

711
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,207
Sometimes things have
to change

712
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,585
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better...

713
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,337
even if...

714
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,715
Nani!

715
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,886
- David!
- I think I found you a job.

716
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,012
You what?

717
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,723
Old man Kukhkini's store,
but we got to hurry.

718
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:26,895
Oh, okay. Lilo? Baby,
this is really important.

719
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,814
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

720
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,232
I'm going to be right back.

721
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,610
Lock the door and don't
answer it for anyone, okay?

722
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,030
Things are finally
turning around.

723
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,242
David, I owe you one.

724
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,410
That's okay.

725
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:44,454
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

726
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,337
Come back here,
you little...

727
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,800
Stitch?

728
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,552
What is it?

729
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,809
Oh, hiding behind your little
friend won't work anymore.

730
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,645
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.

731
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,315
New rules.

732
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,742
What are we going to do?

733
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,578
Ooh! I love this song!

734
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,163
Pliers.

735
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,873
Screwdriver.

736
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,124
Check.

737
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,876
Come out, my friend from
whomever you're hiding behind.

738
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,715
What the...

739
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,638
Come on! What's the big deal?

740
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,141
I'll put you back together again.

741
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,144
I'll make you taller
and not so fluffy!

742
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,229
I like fluffy!

743
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,814
No... No...

744
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,107
No!

745
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,695
Oh, leave my mother
out of this!

746
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,783
You could do with
a makeover.

747
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:07,829
I tried to give you my good looks, but
let's face it, something went wrong.

748
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,039
No!

749
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,087
Quick! Follow me!
If we make it to...

750
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,839
- You're alive!
- They're all over the place!

751
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,511
Running away? Here...
Let me stop you.

752
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,682
You always get in the way!

753
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,558
Where's the girl? What
have you done to the girl?

754
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,477
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?

755
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,604
Aliens are attacking
my house.

756
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,065
No, no, no! No aliens!

757
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,070
Blue punch buggy!

758
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:42,864
No punch back.

759
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,075
They want my dog!

760
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,077
There's no need to
alert the authorities.

761
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,745
Everything's under control.

762
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,996
Lilo, who was that?

763
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,207
Oh, good, my dog
found the chainsaw.

764
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,417
Lilo! Don't hang...

765
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,594
You shouldn't play with guns.

766
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,346
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

767
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,932
Oh, I just remembered.
It's your birthday!

768
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,559
Happy birthday!

769
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,352
- Merry Christmas!
- It's not Christmas.

770
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,437
Happy Hanukkah!

771
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,688
We're leaving Stitch?

772
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,898
Trust me. This is not
going to end well.

773
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,233
- One potato.
- Two potato.

774
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,735
- Three potato.
- Four.

775
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,236
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

776
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,404
Seven potato, more.

777
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,741
My... Mother... Told... Me...
You... Are... It.

778
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,242
Oh, I win!

779
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,169
Thanks. Mahalo plenty. You
won't be disappointed.

780
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,921
I'll show up early to help
with the morning deliver...

781
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,135
Oh, don't turn left.

782
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,097
No.

783
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,522
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

784
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,899
Oh, Lilo!

785
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,695
Please don't do this.

786
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,238
You know I have no choice.

787
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,282
No! You're not taking her!

788
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,867
I'm the only one who
understands her!

789
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,869
You take that away, she
won't stand a chance!

790
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,954
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

791
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,957
You don't know what you're
doing! She needs me!

792
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,293
Is this what she needs?

793
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:23,215
It seems clear to me that you need
her a lot more than she needs you.

794
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,430
Lilo! Lilo!

795
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,974
Lilo!

796
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,143
Lilo!

797
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,603
Lilo!

798
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,735
Lilo!

799
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,403
Lilo!

800
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,498
You ruined everything.

801
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,633
You're one of them?

802
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,345
Get out of here, Stitch.

803
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,183
Surprise!

804
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,063
And here I thought you'd
be difficult to catch.

805
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:22,732
Silly me.

806
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,526
Lilo?

807
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,862
Lilo!

808
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,043
There you go, all buckled
up for the trip.

809
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,840
And, look, I even caught
you a little snack.

810
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,097
No! Stop!

811
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,651
Lilo.

812
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,615
Okay, talk.

813
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,908
I know you had something
to do with this.

814
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,951
Now where is Lilo?

815
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,329
Talk! I know you can.

816
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,583
Okay, okay.

817
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,671
Where's Lilo?

818
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,466
Lilo...

819
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,804
Now all your washing is up!

820
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,015
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.

821
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,642
Listen carefully.

822
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,774
Hello? Galactic command?
Experiment 6-2-6 is in custody.

823
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,192
We'll wait right here.

824
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,371
Don't interact with her.

825
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,960
Where's Lilo?

826
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,670
Who? What?

827
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,800
Lilo. My sister.

828
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:19,557
Sorry, we do not know
anyone by this...

829
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,810
Lilo! She's a little
girl, this big!

830
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:25,397
She has black hair and brown eyes and
she hangs around with that thing!

831
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,402
We know her.

832
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,821
Bring her back.

833
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,323
Oh, we can't do that.

834
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,325
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

835
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:41,621
See, problem is...
We're just here for him.

836
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,790
So she's gone?

837
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,375
Look at the bright side.

838
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,335
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

839
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,721
Come.

840
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,150
Ohana.

841
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,610
Hey! Get away from her.

842
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,196
No! What did you say?

843
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,866
Ohana means family.

844
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,618
Family means...

845
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,705
Nobody gets left behind.

846
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,832
Or forgotten.

847
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,125
Yeah.

848
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,336
Hey...

849
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,796
What?

850
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,468
After all you put me through you
expect me to help you just like that?

851
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,054
Just like that?

852
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,598
Fine.

853
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,641
Fine?
You're doing what he says?

854
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,061
He's very persuasive.

855
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:49,439
Persuasive? What
exactly are we doing?

856
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,775
- Rescue.
- We're going to get Lilo?

857
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,740
Oh, good! I was hoping to
add theft, endangerment

858
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,242
and insanity to my list
of things I did today.

859
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,744
You too?

860
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,502
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

861
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,796
What? Did you think
we walked here?

862
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,258
This is Gantu, requesting
hyperspace clearance.

863
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,969
Stand by for clearance.

864
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,307
Clearance is granted
on vector C-12.

865
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,476
Connect me to the
Grand Councilwoman.

866
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,562
Gantu, what's going on?

867
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,940
I thought you'd like to know that
the little abomination is...

868
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,156
Yes, Captain?

869
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,368
I'll call you back.

870
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,500
How did you get out of there?

871
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,797
So what exactly are we doing?

872
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,216
Don't worry, is
all part of plan.

873
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,051
We are professionals.

874
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,179
Hey!
Get that out of your mouth!

875
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,646
Hold on!

876
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,575
Okay, is show time!

877
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,216
This is it!

878
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,390
Go! Go! Go!

879
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,196
Little savage!
Get off my ship!

880
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,244
Stitch!

881
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:06,094
Computer, locate
experiment 6-2-6.

882
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,429
6-2-6 located.

883
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,556
We finish this now.

884
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,061
Stitch is unconscious.

885
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,731
- What do we do now?
- We stay close. Hope for a miracle.

886
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,066
That's all we can do.

887
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,620
No!

888
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,374
Don't leave me, okay?

889
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,058
Okay.

890
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,011
Okay.

891
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:59,522
Target 6-2-6 is in motion.
Speed is 84.

892
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:01,107
Impossible!

893
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,243
Stitch!

894
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,763
Abomination.

895
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,222
Stupidhead.

896
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,191
Aloha!

897
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:47,362
You're vile! You're foul!
You're flawed!

898
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,781
Also cute and fluffy!

899
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:04,545
You came back.

900
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,714
Nobody gets left behind.

901
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,557
Lilo!

902
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,898
Good dog.

903
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,251
David!

904
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:44,961
Hey, Lilo.

905
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,213
Can you give us a ride
to shore?

906
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,967
Sure!

907
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,261
But I have to make
two trips.

908
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,266
So you're from outer space, huh?
I heard the surfing's choice.

909
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,018
We have 6-2-6.

910
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,395
Take him to my ship.

911
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,647
- Leave him alone.
- Hold on.

912
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,941
Grand Councilwoman,
let me explain.

913
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,192
Silence!

914
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,237
I am retiring you,
Captain Gantu.

915
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,032
Actually, credit for
the capture goes to...

916
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,659
Goes to me.

917
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,870
You'll be lucky if you end
up on a Fluff Trog farm

918
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,621
after we sort this thing out.

919
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,708
I think I should...

920
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,127
You! You're the
cause of all this!

921
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:29,130
If it wasn't for your Experiment
6-2-6, none of this...

922
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:31,466
- Stitch.
- What?

923
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,759
My name Stitch.

924
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,052
Stitch then.

925
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,263
If it wasn't for Stitch...

926
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,310
Does Stitch have
to go in the ship?

927
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,770
Yes.

928
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,814
Can Stitch say good-bye?

929
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,609
Yes.

930
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,027
Thank you.

931
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,201
Who are you?

932
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,622
This is my family.

933
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,583
I found it all on my own.

934
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:11,088
It's little and broken.
But still good.

935
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,175
Yeah. Still good.

936
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,895
Does he really have to go?

937
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:30,608
You know as well as I that
our laws are absolute.

938
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:34,403
I cannot change what the
council has decided.

939
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,491
Lilo, didn't you buy that
thing at the shelter?

940
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,372
Hey!

941
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,626
Three days ago, I bought
Stitch at the shelter.

942
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,380
I paid two dollars for him.
See this stamp? I own him.

943
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,217
If you take him,
you're stealing.

944
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:01,430
Aliens are all about rules.

945
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,891
You look familiar.

946
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,603
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

947
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,856
Ah, yes. You had hair then.

948
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,818
Take note of this.

949
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:18,823
This creature has been
sentenced to life in exile,

950
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,119
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here...

951
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,955
on Earth...

952
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:32,878
And as caretaker of the
alien life-form, Stitch,

953
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,673
this family is now under
the official protection

954
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,426
of the United Galactic Federation.

955
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,971
We'll be checking
in now and then.

956
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:45,224
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

957
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,769
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

958
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,896
I know what you mean.

959
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,320
Don't let those two
get on my ship.

960
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,956
CIA?

961
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,166
Former.

962
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,126
Saved the planet once.

963
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,461
Convinced an alien race

964
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,589
that mosquitoes were
an endangered species.

965
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,341
Now, about your house...

966
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,304
Wait.
