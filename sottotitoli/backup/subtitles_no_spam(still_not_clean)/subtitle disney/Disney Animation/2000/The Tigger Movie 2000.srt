the very seed of my family...

as the 14th century...

Anyway, if I may go out on a limb here,

231
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
I would first and foremost
suggest for Tigger...

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,100
that to find one's family,
one must first look up...

Oh, it does bring to mind
a distant nephew of mine.

He became a sailor...

247
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,700

where could

right over there,

and not a single

305
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,400
Maybe I've been going about this
all the wrong way upside down.

306
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
Maybe what I need to do
is find some sort of clue...

as to where are
their whereabouts.

308
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,600
What kind of clue?

309
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,300
Maybe in here. Some thingamabob or
an heir-i-loom or something.

belonged to my uncle!

And just think,

we could all bounce...

You know, that bounce I bounc-ed
when I bounced that big rock,

That's ridickerous! It-- It's a--

And it's only...

for professional bouncers.

a real good bouncer.
