1
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,977
Yes.

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,248
Quite dead.

3
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,143
As a doornail.

4
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,548
Certificate of death, sir.

5
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,919
Stop!

6
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,590
Back away, praddock.

7
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,545
Tuppence is tuppence.

8
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,400
- Beg your pardon!
- I say!

9
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,543
Delinquents.

10
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,982
Newspaper!

11
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,141
We're hungry, sir!

12
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,448
- Please, sir, we're very hungry.
- Any morsel. We're hungry, sir.

13
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,218
- Any scraps.
- We're starving,

14
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,055
Please, sir. We're very hungry.

15
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,921
Merry Christmas,
from his lordship, the mayor!

16
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,626
- Please, sir.
- Oh, look. There it is.

17
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,033
Oi! Come back here with that!
That's our meat!

18
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,298
Give it back! That's ours!
Come back here!

19
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,460
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,429
Fresh hot chestnuts.

21
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,000
- How would you like this one?
- That's perfect.

22
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,401
That's a nice fresh eel.

23
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,702
Here is the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Get lost.

24
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,437
And under which one is the pea?
Boom, boom, boom, boom...

25
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,069
Boom! Get out of here.

26
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,148
There we are. Watch this now.

27
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,957
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

28
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,353
- God save you.
- Bah! Humbug!

29
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,265
Christmas a humbug?
Uncle! You don't mean that.

30
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,630
Merry Christmas.

31
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,264
What reason have you to be merry?
You're poor enough.

32
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,740
What right have you to be so dismal?
You're rich enough.

33
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,472
- Humbug!
- Don't be cross, Uncle.

34
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:11,745
What else can I be when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

35
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,048
Merry Christmas.

36
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,749
What's Christmastime to you but
a time for paying bills without money.

37
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,658
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not a penny richer.

38
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,286
If I could work my will,

39
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,628
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas" on his lips

40
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,600
should be boiled in his own pudding

41
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,727
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart!

42
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,670
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

43
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,542
Keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.

44
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,444
Keep it? But you don't keep it!

45
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,115
Let me leave it alone then.

46
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,386
Much good it has ever done you.

47
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,186
There are many things from which I have
derived good and have not profited.

48
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,249
Christmas being among them.

49
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,396
But I have always thought of Christmas
as a kind, charitable time.

50
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,796
The only time when men
open their shut-up hearts

51
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,562
and think of all people
as fellow travelers to the grave

52
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,368
and not some other race of creatures
bound on other journeys.

53
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,838
And therefore, Uncle,

54
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,967
although it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver in my pocket,

55
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,073
I believe it has done me good,
and I say, God bless it!

56
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,253
Let me hear another
sound out of you, Cratchit,

57
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,883
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation!

58
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,525
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
A wonder you don't go into Parliament.

59
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,470
Don't be cross, Uncle.
Come, dine with us tomorrow.

60
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,333
I'll see you in hell first.

61
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,277
But why?
Why so cold-hearted, Uncle? Why?

62
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,781
Why did you get married?

63
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,413
Because I fell in love. 

64
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,986
Because...

65
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,785
...you fell...

66
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,621
...in love?

67
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,431
Good afternoon.

68
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:15,233
I want nothing from you.
I ask nothing of you.

69
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,107
- Why can't we be friends?
- Good afternoon.

70
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,637
I'm sorry, with all my heart,
to find you so resolute.

71
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,412
But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and therefore,

72
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,045
- merry Christmas, Uncle!
- Good afternoon!

73
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,647
- And a happy New Year!
- Good afternoon!

74
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,420
And a very merry Christmas
to you too, Mr. Cratchit.

75
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,359
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

76
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,495
There's another one.

77
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,222
A clerk making 15 shillings a week...

78
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,670
...and with a wife and family,
talking about a merry Christmas.

79
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,536
I'll retire to Bedlam.

80
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,669
Good afternoon.
Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?

81
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,413
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?

82
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,148
Mr. Marley has been dead
these seven years.

83
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,123
He died seven years ago...
this very night.

84
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,930
Well, we have no doubt
that his generosity

85
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,797
is well represented
by his surviving partner.

86
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,267
At this festive season
of the year, Mr. Scrooge,

87
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,969
it is more than usually desirable that
we should make some slight provision

88
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,375
for the poor and the destitute.

89
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,678
Many thousands are in want
of common comfort, sir.

90
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,651
Are there no prisons?

91
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,962
Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons.

92
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,525
And the union workhouses,
are they still in operation?

93
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,998
They are. I wish
I could say they were not.

94
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,271
The treadmill in full vigor?

95
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,003
- Very busy, sir.
- Good!

96
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,283
I was afraid something had occurred
to stop them in their useful course.

97
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:14,192
Yes. At this festive season, a few
of us are endeavoring to raise a fund

98
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:18,686
to buy the poor some meat
and drink and means of warmth.

99
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,858
What shall we put you down for?

100
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,934
- Nothing.
- Oh, you wish to remain anonymous?

101
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,805
I wish to be left alone!
I don't make merry myself at Christmas,

102
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,902
and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

103
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,571
I support the establishments
I have mentioned.

104
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,607
And those who are badly off
must go there.

105
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,786
Many cannot go there.

106
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,625
And, well, frankly,
many would rather die.

107
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,723
Then they had better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

108
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,329
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

109
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,505
Good afternoon.

110
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,189
You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?

111
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,224
Well, if quite convenient, sir.

112
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,461
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

113
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,563
If I were to dock you a half a crown
for it, you'd think yourself ill-used.

114
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:37,372
And yet you don't think me ill-used
when I pay a day's wages for no work.

115
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,443
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

116
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,177
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

117
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,553
But I suppose you
must have the whole day.

118
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,320
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

119
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,253
Sir.

120
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,242
In honor of Christmas Eve!

121
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,044
Bugger it!

122
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,628
Where are you? Here!

123
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,400
Why does everything
seem to happen to me?

124
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,196
Get away! Get away!

125
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,317
Balderdash!

126
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,674
I have given myself the willies.

127
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,509
That's what it is.

128
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,252
It's all still a hum...

129
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,486
How now!

130
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,958
What do you want with me?

131
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,730
Oh, much.

132
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:32,071
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

133
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,737
Who were you then?

134
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,742
In life, I was your partner,

135
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,014
Jacob Marley.

136
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,816
Can you sit down?

137
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,929
- I can.
- Do it then.

138
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,972
You do not believe in me.

139
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,947
I don't.

140
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,179
Why do you doubt your senses?

141
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,017
Because the littlest thing
can affect them.

142
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,616
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

143
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,356
You may be an undigested bit of beef.
A blot of mustard.

144
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:28,093
A crumb of cheese.
A fragment of underdone potato.

145
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,569
There's more of gravy than of grave
about you, whatever you are.

146
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:39,305
Mercy! Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

147
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,678
Man of worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?

148
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,649
I do! I must!

149
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:50,314
Woe! Woe is me!

150
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,188
You are fettered in chains. Why?

151
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,425
I wear the chain I forged in life.

152
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:02,593
I made it link by link and yard by yard.

153
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,603
Do you recognize its pattern?

154
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:11,365
Can you imagine the weight and length
of the chain you bear?

155
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,539
It was as heavy and long
as this seven Christmas Eves ago.

156
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,108
Oh, yours is a ponderous chain.

157
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,345
Jacob, tell me no more.

158
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,517
Speak comfort to me, Jacob.

159
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,063
I have none to give.

160
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,564
I cannot stay.

161
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,163
I cannot linger anywhere.

162
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:46,337
Mark me, in life, my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghouse,

163
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,748
never roved beyond the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole.

164
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,879
Now endless journeys lie before me.

165
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,352
Seven years dead
and traveling all the time?

166
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:06,388
The whole time. No rest, no peace.

167
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,801
You must've covered
a lot of ground in seven years.

168
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:20,808
I was blind!
Blind! I could not see my own life!

169
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:26,545
Squandered and misused.
Oh, woe... Oh, woe is me!

170
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,281
But you were always
a good man of business!

171
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,482
Business!

172
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,964
Mankind... was my business.

173
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,099
The common welfare was my business.

174
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,503
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence were all my...

175
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,834
Hear me! My time is nearly gone.

176
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,565
I will. But don't be hard upon me,
Jacob. Pray.

177
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,766
I am here to warn you

178
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,573
that you have yet a chance
and a hope of escaping my fate.

179
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,411
A chance of my procuring, Ebenezer.

180
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,816
You were always a good friend
to me, Jacob. Thank 'ee.

181
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,256
You will be haunted by three spirits.

182
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,886
That's the chance and hope?

183
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,361
- I'd rather not.
- Expect the first

184
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,699
tomorrow when the bell tolls one.

185
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,968
Couldn't I take them all at once,
and have it over with, Jacob?

186
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,602
Expect the second the next night
at the same hour.

187
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,375
And the third upon the next night,

188
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,443
when the last stroke of 12

189
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,851
has ceased to vibrate.

190
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,492
Look to see me no more.

191
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,865
I'm sorry.

192
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,371
I wish I could help you.

193
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:21,844
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

194
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,519
I am.

195
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,405
Is it possible that
you might put your cap on?

196
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:49,270
Would you so soon put out,
with your worldly hands,

197
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:53,478
the light I give?

198
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,577
No, no! No, no! I'm so sorry.

199
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,589
I meant nothing by it.
I meant no offense.

200
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,784
I just thought I...

201
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,605
Who and what are you?

202
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,807
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

203
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,322
Long past?

204
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,859
Your past.

205
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,930
Rise.

206
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:44,333
And walk with me.

207
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,313
But I am mortal and liable to fall.

208
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,289
Bear but a touch of my hand there...

209
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,362
...and you shall be upheld
in more than this.

210
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,811
Good heavens.

211
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,813
I was bred in this place.

212
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,285
I was a boy here.

213
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,552
Your lip... is trembling.

214
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,094
And what's that?

215
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,896
- On your cheek?
- Nothing.

216
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,565
Something in my eye.

217
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,066
Do you remember the way?

218
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,171
Remember it?

219
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,415
I could walk it blindfolded.

220
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,952
Giddyup! Giddyup!

221
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,824
These are but shadows of things
that have been.

222
00:33:54,632 --> 00:34:00,070
They have no consciousness... of us.

223
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,102
I knew them.

224
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,908
I know every one of them.

225
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,382
They were schoolmates of mine.

226
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,750
Let's go on.

227
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,097
This...

228
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,164
This was my school.

229
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,969
This school is not quite deserted.

230
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,314
A solitary child...

231
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,747
...neglected by his friends...

232
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,983
...is left here still.

233
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,453
I know.

234
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,629
Poor boy.

235
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,361
Poor, poor boy.

236
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:47,405
Let's... see another Christmas.

237
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,097
Ebenezer!

238
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,401
Ebenezer!

239
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,810
Dear, dear brother!
I've come to bring you home!

240
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,111
- Home, little Fan?
- Yes, home!

241
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,816
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be.

242
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,549
He spoke so gently to me one night.

243
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,558
I was not afraid to ask him
if you might come home.

244
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,560
And he said yes!

245
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,290
And he sent me in a coach to fetch you.

246
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,855
And we're to be together
all the Christmas long.

247
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,699
And to have the merriest time
in all the world!

248
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,768
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

249
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,307
- She had a large heart.
- She died a woman.

250
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,952
And had, as I think...

251
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,846
...children.

252
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,349
Yes, one child.

253
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,124
True.

254
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,526
- Your nephew.
- Yes.

255
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,482
Do you know this place?

256
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,551
Know it? I was an apprentice here!

257
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,594
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

258
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,628
Bless his heart!
It's Fezziwig alive again!

259
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,309
Yo-ho! Ebenezer, come on!

260
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,876
Come on! Dick! Come on!
It's 6:00.

261
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,077
They're going to be here soon.

262
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:14,156
Dick Wilkins. Bless me, yes.
There he is, Dick Wilkins.

263
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,421
He was very attached to me, was Dick.

264
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,929
Yo-ho, me lads! No more work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve!

265
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,266
Hooray!

266
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,363
Dick, Ebenezer,
let's get cleared away.

267
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,739
We want lots of space.
Lots and lots of space.

268
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,607
Hee-hi!

269
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,353
Maestro!

270
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,923
May I present...?!

271
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,465
Well done! Well done!

272
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,032
And now, kind fiddler, if you please.

273
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,700
It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley!

274
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,884
Might I have this dance with you?

275
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,258
Ebenezer, it's your pass.

276
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:20,733
- Another idol has replaced me.
- Another idol? What idol?

277
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,737
A golden one.

278
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,012
There is nothing on this earth
more terrifying to me

279
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,418
than a life doomed to poverty.

280
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,323
May I ask, why do you condemn,
with such severity,

281
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,385
the honest pursuit of substance?

282
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,531
You fear the world too much, Ebenezer.

283
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,892
- You've changed.
- Changed?

284
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:51,067
Perhaps grown wiser,
but I have not changed toward you.

285
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,076
Our contract is an old one.

286
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,012
It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so.

287
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,074
When it was made...

288
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,746
- You were another man.
- I was a boy!

289
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,487
I release you, Ebenezer.

290
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,928
Have I ever sought release?

291
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,461
- In words, no.
- In what, then?

292
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,538
In an altered spirit.

293
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,707
In another atmosphere of life.

294
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,178
In everything that made my love
of any worth in your sight.

295
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,849
Tell me, Ebenezer, if this contract
had never been between us,

296
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,790
would you seek me out now?

297
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,960
No.

298
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,597
You think not?

299
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,795
I would gladly think otherwise
if I could.

300
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:01,336
But if you were free today,
would you choose a dowerless girl?

301
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,015
A girl left penniless
by the death of her parents?

302
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,776
You, who weighs everything by gain?

303
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,521
I release you, Ebenezer.

304
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,863
May you be happy in the life
you've chosen.

305
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,236
Spirit, remove me from this place.

306
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,572
I told you, these were shadows
of things that have been.

307
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,546
They are what they are.
Do not blame me.

308
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,276
Remove me. I cannot bear it.

309
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,327
Leave me! Take me back!

310
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,133
Haunt me no longer!

311
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,118
Oh, blast!

312
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,558
Enter, Scrooge!

313
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:14,266
Come in! Come in
and know me better, man!

314
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,176
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

315
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,847
Look upon me!

316
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,725
You have never seen
the likes of me before?

317
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:45,694
Never.

318
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,900
Have never walked forth
with my elder brothers?

319
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,702
I don't think that I have.

320
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,841
You have many brothers?

321
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,350
More than 1,800.

322
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,687
1,842, to be exact.

323
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:24,631
I see you wear a scabbard,
but no sword.

324
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,403
Indeed.

325
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:35,777
Peace on Earth. Goodwill toward men.

326
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,686
Spirit, conduct me where you will.

327
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,267
Touch my robe.

328
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,923
What's happening? What are you doing?

329
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:30,159
- Very strange.
- Indeed.

330
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,966
Not many mortals are granted
a heavenly perspective of man's world.

331
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,496
Yes.

332
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,085
It's quite beautiful.

333
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,713
Spirit, these poor people
have no means to cook their food.

334
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,584
And yet you seek
to close the only places

335
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,648
in which they can warm
their meager meals every seventh day.

336
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,857
Hear me, Scrooge.

337
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,735
There are some upon this earth of yours

338
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,834
who claim to know me and my brothers,

339
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:25,541
and do their deeds of ill will
and selfishness in our name.

340
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,040
These so-called "men of the cloth"

341
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:34,456
are as strange to me and my kin
as if they never lived.

342
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,222
Charge their doings to them, not us.

343
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,562
Aye. I will.

344
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,335
Smell that?

345
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,065
Cooking goose!

346
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,273
Come on!

347
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,929
I take it this bleak paupers' dwelling
is of some significance.

348
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:25,408
It is all your loyal clerk can afford
for his meager 15 bob a week.

349
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,137
- Mother!
- Papa!

350
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,940
We just came by the baker shop.

351
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,504
And smelled our goose,
cooking delicious.

352
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:35,348
Shut the door, please. What happened
to your precious father?

353
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:39,879
And your brother. And Martha,
she wasn't as late last Christmas Day.

354
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,050
Mother, here she is, Mother.
Here's Martha.

355
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:45,687
Martha! Wait till you see
our goose. 'Tis a wonderful one.

356
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,094
Peter, off with you to the baker's
and collect the bird.

357
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,794
And take the children with you.
And pray, no dallying.

358
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,396
Why, bless your heart alive!
Dear, how late you are!

359
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:59,431
We had a deal of work to finish up last
night and clear away this morning.

360
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,242
Never mind. Long as you're here. Sit ye
down before the fire and have a warm.

361
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,714
No. No, no, no. There's Father coming.

362
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,912
Hide, Martha.
You must hide. Hide, Martha.

363
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:22,395
- It's cold out there.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Timmy.

364
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,099
Why, where's our Martha?

365
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,035
Not coming.

366
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:37,275
Not coming?
Not coming upon Christmas Day?

367
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,181
Here I am, Father!

368
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,048
We got you, Father.

369
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:47,113
I couldn't bear to see you in a state
of disappointment. If only for a giggle.

370
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,887
It's so lovely to see you, my Martha.

371
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,656
Come on, Timmy. I hear
the pudding singing in the copper.

372
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,425
Shall we have a look, then?

373
00:53:55,332 --> 00:54:00,326
- How did little Timmy behave?
- As good as gold. And better.

374
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,034
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much,

375
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,907
and he thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

376
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:10,379
He told me, coming home, that he hoped
the people sawed him in church,

377
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,105
because he was a cripple...

378
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,477
...and it might make pleasant for them
to remember it upon Christmas Day

379
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,182
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

380
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:29,394
I believe he grows more hearty
and stronger every day, my dear.

381
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,798
The pudding looks delicious!

382
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:43,844
The whole wash house
smells like a pastry cook's shop.

383
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:50,913
Spirit, tell me, will Tiny Tim...?

384
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:56,449
I see a vacant seat
in the poor chimney corner...

385
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,157
...and a crutch without an owner.

386
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,065
Carefully preserved.

387
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,999
- Hurrah!
- The Christmas goose!

388
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,706
Make space. Let's get that cover off.

389
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,780
Lovely! Well done, Peter.

390
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,979
I don't believe I've ever seen
a more magnificent goose cooked.

391
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,510
It is a beautiful bird, that's for sure.

392
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,918
But I'll pray that
one Christmas, perhaps,

393
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,824
the children might taste a turkey.

394
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,625
Perhaps one day, my dear.
Perhaps one day.

395
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,464
A toast.

396
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,369
To Mr. Scrooge.

397
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,508
The founder of our feast.

398
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,271
Founder of the feast, indeed.
I wish I had him here.

399
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,304
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon,

400
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,681
and I'd hope he'd have
a good appetite for it.

401
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,449
My dear, the children...
It's Christmas Day.

402
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,547
Christmas Day, I'm sure.
How can one drink the health

403
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:04,993
of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge?

404
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:09,192
As you know he is, Robert.
Nobody knows it better than you.

405
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,894
My dear, Christmas Day.

406
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,568
I'll drink his health for your sake
and the day's, not for his.

407
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,238
A merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

408
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,870
He'll be very merry and very happy,
I have no doubt.

409
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:30,612
A merry Christmas to us all,
my dears. God bless us.

410
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,518
God bless us.

411
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,581
God bless us, everyone.

412
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,117
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year.
- God bless.

413
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,723
Kind spirit,
say Tiny Tim will be spared.

414
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:48,636
If these shadows
remain unaltered by the future...

415
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:55,041
...the child will die.
- Die! No, spirit. No.

416
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,874
What then? If he is to die,
he had better do it.

417
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,252
And decrease the surplus population.

418
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,339
- So you're thinking of an animal?
- Yes.

419
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,349
- A live animal?
- Yes.

420
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,783
- A rather disagreeable animal?
- Yes.

421
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,184
- A savage animal?
- Yes.

422
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,155
Wait, wait! Is it an animal
that grunts and growls?

423
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,487
Yes!

424
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,321
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

425
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,451
- A horse?
- No.

426
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,518
- A cow?
- No.

427
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,052
- A dog?
- A pig?

428
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,654
- No.
- An ass?

429
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,423
Yes and no.

430
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,132
I know who it is, Fred!
I know! It's your Uncle Scrooge!

431
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,662
Yes!

432
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,346
Christmas a humbug?
Now, he actually said that?

433
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,684
As I live. And he believes it.

434
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,952
I have no patience with him, Fred.

435
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,826
I have. I'm sorry for him.

436
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,496
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Only himself.

437
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:25,126
He decides to dislike us,
won't come and dine with us,

438
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,659
and what's the consequence?
He loses a dinner.

439
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,936
- Indeed, he loses a very good dinner.
- Hear, hear. A magnificent dinner.

440
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,533
Great.

441
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,705
He's certainly given us plenty
of merriment, that's for sure,

442
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,613
and I think it would be ungrateful
not to drink to his health.

443
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,675
He wouldn't take it from me,
but he may have it nevertheless.

444
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,652
A merry Christmas to the old man,
whatever he is. Uncle Scrooge.

445
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,680
To Uncle Scrooge.

446
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,402
Are spirits' lives so short?

447
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,935
My life upon this globe is very brief.

448
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,749
It ends tonight.

449
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:18,379
- Tonight?
- Tonight at midnight.

450
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:25,726
Hark. The time is drawing near.

451
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,236
Forgive me...

452
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,065
...but I see something strange
protruding from your skirt.

453
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,938
Is it a foot or a claw?

454
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:48,710
It might be a claw, for the scant amount
of flesh there is upon it.

455
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:55,515
- Look here.
- Naff off!

456
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:59,961
- Oh, man. Look here.
- You daft old geezer.

457
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,693
Look! Look!

458
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,131
Down here!

459
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,173
- Go away!
- Are they yours?

460
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,702
They are man's.

461
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:19,245
This boy is Ignorance.

462
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,279
This girl is Want.

463
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,055
Beware them both.

464
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:49,004
Have they no refuge? No resource?

465
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,143
Are there no prisons?

466
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,887
Are there no workhouses?

467
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:12,726
Am I in the presence of
the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

468
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,195
You're about to show me shadows

469
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,633
of the things that have not happened
but will happen.

470
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,227
Is that so, spirit?

471
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:27,206
Ghost of the Future, I fear you
more than any specter I have seen.

472
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,837
But I know your purpose
is to do me good.

473
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,513
I am prepared to bear you company.

474
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:34,607
Lead on.

475
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,587
The night is waning fast.
It's precious time to me.

476
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,684
Lead on, spirit.

477
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:01,369
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

478
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,379
- Or sometime Christmas Day.
- I thought he'd never die.

479
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,742
What's he done with his money?

480
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,344
Hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.

481
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,923
It is likely to be a cheap funeral.

482
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,983
For the life of me, I can't think
of anyone who'd want to attend it.

483
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:22,521
I don't mind going...
if lunch is provided.

484
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,896
There, yes.

485
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,432
What a frightful fellow.

486
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,937
- All right.
- Good day, gentlemen.

487
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:39,710
Get ahold of yourself, Ebenezer.
You're having a wobbly.

488
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,047
You won't get me in here.

489
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,490
Christmas pudding, no doubt.

490
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,444
I'm... I'm on Lime Street.

491
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,892
Come now.

492
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,649
Merry Christmas, Joe.

493
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,485
And happy New Year,
to be sure. Come in.

494
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,386
Sit down in me parlor
and let's have a look.

495
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,597
Here.

496
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,798
What do you call these,
Mrs. Dilber, huh?

497
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,569
Mrs. Dilber?

498
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,873
Bed curtains.

499
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,707
You mean to say you took them down
while he was lying there?

500
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,881
I do.

501
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,019
And why not?

502
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:25,254
You was born to make your fortune,
and you certainly will do it.

503
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:29,162
Well, I shan't hold back my hand
when I can get something by it...

504
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,689
Don't you go getting grease
on them blankets now.

505
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,736
- His blankets?
- Whose else do you think?

506
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:40,465
He won't be feeling the cold
without them now, I dare say.

507
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,875
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

508
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,039
Don't you be afeard of that.

509
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,640
I ain't so fond of his company
that I'd loiter about.

510
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,484
You can look through that shirt
till your eyes ache,

511
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,926
and you won't find one hole in it.

512
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,591
- It was the best he had.
- Mrs. Dilber!

513
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,301
Would have been wasted, only for me.

514
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,863
- You're fired! Fired!
- How did you mean "wasted"?

515
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:16,742
Somebody was fool enough
to put it on him to be buried in.

516
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,310
But I took it off him.

517
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,614
This is the end of it, you see.

518
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,823
He frightened everyone away
while he was alive.

519
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,121
Only to profit us now that he's dead.

520
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:41,061
If he'd had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with death,

521
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:46,632
instead of lying there, all alone,
gasping out his last breath...

522
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,667
...well, we wouldn't have
these things to sell now, would we?

523
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,906
Spirit! I see! I see!

524
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,303
The case of this unhappy man
who dies a solitary, lonesome death

525
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,074
might be my own.

526
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,139
My life tends that way now.

527
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,102
Merciful heavens! What's this?

528
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:55,066
Spirit, this is a fearful place.

529
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:59,712
When I leave it, I shall not leave
its lesson. Trust me. Let's go!

530
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:17,589
I understand. And I would, if I could,
but I have not the power.

531
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:35,745
Spirit, if there is any person who feels
emotion caused by this man's death,

532
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,250
show that person to me, I beg you.

533
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,699
- Are we ruined?
- There is hope yet.

534
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:58,532
Hope? Only if he relents.

535
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,437
He is past relenting.

536
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,137
He is dead.

537
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,211
Dead?

538
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,513
To whom will our debts be transferred?

539
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,147
I don't know, but by then
we'll have the money.

540
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:19,320
And even if we don't, it's unlikely any
new creditor will ever be so merciless.

541
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,827
We shall sleep tonight
with light hearts, my dear.

542
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,463
Let me see some tenderness
connected to death,

543
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,971
or this chamber will forever haunt me!

544
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,478
It's late.

545
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,585
Past your father's time.

546
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:53,191
He's walked slow
these last few evenings.

547
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,688
Oh, he has walked...

548
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:00,930
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders...
fast, indeed.

549
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,464
But he was very light...

550
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,299
...to carry, and...

551
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,270
...your father loved him so.

552
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,255
- Father.
- You went today, then?

553
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:29,762
Yes, my dear.

554
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,990
I wish you could have gone.

555
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,797
Would have done you good
to see how green a place it is.

556
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,671
You'll see it often.

557
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:45,644
And I promised him I would
walk there every... every Sunday.

558
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,449
My little child!

559
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,020
My little child.

560
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:57,648
Father, please don't be grieved.
Please, Father.

561
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,491
I'm all right, love.
I'm quite at peace.

562
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:06,901
I'm sure none of us
will ever forget our poor Tiny Tim.

563
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,665
- Oh, no, Father.
- Never ever.

564
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:11,666
Thank you.

565
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,607
Thank you, my dears.

566
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,264
Bob.

567
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:14,767
Specter... something tells me
our parting moment is at hand.

568
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,433
Tell me...

569
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:23,642
...who... was that man
we saw lying dead?

570
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,438
Spirit...

571
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:05,950
...before I draw nearer
to that stone to which you point,

572
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,546
answer me one question!

573
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,083
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

574
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,185
or shadows of things that may be?

575
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,990
Men's courses in life
foreshadow certain ends.

576
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:21,264
But if these courses are departed from,
these ends will change. Isn't that so?

577
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,164
No. No!

578
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,576
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

579
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,213
No. Spirit, hear me!

580
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,652
I'm not the man I was!

581
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,589
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

582
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:44,884
Spirit!

583
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,657
Spirit, assure me that I may change
these shadows you've shown me!

584
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,961
Change them by an altered life!

585
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,635
No, spirit! No! No, spirit!

586
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,411
Good spirit... help me!

587
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,052
Spirit!

588
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,086
Help me, spirit!

589
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,745
Help, spirit!

590
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,859
Spirit, I will honor Christmas in my
heart and try to keep it all the year.

591
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,390
I will not shut out the lessons
of the past, nor present, nor future.

592
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,630
Oh, please, spirit,

593
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:07,574
tell me I may sponge away
the writing on that stone!

594
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,454
Still here?

595
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,796
They're still here.

596
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:07,827
I'm still here.

597
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,865
I'm still here.

598
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,575
I'm still here!

599
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,909
I don't know what to do.

600
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:24,715
I'm light as a feather,
merry as a schoolboy.

601
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,084
I've heard that laugh before.

602
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,491
- I say, what's today?
- Eh?

603
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:45,832
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today? Why, Christmas Day.

604
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,672
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

605
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,736
The spirits have
done it all in one night.

606
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,011
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can. Of course they can.

607
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,315
Hello, my fine fellow. Do you know
the poulterer's on the corner?

608
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,686
- I should hope I did.
- What an intelligent boy.

609
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,886
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

610
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,690
Not the little prize turkey,
the big one.

611
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:11,529
- The one as big as me?
- What a delightful child.

612
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:17,064
- Yes, my buck.
- It's hanging there now.

613
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,938
Is it? Go and buy it, then!

614
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,274
- Walker!
- No, no, I'm in earnest.

615
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:26,678
Go and buy it, bring it back here,
and I'll give you a shilling.

616
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,616
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you a half a crown.

617
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,021
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's.
He shan't know who sent it.

618
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,547
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

619
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,490
Mrs. Dilber.

620
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,799
Merry Christmas!

621
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,104
Oh, my God!

622
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,435
He's gone mad!

623
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:01,105
My dear Mrs. Dilber,

624
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:04,710
you're the loveliest creature
I have ever laid eyes upon.

625
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,483
Dance with me, Mrs. Dilber.
Dance with me!

626
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,889
You're barmy, Mr. Scrooge! Unhand me!

627
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:15,518
He's completely deranged! Help!

628
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,554
What a charming woman.

629
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,191
Help!

630
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,995
I shall love it as long as I live.

631
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,300
What an honest face it has.

632
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,210
Hello. Here's the bird.

633
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:34,010
Hello! Whoop!

634
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:37,083
How are you? Merry Christmas.

635
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:42,454
Why, it's impossible to carry that
to Camden Town. You must have a cab.

636
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:46,423
Drive on, my good man!

637
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,372
Hilly-ho! Chirrup!

638
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,776
Hip, hip! Chirry-up!

639
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,809
Bob's your uncle! Fanny's your aunt!

640
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,581
Here's your aunt's fanny.

641
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,923
Live it up, folks!
You'll be a long time dead!

642
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:22,293
Don't let the worms have all the fun.

643
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:31,404
Merry Christmas.

644
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,814
Good morning, sir.
A merry Christmas to you.

645
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,946
- And to you, sir.
- Happy holiday!

646
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,149
And a merry Christmas to you.

647
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,558
- "God bless you, sir."
- Thank you, sir.

648
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:54,723
Glad tidings.

649
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,458
Sir.

650
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:07,432
My dear sir, how do you do?
I hope you succeeded yesterday.

651
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,067
A merry Christmas to you, sir.

652
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,802
Mr. Scrooge?

653
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:17,074
Yes. That is my name, and I fear
it may not be pleasant to you.

654
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,880
But allow me to ask your pardon.

655
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,418
And will you have the goodness...

656
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,795
Lord bless me!

657
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,564
- My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?
- And not a farthing less.

658
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,799
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

659
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,239
My dear sir, I don't know
what to say to such...

660
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:44,177
Do not say anything.
I'm much obliged to you.

661
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:46,772
Many thanks to you. And bless you.

662
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,065
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

663
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:42,968
I'm... his uncle.

664
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,115
Is it an animal that grunts and growls?

665
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,175
Yes.

666
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,708
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

667
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,777
- A horse?
- No.

668
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,845
- A cow?
- No.

669
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,013
A dog.

670
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,182
- A pig.
- No.

671
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,282
An ass.

672
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:07,083
Yes and no.

673
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,456
- I know what it is, Fred! I know!
- What?

674
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:11,522
It's your...

675
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:14,933
Uncle Scrooge?

676
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,795
Well, bless my soul.

677
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:24,303
I've... come to dinner...

678
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,509
...if you'll have me.

679
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,213
Of course, Uncle! Welcome! Welcome!

680
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:39,351
Merry Christmas!
Everybody, this is my uncle, Ebenezer.

681
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,159
Be good and pass this.

682
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,564
Here you go. Enjoy.

683
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:55,201
Next year we must have
this dinner at my house.

684
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:56,710
I insist.

685
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,410
I'll spare no expense. After all,
you can't take it with you, can you?

686
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,076
No, you can't.

687
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:36,811
A full 16 minutes late.

688
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:44,250
What do you mean by
coming here at this time of day?

689
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:48,387
I'm very sorry, sir.
I am a bit behind in my time.

690
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,454
You are, indeed.

691
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,957
Step in here.

692
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:58,832
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

693
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:02,400
It shall not be repeated.
I was making rather merry yesterday.

694
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:05,344
Now, I'll tell you what, Mr. Cratchit.

695
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,872
I'm not going to stand
for this sort of thing any longer.

696
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,281
And therefore...

697
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,750
And therefore...

698
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:17,087
...I am about to raise your salary!

699
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,333
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

700
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:32,667
A merrier Christmas, Bob,
my good fellow,

701
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:35,369
than I've given you in many a year.

702
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:39,676
I'll raise your salary, and do whatever
I can to help your struggling family.

703
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,204
And we'll discuss your affairs

704
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:44,343
this very afternoon
over a bowl of Christmas punch.

705
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:47,149
But first, let's make up the fires.

706
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:48,746
I want you to go out...

707
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:52,118
...and buy another scuttle of coal

708
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,751
before you dot another "I,"
Bob Cratchit.

709
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,761
Off with you, Bob.

710
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,495
We've wassailing to do.

711
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,302
Hilly-ho, Bob!

712
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,363
Yeah. Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

713
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,262
And Scrooge was better than his word.

714
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,993
He did all that he said he would
and more.

715
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:38,238
And to our Tiny Tim, who got well,
Scrooge was like a second father.

716
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:41,332
He became as good a friend,
as good a master

717
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,936
and as good a man
as the good old city ever knew.

718
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:48,906
And it was always said of him
that he knew how to keep Christmas well.

719
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:54,284
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

720
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:57,018
God bless us, everyone.
