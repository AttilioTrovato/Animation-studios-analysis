00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,754
CON LI : <i>Welcome to
our audio commentary</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,173
<i>on our film</i> Treasure Planet.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,509
<i>My name's Roy Conli.</i>
<i>I'm the producer of the film.</i>

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,427
<i>And I'm Ron Clements.</i>

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,847
<i>I'm the co-director and co-writer
of the film.</i>

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>And this is John Musker,
the other co-director/co-writer.</i>

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:21,063
<i>Hi. I'm Glen Keane.
I'm a supervising animator at Disney,</i>

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:26,401
<i>and my job on this film was to design
and animate the character John Silver.</i>

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>Hi. I'm John Ripa, and I was
supervising animator on Jim Hawkins.</i>

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>Hi. I'm Ian Gooding. I'm the associate
art director on</i> Treasure Planet,

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:40,207
<i>and hopefully I can give you
some insight into how color is done</i>

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,378
<i>on a Disney animated feature
during the course of this commentary.</i>

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,005
MUSKER: <i>The entire prologue here,</i>

14
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,217
<i>we actually changed around
during the course of production,</i>

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>in that it used to take place...</i>

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:56,056
<i>The story used to be told first-person.</i>
<i>Jim was the adult narrator of this story,</i>

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>and he sort of pulled us into it,
but we discovered through the course</i>

18
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,645
<i>of some previews and whatnot
that it was playing kind of dark,</i>

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,647
<i>and we didn't have Jim
as a character involved in it,</i>

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,942
<i>so fairly late into production,
we reworked this opening</i>

21
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>such that we see young Jim as a child.</i>

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,322
<i>We don't hear Jim
as an adult narrator anymore,</i>

23
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>we hear Tony Jay who is...</i>

24
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,953
<i>Those of you voice recognition experts
from the FBI know</i>

25
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,082
<i>he was the voice of Frollo
in</i> Hunchback,

26
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>in which Roy worked closely with Tony</i>

27
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,961
<i>and knew him from theatrical days
as I understand it.</i>

28
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,879
CLEMENTS: <i>Great voice.</i>
MUSKER: <i>Exactly.</i>

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,761
CLEMENTS: <i>Now we see young Jim,
little five-year-old Jim Hawkins.</i>

30
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>Voices of Laurie Metcalf
and Austin Majors,</i>

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>who is the little kid on</i> NYPD Blue,
<i>he plays Dennis Franz's son.</i>

32
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,271
CONLI: <i>You should talk
about the recording.</i>

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,355
MUSKER: <i>Yes, he was recording</i>

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,065
<i>in the same room
that we're in right now, actually,</i>

35
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,860
<i>and he was funny 'cause we had
Glen Keane in here working with him</i>

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>'cause Glen really works well
with children</i>

37
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>and was gonna animate some of this,</i>

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,741
<i>and we wanted to get him involved
in the recording,</i>

39
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>and so Austin was all over the place,</i>

40
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,996
<i>so they had to put tape on the floor,
"Austin, stay by the tape, "</i>

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,625
<i>and it was an interesting
recording session.</i>

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,251
KEANE: <i>This was fun for me</i>

43
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>because after doing Long John Silver
for the whole film,</i>

44
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:14,009
<i>to get a chance to do something cute,</i>

45
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,595
<i>it wasn't supposed to
look mean and ugly.</i>

46
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>It was a nice change.</i>

47
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,849
RIPA: <i>Yeah, well,
we certainly appreciated</i>

48
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,893
<i>and needed your help at the time.</i>

49
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,436
MUSKER: <i>Jim's mother, Sarah,</i>

50
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,229
<i>it was an interesting
acting challenge for us</i>

51
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,982
<i>because we wanted to find someone
whose voice was old enough</i>

52
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,567
<i>that you bought as his mother,
and yet young enough</i>

53
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,195
<i>because she had Jim at an early age.</i>

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>And Laurie Metcalf was special to us in
that she could play the maternal thing,</i>

55
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,037
<i>but she could get this sort of weariness
of being the single mother</i>

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,164
<i>who really had to make ends meet
on her own,</i>

57
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,752
<i>and yet a kind of vulnerability
underneath the kind of toughness</i>

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,338
<i>that she had to acquire to be
her own woman.</i>

59
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,841
<i>Sarah's clean-up,
that is the refined drawings done</i>

60
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,178
<i>over the rough animator's drawings
was done by Vera Pacheco,</i>

61
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,640
<i>a wonderful draftsperson
and the woman who, in fact,</i>

62
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,352
<i>supervised all of the clean-up
animation on the entire movie.</i>

63
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,020
<i>And Vera did a wonderful job</i>

64
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:11,608
<i>of really giving us
such a rich-looking, well-drawn film.</i>

65
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,695
<i>It had to be crafted particularly well.</i>

66
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,739
<i>It's being blown up
to large format systems,</i>

67
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,243
<i>and every little nuance
shows up on those big screens,</i>

68
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,329
<i>and we've been delighted to see
how solid the drawing is,</i>

69
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>and our hats are off to Vera
for the great job she did on this movie.</i>

70
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,673
CONLI: <i>This was actually...</i>
<i>As we said we changed the story.</i>

71
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,218
<i>John had this idea of doing this
whole thing with the storybook,</i>

72
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,638
<i>making this pop-up book,
which wasn't part of the original thing,</i>

73
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>and then we take this into
the transition to Jim Hawkins.</i>

74
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,226
<i>He's now 15-years-old.</i>

75
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>We added that title
just in case you didn't know</i>

76
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,398
<i>that it was several years later.</i>

77
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,984
RIPA: <i>This section was a lot of fun.</i>

78
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,112
<i>Jin Kim, who was one
of the animators on the character,</i>

79
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,322
<i>did such an outstanding job.</i>

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,408
<i>These scenes were very difficult.</i>

81
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,411
<i>They dealt
with a three-dimensional board,</i>

82
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>which, a lot of times,
he had to indicate beforehand,</i>

83
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,583
<i>3-D moving backgrounds.</i>

84
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,545
<i>He just really took to it
and did such a fun job.</i>

85
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,382
<i>The sequence, overall,
was just a lot of fun to design</i>

86
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>and come up with movements
and poses, it really uses a lot of things.</i>

87
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>It kind of went X Game crazy, I guess,
where there's sky surfing,</i>

88
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,811
<i>there's windsurfing, there's
skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing.</i>

89
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>It kind of incorporates
a little bit of everything.</i>

90
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,651
<i>Also, Anthony Wong, Mike Cedeno,
John Pomeroy</i>

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,195
<i>did these few scenes here.</i>

92
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,198
<i>Um, Danny Galieote,
some of the other animators</i>

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,449
<i>that worked on the character</i>

94
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>and just did a nice job,
everybody matching each other,</i>

95
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,536
<i>and clean-up did a nice job</i>

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,413
<i>because everybody does draw
a little bit different.</i>

97
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>No matter what you do, everybody
has their set way of drawing.</i>

98
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>And did a nice job pulling the character
into a consistent range.</i>

99
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,633
GOODING: <i>Establishing shot of the
Benbow Inn, painted by Carl Jones.</i>

100
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,095
<i>Really interesting 70/30 rule
that we had,</i>

101
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:10,143
<i>which was 70% 18th century mostly,
and 30% science fiction,</i>

102
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:14,481
<i>so we have half-timbered houses
with all sorts of techie stuff on them.</i>

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,737
CONLI: <i>And here we introduce
Doctor Doppler, David Hyde Pierce.</i>

104
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>This part was written
with David Hyde Pierce in mind.</i>

105
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,493
MUSKER: <i>Ironically, then we tested
a bunch of other actors</i>

106
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,036
<i>before coming back
to David Hyde Pierce.</i>

107
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>Why we did that, I don't know exactly.</i>

108
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,415
CONLI: <i>Because it's your prerogative.</i>
MUSKER: <i>I know.</i>

109
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,336
CONLI: <i>Well, we wanted to make sure,
but he was definitely right for the part.</i>

110
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,089
<i>Although, we struggled a little bit
trying to get the right feeling,</i>

111
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,007
<i>and this bit here with the little girl,</i>

112
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>this was added, actually,
fairly late in the game.</i>

113
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,763
<i>We felt we needed
a better introduction to Doppler.</i>

114
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,098
(SCREAMS)

115
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,141
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we had a meeting
with some other writers</i>

116
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,687
<i>and story people to kick around
ideas for punching up his introduction.</i>

117
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,189
<i>Baird and Gerson,
if I've got their names straight,</i>

118
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>they did some writing in this area,
some of which is here.</i>

119
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,986
<i>And David certainly was
a great improv guy,</i>

120
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,238
<i>so some of his funniest dialogue
throughout the film,</i>

121
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,824
<i>and even in this section,
were things that he winged in,</i>

122
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,785
<i>and he was just great,
great to work with, funny.</i>

123
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,453
Ooh. . . Wrong turn.

124
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,290
- Okay. Thanks for the lift, guys.
- Not so fast.

125
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:19,713
RIPA: <i>Joey Gordon-Levitt did the voice
of Jim, and that was just really a treat.</i>

126
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,715
<i>He did such a good job.</i>

127
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,467
<i>One of the things, as supervising
animator that you get to do,</i>

128
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,845
<i>which is really cool, is you get to go
to the recording sessions,</i>

129
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,933
<i>and watching Joey record the lines
was really inspiring.</i>

130
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,644
<i>He has a good, strong range,</i>

131
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,606
<i>and I always felt like
he put a lot of emotion into it.</i>

132
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,693
<i>There were some scenes that he did
that were so explosive,</i>

133
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,322
<i>and you're just chomping at the bit.</i>
<i>You really can't wait to get to them.</i>

134
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:51,036
<i>And another thing that he did
that I really was inspired by</i>

135
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,330
<i>was you felt he believed
in the character,</i>

136
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,751
<i>and he had a certain take
on the character,</i>

137
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:03,173
<i>and if lines came up that he wasn't
comfortable or sure about,</i>

138
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,718
<i>where it didn't feel like the character,
he'd try and improve them,</i>

139
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>and come up with lines
that he could believe</i>

140
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>were coming from this character.</i>

141
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>And that's kind of what we do as a
supervisor when we approach a scene,</i>

142
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,395
<i>is to try and find something
that's true to the character,</i>

143
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,190
<i>and something that you believe in
and feels right.</i>

144
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,902
<i>And to watch him doing
the same things at the voice level,</i>

145
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:29,074
<i>really helped to set up and inspire me
and our team, I think,</i>

146
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,868
<i>for the scenes that we
were going to do.</i>

147
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,204
Jim?

148
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,206
Jim, look at me.

149
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,585
CONLI: <i>We added this bit
with Jim helping clear the tables</i>

150
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,796
<i>just to make him
a little more sympathetic.</i>

151
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,049
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, this was John Ripa's
idea to make Jim a little more active.</i>

152
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,884
<i>He's actually helping his mother out
in the end, here,</i>

153
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,302
<i>rather than just standing there
kind of moping.</i>

154
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,306
<i>We wanted to make him more active
to build a little sympathy for him.</i>

155
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,767
<i>In the earlier versions of the story,
he used to just sort of walk out</i>

156
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,311
<i>in the middle of their conversation.</i>
<i>She'd turn around and he was gone.</i>

157
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,855
<i>That seemed maybe a little</i> too <i>rude,</i>

158
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>so we reworked it where he stayed
there in the scene.</i>

159
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,368
CONLI: <i>Lot of discussion about this
and the off-screen conversation</i>

160
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>and what Sarah would say.</i>

161
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,082
MUSKER: <i>I thought it was more
emotional to have Jim be listening,</i>

162
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,291
<i>and hear himself discussed.</i>

163
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,169
<i>It just seemed like that if you're a kid
and you're hearing your parents</i>

164
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,922
<i>talk about you or adults talk about you,
they're not aware of it,</i>

165
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>and you're overhearing this,
and they can speak frankly</i>

166
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,802
<i>about what they feel about you,
but you're on...</i>

167
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,013
<i>We sort of see his face
as he's hearing this,</i>

168
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,056
<i>we just thought this was a way
of getting inside his head</i>

169
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,183
<i>and feeling a little more
sympathy for him.</i>

170
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,061
<i>This dialogue used to be played
in a scene where he wasn't there,</i>

171
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,690
<i>and we just felt it was good
to play the dialogue off his face.</i>

172
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,484
CONLI: <i>There was also a question,
like the father thing,</i>

173
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:51,114
<i>this was the first real reference
to the father and that he's not there.</i>

174
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,200
<i>It was a big question about how much
to say at this point,</i>

175
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,287
<i>how much to reveal, and how much
to reveal in the course of the story</i>

176
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,959
<i>because Jim's loss of his father
is a big part of his problem,</i>

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,464
<i>but we didn't want to say it all</i> too <i>early.</i>

178
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,632
MUSKER: <i>We've got
Billy Bones' entrance here,</i>

179
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,134
<i>who is voiced by Patrick McGoohan,</i>

180
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,762
<i>who those of you fellow boomers know</i>

181

<i>from</i> The Prisoner

Braveheart, <i>more recently.</i>

183

<i>And</i> The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh.

184
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,062
<i>So, it was a big geek fest for all of us
baby boomers</i>

185
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,191
<i>to be recording Patrick McGoohan,
who came in and was actually having</i>

186
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:30,695
<i>a very bad cold, was very phlegmy
and coughy, and it worked well</i>

187
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>with things like this,
with his coughs of...</i>

188
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,157
CONLI: <i>He loved doing that coughing.</i>

189
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,325
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, 50 different coughs.</i>

190
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,994
CONLI: <i>I think he did... We could have
10 minutes of. that cough.</i>

191
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,707
KEANE: <i>Nancy Beiman, who did
this Billy Bones character,</i>

192
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,001
<i>she researches everything.</i>

193
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:51,508
<i>This character was truly a believable,
organic character.</i>

194
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,928
<i>She developed his whole planet
where he had come from.</i>

195
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>He's kind of from a turtle planet.</i>

196
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,100
<i>The way the neck comes out,
she had worked on all the anatomy.</i>

197
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,312
<i>Everything that she put into him,
there's nothing by chance on this guy.</i>

198
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,440
<i>And she's a pretty good example
of all the animators,</i>

199
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:12,403
<i>how everybody takes these characters
so seriously. These are real to them.</i>

200
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,823
And there he'll be, just the way he was.

201
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:18,284
A smiling, happy little boy,
holding a new pet

202
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,745
and begging me to let him keep it.

203
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,414
CONLI: <i>We used to have a line here
when Doppler opened the door</i>

204
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,875
<i>where he said,
"In the dream, is the pet dead?"</i>

205
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,545
<i>Which was John's line,
but as it played,</i>

206
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>it almost seemed like the audience was
ahead of it, and we didn't need the line.</i>

207
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,634
MUSKER: <i>And this is funny
'cause some people thought</i>

208
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,802
<i>when Billy said, "My chest!"</i>

209
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,054
<i>Like you got shot in the chest,
and if you look at the chest,</i>

210
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,682
<i>that spelling almost spells "Ron"
backwards and upside-down.</i>

211
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,475
CONLI: <i>Not deliberately,
it just sort of came out that way.</i>

212
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,435
MUSKER: <i>I think there will be
several lawsuits involving that</i>

213
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>by the time you hear this commentary.</i>

214
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,313
CONLI: <i>By Ron?</i>

215
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,940
MUSKER: <i>Yeah. By someone.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

216
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,819
CON LI : <i>This was where we had our
first</i> Star Trek <i>joke in the movie.</i>

217
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,156
<i>There used to be Doppler examine
Bones and then he said the line,</i>

218
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,323
<i>"He's dead, Jim."</i>

219
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,826
<i>And it was a funny line
and some people really liked it,</i>

220
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
<i>but it felt like it wasn't right
for what was going on there,</i>

221
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,124
<i>the emotion was</i> too <i>serious,
so we took the line out.</i>

222
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,627
MUSKER: <i>These holo-blinds here
that sort of work like venetian blinds,</i>

223
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,380
<i>but they show off a different scene.</i>

224
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,924
<i>Tina Price,
our assistant artistic coordinator,</i>

225
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,053
<i>was involved in developing this idea,
as was Ian Gooding and Andy Gaskill,</i>

226
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,764
<i>and Dave Tidgwell on effects,</i>

227
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:27,103
<i>and it really was a fun visual way
to mask the bleak planet outside.</i>

228
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,980
<i>And I'll tell you, at one point
we had more different scenes</i>

229
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,064
<i>that they went through, I think,</i>

230
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,483
<i>where again, in the interest of time,
we don't have as many,</i>

231
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,320
<i>but we just liked the idea
that it was sort of</i>

232
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,697
<i>an analogous thing to a phenomenon
people know,</i>

233
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>venetian blinds
with sort of a sci-fi twist to it.</i>

234
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,993
CONLI: <i>I like to call them
Venutian blinds.</i>

235
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,620
MUSKER: <i>Venutian blinds, right.</i>
<i>Venutian blinds.</i>

236
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,872
CLEMENTS: <i>We also used to have
a scene, a kind of dramatic scene</i>

237
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,375
<i>where the window
was blown to pieces,</i>

238
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,754
<i>shattered by the pirates
as they're bursting in the Benbow.</i>

239
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,215
<i>We took that out for various reasons,
but you will notice</i>

240
00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>that the window is there in the one
Doppler shot, and now it's shattered,</i>

241
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,390
<i>but we never actually
saw it shatter on screen.</i>

242
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,893
CONLI: <i>He's been bellyaching
about this for three months now.</i>

243
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,146
CLEMENTS: <i>I always liked that shot.</i>
<i>I always liked that shot.</i>

244
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,192
MUSKER: <i>Doppler's observatory.</i>

245
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,946
<i>A lot of the interior is based
on drawings that Michael Spooner did,</i>

246
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>and they were really just trying to
set up this sort of eccentric bachelor,</i>

247
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,994
<i>but it had to serve different masters
in that we wanted Doppler</i>

248
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,080
<i>to be wealthy enough that he could
finance the expedition,</i>

249
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,791
<i>so we wanted a certain opulence
and scale to the place,</i>

250
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,045
<i>but also this sort of eccentricity and
this sort of scientific overlay to it all,</i>

251
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,589
<i>and we went through
a number of stages,</i>

252
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,799
<i>and yet we didn't want it to seem...</i>

253
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,426
<i>Some of the earlier drawings were
</i>too <i>cartoony, and we wanted it to fit</i>

254
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,096
<i>the rest of the style of the film
and not make it stand out.</i>

255
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,598
<i>So that was a bit of a struggle
for us to come up with something</i>

256
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:51,562
<i>that served all those ends, and
ultimately, I think it accomplished that</i>

257
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,023
<i>but it took a while to get there.</i>

258
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,693
<i>This is sort of a tour de force
of the effects animation</i>

259
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,528
<i>Dave Tidgwell
and his team supervised.</i>

260
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,029
<i>And Bill Konersman,
one of the effects guys,</i>

261
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,950
<i>worked on this for quite a while,
and just tried...</i>

262
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,952
<i>It was a fun sequence,
although it was one of those things,</i>

263
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,954
<i>in storyboards and in the script,</i>

264
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,289
<i>you're like,
"You have to take our word for it,</i>

265
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,832
<i>"it's gonna look really cool
when it's done.</i> <i>"</i>

266
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>And people sometimes didn't realize
that, but it turned out really well, I think.</i>

267
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,215
GOODING: <i>Now, one of the interesting
things in the movie, color-wise,</i>

268
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,468
<i>is that we don't
use the color green a lot</i>

269
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>because it associates
only with Treasure Planet,</i>

270
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,726
<i>so whenever you see green,
it represents good and moral,</i>

271
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>and comfortable and, obviously,
exotic because Jim's home world</i>

272
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,149
<i>doesn't have any green,
so when you see the map,</i>

273
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,736
<i>it's all green
associating with Treasure Planet.</i>

274
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,988
This is the answer
to all our problems.

275
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,282
MUSKER: <i>There was a whole issue
of the flicker in the room,</i>

276
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,451
<i>we wanted this to feel
like it was a fire-lit room,</i>

277
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
<i>but the first pass on this,</i>

278
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,121
<i>it was so violent,
it seemed like the room was in flames,</i>

279
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,499
<i>and we had to go back several times
like, "</i>Too <i>much.</i> <i>" "Not enough.</i> <i>"</i>

280
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,461
<i>And Tom Baker
and his scene planning crew</i>

281
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,922
<i>had to really back up
and go through this.</i>

282
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,052
CLEMENTS: <i>People take things like the
flicker for granted, but it was not easy.</i>

283
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,305
<i>It had to be redone several times
for continuity.</i>

284
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,183
MUSKER: <i>We did have to rewrite
this scene sometimes, too,</i>

285
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,893
<i>because we... There was a question,</i>

286
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>"Why does Sarah let him go
on this big expedition?"</i>

287
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,774
<i>And we were rewriting
a number of times.</i>

288
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,650
CONLI: <i>This particular joke...</i>

289
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,194

<i>Early on, we had this.
This was an adlib by David, right?</i>

<i>And it made the film, got great laughs,</i>

293
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,040

as well as his acting skills,</i>

310
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,208
<i>and people would just
study his scenes.</i>

311
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,918
<i>He was tough on his crew,</i>

312
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,587
<i>people working with him
had a high standard to live up to,</i>

313
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,757
<i>but it was always a thrill for us
to see his scenes</i>

314
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:30,179
<i>'cause they just were dazzling in their
technical mastery and acting chops.</i>

315
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,557
CONLI: <i>Here comes
the momma kahuna of all.</i>

316
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,766
CLEMENTS: <i>One of the
biggest shots in the movie.</i>

317
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,892
CONLI: <i>CGI shots.</i>

318
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,687
CLEMENTS: <i>Probably took,
how long to do this shot? Two years?</i>

319
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
CONLI: <i>Yeah, two years easy.</i>

320
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,189
CLEMENTS: <i>More than several days,
I think, yeah.</i>

321
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,692
MUSKER: <i>Peter Clarke really did
some great visual development on this,</i>

322
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,569
<i>one of our designers.</i>

323
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,825
GOODING: <i>Amazing model
built by Thomas Debitus.</i>

324
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,910
<i>Incredibly fun concept, I thought.</i>

325
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,164
<i>This was one of the earliest concepts
that the directors came up with,</i>

326
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:00,918
<i>and l just think it's a really fun,
magical storybook conceit</i>

327
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,796
<i>that the moon is really just a crescent,</i>

328
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,842
<i>and one of the things that really
attracted me to the movie, initially.</i>

329
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,636
KEANE: <i>Rick Maki
is a character designer</i>

330
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,431
<i>who worked on this movie
almost as long as we did.</i>

331
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,183
<i>Rick did, literally,
thousands of drawings.</i>

332
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>He did aliens
of every possible persuasion.</i>

333
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,606
<i>And this spaceport sequence
was sort of a tour de force</i>

334
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,527
<i>where we tried to dig out as many
of these great Rick Maki concoctions.</i>

335
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,071
<i>Some have got tentacles, some fly,
some walk, whatever,</i>

336
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,158
<i>but Rick,
just a brilliantly inventive mind.</i>

337
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,869
Familiarity breeds,
well, contempt, but in our case...

338
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,748
Look, let's just find the ship. Okay?

339
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,251
MUSKER: <i>This is our special
Hitchcockian cameo.</i>

340
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,046
<i>That skinny, frail robot up there
is me, John.</i>

341
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,466
CLEMENTS: <i>And the little, hairy,
red-haired guy is me, Ron.</i>

342
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,677
<i>It started with</i> Aladdin <i>accidentally.</i>
<i>We did a little cameo in</i> Aladdin,

343
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,012
<i>and then we did one in</i> Hercules,
<i>so we felt</i>

344
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,847
<i>-we had to do one in this,</i> too.
- MUSKER: <i>We did the dialogue</i>

345
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>here, as well, as we did in those.</i>

346
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,601
-'<i>'Second berth on your right.</i> <i>"
</i>-'<i>'You can't miss it.</i> <i>"</i>

347
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,353
MUSKER: <i>Boy. ls that acting?</i>

348
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>- Don't answer that question.</i>
- CLEMENTS: <i>Okay.</i>

349
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,733
MUSKER: <i>So, this is our ship,
the</i> Legacy,

350
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,109
<i>that went through many name changes</i>

351
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,612
<i>on the course of arriving
where it was here.</i>

352
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,782
CLEMENTS: <i>I think we had a contest
at some point to name the ship.</i>

353
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,701
<i>Originally, we toyed with the idea
of using the</i> Hispaniola,

354
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,744
<i>which is the name
of the ship in the book.</i>

355
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,038
MUSKER: <i>I wanted to use that name.</i>
CLEMENTS: <i>John wanted to do that.</i>

356
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,289
<i>I didn't want to use that.</i>

357
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,457
MUSKER: <i>I wanted to.</i>

358
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,585
CLEMENTS: <i>Finally, we ended up
with</i> Legacy, <i>which I think</i>

359
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,715
<i>it was Glen Gagnon who came
up with the</i> Legacy.

360
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,801
MUSKER: <i>That was his legacy.</i>
CLEMENTS: <i>Exactly.</i>

361
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,720
<i>And we should talk a little bit
about Mr. Snuff,</i>

362
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,599
<i>the voice of that and the animation
is done by Adam Dykstra.</i>

363
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,686
<i>One of the rare cases
where an animator actually</i>

364
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,647
<i>animates the character
and supplied the voice.</i>

365
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,232
<i>How he did it, we're not quite sure.</i>

366
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,068
<i>I think that he used this stuff called Gak</i>

367
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,488
<i>but he was always by himself
in the recording session,</i>

368
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,615
<i>so we don't know for sure.</i>

369
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,159
MUSKER: <i>Captain Amelia,
voiced by Emma Thompson.</i>

370
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,246
<i>Emma was great to work with,
and animated by Ken Duncan,</i>

371
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,582
<i>one of the best draftsmen at the studio.</i>

372
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,543
<i>We recorded all of her, I guess,
in London,</i>

373
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,088
<i>and she really came into the sessions,
having looked at the lines,</i>

374
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,757
<i>and with ideas for rewrites,
and it was always fun working with her,</i>

375
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,136
<i>because we sat down
and actually hashed out the lines.</i>

376
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,555
CLEMENTS: <i>She's a great writer
as well as an actress.</i>

377
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,100
CONLI: <i>Literally, we would sit down
each sequence at a time, go through it,</i>

378
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,644
<i>-and then go into the recording booth.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>

379
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,854
CONLI: <i>Always beplussed us.</i>

380
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,648
MUSKER: <i>Right. She came up
with a particular word or something</i>

381
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>that would just make it
very British, very precise,</i>

382
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,696
<i>and very much in character for her.</i>

383
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,533
<i>Captain Amelia, the captain of the ship,
is based on Captain Smollett</i>

384
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,285
<i>from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel.</i>

385
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,620
<i>Of course, in the novel, he's a man,</i>

386
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,664
<i>as, I think, just about all ship captains
were in that era.</i>

387
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,499
<i>Ted and Terry,
Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio,</i>

388
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,461
<i>when they did their treatment
based on Ron's original treatment,</i>

389
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,172
<i>thought the captain could be a woman,
sort of a woman alien,</i>

390
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,091
<i>and I think they described her as a
bird-like alien in their original treatment</i>

391
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,636
<i>but we liked the idea
of a female captain.</i>

392
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,846
<i>It just gave a whole twist to the story,</i>

393
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,308
<i>and we then wrote the part
with Emma Thompson in mind,</i>

394
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
<i>never knowing whether or not
she would do it,</i>

395
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,353
<i>but her kind of wittiness,</i>

396
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,105
<i>and take-chargeness,
and authoritativeness</i>

397
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,318
<i>and intelligence, we thought would be
great coupled with this sort of..</i>

398
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>And there's an element of Emma Peel
in there, slightly...</i>

399
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,114
CLEMENTS: <i>I remember in the
first draft of the script,</i>

400
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,033
<i>we described Amelia as a combination</i>

401
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,577
<i>between Emma Peel
and Mary Poppins.</i>

402
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,915
<i>And there's still a little of that, I think,
that comes through.</i>

403
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,334
GOODING: <i>This set
is Amelia's state room.</i>

404
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,672
<i>We tried to come up
with a very soft lighting situation,</i>

405
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,716
<i>so that the characters
would not require tones.</i>

406
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,179
<i>Tones are the shadows
on the actual characters</i>

407
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,850
<i>that render them more dimensional,
and they take a lot of time,</i>

408
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:49,522
<i>and since this movie had a lot
of very cool effects sequences,</i>

409
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,943
<i>we didn't want to tie up the effects
people with doing</i> too <i>many tones,</i>

410
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,112
<i>so we tried to come up
with lighting situations</i>

411
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,531
<i>that would be better without the tones,</i>

412
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,784
<i>rather than having a movie
that just looked cheap.</i>

413
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,828
<i>Um...</i>

414
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,914
<i>We have a nice sort of
photographic light effect</i>

415
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,959
<i>happening here on the characters,
which we called "overspill, "</i>

416
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,046
<i>which happens when you
take a picture into a light source.</i>

417
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,716
<i>The edges of the characters
and backgrounds</i>

418
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,010
<i>get chewed away a bit
by the light behind them,</i>

419
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,640
<i>which is that sort of nice haze you see
working around the edges.</i>

420
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,560
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes

421
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,894
down to the galley straightaway.

422
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,647
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

423
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,649
What? The cook?

424
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,611
CLEMENTS: <i>So this sequence,
which is actually</i>

425
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>the introduction of John Silver,</i>

426
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>was actually one of the first scenes
animated in the movie,</i>

427
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,492
<i>one of the first to come out of story,</i>

428
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,370
<i>Barry Johnson did the storyboards
on this sequence,</i>

429
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,833
<i>and so a lot of this is some
of the first animation that was done.</i>

430
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>This is like the first scene
that was animated on Silver</i>

431
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,547
<i>'cause Glen Keane, who did Silver,
kind of went in order,</i>

432
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,717
<i>and I think that was the second scene
that was animated.</i>

433
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,720
KEANE: <i>Silver is a
very unique character</i>

434
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,430
<i>in that he's the first time
we've animated</i>

435
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>a character that's traditional
hand drawn and computer generated</i>

436
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,812
<i>in the same character.</i>

437
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>And we really wondered,</i>

438
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,109
<i>"ls the audience going to believe this
character is real?</i>

439
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,654
<i>"ls it going to look like he's got
metal pieces stuck onto him,</i>

440
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:25,075
<i>"and they don't belong, they're not part
of his being? Are they going to buy it?"</i>

441
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>And I was very happy to find that
the biggest challenges with Silver</i>

442
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,584
<i>were not the technical,
sticking a CG part onto him,</i>

443
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,752
<i>but as it should be,</i>

444
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,547
<i>it was the acting, the performance.</i>
<i>How do you make him real?</i>

445
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,720
<i>Right from the start, I knew that I could
do the hand-drawn part,</i>

446
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>but I wasn't going to step into territory
that I wasn't comfortable with,</i>

447
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>and Eric Daniels, who I had worked
closely with on</i> Tarzan,

448
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,647
<i>and he created the deep canvas look</i>

449
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,525
<i>with the jungle being able
to move in dimension.</i>

450
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,277
<i>And I just felt like
this guy is an inventor,</i>

451
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,322
<i>and we need somebody
doing the mechanical arm</i>

452
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>who's not just a technician
and an animator, but an inventor.</i>

453
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,956
CONLI: <i>Probably good to note right
now the performance by Brian Murray,</i>

454
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,749
<i>which is just phenomenal.</i>

455
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,503
<i>It's probably one of the best voice
performances we've had at Disney.</i>

456
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,256
(LAUGHING)

457
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,346
KEANE: <i>Brian's voice, it comes from
somewhere way down inside of him,</i>

458
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:33,644
<i>and he can go from very light
and jovial, feels very sincere,</i>

459
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,606
<i>and just as easily switch
into a dark, ominous side</i>

460
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,651
<i>that you find just as believable,
which had to work for Silver,</i>

461
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,155
<i>that you had to genuinely believe that
this was a man who was torn</i>

462
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:50,119
<i>between the greed and lust
for this treasure</i>

463
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,456
<i>and a genuine compassion that he's
beginning to feel for Jim Hawkins.</i>

464
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,210
CLEMENTS: <i>Mike Show
did the animation on Morph,</i>

465
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,879
<i>and he studied lava lamps.</i>

466
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,841
MUSKER: <i>It was the cross between
a puppy dog and a lava lamp.</i>

467
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,012
<i>Mike didn't have a puppy dog,
but he actually has a little, at the time,</i>

468
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,513
<i>a little son, maybe a year old,</i>

469
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,974
<i>so he tried to get
some of his son's expressions in this.</i>

470
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,143
CONLI: <i>It's like a puppy dog.</i>
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, it is.</i>

471
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,272
<i>And Dane Davis, our sound designer,
who's a great sound designer,</i>

472
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,941
<i>he actually provided
the voice for Morph.</i>

473
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,735
MUSKER: <i>We're about to move
into this area now</i>

474
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,154
<i>where we tried to feature what's called
the virtual set,</i>

475
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,823
<i>where we built this whole
galley in the computer</i>

476
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,993
<i>and then rendered it and painted it
with deep canvas techniques,</i>

477
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,828
<i>such that we could move the camera
around and in it,</i>

478
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,039
<i>and this was sort of a unique use</i>

479
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>because it wasn't
a bravura action scene,</i>

480
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,878
<i>it was more of a personality scene,
and we were trying to build tension</i>

481
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,463
<i>by the way the camera moves
in the scene.</i>

482
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,257
CLEMENTS: <i>There it starts to move,
and that is a three-dimensional set</i>

483
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,509
<i>painted to look
like a painted background.</i>

484
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,721
Who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

485
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,390
KEANE: <i>This moment,
I thought was, for me,</i>

486
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,977
<i>one of the most enjoyable acting
moments I've ever had</i>

487
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,146
<i>working at Disney,
working with you on this one.</i>

488
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,942
RIPA: <i>Yeah, this whole sequence
is interesting, but this scene actually...</i>

489
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:07,613
<i>Normally, the process is
you work on your characters yourself</i>

490
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,115
<i>in your room
at a separate time, usually,</i>

491
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,954
<i>and for that scene,
Glen and I actually worked</i>

492
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,539
<i>on the scene at the same time
at the same desk.</i>

493
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,918
<i>He would go up and do a drawing,
and he'd step back and we'd act it out,</i>

494
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,128
<i>and then I'd step up
and I'd do a drawing.</i>

495
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,382
KEANE: <i>Fortunately, John draws
at his desk standing up.</i>

496
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,425
<i>Everybody else sits in a chair,
but John stands up,</i>

497
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,721
<i>so we can actually do this
tag-team animating pretty easily.</i>

498
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,849
RIPA: <i>Yeah, it was pretty cool,
and this was some of the first</i>

499
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,685
<i>stuff that we did on the character,</i>

500
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,146
<i>and it's so huge
in terms of their relationship,</i>

501
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,440
<i>and the play back and forth.</i>

502
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,568
<i>Just the contact between them
and the interaction,</i>

503
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,531
<i>and keeping it going from this point
'cause it seemed like such a nice setup</i>

504
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,659
<i>between them
that trying to keep that in mind</i>

505
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:58,372
<i>whenever they're on screen and how
they relate and really working together</i>

506
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,251
<i>closely and knowing each other's
characters, I think, really helped.</i>

507
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,714
We're all clear, Captain !

508
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,677
CLEMENTS: <i>Early on, I think we've
always considered that these ships,</i>

509
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,221
<i>we would be using solar power a lot.</i>

510
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,017
<i>The technology of this universe
relies a lot on solar power</i>

511
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,603
<i>and artificial gravity.</i>
<i>Those are two of their big things.</i>

512
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,647
MUSKER: <i>Well, we always said
we wanted this to feel almost like</i>

513
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:28,569
<i>if they had discovered solar power
like in the 17th century</i>

514
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,196
<i>on a major scale
and really developed it,</i>

515
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,282
<i>this was where
they would have gotten then.</i>

516
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>I think Andy Gaskill did some
of the early drawings on this</i>

517
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,703
<i>where he did these sort of hexagonal
patterns in the sails</i>

518
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,372
<i>which we really liked
in terms of just feeling like there was</i>

519
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:44,334
<i>this sort of fiber filament that
was a conduit in these things.</i>

520
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,881
GOODING: <i>We did a lot of research
on the color of ships,</i>

521
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,884
<i>how they were painted
back in the 18th century,</i>

522
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,428
<i>and settled, eventually,
on a white hull for the ship</i>

523
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,057
<i>because, several reasons,
it shows up very nicely</i>

524
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,269
<i>against the dark-colored backgrounds,
and also it picks up color.</i>

525
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:07,399
<i>White is a very good reflector
of what's happening around it,</i>

526
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:12,529
<i>so when it's in a colorful Etherium
that actually reflects onto the hull,</i>

527
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,698
<i>and it's really attractive.</i>

528
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,997
MUSKER: <i>This shot of the ship
with the manta birds swooping by</i>

529
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,750
<i>was based on a painting
that Ian Gooding did of the ship,</i>

530
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,294
<i>and these birds going by,
and it was just a majestic image.</i>

531
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,754
CONLI: <i>It was one of the
really early paintings,</i>

532
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,924
<i>and it really set a tone
for the whole movie.</i>

533
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,717
MUSKER: <i>It was sort of an icon,
and it was just</i>

534
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,094
<i>based on a visual development thing,</i>

535
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,929
<i>and we said, "We've got to get that
image into the movie.</i> <i>"</i>

536
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,764
<i>So we really tried to duplicate
the feeling of that,</i>

537
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,100
<i>and I'm really happy
with the way it turned out.</i>

538
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,144
<i>The manta birds,
animated by Mark Austin.</i>

539
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,395
CLEMENTS: <i>I think there is one frame</i>

540
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,232
<i>that pretty much
matches the painting very closely.</i>

541
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,484
MUSKER: <i>It was really
Ian Gooding's vision of that image</i>

542
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,945
<i>that we really tried to duplicate on film.</i>

543
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,655
CLEMENTS:
<i>Deep canvas space whales.</i>

544
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,699
<i>These are the first characters that
Disney has ever done in deep canvas.</i>

545
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,578
CONLI: <i>Except for the manta birds,
but you don't notice them as much.</i>

546
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,998
<i>These take full advantage of that,
so they're painted like backgrounds</i>

547
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,128
<i>but animated as computer animation.</i>

548
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,463
MUSKER: <i>This scene was
a little bit of a struggle</i>

549
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,800
<i>because Doppler
was gonna be kind of slimed</i>

550
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,260
<i>by these whales and we discussed</i>

551
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,304
<i>what was the funny color
of this sort of slime</i>

552
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,224
<i>and went through various ones
and we wound up with...</i>

553
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,143
<i>This was our funny color.</i>

554
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,313
KEANE: <i>These scenes,
Marc Smith animated, who just became</i>

555
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,942
<i>my right hand man
on animating Long John Silver.</i>

556
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,446
<i>He has a natural appeal.</i>

557
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,575
<i>Appeal is something that I used to hear
all the time</i>

558
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,369
<i>from Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnson,
Eric Larson,</i>

559
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,872
<i>the old guys who did
</i>Pinocchio, Snow White.

560
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>They were always talking about
appeal and sincerity.</i>

561
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,919
<i>And the word "appeal"
I haven't heard as much lately,</i>

562
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,674
<i>and looking at Marc's work,
it reminded me</i>

563
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,968
<i>of how important that is.</i>
<i>It's a natural thing.</i>

564
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:03,432
<i>You're born with this ability to just draw
and all the parts are in the right place,</i>

565
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,269
<i>and you are attracted to that character.</i>

566
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,857
CONLI: <i>It's interesting to note that
in the development process,</i>

567
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,693
<i>both in terms of characters
and backgrounds,</i>

568
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:19,531
<i>that we have about 15, 000 pieces
of artwork that were developed</i>

569
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,951
<i>during the period
before we got into production.</i>

570
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,579
<i>So there's a lot of artwork
that gets generated</i>

571
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,415
<i>just in terms of spawning ideas</i>

572
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:33,712
<i>and massive amounts of character stuff
and background stuff</i>

573
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,214
MUSKER: <i>A lot of this
cast of characters,</i>

574
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,758
<i>we really wanted to get
a range of shapes and sizes</i>

575
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,636
<i>in this supporting cast
of pirates and species.</i>

576
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,721
<i>And Peter De Sève was
fairly instrumental in doing that,</i>

577
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,474
<i>the character designer who did these
really fun designs,</i>

578
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,019
<i>little tentacled people
and huge hulking people</i>

579
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,438
<i>and the spidery guy and all that.</i>

580
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,524
<i>He kicked off a lot of that stuff,
and much of what he did,</i>

581
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>Andy adapted and we adapted
and the animators jumped off from.</i>

582
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,950
CLEMENTS: <i>And Mr. Scroop here,
voiced my Michael Wincott,</i>

583
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,743
<i>who has a terrific voice.</i>

584
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,579
<i>Actually, originally, we had
a different voice for Scroop,</i>

585
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:14,002
<i>a different actor who was doing more
of a raspy, insectoid kind of voice,</i>

586
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,089
<i>and it didn't quite work, I think.</i>

587
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,466
<i>It didn't quite feel right
and so we went with Michael Wincott</i>

588
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,928
<i>and we're not doing anything
to his voice. It's a great voice.</i>

589
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,973
<i>And another one of
the character designers</i>

590
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:29,434
<i>was Eric Pigors who did
a lot of these characters.</i>

591
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:34,481
<i>His style was a little bit reminiscent
of Big Daddy Roth.</i>

592
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,608
<i>People from the '60s
may remember that.</i>

593
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:41,363
<i>And he's particularly represented with
the one alien with the one eye</i>

594
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,282
<i>that sticks out.</i>

595
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,367
MUSKER: <i>That was Eric's design
and we called him Pigors</i>

596
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,953
<i>in honor of Eric himself</i>

597
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,330
CLEMENTS: <i>And we should
mention Mr. Arrow.</i>

598
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,790
<i>We haven't talked about Mr. Arrow,</i>

599
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,625
<i>voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne</i>

600
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,127
<i>who did a great, great job,</i>

601
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,296
<i>and T. Dan Hofstedt did the animation.</i>

602
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,547
MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>

603
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,509
<i>Yeah, we really liked, sort of,
the reserve that he animated with</i>

604
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,096
<i>and gave him that kind of solidity
and stolidity</i>

605
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,348
<i>and really made him...</i>

606
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,101
CONLI: <i>T. Dan's a real genius
at understatement.</i>

607
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,979
MUSKER: <i>Yeah. Yeah, he did
the emperor in</i> Mulan

608
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,523
<i>and found a lot to work with
a little on that as well.</i>

609
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,526
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...

610
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,610
Belay that!

611
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,656
CLEMENTS: <i>You mentioned Jim's
eye mask, which you just sort of notice.</i>

612
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,701
<i>I mean, he's had this little shadow
around his eyes</i>

613
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,786
<i>throughout the movie.</i>
<i>It's kind of a trademark,</i>

614
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,332
<i>along with his jacket that
makes him feel kind of internalized</i>

615
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>and gives that dark,
brooding sort of edge,</i>

616
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:39,338
<i>presumably, the eye mask
actually becomes a thematic element</i>

617
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,922
<i>in the movie.</i>

618
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,554
<i>This section actually
started out much longer,</i>

619
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,348
<i>had a lot more exposition in it.</i>

620
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,308
<i>Then it got taken out.</i>

621
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>We cut it out of the movie
completely at one point</i>

622
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,147
<i>to sort of keep
more mystery about Silver.</i>

623
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,484
<i>And then we ended up putting it
back in, in a much shortened version.</i>

624
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,862
MUSKER: <i>Also our movies are always
running... They have</i> too <i>much story</i>

625
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>or they run</i> too <i>long,
and we wind up having to look for cuts,</i>

626
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,743
<i>and it's always difficult for us
to figure out</i>

627
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,037
<i>what we can cut,
what exposition can you cut</i>

628
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,039
<i>and still make the audience
understand the story.</i>

629
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,208
CLEMENTS: <i>We cut a lot
of exposition from this.</i>

630
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,710
<i>Here he used to talk about Billy Bones,</i>

631
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,879
<i>he talked about
why they needed the Captain</i>

632
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,798
-to <i>run the ship.</i>
- CONLI: <i>You really spelled it out.</i>

633
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,301
CLEMENTS: <i>And now it's pretty much
down to bare basics.</i>

634
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,931
(LAUGHING)

635
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:36,395
<i>This little bit with Morph here where
he turns into a little version of Scroop</i>

636
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,397
<i>was added just as a gag</i>

637
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,234
<i>and it just seemed a way of kind of
de-demonizing Scroop</i>

638
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,611
<i>to sort of make fun of
the bogeyman a little bit here.</i>

639
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,907
<i>So we added this and Mike Show
animated a very funny...</i>

640
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,575
<i>With his little Nijinsky move there.</i>

641
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,703
CONLI: <i>You can see Jim's
eye mask pretty clearly there.</i>

642
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,372
<i>Dark brooding eye mask.</i>

643
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>And Silver's striped pants turned into
a little bit of a nightmare, too,</i>

644
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:03,130
<i>because they were
very difficult to draw.</i>

645
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:04,881
MUSKER: <i>So the clean-up people,</i>

646
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,092
<i>Vera Pacheco,
was pleading with us, "Please don't,</i>

647
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>"let's not do the striped pants
through the whole movie.</i> <i>"</i>

648
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,930
<i>So we found a convenient spot
for him to go into a changing room,</i>

649
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,933
<i>and during the latter half of the movie,
he has remarkably unstriped pants,</i>

650
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,519
<i>which I don't think anyone ever notices.</i>

651
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,521
<i>But he has more than one
pair of pants, right?</i>

652
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,398
CONLI: <i>Sure.</i>

653
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,775
Your father not the teachin' sort?

654
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,735
No.

655
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,405
CLEMENTS: <i>Once again, there was
some rewriting on this scene,</i>

656
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:33,118
<i>just the question of how much to reveal
about Jim's father and what happened,</i>

657
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,912
<i>and how much to leave
for the song to reveal.</i>

658
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,125
<i>It's still leading into this father-son arc,
this surrogate father-surrogate son,</i>

659
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,754
<i>which is kind of what we're building
toward with Jim and Silver.</i>

660
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,966
The captain has put you in my charge,
like it or not.

661
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,845
MUSKER: <i>The montage
that we're entering into</i>

662
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,557
<i>was in the film for a long time,
but originally it had</i>

663
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,685
<i>a different temp song behind it.</i>
<i>It had a U2 song behind it,</i>

664
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,397
<i>and it featured other sort of visuals,
and we went through a lot on that.</i>

665
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,150
<i>Ultimately, Glen Keane
went and re-boarded it</i>

666
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,944
<i>and really changed it around
into what you see now.</i>

667
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>We delved more into Jim's back-story.</i>

668
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,158
CLEMENTS: <i>And even before he
re-boarded it, I think it was Glen's idea</i>

669
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,161
<i>to actually put the song
</i>Iris <i>by the</i> Goo Goo <i>Dolls</i>

670
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,207
<i>in as a temp track instead of
the U2 song, which we did.</i>

671
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,000
CONLI: <i>Glen really brought
Johnny Rzeznik to our attention.</i>

672
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,168
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Johnny Rzeznik</i>

673
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,252
<i>who's the lead singer
of the</i> Goo Goo <i>Dolls</i>

674
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,506
<i>and kind of its central core member,
came in, we met with him.</i>

675
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,217
<i>We discovered that he actually
had a lot in common with Jim,</i>

676
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,677
<i>just in terms of his background,
growing up in Buffalo,</i>

677
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:37,265
<i>and his relationship with his father,
and just a guarded and troubled youth</i>

678
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,309
<i>who sort of came out of it
on the other side.</i>

679
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,145
CLEMENTS: <i>With a mentor's help.</i>
<i>I mean, a lot of parallels.</i>

680
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,355
MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>

681
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,775
<i>And so he performed the song
that he wrote here for us in a room</i>

682
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,486
<i>before he had lyrics,
so he would just lean over Roy, and,</i>

683
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,405
<i>"Hey, " you know, just sort of..
</i>(MUMBLING)

684
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,783
CLEMENTS: <i>He did this sort of
Bob Dylan thing.</i>

685
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,243
MUSKER: <i>A little Bob Dylan-y,</i>

686
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,453
<i>and Angela Lepito
was filming the whole thing.</i>

687
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,789
<i>You can talk to her
about the tape, yeah.</i>

688
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,166
CONLI: <i>The whole idea here
of the flashbacks</i>

689
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,793
<i>was actually Glen Keane's idea.</i>

690
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,545
<i>That wasn't part of the original story.</i>

691
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:10,382
<i>This was originally just sort of
a Disney mentoring sequence,</i>

692
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,927
<i>but Glen had the idea of,
"Let's take this into Jim's past</i>

693
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,137
<i>"and kind of show
what really happened.</i> <i>"</i>

694
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,514
CONLI: <i>I think it's a testament to Glen</i>

695
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,433
<i>because here's the guy
who's the lead animator for Silver,</i>

696
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,311
<i>and then he's able to kind of
get into Jim's mind as well.</i>

697
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,771
MUSKER: <i>Well, the core
of this whole movie</i>

698
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,898
<i>is Jim and Silver, their relationship,</i>

699
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,319
<i>and I think Glen and John were both
intimately involved in developing that.</i>

700
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,990
KEANE: <i>I remember,
I had to storyboard this</i>

701
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,783
<i>and it just wasn't working,</i>

702
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,620
<i>but I felt in my gut
that we had to do these flashbacks.</i>

703
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,583
<i>So I left the studio
and went up to Lake Arrowhead,</i>

704
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:48,128
<i>about two hours from here,
and just sat up there and thought,</i>

705
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:53,008
<i>"Okay, if I was just going to do this
just the way Rzeznik wrote it,</i>

706
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,759
<i>"this is what it would be."</i>

707
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,428
<i>But I wasn't sure if this
was gonna work,</i>

708
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,265
<i>so I called my wife
and I started to describe this,</i>

709
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,058
<i>and there was this silence
on the phone.</i>

710
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,144
<i>I said, "What, you don't like it?"</i>

711
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,229
<i>She said, "No, I'm crying."</i>

712
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,358
<i>"Well, then I'm gonna do it.</i>
<i>That's how it has to be.</i> <i>"</i>

713
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,113
CLEMENTS: <i>I think it's interesting,
Johnny is just amazing</i>

714
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,576
<i>in terms of being able to interpret
the dramatic structure of a film</i>

715
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>into the music.</i>

716
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,623
<i>I mean, he really gets the concept
of what the story is about</i>

717
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,126
<i>and he's able to kind of
transfer that pretty easily into...</i>

718
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>And his lyrics are very strong, I think,</i>

719
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,967
<i>and really express a lot
of the underlying things</i>

720
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,095
<i>that we wanted to get through
in the character of Jim.</i>

721
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,434
MUSKER: <i>We're about to get into
this whole sequence where they...</i>

722
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,563
<i>After Jim sees his father
leaving for the last time,</i>

723
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,982
<i>now Silver invites him on board,</i>

724
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,984
<i>where he's going to
show him the ropes of driving,</i>

725
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>and then Jim takes over.
And I think it was Glen's idea</i>

726
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,072
<i>to really work in
something with a comet</i>

727
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,449
<i>or something that just had
a spectacular visual to it.</i>

728
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:03,161
<i>So that became the basis for this
last little movement within the song</i>

729
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,747
<i>where Jim really takes Silver
kind of on this joy ride</i>

730
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,249
<i>and shows him that
he really knows what he's doing.</i>

731
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,544
CLEMENTS: <i>Sky continuity
was a nightmare.</i>

732
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,546
MUSKER: <i>Maybe we should also
talk about the size of stars,</i> too.

733
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,925
CLEMENTS: <i>Stars and sky.</i>
<i>We've said many times on this,</i>

734
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,804
<i>"If we ever do another movie again,
we don't want to have any sky,</i>

735
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,764
<i>"or any clouds, or any stars.</i> <i>"</i>

736
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,392
<i>It's just</i> too <i>complicated.</i>

737
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,019
<i>And there again,
people take it for granted,</i>

738
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,230
<i>like, if they look the same in every shot,</i>

739
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,982
<i>and they're moving
at the same speed in every shot...</i>

740
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,235
<i>And it doesn't always happen,</i>

741
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:40,532
<i>because somehow continuity
is very, very difficult to keep going.</i>

742
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,284
<i>And this movie, I think, is probably
one of the most complicated</i>

743
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,705
<i>in terms of continuity
and trying to match from shot to shot.</i>

744
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,665
<i>And we had to redo a lot of these skies.</i>

745
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,459
CONLI: <i>Well, basically, you're
just sticklers on continuity.</i> (LAUGHS)

746
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,087
MUSKER: <i>No one will ever notice.</i>

747
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,506
GOODING: <i>Now, this scene
ends up having</i>

748
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,844
<i>a very Brandywine School
of Illustration look to it</i>

749
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:05,140
<i>because of the pool of light that we use
to stage the two characters in.</i>

750
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,101
<i>It's a very nice balance
of warm and cool here.</i>

751
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,354
<i>It sort of spotlights the two characters</i>

752
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,357
<i>and focuses your attention
on them nicely.</i>

753
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,317
CONLI: <i>Well, this is, I think,
some of the best acting</i>

754
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,111
<i>-in the film.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

755
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,904
<i>Rick Hoppe did a number
of these scenes</i>

756
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,072
<i>of Silver and Jim at the beginning</i>

757
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,283
<i>and then Dean Wellins
did the latter half</i>

758
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:28,747
<i>And really just some great
acting moments, I think, from Dean.</i>

759
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,083
<i>This was a subtlety in thought process.</i>

760
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,211
<i>Yeah, Dean Wellins was an animator
who worked at Warner Brothers,</i>

761
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:39,632
<i>and was a schoolmate of
John Ripa's and Sergio Pablo's,</i>

762
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,719
<i>and this is the first Disney film
he's worked on,</i>

763
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,014
<i>and he just was an outstanding talent.</i>

764
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,810
CONLI: <i>The whole Silver team
and the Jim unit was just amazing.</i>

765
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,812
CLEMENTS: <i>That scene of Jim
was just beautifully acted.</i>

766
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,357
<i>And this scene of Silver, I think,
is one of the best scenes in the movie</i>

767
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,902
<i>in terms of how well the acting...</i>

768
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,029
MUSKER: <i>Yeah. It's amazing.</i>

769
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,239
KEANE: <i>And something that we tried
on this picture</i>

770
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,410
<i>was to have a crew, a shared crew,
between John and I</i>

771
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,830
<i>where some of the animators
would do both characters,</i>

772
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,959
<i>just so that they would understand
the relationship that much better.</i>

773
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,920
RIPA: <i>And that, hopefully, yeah,
that that would make</i>

774
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,672
<i>the relationship on screen
come across better.</i>

775
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,301
CONLI: <i>The storm sequence
is a real showcase</i>

776
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:28,264
<i>for our head of layout, Rasoul Azadani,
and head of effects, Dave Tidgwell.</i>

777
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,893
<i>It was great, in terms of doing
an action-adventure movie,</i>

778
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,979
<i>I think it was exciting for Rasoul
to work with virtual sets.</i>

779
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,273
<i>This is the first movie
where we were really able</i>

780
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,943
<i>to move the camera
through environments.</i>

781
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,905
<i>And Rasoul is sort of the equivalent
of a live-action cinematographer,</i>

782
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,658
<i>so it was really a freeing thing for him</i>

783
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,744
<i>to be able to move the camera
wherever we wanted it,</i>

784
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,789
<i>and I think we really take advantage
of it in some of these shots.</i>

785
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,917
<i>And certainly this is
a big, big effects movie,</i>

786
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,753
<i>probably one of the biggest
that Disney's ever done.</i>

787
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:04,008
<i>And Dave and his staff really
responded to that challenge,</i>

788
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,928
<i>and did just sort of magnificent work.</i>

789
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,765
<i>I think we were really blown away
by the work of the effects department</i>

790
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,100
<i>on this film.</i>

791
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,983
CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the reason
for the Etherium</i>

792
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,526
<i>and being able to breathe
in outer space</i>

793
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,153
<i>is so you could do something
like this on an open-deck ship</i>

794
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,656
<i>and it just made it
a lot more fun and visceral</i>

795
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,408
<i>than if they were in
some kind of a spaceship.</i>

796
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,869
CLEMENTS: <i>What would a space
sea adventure be without a storm?</i>

797
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,120
MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

798
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,502
<i>Peter De Mund did
some of the effects here</i>

799
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>with the explosions and all the smoke
trailing off this giant meteor.</i>

800
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,300
<i>I guess the idea for this,
Francis Glebas...</i>

801
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,760
CLEMENTS: <i>Francis Glebas came up
with the giant star shard</i>

802
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,013
<i>that reverses direction</i>

803
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,182
<i>and kind of breaks the sequence
into part one and part two.</i>

804
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:57,020
<i>Part one being the star shards,
part two being the black hole.</i>

805
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,481
CONLI: <i>This sequence really was
a tent pole for us.</i>

806
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,442
<i>We were able to get this
into production really early</i>

807
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,818
<i>because we knew
we wanted this storm.</i>

808
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,403
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it was one of
the first sequences begun,</i>

809
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,990
<i>although it took a long time
because it had all these special effects.</i>

810
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,076
CLEMENTS: <i>Very.</i>
<i>And it's an effects tour de force</i>

811
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,456
<i>with a combination of
2-D effects and 3-D effects.</i>

812
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,833
No, Captain. They're not erratic at all.

813
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,169
CLEMENTS: <i>Those screens are cool.</i>
MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

814
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,756
...followed by the biggest
magilla of them all !

815
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,090
MUSKER: <i>We were told
by Nancy Beiman</i>

816
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,759
<i>that we misused
the word "magilla" here,</i>

817
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,678
<i>but we took our lives
in our hands and said,</i>

818
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,597
<i>"Nancy, we're keeping 'magilla. "'</i>

819
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,224
<i>And she moved to
Savannah, Georgia after.</i>

820
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,021
Aye, Captain. You heard her, men.

821
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,148
Unfurl those sails.

822
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,817
CON LI : <i>Nice little piece of acting
for Arrow back there.</i>

823
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,110
MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

824
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,947
<i>Birdbrain Mary, the little bird on legs,</i>

825
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,573
<i>that was John Mahoney's, I think,
character design.</i>

826
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,408
<i>One of our designers.</i>

827
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,993
CLEMENTS: <i>Although
not originally a female,</i>

828
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,620
<i>I think Ellen Woodbury, the animator...</i>

829
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,121
MUSKER: <i>She saw
something female there.</i>

830
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,706
CLEMENTS: <i>... wanted to have
one female pirate.</i>

831
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,459
<i>And we agreed it would be nice
to at least have one female pirate.</i>

832
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,753
MUSKER: <i>To have the allure
of that woman there, yes.</i>

833
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,422
CLEMENTS: <i>Some people find her
attractive, which is really scary.</i>

834
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,049
MUSKER: <i>Ron, you do.</i>

835
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,801
CLEMENTS: <i>That's pretty scary.</i>

836
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,803
(SCREAMING)

837
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,224
<i>Now we've started to kill off</i>

838
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>some of the more complicated
characters in the movie.</i>

839
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,853
<i>Arrow was very difficult to draw
and clean up.</i>

840
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,939
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there are some
pirates that die during this movie,</i>

841
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,149
<i>and they die in order of
how complicated they are, I think.</i>

842
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,985
<i>The hardest ones to draw
went first,</i>

843
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,363
<i>so once the characters actually
realized they were hard to draw,</i>

844
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,824
<i>they started trying to erase
their own lines, but it didn't...</i>

845
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,743
Captain, the last wave!

846
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,745
Here it comes!

847
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,998
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!

848
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,417
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

849
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,421
MUSKER: <i>As the ship descends down
into the black hole,</i>

850
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,798
<i>this scene actually was quicker
at one time,</i>

851
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,758
<i>and Michael Kelly felt strongly
we needed a beat</i>

852
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,302
<i>that really said,
"They're gone. This is over.</i> <i>"</i>

853
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,806
<i>And so he expanded that time,
and I think that really to its benefit,</i>

854
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,850
<i>that you really have this moment
of suspension</i>

855
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,601
<i>where you're not sure
what's going to happen.</i>

856
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,645
<i>And he really let that hang there
and play out.</i>

857
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:08,192
<i>So all this movement decrescendoed
down into this rest,</i>

858
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,320
<i>and then suddenly exploded out
and made the next part more powerful.</i>

859
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,532
<i>And I think Michael really sort of
went to the wall on that,</i>

860
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,453
<i>retiming that and really trying
to give that its maximum impact.</i>

861
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,456
CLEMENTS: <i>And Michael's
a brilliant editor,</i>

862
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,249
<i>and I think did a great job on this film.</i>

863
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,128
<i>And the most easy-going guy
you could possibly work with.</i>

864
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,631
<i>I mean, just unflappable, really.</i>

865
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,550
<i>MUSKER: It's that lighthearted
Irish thing.</i>

866
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,261
Thank you. Thank you very much.

867
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,722
Well, I have a lot of help
to offer anatomically...

868
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,141
Amanamonically. . . Astronomically.

869
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,977
CLEMENTS: <i>That's a great line,
a very funny line,</i>

870
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,230
<i>written by Rob Edwards,
who joined us fairly early</i>

871
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,316
<i>in the writing process on this film.</i>

872
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,487
<i>He's actually one of the writers
from the sitcom</i> Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

873
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:58,493
<i>And he worked on this movie with us,
writing the script for quite a bit of time,</i>

874
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,204
<i>and did a great job
and was a really big help</i>

875
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,622
<i>in the writing of the movie.</i>

876
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,249
MUSKER: <i>We had to cheat, sort of,</i>

877
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,002
<i>that Arrow's hat hung around
even though he went away</i>

878
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,421
<i>so we'd have a little prop
for them to react to here.</i>

879
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,715
CONLI: <i>Nice editing
by Michael Kelly with the...</i>

880
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,259
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Michael Kelly devised
some of this, the pacing of this,</i>

881
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:19,347
<i>and the round robin of looks
that come up in terms of Jim's guilt.</i>

882
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,268
<i>Michael really had a fine eye for just
the pace and the length of these shots,</i>

883
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,521
<i>and who you go to when.</i>

884
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,900
<i>Right, coming up,
he cooked this relationship up here.</i>

885
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,780
CLEMENTS: <i>And Emma did a great job
on this little...</i>

886
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,657
<i>Eulogy for Mr. Arrow.</i>

887
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,783
A fine spacer,

888
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,954
finer than most of us
could ever hope to be.

889
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,455
CLEMENTS: <i>It used to be
a little longer,</i>

890
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,417
<i>and we actually followed her
all the way back into her...</i>

891
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,503
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there was a scene
where she went into her quarters</i>

892
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,630
<i>and was sort of leaning against
the wall like she was overcome.</i>

893
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,173
CLEMENTS: <i>There was a bit
with Doppler offering to help</i>

894
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,426
<i>and she just can't talk to him,
and goes and closes the door.</i>

895
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,556
<i>It was very emotional, but it seemed
like it took away from Jim's emotion.</i>

896
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,727
MUSKER: <i>Ian Gooding design
of that big nebula.</i>

897
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,437
CLEMENTS: <i>This is a very key
sequence of the movie,</i>

898
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,189
<i>storyboarded by Ken Harsha</i>

899
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,025
<i>who did a beautiful job
on the storyboards of this.</i>

900
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,237
<i>And the animation by
Glen Keane and John Ripa</i>

901
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,073
<i>pretty much reflects a lot
of what was in those boards.</i>

902
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,741
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it's almost
shot for shot.</i>

903
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,913
Why, half the crew would be
spinning in that black abyss...

904
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,083
Look, don't you get it? I screwed up!

905
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,668
CLEMENTS: <i>This was
a pivotal sequence,</i>

906
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,336
<i>I think, that we always
pictured this moment</i>

907
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,338
<i>as the bonding moment
between the two,</i>

908
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,633
<i>and that from this point in the movie,
actually that Silver and Jim</i>

909
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,720
<i>have become father and son.</i>
<i>At least, surrogate father and son.</i>

910
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,348
<i>And that that will remain.</i>
<i>That sort of can't be taken away.</i>

911
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,602
<i>So, this is the moment
where that happens</i>

912
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,689
<i>and that's going to play off a lot
in terms of what happens later.</i>

913
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:56,652
James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya.

914
00:44:56,736 --> 00:45:00,865
KEANE: <i>If there was ever
a sequence that I would love to go</i>

915
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:06,245
<i>and keep trying to make it reach
its potential, it's this sequence.</i>

916
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:11,959
<i>Because it's so deep,
and the emotions that I felt with this</i>

917
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:17,006
<i>were so much tied into my own history
and what happened to me as a...</i>

918
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,928
<i>When I was 18 years old
and my football coach comforted me</i>

919
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,348
<i>in the parking lot one night
after a football game</i>

920
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,894
<i>where I had completely lost
the starting position,</i>

921
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,980
<i>and I felt unjustly treated.</i>

922
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,234
<i>And he came out, and put his hand
on my shoulder and said,</i>

923
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,902
<i>"Glen, you're gonna do great things,</i>

924
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,030
<i>"I'm gonna be there
when you're making that touchdown.</i> <i>"</i>

925
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,700
<i>And, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,
and I had tears in my eyes.</i>

926
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,245
<i>And looked a lot like Long John Silver.</i>

927
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:51,666
<i>It was one of those soul inspirations
for me in this character.</i>

928
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:56,587
<i>And when you're drawing on
an emotion like that, that's so real,</i>

929
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,339
<i>you're setting yourself up for a fall.</i>

930
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:03,261
<i>You're never going to be able
to capture how you felt.</i>

931
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,930
<i>I think we both probably animated
every scene in this</i>

932
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,432
<i>at least two or three times.</i>

933
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:14,772
Next thing ya know,
they'll be saying I've gone soft.

934
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,607
CLEMENTS: <i>The softer side of Silver.</i>

935
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,987
<i>It was tricky, Silver was a very complex
character to deal with</i>

936
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,447
<i>'cause he's part bad guy,
part good guy,</i>

937
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,368
<i>and we were always walking
that tightrope as far as...</i>

938
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,120
MUSKER: <i>Yeah. If he was</i> too <i>nice,
that hurt the story.</i>

939
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,913
<i>If he was</i> too <i>dark,
that seemed to hurt the story.</i>

940
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,499
<i>We really struggled to find
a balance between the two.</i>

941
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,586
<i>This is a very complicated shot,
although it doesn't look like it.</i>

942
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,132
<i>It's a 3-D set combined with
some 2-D elements.</i>

943
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,050
CLEMENTS: <i>This is a lot of
Adam animation, right?</i>

944
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,802
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
Adam Dykstra doing stuff</i>

945
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,930
<i>And Dean Wellins did Jim here,
did some really fine attitudes.</i>

946
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,975
CLEMENTS: <i>Some of the first
animation that Dean did on the movie.</i>

947
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,977
MUSKER: <i>And Mike Show did Morph
through all this.</i>

948
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,521
<i>Mike Show and Jay Jackson
did all of Morph pretty much,</i>

949
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,981
<i>I guess there's a scene here
that other people did,</i>

950
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,234
<i>but Mike really did most of him,
which was great.</i>

951
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,820
<i>Joey Gordon-Levitt
who did a great job on Jim's voice,</i>

952
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,488
<i>he had to say,
"You little squidge, " here,</i>

953
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>and somehow he didn't like
the word "squidge"</i>

954
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,992
<i>and we had to talk him into it,
but Joey...</i>

955
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,119
<i>He loosened up in the course
of the acting process.</i>

956
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,996
<i>In the initial going,
he was kind of reserved.</i>

957
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,082
<i>"What is this all about? I've never acted
without other actors.</i> '<i>' And all this.</i>

958
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,459
<i>But he eventually came
to embrace this,</i>

959
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,670
<i>and just did a wonderful job,
and did improv stuff as well.</i>

960
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,172
CLEMENTS: <i>With Joey,
it was very much like Jim,</i>

961
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,548
<i>that he started out very cautious</i>

962
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,343
<i>and reserved, and then he sort of
opened up more and more</i>

963
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,720
<i>in the course of, like,
several years of recording.</i>

964
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,556
<i>- These things take so long to do.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

965
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,310
(GRUNTS)

966
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,730
GOODING: <i>Now here we see
the 3-D virtual set</i>

967
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,982
<i>relit with a completely different look.</i>

968
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,610
<i>With a sort of nice green light.</i>

969
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,571
<i>Now, everything has turned green
at this point,</i>

970
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,532
<i>so you know you're approaching
Treasure Planet.</i>

971
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,118
CLEMENTS: <i>This whole scene is one
of the tent-pole scenes</i>

972
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,203
<i>from the novel</i> Treasure Island.

973
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,330
<i>Of course, we haven't mentioned
Robert Louis Stevenson</i> too <i>much,</i>

974
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,207
<i>but he was the whole reason
for this going.</i>

975
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,542
<i>And there's the famous
apple barrel scene in there</i>

976
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,545
<i>where Jim Hawkins learns the truth
about Long John Silver,</i>

977
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,047
<i>and this is sort of our homage to that.</i>

978
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,592
<i>And we just felt it was important for Jim
to realize how he's been betrayed,</i>

979
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,552
<i>and we wanted to hang on
to that scene,</i>

980
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,223
<i>so this is sort of our adaptation
of Stevenson's scene.</i>

981
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,560
CONLI: <i>I mean, with the adaptation,
we were fairly faithful</i>

982
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:20,606
<i>to several tent poles in the book,
to kind of maintain that through-line.</i>

983
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,901
CLEMENTS: <i>And you
children at home,</i>

984
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,236
<i>we'd recommend
turning off the tape now</i>

985
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,197
<i>and going and reading the book
because it is actually a great book,</i>

986
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,283
<i>and well-worth reading,
and holds up to this day.</i>

987
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,077
CONLI: <i>It's worth noting
that the three of us</i>

988
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,245
<i>read the book when we were kids</i>

989
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,373
<i>and we fell in love with it,
and that's why the film is what it is.</i>

990
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,417
GOODING: <i>Towards the end
of this sequence,</i>

991
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,710
<i>you'll see that
everything's transitioning</i>

992
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,047
<i>towards a more golden-orange light.</i>

993
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,551
<i>Another difficult sequence to do,</i>

994
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,053
<i>as transitions always are.</i>

995
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,641
<i>Because we have our mutiny
coming up,</i>

996
00:48:55,724 --> 00:49:00,438
<i>and that, we had originally keyed
the mutiny with orange light,</i>

997
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,773
<i>so we needed to somehow
transition to that,</i>

998
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,151
<i>so you see it gradually happening.</i>

999
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:09,530
<i>And it helps to highlight the characters
getting more and more angry, also.</i>

1000
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,743
MUSKER: <i>We're coming up on
the reveal of Treasure Planet,</i>

1001
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,745
<i>which, again, was one of those
slight nightmare shots,</i>

1002
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,789
<i>but David Krentz did some drawings.</i>

1003
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,792
<i>David Krentz was in layout, and
did these beautiful charcoal drawings</i>

1004
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,461
<i>that showed how the planet
might be displayed.</i>

1005
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,795
<i>And then Uma Thumrugoti,</i>

1006
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,131
<i>that was one of the more difficult
names to pronounce on the movie,</i>

1007
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,176
<i>really worked for months in terms of
just getting all that cloud animation</i>

1008
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,553
<i>and the reel of the planet
working just right.</i>

1009
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,015
CLEMENTS: <i>Originally,
we had Silver set down</i>

1010
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,184
<i>his spyglass in the earlier sequence,</i>

1011
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,479
<i>but the way it was staged,
there really wasn't any way to show it.</i>

1012
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,606
<i>But, of course, the bigger question is
why does Silver</i>

1013
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,650
<i>need a spyglass anyway
since he's got this cyborg eye?</i>

1014
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,152
MUSKER: <i>We did record this scene</i>

1015
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,487
<i>with Joey Gordon-Levitt
and Brian Murray</i>

1016
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,988
<i>in the same room at the same time,</i>

1017
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,656
<i>which we also did
in that earlier sequence.</i>

1018
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,326
CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the stuff we did
with the two of them together...</i>

1019
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,329
MUSKER: <i>I think Joey felt strongly
he could play off another actor better,</i>

1020
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,122
<i>and felt less like he was in a void.</i>

1021
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,333
<i>And he was right, it really
brought a lot to the scenes</i>

1022
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,085
<i>to have them both in the same room
and playing off each other.</i>

1023
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,754
CLEMENTS: <i>And they bonded.</i>

1024
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,674
<i>You had the sort of older actor
and the younger actor,</i>

1025
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,259
<i>and they became good friends.</i>

1026
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,428
MUSKER: <i>This scene through
Silver's eye we had to retake</i>

1027
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,681
<i>because the first version of this,
it was all green and obscure.</i>

1028
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,849
<i>You couldn't tell what was going on.</i>

1029
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,185
<i>And we had to sort of rework it.</i>
<i>Dave Tidgwell sort of reworked it</i>

1030
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,103
<i>to make it clear.</i>

1031
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,899
<i>Now we're getting into
pirates as pirates here,</i>

1032
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,860
<i>so we really wanted our homage to...</i>
<i>You know, classic things.</i>

1033
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,239
<i>So pirates start swinging into camera
and storming down,</i>

1034
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>and we have a shot coming up of Silver</i>

1035
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,201
<i>with the Jolly Roger
rising up behind him.</i>

1036
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,828
<i>Very iconic images
we were going for here.</i>

1037
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,206
<i>Brandishing the weapons,
I mean, all these...</i>

1038
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,290
<i>Racing around the deck.</i>

1039
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,708
CLEMENTS: <i>You might notice here</i>

1040
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,336
<i>that Mr. Hands is also
very difficult to draw.</i>

1041
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,380
MUSKER: <i>Here's one of the icons.</i>
<i>That pirate flag was designed</i>

1042
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,799
<i>by Andy Gaskill, our art director.</i>

1043
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,467
I'll see they all hang.

1044
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,969
Doctor, familiar with these?

1045
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,513
Oh, I've seen. . . Well, I've read...

1046
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,599
Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.

1047
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,143
MUSKER: <i>The shot of Morph looking
at his reflection, I think,</i>

1048
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,396
<i>was based on a Roy Disney comment,
where he needed to,</i>

1049
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,399
<i>or wanted to get that set up
more clearly, why Morph was...</i>

1050
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,651
<i>That it was a playful thing
and not a malicious thing.</i>

1051
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,404
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, the idea of Morph</i>

1052
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,740
<i>is that he is just
all feelings and emotions</i>

1053
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:21,036
<i>and no intellect, and really has no idea
of anything that's going on.</i>

1054
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,165
Stop them !

1055
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,086
RIPA: <i>These are our big
submarine-type shots</i>

1056
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,714
<i>where the camera is running through
and the characters are running through</i>

1057
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,549
<i>these tight cornerways
and things like that.</i>

1058
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,219
<i>Shawn Keller had handled Jim
and most of those running ones,</i>

1059
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,889
<i>did a nice job matching
the atmosphere and everything.</i>

1060
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,017
(GRUNTS)

1061
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,771
MUSKER: <i>This is an example
of interactive lighting,</i>

1062
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:51,442
<i>where there's a light source outside
that changes the lighting of the set.</i>

1063
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,611
CLEMENTS: <i>I think Emma
really enjoyed the fact</i>

1064
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,821
<i>that she could play action-adventure.</i>

1065
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,366
<i>She's never really done
an action-adventure movie before,</i>

1066
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:05,289
<i>and she was actually pregnant through
most of the Amelia recording.</i>

1067
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,042
CONLI: <i>She was very happy
she didn't have to get buff</i>

1068
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,003
CLEMENTS: <i>So, we lost several
complicated characters there</i>

1069
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,546
<i>that were very difficult to draw.</i>

1070
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,800
CONLI: <i>So it's a lesson to you, kids,
don't ever be a complicated character.</i>

1071
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,552
MUSKER: <i>You notice Silver's eye</i>

1072
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>changing color
through these sequences.</i>

1073
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,890
<i>He sort of had a mood eye.</i>
<i>When he was in his normal mode,</i>

1074
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,391
<i>and kind of full of blarney, it's yellow.</i>

1075
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:28,604
<i>But as he gets angrier, or more
incensed or whatever, it gets redder.</i>

1076
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,523
<i>So you'll see through
some of this section, it's a red eye,</i>

1077
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,485
<i>and as he softens,
it goes back into the yellow mode.</i>

1078
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:40,324
KEANE: <i>The recording session
between Brian Murray and Joey here</i>

1079
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,327
<i>was just the greatest.</i>

1080
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,038
RIPA: <i>Yeah, we could have stretched
this area out for about 10 minutes.</i>

1081
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,374
<i>They did so much fun stuff</i>

1082
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,459
KEANE: <i>You really felt
like there was this</i>

1083
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,960
<i>competition between the two of them,</i>

RIPA: <i>Yeah.</i>
KEANE: <i>...between each other.</i>

1087
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,347
<i>I felt like this was an animator's film</i>

1088

<i>in that even though there's all kinds
of amazing effects and everything,</i>

1089
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,186
<i>it's still character-centered.</i>

1090
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,232
<i>That it gives you time to really explore
the expressions,</i>

1091
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,733
<i>the attitudes of the characters.</i>

1092
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:19,571

<i>your main character,
and relationships are growing,</i>

1094
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,162

KEANE: <i>Yeah.</i>

1098
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,087
MUSKER: <i>These trees are 2-D
for the most part.</i>

1099
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,340
<i>They're hand-drawn, but a million
levels of them so they get dimensional.</i>

1100
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,591
<i>Except that was 3-D right there.</i>

1101
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,636
<i>So we keep bouncing back and forth
between 2-D and 3-D.</i>

1102
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,388
<i>And this shot was all 2-D.</i>

1103
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,725
<i>It was a challenge because 3-D
is more expensive, takes longer to do,</i>

1104
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,394
<i>and we really had to pick our spots
for our 3-D shots.</i>

CLEMENTS: <i>The basic idea

1111
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,744
<i>that the planet is really
a machine that is covered</i>

1112

<i>-with a bunch of, like, moldy stuff
</i>-MUSKER: <i>Fungi.</i>

1113
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,416
CLEMENTS: <i>Kind of the stuff that
would grow in your refrigerator</i>

1114
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,627
<i>if you left stuff in your refrigerator
over a million years.</i>

1115
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,714
<i>And I actually think
there was research done</i>

1116
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,299
<i>in terms of various bacteria.</i>

1117
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:23,385
MUSKER: <i>When I went to CalArts,
it was our refrigerator that was like that.</i>

1118
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,762
<i>Or was it the bathroom?</i>

1119
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,096
<i>No, it was the refrigerator.</i>

1120
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,974
CLEMENTS: <i>So,
there were subliminal things</i>

1121
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,686
<i>That kind of may hint
that this is not a normal planet.</i>

1122
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,606
<i>Although, until we see the structure,</i>

1123
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:40,152
<i>I think we wanted people to sort of
take it more as just a planet.</i>

1124
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,155
MUSKER: <i>But our layout department,
Rasoul and everybody,</i>

1125
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,158
<i>did a lot of research into
just sort of different vegetation,</i>

1126
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:50,287
<i>and they explored all sorts of fungi
and mold spores,</i>

1127
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,622
<i>-and macro-things.</i>
- CLEMENTS: <i>Coral.</i>

1128
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,624
MUSKER: <i>Little micro-things that
they blew up to huge scale.</i>

1129
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>Yeah, and coral structures.</i>

1130
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,544
<i>And tried to make it sort of
an other-worldly landscape,</i>

1131
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,379
<i>and yet, vegetation.
That was a big thing.</i>

1132
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,964
<i>We wanted to get some green
into the movie.</i>

1133
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,384
<i>We kept green off the color palette
until we got there</i>

1134
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,803
<i>to play up that there was still</i>

1135
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,055
<i>a tropical island analogy
we wanted to get,</i>

1136
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,475
<i>that there was something
almost tropic about this place.</i>

1137
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,561
<i>And to disguise its machine origins,
that it really...</i>

1138
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,104
<i>You wouldn't suspect it, first thing,</i>

1139
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,982
<i>it seemed so organic
that it could be this inorganic place.</i>

1140
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,152
<i>Plus, then we had to design
the alien technology.</i>

1141
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,987
<i>What was this race
that built this planet?</i>

1142
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,197
<i>What was their technology like?</i>

1143
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,573
<i>And we didn't want it to be human stuff,</i>

1144
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,117
<i>so some of the early development
on that seemed a little bit</i>

1145
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,245
too <i>much gears and sprockets,
and we said, "Well, no.</i>

1146
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,330
<i>"It's got to feel more other-worldly.</i> <i>"</i>

1147
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,707
<i>It's a culture that isn't the culture
of the rest of the movie,</i>

1148
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,836
<i>so that was a challenge to find
something that felt different enough</i>

1149
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,212
<i>so that it stood out from that.</i>

1150
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,421
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1151
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,507

1155
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,224
All right. Okay.

1156
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,269
MUSKER: <i>Martin Short,
the voice of B.E.N.,</i>

1157
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,479
<i>noted from all his movies
and everything,</i>

1158
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,023
<i>great improv actor.</i> So <i>we wrote it...</i>

1159
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,192
<i>We tried to take advantage of Martin,</i>

1160
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,986
<i>but certainly he added a lot
in his improv.</i>

1161
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,779
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, we probably
have five times,</i>

1162
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,323
<i>six times as much material for Martin
as anyone in this film.</i>

1163
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,575
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we have
a whole raft of material.</i>

1164
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,951
I am, um...

1165
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,370
My name is, uh...

<i>This gag here, where...</i>

1167
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:19,084
<i>The cuckoo thing was Barry Johnson,
our head of story, his idea,</i>

1168
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,461
<i>his gag, and it gets one of
the biggest laughs in the movie.</i>

1169
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,880
<i>It was Barry's idea.</i>

1170
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,549
<i>B.E.N., in the script,</i>

1171
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,718
<i>we had a whole thing
where he leaked oil inadvertently,</i>

1172
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,554
<i>and that somehow went away
eventually. It was vaguely scatological.</i>

1173
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,848
<i>But somehow, I don't know why
it went away, but it went away.</i>

1174
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:33,932
CLEMENTS: <i>And you still miss it.</i>

1175
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,184
MUSKER: <i>I miss it,
I think we made a mistake.</i>

1176
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:39,396
<i>But, hey, let's just talk about
the mistakes for a while.</i>

1177
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,315
CLEMENTS: <i>This was ad-libbed,
this whole little rant here.</i>

1178
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,942
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
this rant about his therapist.</i>

1179
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,990
<i>Rambling, and very funny Martin
off-the-wall shtick.</i>

1180
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,534
But that means. . . But wait.

1181
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,037
MUSKER: <i>Oskar Urretabizkaia was
the animator for B.E.N.,</i>

1182
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,083
<i>and of Basque Spanish descent
and very difficult-to-pronounce name,</i>

1183
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,710
<i>but he did a great job.</i>

1184
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,880
<i>We were concerned
'cause B.E.N. is a 3-D character,</i>

1185
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,757
<i>but we wanted him to integrate
with the 2-D characters,</i>

1186
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,260
<i>so his animation was meant to be
as cartoony as the other characters.</i>

1187
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,138
<i>And we tried to design him
so he had a line around him</i>

1188
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,264
<i>so he'd fit with the other characters,</i>

1189
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:18,602
<i>but Oskar animated him in a way
that really kept him loose,</i>

1190
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,312
<i>and the guys who built the rig
and all that</i>

1191
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,482
<i>made it very squashy and stretchy
so that it would integrate</i>

1192
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,525
<i>with the other characters.</i>

1193
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,027
<i>That was the goal here, really,</i>

1194
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,529
<i>not to make him feel like he was
from another planet, so to speak.</i>

1195
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,823
CONLI: <i>Yeah, the whole idea
of doing him in 3-D</i>

1196
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,285
<i>was to be able to get the amount
of detail on the character</i>

1197
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,412
<i>but still try and maintain
the squash-and-stretch</i>

1198
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,538
-of <i>the actual...</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>

1199
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,833
<i>Given that he was a robot,
it seemed like a natural fit for 3-D.</i>

1200
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,294
I've lost my mind.

1201
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,089
I've lost my mind.
You haven't found it, have you?

1202
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,634
My missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

1203
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:51,927
Look, B. E. N...

1204

CLEMENTS: <i>We get into
the missing piece idea here,</i>

1205
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,141
<i>which was a little controversial
for a while,</i>

1206
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,519
<i>but is actually thematic.</i>

1207
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,856
<i>Wanted to sort of keep it because
it really ties into the whole movie</i>

1208
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,610
<i>in that sort of every character has
a missing piece in some sense.</i>

1209
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,404
<i>B.E.N.'s is fairly literal,</i>

1210
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,783
<i>but Silver has one in terms of
that he lost his arm.</i>

1211
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,077
<i>- Jim lost his father.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

1212
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,579
I do. Bye-bye.

1214
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:28,797
CONLI: <i>The fact that whenever you're
doing a 2-D and 3-D combination</i>

1215
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,175
<i>it's, from a technical standpoint, for a...</i>

1216
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,802
MUSKER: <i>The worst thing is where
they touch each other.</i>

1217
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,637
<i>Touching and talking,
those are the two big no-no's.</i>

1218
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,182
CLEMENTS: <i>Ironically, that B.E.N.</i>
<i>is such a touchy-feely guy,</i>

1219
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,642
<i>and that's the hardest thing to do.</i>

1220
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,185
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
every time a 2-D drawing,</i>

1221

<i>something that someone drew
on a piece of paper,</i>

1222
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,481
<i>interacts with something
created in a computer,</i>

1223
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,525
<i>it becomes a very difficult task.</i>

1224
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,987
<i>And yet, B.E.N. is a compulsive
sort of grabber and toucher</i>

1225
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,490
<i>and wants to be...</i>
<i>ls desperate at being left alone again.</i>

1226
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,451
<i>So we really wanted him
to be hanging on Jim,</i>

1227
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,619
<i>so that made their jobs
much, much harder</i>

1228

<i>to make that work together.</i>

1229
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,876

good job, I think, there again,</i>

GOODING: <i>Here's another instance
of comedy being extremely difficult.</i>

1233

<i>We went through such pains

<i>trying to get
the funniest possible pattern,</i>

<i>and something that read as underwear,</i>

1236
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:26,396
<i>and hopefully everyone's going to be
in hysterics over that one.</i>

00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,612
<i>through the course of the movie.</i>

1240
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,075
MUSKER: <i>Craig Elliott,
one of the layout artists,</i>

1241
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,327
<i>helped design this alien language</i>

1242
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,163
<i>that you see written on the walls,</i>

1243
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,332
<i>and on the technology here
that built this whole planet.</i>

1244
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,210
<i>This whole planet was built, of course,
as you can surmise,</i>

1245
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,587
<i>by an ancient race of aliens
that abandoned it.</i>

1246
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,006
<i>Who built it for scientific purposes
to explore the universe.</i>

1247
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,050
CLEMENTS: <i>Once again,
we took out a lot of exposition,</i>

1248
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,427
<i>so we leave that to
the audience's imagination.</i>

1249
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,595
<i>But there was a whole back-story...</i>

1250
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,721
MUSKER: <i>I'm sure you're all imagining.</i>

1251
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,014
CLEMENTS: <i>... with this
ancient alien culture</i>

1252
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,101
<i>who built this planet,
and why they built it.</i>

1253
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:10,107
KEANE: <i>Coordinating these kinds
of scenes was a huge challenge,</i>

1254
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,486
<i>where you've got all the pirates firing,
and just how many...</i>

1255
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,697
<i>Sometimes we'd have
up to 12 animators</i>

1256
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,909
<i>in the director's office
on a scene handout,</i>

1257
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,538
<i>and everybody's got to learn their part
and do their character.</i>

1258
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,666
No tricks, just a little palaver.

1259
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,168
CLEMENTS: <i>This is
very much from the book.</i>

1260
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,129
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
another tent-pole scene.</i>

1261
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,382
<i>The negotiation scene between Silver
and in the book, the captain, actually.</i>

1262
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,467
<i>And in our earlier versions,
we had him negotiating with Amelia</i>

1263
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,969
<i>and Jim standing by.</i>

1264
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,887
<i>But Jim is our central character,
it seemed that</i>

1265
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,223
<i>the key relationship was between
Silver and Jim,</i>

1266
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:49,146
<i>so we reworked the scene to feature,
again, their sort of challenge</i>

1267
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,897
<i>between the two of them.</i>

1268
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:55,819
CLEMENTS: <i>This was a difficult scene
to write, rewritten many times just to...</i>

1269
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,823
<i>A lot is going on between the dynamics
of the two characters,</i>

1270
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,285
<i>and Jim is kind of taking control,
starting to take charge,</i>

1271
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:07,747
<i>and Silver, there's some vulnerability
here on Silver, I think,</i>

1272
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:12,335
<i>which is what makes him
completely lose his temper</i>

1273
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,503
<i>as the scene progresses.</i>

1274
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,424
CONLI: <i>It's important that the audience
not be sure</i>

1275
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,135
<i>whether what he's saying
is true or false.</i>

1276
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,846
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, they're trying
to scope him out just as Jim is.</i>

1277
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,016
<i>ls he telling the truth at all?
Can you trust him?</i>

1278
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,478
CLEMENTS: <i>We adjusted this scene
a little bit in terms of the acting.</i>

1279
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:34,566
<i>Originally, Jim didn't seem so much
like he was kind of considering</i>

1280
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,110
<i>and going along with Silver's proposal.</i>

1281
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,487
MUSKER: <i>And it seemed to give
more dramatics to let him seem like</i>

1282
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,282
<i>he was being taken in and then
sort of throw it back in Silver's face</i>

1283
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:46,036
<i>to kind of misdirect Silver
as well as the audience.</i>

1284
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:50,498
CLEMENTS: <i>Once again, it has Jim sort
of gaining a little bit of the upper hand.</i>

1285
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,753
CONLI: (CHUCKLING) <i>Although
he does have the eye mask on.</i>

1286
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,379
CLEMENTS: <i>He does
have the eye mask.</i>

1287
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,589
MUSKER: <i>He's a more
guarded guy again.</i>

1288
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,008
CLEMENTS: <i>He hasn't resolved
his problems yet.</i>

1289
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,468
MUSKER: <i>We do have some slight
moving camera,</i>

1290
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,178
<i>although this was done
with a 2-D technique</i>

1291
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,888
<i>where we're just panning
the camera behind him</i>

1292
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:09,935
<i>just to get a feeling of point of view
of Silver as Jim circles around him.</i>

1293
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,438
CLEMENTS: <i>Jim is high, Silver's low,</i>

1294
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:18,777
<i>which, once again, is emphasizing that
Jim is gaining the upper hand here.</i>

1295
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,405
Try to find it without my map,
by thunder!

1296
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,827
You still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

1297
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,163
Now, mark me.

1298
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,666
MUSKER: <i>There was the famous scene
in the movie and the book</i>

1299
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,044
<i>where, "Somebody help me up, "</i>
<i>where Silver is sort of lame.</i>

1300
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,587
<i>We wanted to get the feeling
of that moment,</i>

1301
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,465
<i>even if we didn't do that literally,
but just that</i>

1302
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,970
<i>there's this anger and volatility
on the part of Silver</i>

1303
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,806
<i>and this sort of estrangement
of their relationship here.</i>

1304
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,140
Now!

1305
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,311
Oh, blast it!

1306
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,522
MUSKER: <i>We went back
and sort of adjusted this end</i>

1307
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,899
<i>to put back a look of regret
on Silver's part,</i>

1308
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:01,069
<i>which we took out at one point, but it
seemed to give you a little feeling of</i>

1309
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,572
<i>he didn't want things to go this way,
but that's the way it played out.</i>

1310
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,784
CONLI: <i>Yeah. Finding that balance
between their relationship</i>

1311
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,413
<i>and Silver's wants
was always an issue.</i>

1312
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,207
- Ohh.
- And what? What?

1313
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,793
We must stay together and what?

1314
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,128
Doctor...

1315
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,046
MUSKER: <i>David's line of dialogue here</i>

1316
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,550
<i>involving "I'm not a doctor, " we had
written that in kind of a</i> Star Trek joke.

1317
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,884
CLEMENTS: <i>Second</i> Star Trek joke
<i>in the movie.</i>

1318
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:28,013
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, although then
David really elaborated on it,</i>

1319
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,764
<i>so it was his improv
that went into the whole,</i>

1320
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,099
<i>"You can't do anything
with a doctorate.</i>

1321
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,475
<i>"You just sit there and you're useless!"</i>

1322
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,602
<i>That was all David's improv.
It was very funny.</i>

1323
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,937
CLEMENTS: <i>His greatest ad lib,</i>

1324
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:38,940
<i>it was written as Doppler kind of
breaking down and losing it</i>

1325
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,984
<i>but he took it to something</i>

1326
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,736
<i>-that was...</i>
- MUSKER: <i>A new level. Yeah.</i>

1327
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,406
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

1328
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,199
MUSKER: <i>And this was
a Martin improv, with that,</i>

1329
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,118
<i>"Jim, any thoughts at all?"
after the big build-up.</i>

1330
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,872
<i>That was Martin's funny sort of
understated improv on that.</i>

1331
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,333
If we try to leave, we're dead.

1332
01:03:56,416 --> 01:04:02,047
CLEMENTS: <i>And this little bit with
Morph, that was a Ken Harsha idea.</i>

1333
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,632
MUSKER: <i>The "We're dead,
we're dead, we're dead, " is a funny...</i>

1334
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,676
<i>That Ken came up with.</i>

1335
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,346
RIPA: <i>You know what's interesting, too,
is kind of</i>

1336
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,222
<i>looking at Morph there a bit</i>

1337
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:15,268
<i>and how much he actually
means to the story,</i>

1338
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,731
<i>and scenes, and for the characters
to work with and play off of,</i>

1339
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,193
<i>and how he works
between Silver and Jim.</i>

1340
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,111
KEANE: <i>Well, to me, a villain</i>

1341
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,323
<i>who's really nice to his dog,
is no real villain.</i>

1342
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,618
<i>I mean, in the end,
there's a redeemable quality to him.</i>

1343
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,623
<i>The fact that Silver loves Morph
is a very redeeming thing.</i>

1344
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,961
<i>There's no character with a more pure,</i>

1345
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,090
<i>genuine heart in this than Morph.</i>

1346
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,592
RIPA: <i>Yeah, they'd always talked
about Morph almost like a puppy,</i>

1347
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:48,760
<i>very innocent.</i>

1348
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,597
<i>And they're always very watchful
as far as how much he understood</i>

1349
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,642
<i>and how much he didn't,
as to what the situations were.</i>

1350
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,562
CONLI: <i>There used to be a scene here
where, actually, they went out</i>

1351
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,233
<i>and B.E.N. had a skiff
called</i> The Mambo Queen

1352
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,360
<i>which was like the book, I mean,</i>

1353
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,445
<i>'cause Ben, in the book,
did have a boat that he built.</i>

1354
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,864
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
he had a little raft that they used</i>

1355
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,534
<i>and so they went to his little flivver
and flew it to the ship.</i>

1356
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,537
<i>But then, as we shortened the movie,
we got rid of his</i> Mambo Queen

1357
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,080
<i>and we just had them
steal this longboat</i>

1358
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,875
<i>and make their way to
the</i> Legacy <i>to steal back the map.</i>

1359
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,755
<i>Andy Gaskill storyboarded this section.</i>

1360
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,426
<i>And originally,
guarding the ship was Mr. Hands</i>

1361
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,344
<i>so Jim had a big fight with Mr. Hands</i>

1362
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:35,223
<i>based, again, sort of on the archetypal
scene of the movie and the book</i>

1363
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:39,894
<i>where he had to go back to the ship
and deal with this guy, but...</i>

1364
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,897
<i>Tom Schumacher actually said,
"Hey, Scroop is a much scarier guy</i>

1365
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,775
<i>"and he's better to have as your villain.</i>
<i>You got</i> too <i>many characters,</i>

1366
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,278
<i>"so why don't you
redo this with Scroop?"</i>

1367
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,530
<i>- And I think that was a good idea.</i>
- CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah.</i>

1368
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,157
MUSKER: <i>And we went back
and redid it.</i>

1369
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,538
<i>We used to have a thing,
like</i> Mission: Impossible <i>where</i>

1370
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,875
<i>Jim tried to disguise himself
by wearing a mask over his face</i>

1371
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,126
<i>so that he looked like...</i>

1372
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,419
<i>No, no, Morph was the mask.</i>

1373
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,962
<i>Morph was the mask.</i>

1374
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:09,382
CONLI: <i>So he disguised himself
as Mr. Onus, using Morph as a mask.</i>

1375
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,968
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it was like
Tom Cruise in the movie.</i>

1376
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,052
CONLI: <i>Kind of a fun idea.</i>

1377
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,679
MUSKER: <i>Again,
we've got the virtual set here</i>

1378
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,140
<i>where we can actually track
and travel down through this.</i>

1379
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:21,060
<i>We have our homage
to Larry, Moe and Curly here.</i>

1380
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,230
CLEMENTS: <i>There's a</i> Three Stooges
<i>aspect to Morph</i>

1381
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,733
<i>played out quite a bit in this sequence.</i>

1382
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,237
(POWERS UP)

1383
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,744
B. E. N. : Whoops. Okay, don't panic.

1384
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,247
CLEMENTS: <i>The big fear
with this sequence is</i>

1385
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,791
<i>it would become</i> too <i>intense
with a Disney film.</i>

1386
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:47,754
CONLI: <i>There used to be a leaking pipe
where you had the hiss coming</i>

1387
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,048
<i>and another half dozen shots probably.</i>

1388
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:53,384
CLEMENTS: <i>We actually
took out a little tension.</i>

1389
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,346
<i>John added this bit with...</i>

1390
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,349
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we had variations
on that. We had a boxing glove.</i>

1391
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,808
<i>We had a hammer
hitting him in the head</i>

1392
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,727
<i>but we went with the poke in the eyes.</i>

1393
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,853
CLEMENTS: <i>To break the tension.</i>

1394
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,979
CONLI: <i>Continuing with
</i>The Three Stooges.

1395
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,564
CLEMENTS: <i>Counter the tension.</i>

1396
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,525
MUSKER: <i>And the idea of this whole
anti-gravity fight</i>

1397
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,026
<i>actually went back to
Ted and Terry's script.</i>

1398
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,195
<i>They concocted the idea
of Jim having to deal</i>

1399
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,281
<i>with the gravity going off
in the middle of this thing</i>

1400
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:19,369
<i>and B.E.N. futzing with the wires
and that was Ted and Terry's thing.</i>

1401
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,162
(GRUNTING)

1402
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,956
Heh, heh.

1403
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:31,005
MUSKER: <i>There was a question at
the end, too, how we'd dispatch Scroop</i>

1404
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,590
<i>and in the earlier versions,
these pistols,</i>

1405
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,758
<i>some of them were freeze guns</i>

1406
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,552
<i>and there was a whole sequence
where we showed</i>

1407
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,721
<i>how they worked and everything
and then as Scroop attacked Jim,</i>

1408
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,765
<i>he wound up shooting him
and freezing him</i>

1409
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,560
<i>and he broke into a million
little ice shards as he fell to the deck.</i>

1410
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:46,896
<i>But then we saw</i> Atlantis
<i>which had the villain</i>

1411
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,023
<i>crystallize and freeze
and break into a million pieces,</i>

1412
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,900
<i>and we're like,
"We can't do that. They just did that."</i>

1413
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,694
<i>So we had to rework it.</i>

1414
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,237
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>There was also a question of</i>

1415
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,573
<i>whether Jim should shoot Scroop...</i>

1416
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,907
MUSKER: <i>And not have
the violence questioned.</i>

1417
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,409
CLEMENTS: <i>Which he did at one point.</i>
<i>He did shoot him.</i>

1418
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,035
MUSKER: <i>There did seem
to be something poetic</i>

1419
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,705
<i>about seeing Scroop
sail off into the distance</i>

1420
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,959
<i>à la what he did to Mr. Arrow.</i>
<i>Poetic justice sort of thing.</i>

1421
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,377
B. E. N. : Laser cannons disconnected,

1422
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,170
Captain Jimmy, sir!

1423
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,381
Gee, that wasn't so tough.

1424
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,429
GOODING: <i>The lighting in this
sequence was really interesting.</i>

1425
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:25,310
<i>The very strong under-light
coming up from that air vent.</i>

1426
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,438
Fine work, Jimbo.

1427
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,107
GOODING: <i>That was a very, very
difficult scene to do</i>

1428
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,109
<i>where Silver comes
out of the darkness.</i>

1429
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:36,613
<i>Just the balance of what you see
and what you don't see</i>

1430
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,531
<i>was hard to achieve.</i>

1431
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:42,118
<i>And this whole sequence
had to be really dark</i>

1432
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,578
<i>so it would be believable</i>

1433
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:47,957
<i>that Jim didn't see all these pirates
when he first came in,</i>

1434
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,127
<i>but not so dark that the audience
couldn't see what was going on.</i>

1435
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,212
You're just like me, Jimbo.

1436
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,506
Ya hates to lose.

1437
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,676
MUSKER: <i>I think Glen really wanted
to do more of a tour de force scene.</i>

1438
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,472
<i>This is actually animated by Jin Kim
but sort of devised by Glen, I think,</i>

1439
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:06,017
<i>where Silver really struggles
to make this thing open</i>

1440
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,479
<i>to build up his frustration with Jim
and to give Jim the upper hand here.</i>

1441
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,272
<i>The fact that he can do it effortlessly</i>

1442
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:14,817
<i>where Silver can't possibly
do it without Jim's help.</i>

1443
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,446
CLEMENTS: <i>Once again,
we played this at one point</i>

1444
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,240
<i>that Jim was completely demoralized</i>

1445
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:25,536
<i>by giving the map directly to Silver
after he thought he'd won.</i>

1446
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,580
<i>But that scene,
Jim seemed</i> too <i>passive</i>

1447
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:31,042
<i>so we kind of tried to give him
a little more defiance here</i>

1448
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,169
<i>that he's not giving up,
even though he has to.</i>

1449
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,213
CONLI: <i>We had to keep him alive
through the rest of the film.</i>

1450
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,547
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, he receded</i> too <i>much.</i>

1451
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:37,882
CONLI: <i>Receded
into his eye mask thing.</i>

1452
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,050
MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>

1453
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,220
KEANE: <i>These are some of
the most difficult scenes to animate.</i>

1454
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:47,100
<i>Chris Hubbard did a lot of
these scenes where Silver is in awe.</i>

1455
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,645
<i>And when you animate
a character that's in awe of something,</i>

1456
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,856
<i>it's the other thing
that's really amazing,</i>

1457
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,652
<i>and they're just responding to it
and all you have to do is</i>

1458
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:04,409
<i>a slow, gradual opening of the eyes
and the mouth and a fascination.</i>

1459
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,452
<i>And you don't have much to work with.</i>

1460
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,037
<i>It's very subtle.</i>

1461
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,165
<i>And I think he did
an incredible job with it.</i>

1462
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,920
MUSKER: <i>And Ian Gooding concocted
those centipede trees.</i>

1463
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,547
<i>They only appear really
in that one shot,</i>

1464
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,383
<i>but it was so great, we had to use it.</i>

1465
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,136
<i>And this sequence was
originally much longer</i>

1466
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,513
<i>and it was based, again, sort of on
the book and on the movie where</i>

1467
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,640
<i>they were going through
this dark, spooky place</i>

1468
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,225
<i>in anticipation of finding the treasure.</i>

1469
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,686
CLEMENTS: <i>And some complicated
characters got killed.</i>

1470
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,730
MUSKER: <i>We had killed off
a few people</i>

1471
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,108
<i>in traps that Flint had set for people
as they were coming and it just...</i>

1472
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,110
<i>We needed to get to
the treasure sooner</i>

1473
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,653
<i>so we wound up
tightening this sequence.</i>

1474
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,240
GOODING: <i>Of course,
we had this pulsing</i>

1475
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,076
<i>lime green light in the background</i>

1476
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,287
<i>that just keeps going
through the whole sequence,</i>

1477
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,748
<i>and that was a continuity nightmare.</i>

1478
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,666
<i>To try and get it just right.</i>

1479
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,836
<i>It also changes speed
which was difficult to track.</i>

1480
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,464
<i>So that the further along you go,
the faster it gets</i>

1481
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,591
<i>right up to the end.</i>

1482
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,427
KEANE: <i>It's at this point that you start</i>

1483
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,430
<i>relying on all the pipe work
that you've laid on</i>

1484
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,766
<i>how the characters relate
to each other.</i>

1485
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,643
<i>That you can just,
in a very quick moment,</i>

1486
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:17,190
<i>have a look between Jim and B.E.N.</i>
<i>that says enough.</i>

1487
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,942
<i>You don't have to go
really far and develop it</i>

1488
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,320
<i>'cause now we've got
a lot of story to tell.</i>

1489
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,488
RIPA: <i>Yeah.</i>

1490
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,114
KEANE: <i>But we've already
set the characters up</i>

1491
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,325
<i>so we can move through it quicker.</i>

1492
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,828
CONLI: <i>This whole area that
we're going into is really kind of</i>

1493
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,748
<i>a testament to Ron
in terms of his persistence</i>

1494
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,042
<i>on wanting to get this portal functioning</i>

1495
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,878
<i>and it really came out
to be pretty brilliant.</i>

1496
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,964
MUSKER: <i>Frank Nissen sort of helped
design this controller,</i>

1497
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,716
<i>that little green sphere that comes up</i>

1498
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,303
<i>and then gets the whole portal
opening here.</i>

1499
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:51,432
CLEMENTS: <i>We were able to get the
dimension and the size of this thing.</i>

1500
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,101
CONLI: <i>This is where we get
more into science fiction</i>

1501
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,311
<i>than we had before.</i>

1502
01:11:55,394 --> 01:12:00,066
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Andrey Brandl, one of
our Hungarian conceptual designers,</i>

1503
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,484
<i>concocted a whole bunch of worlds,</i>

1504
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,694
<i>which we see very much
quickly in passing here</i>

1505
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,112
<i>and not in Hungarian.</i>

1506
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:11,285
<i>And Dave Tidgwell actually,
using Bryce and other programs,</i>

1507
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,329
<i>concocted some of these
3-D environments</i>

1508
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,747
<i>that we see through the portal.</i>

1509
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,666
CONLI: <i>We used to have
more exposition here</i>

1510
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,959
<i>and actually we used to have</i>

1511
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,587
<i>these zaftwing, these birds that
actually flew out of one of the worlds.</i>

1512
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,006
MUSKER: <i>And interacted with
Jim and Morph and everything,</i>

1513
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,175
<i>but, again, we were trying to
pace it a little more briskly</i>

1514
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,553
<i>so it got shortened.</i>

1515
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:32,932
CONLI: <i>The key idea,
which we hope is clear, is that</i>

1516
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,604
<i>the planet is actually a machine
that works these portals.</i>

1517
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,235
CLEMENTS: <i>We took a lot of time
working this and trying to craft it so that</i>

1518
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,654
<i>-you could get a lot of exposition in...</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Trying to rewrite...</i>

1519
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:50,324
<i>To get the least exposition you could
and yet get it clear.</i>

1520
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,535
<i>That was a real struggle.</i>

1521
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,206
KEANE: <i>I like it when Silver
starts to get frustrated.</i>

1522
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,458
<i>- There's this volcano inside.</i>
- RIPA: <i>He looks good yelling.</i>

1523
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:04,380
<i>Yeah, he's like one of those
few people that looks good mad.</i>

1524
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,048
RIPA: <i>Yeah, he does.</i>

1525
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:13,347
GOODING: <i>So, here we get the idea
that the planet,</i>

1526
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:17,393
<i>which was really good on the surface
and covered with natural green stuff,</i>

1527
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,478
<i>is actually quite rotten at the core.</i>

1528
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:23,149
<i>It's filled with gold,
which you'll see in a second.</i>

1529
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,320
<i>And that sort of helps to
carry through our idea</i>

1530
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,323
<i>with the green
and the gold storytelling.</i>

1531
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:34,160
The loot of a thousand worlds.

1532
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:38,539
<i>This big idea here actually
was one of mine,</i>

1533
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:43,461
<i>where the core of the planet is like
a huge spherical computer floating</i>

1534
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:46,422
<i>at the gravitational center of the planet.</i>

1535
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,758
<i>And the way it communicates</i>

1536
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,802
<i>with the rest of the planet
that works the portal</i>

1537
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,888
<i>is through these information beams</i>

1538
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,099
<i>fired by the prongs
and fired back by the core.</i>

1539
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,604
I can't remember why.

1540
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:03,689
B. E. N. , come on.

1541
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,524
We're getting out of here...

1542
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,528
CLEMENTS: <i>And this area was
reworked some I think.</i>

1543
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,113
- MUSKER: <i>Some?
</i>-(ALL LAUGHING)

1544
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,698
CONLI: <i>We spent a lifetime
on this one.</i>

1545
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,992
CLEMENTS: <i>The whole idea,
Flint's ship and Jim...</i>

1546
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:19,789
<i>I think Roy had
wanted to bring in that element</i>

1547
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,415
<i>to keep Jim more active through this.</i>

1548
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,667
<i>So he had a plan.</i>

1549
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,043
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, and in earlier versions,</i>

1550
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,171
<i>he didn't really try and get away
on the ship and all this.</i>

1551
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:28,297
<i>This really came about...</i>

1552
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,467
CONLI: <i>We really were starting to find
something for him to do at this point,</i>

1553
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,679
-to <i>keep active and this became...</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Right. Right.</i>

1554
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,806
<i>There used to be
a sequence here where...</i>

1555
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,891
<i>I mean, B.E.N. used to have
more flashbacks</i>

1556
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,310
<i>and in flashbacks we saw
what happened to Captain Flint</i>

1557
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:45,314
<i>and the pirates, and a gunfight,
and that all went away.</i>

1558
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,442
CLEMENTS: <i>The original idea was that
B.E.N. would get his missing piece back</i>

1559
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,569
<i>as he's about to right now.</i>

1560
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,737
<i>And when he got it back,</i>

1561
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,323
<i>he would remember everything,
and basically deliver</i>

1562
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,367
<i>tons of exposition that would explain</i>

1563
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,786
<i>every aspect of the movie
that anyone had ever questioned.</i>

1564
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,830
CONLI: <i>We had just, literally,
tons of exposition.</i>

1565
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,498
MUSKER: <i>And we had a version
like that. He went through,</i>

1566
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:05,876
<i>"Annual rainfall 7. 5 inches.</i>
<i>Planet built over a series of years.</i> <i>"</i>

1567
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,462
<i>And he belted this story out,
as we encouraged him to do.</i>

1568
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:09,797
<i>Five minutes of exposition.</i>

1569
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,507
<i>"Billy Bones stole the map.</i>

1570
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,050
<i>"What else do you need to know?
Let me tell you.</i> <i>"</i>

1571
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,137
<i>And it just got a little</i> too <i>much.</i>

1572
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,346
CLEMENTS: <i>But it went through how</i>

1573
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,431
<i>they discovered the planet.</i>

1574
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,557
MUSKER: <i>There were
explosions going on.</i>

1575
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,475
CLEMENTS: <i>They had stumbled
onto the planet</i>

1576
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,852
<i>and had discovered the portals</i>

1577
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,813
<i>and B.E.N. figured out
how to operate them.</i>

1578
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,149
<i>And then the pirates stole the map.</i>

1579
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,859
CONLI: <i>And all the picnics!</i>
CLEMENTS: <i>And Billy Bones</i>

1580
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,777
<i>was the cabin boy and they deserted.</i>

1581
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,863
<i>And then Flint booby-trapped
the whole system</i>

1582
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,616
<i>so that if anyone ever returned,
they would find trouble.</i>

1583
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,374
KEANE: <i>The way these
little pirates move,</i>

1584
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:50,421
<i>they add such a spark
of action and movement and life.</i>

1585
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:55,885
<i>Without their crazy way
of bouncing around...</i>

1586
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,972
<i>They always add lightness to a scene,
no matter what it is.</i>

1587
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,975
RIPA: <i>And just even
the layout work and the scale</i>

1588
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,394
<i>of this whole area is just amazing.</i>

1589
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,190
<i>This is a tragic scene.</i>

1590
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,068
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1591
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,362
MUSKER: <i>Silver was
grabbing for all the treasure.</i>

1592
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:19,158
<i>Everything he's lived for
is going past him.</i>

1593
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,582
CONLI: <i>Now this is just
phenomenal effects work.</i>

1594
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,336
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, a combination
of 2-D/3-D. But mostly 3-D.</i>

1595
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,967
MUSKER: <i>That scene of Silver
at the end was gone for a while.</i>

1596
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,260
<i>We thought we didn't need it
and then we realized,</i>

1597
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,805
<i>"We better have that in there."</i>

1598
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,726
<i>This little sequence where Doppler
turns the tables on the pirates</i>

1599
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,688
<i>used to be longer, and we had him
actually doing a little gun...</i>

1600
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,982
<i>Demonstrating his nimbleness
with a gun and doing a little gunfight.</i>

1601
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,150
CLEMENTS: <i>This was
going to be Doppler's moment</i>

1602
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,276
<i>where he was really going to</i>

1603
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,445
<i>-turn into Errol Flynn.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>

1604
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,949
<i>And we had him at the end also getting
more dog-like where he was barking...</i>

1605
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,118
<i>And sort of doing in the pirates
and howling.</i>

1606
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,121
CLEMENTS: <i>He actually did
the sharp-shooting thing.</i>

1607
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,997
<i>"You've released my inner mongrel!"</i>

1608
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,458
MUSKER: <i>We had a line,
"You have released my inner mongrel.</i> <i>"</i>

1609
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,293
<i>And Amelia, herself..
</i>(IMITATING CAT YOWLING)

1610
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,795
<i>- Did a little cat thing.</i>
- CLEMENTS: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1611
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,797
MUSKER: <i>That all went away.</i>
<i>It was just</i> too <i>much.</i>

1612
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,799
CLEMENTS: <i>We shortened it
and you still get the idea.</i>

1613
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,134
<i>He basically turned the tables.</i>

1614
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,469
MUSKER: <i>It seemed like we were away
from the other action</i> too <i>long</i>

1615
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:25,141
<i>sort of to make it feel right, so
we said, "It's gotta be more concise.</i> <i>"</i>

1616
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,518
<i>Yeah, Adam Dykstra did that.</i>

1617
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:35,526
<i>Emil Mitev is the layout artist who
designed a lot of these interiors here.</i>

1618
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,821
<i>Emil did a great job with just
the whole devolving planet here</i>

1619
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,323
<i>and the scale of these shots
owes a lot to his drawings.</i>

1620
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,493
CLEMENTS: <i>This was also a scene
we struggled and struggled over, this</i>

1621
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,204
<i>sort of final confrontation
with Silver and Jim.</i>

1622
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,956
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we had it longer,
we had it shorter.</i>

1623
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,876
<i>We had it more friendly on Silver's part.</i>
<i>We had it darker and blacker.</i>

1624
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,502
CLEMENTS: <i>We had Jim
lowering the sword</i>

1625
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,462
<i>or Silver knocking the sword away.</i>

1626
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:58,215
MUSKER: <i>We had a million variations
on this and just, it was...</i>

1627
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,509
CLEMENTS: <i>We had
more father-son bits</i>

1628
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,220
<i>where Silver said,
"You're just like me, Jim."</i>

1629
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,265
MUSKER: <i>And Jim just said,
"I am nothing like you!"</i>

1630
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,186
<i>And, in fact, this whole sequence
used to take place out in the snow.</i>

1631
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:13,439
<i>In an earlier version, there was a race
back through the portals.</i>

1632
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17,109
<i>And Silver and Jim actually were
stranded on this sort of snowy planet</i>

1633
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,360
<i>in the earliest versions.</i>

1634
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,863
CONLI: <i>'Cause the portal used to
take you from world to world.</i>

1635
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,406
MUSKER: <i>They worked
in a little different way</i>

1636
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:23,532
<i>and they went to a winter world.</i>

1637
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,451
CLEMENTS: <i>And you had to go through
a sort of tunnel of worlds</i>

1638
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,744
<i>to get to the center of the planet.</i>

1639
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:31,040
MUSKER: <i>So the earlier lines all had
Silver shivering, "Hang on, Jim!"</i>

1640
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,416
<i>And so we couldn't use
any of that dialogue,</i>

1641
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:33,709
<i>so we reworked it
into this environment,</i>

1642
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,002
<i>so that all got rerecorded.</i>

1643
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:38,005
CLEMENTS: <i>So now we reach
Silver's moment of truth.</i>

1644
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,507
MUSKER: <i>I mean, this was really one of
the archetypal moments</i>

1645
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,010
<i>where we were trying to find
a way to stage it where, basically,</i>

1646
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,303
<i>Silver has a choice here.</i>

1647
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,140
<i>He can either save this treasure
he's been obsessed with his entire life,</i>

1648
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,101
<i>or he can save Jim. He can't do both.</i>

1649
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:52,853
(SIGHS)

1650
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,897
<i>When we first talked to Glen Keane
about working on the movie,</i>

1651
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,524
<i>we described a scene that
demonstrated this idea,</i>

1652
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,610
<i>and that was something,
through the course of the film,</i>

1653
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,153
<i>no matter what we did,
we tried to hang on to,</i>

1654
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,197
<i>just that this was a pivotal moment.</i>

1655
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,865
CLEMENTS: <i>There was one point
we had here</i>

1656
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,493
<i>when Silver finally made the decision
to let go, he couldn't let go.</i>

1657
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,662
<i>The arm was sort of clasped
on to the treasure</i>

1658
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,413
<i>-and wouldn't let go.</i>
- MUSKER: <i>That was Glen's idea. Yeah.</i>

1659
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,249
CLEMENTS: <i>So he had to
actually release his arm.</i>

1660
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:14,333
<i>His whole arm.</i>

1661
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,668
CONLI: <i>Pulled the pin
and his arm came off</i>

1662
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,837
MUSKER: <i>So we had Silver, through
the climax of the film being one-armed</i>

1663
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,256
<i>and he had lost that mechanical side.</i>

1664
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,382
CLEMENTS: <i>Which would
have been simpler.</i>

1665
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,592
<i>It just reminded us
</i>too <i>much of Richard Kimble.</i>

1666
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,594
MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>There was a</i> Fugitive <i>aspect of it</i>

1667
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,430
<i>that we weren't sure
that was a good thing.</i>

1668
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,182
Silver, you gave up?

1669
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:33,519
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.

1670
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,646
MUSKER: <i>Now we're moving
into sort of this</i>

1671
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,108
<i>action-adventure chock-full
of 3-D effects</i>

1672
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:43,779
<i>and just very dense
and, again, got heavily reworked.</i>

1673
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,864
<i>We had things in
at one point where Jim</i>

1674
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,534
<i>remained on the ship
and piloted them to safety.</i>

1675
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,202
<i>He became the captain of the ship.</i>

1676
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,079
CLEMENTS: <i>It was always Jim's
sort of sequence.</i>

1677
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,456
MUSKER: <i>It was.</i>
CLEMENTS: <i>And his chance to really</i>

1678
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,958
<i>show what he could do.</i>

1679
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,835
MUSKER: <i>Right,
but what he was demonstrating</i>

1680
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,628
<i>went through
at least 10 different variations</i>

1681
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,422
<i>before we arrived at this one.</i>

1682
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,799
CLEMENTS: <i>Which ended up bringing
the solar surfer back</i>

1683
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,552
<i>which seems fitting.</i>

1684
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,345
MUSKER: <i>Yeah,
we sort of concocted this thing</i>

1685
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,180
<i>so Jim would actually be surfing</i>

1686
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,890
<i>and we had to sort of make it plausible.</i>

1687
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:14,727
<i>And I think John Ripa felt, "It should
have some form of propulsion.</i> <i>"</i>

1688
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,688
<i>And at one point he was just
riding a piece of sheet metal</i>

1689
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,814
<i>down to what was going on.</i>

1690
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,733
<i>- Just kind of riding the waves.</i>
- CLEMENTS: <i>With a solar sail.</i>

1691
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,943
MUSKER: <i>With a sail,
but that seemed</i> too <i>contrived</i>

1692
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:26,822
<i>and the idea came up, use the cannon
as a form of propulsion for this thing.</i>

1693
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,657
<i>And I think we reworked it to...</i>

1694
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,159
<i>And then I think Glen had the idea,</i>

1695
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,494
<i>it can have a certain amount of
canisters of energy</i>

1696
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,080
<i>so there's sort of
a ticking clock that way.</i>

1697
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,336
CLEMENTS: <i>I don't know
if everyone gets it</i>

1698
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:44,173
<i>but basically this cannon
has these three canisters</i>

1699
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,719
<i>and Jim uses them all up
in his course to try to save the day.</i>

1700
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:52,264
CONLI: <i>Yeah, the propulsion device is
basically like a chamber for a pistol.</i>

1701
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,186
<i>The little canisters go in
and shoot off the power.</i>

1702
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,105
CLEMENTS: <i>It's where you get into
what has been referred to at Disney</i>

1703
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,733
<i>as the "plausible impossible."</i>

1704
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,904
There you go.

1705
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:08,739
There you go.

1706
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,034
Okay. Now, no matter what happens...

1707
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,202
MUSKER: <i>They used
to have a little more</i>

1708
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,578
<i>dialogue between them as they left</i>

1709
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,955
<i>where they sort of said goodbye
or, "If I never come back</i>

1710
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,124
<i>"tell my mother I love her.</i> '<i>'
I mean, practically like that.</i>

1711
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,876
<i>And it seemed</i> too <i>much at this moment</i>

1712
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,295
<i>so we went with
the more understated...</i>

1713
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,880
CLEMENTS:
<i>There was the first canister.</i>

1714
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,006
<i>So there's only two left.</i>

1715
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:30,010
Get this blasted heap turned 'round !

1716
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,847
GOODING: <i>This shot you actually
see the ship tacking</i>

1717
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,557
<i>as a real sailing ship might,</i>

1718
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:39,436
<i>where the sails transfer
from one side of the ship to the other.</i>

1719
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,440
<i>That was animated by Ian Coony.</i>
<i>A nice little touch that he added.</i>

1720
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:46,735
RIPA: <i>These scenes coming up
with Jim on the surfer,</i>

1721
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:50,239
<i>again, went to Jin Kim,
just because of how well</i>

1722
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,907
<i>he was able to do these scenes,</i>

1723
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,909
<i>and how much he was
able to put into them.</i>

1724
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,036
<i>I mean, they're so difficult as it is</i>

1725
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,331
<i>that you can get lost in
trying to figure out how to do them.</i>

1726
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,334
<i>That he was able to do them
and focus on the performance,</i>

1727
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,002
<i>which is one of the hardest things to do</i>

1728
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,796
<i>when you have something
that's very technical.</i>

1729
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,799
<i>And he just was
the right person for that.</i>

1730
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,052
<i>There were also scenes... Bobby Rubio
had done a couple of scenes in there.</i>

1731
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,303
<i>Really nice match.</i>

1732
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,514
<i>And John Pomeroy has some
scenes coming up</i>

1733
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:20,269
<i>that really, I think, match the intensity
that Jin was able to get into his work.</i>

1734
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,521
MUSKER: <i>And this was our attempt
to get the slight James Bond thing.</i>

1735
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,772
<i>This came up fairly late
in the thing,</i> too.

1736
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:27,109
<i>We wanted to give Jim a way
of sort of cleverly coming up with</i>

1737
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,404
<i>some way of saving the day
and restarting his engine,</i>

1738
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,282
<i>so we came up with this thing
of him grinding the dead engine</i>

1739
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,452
<i>against this metal wall
and the sparks reigniting it</i>

1740
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,036
<i>and that was our attempt
to do a little reversal</i>

1741
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,707
<i>at the end of this thing
as we head toward the finish line.</i>

1742
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,126
DOPPLER: Three, two...

1743
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,962
CLEMENTS: <i>And if anyone
was keeping track</i>

1744
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,130
<i>as far as B.E.N.'s countdown,</i>

1745
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,716
<i>if that was all accurate, it's not.</i>

1746
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,554
MUSKER: <i>This was one of the most
complicated shots we did in this ending.</i>

1747
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,973
<i>This turnaround of the ship.</i>
<i>Trying to make the sky work behind it</i>

1748
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,309
<i>because it was 2-D, it was 3-D.</i>

1749
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,811
<i>I don't even know what it is now,
but it was complicated.</i>

1750
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,064
(CHEERING)

1751
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,653
<i>Amelia and Doppler used to
have a longer thing between them</i>

1752
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:14,406
<i>where she sort of talked to him
about becoming first mate on the ship</i>

1753
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,616
<i>and it was a great scene
between them.</i>

1754
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,744
<i>But it seemed like it may have pulled
away from Jim a little bit</i> too <i>much</i>

1755
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,704
<i>so we simplified that.</i>

1756
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,749
AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you
to the interstellar academy.

1757
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,626
CLEMENTS: <i>The proud father.</i>

1758
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,795
Just wait until your mother
hears about this!

1759
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,131
Of course, we may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

1760
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,175
MUSKER: <i>Again with Martin's
goodbye here,</i>

1761
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,177
<i>or his congratulatory thing here,</i>

1762
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,720
<i>we had longer versions,
we had shorter versions,</i>

1763
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,223
<i>I think we were much shorter,
but we wound up reinstating stuff</i>

1764
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:42,684
<i>'cause Martin just did some funny stuff
with this crying bit at the end.</i>

1765
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,646
<i>It just seemed kind of
comic that we liked.</i>

1766
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,690
CLEMENTS: <i>And if people notice,
his eyes are now blue.</i>

1767
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:53,695
<i>When he got his memory chip,
it turned his eyes from green to blue.</i>

1768
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,531
CONLI: <i>I thought you were going to
talk about the eye mask.</i>

1769
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,032
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah,
I was going to get to it.</i>

1770
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:00,202
<i>And Jim's eye mask is gone for good.</i>

1771
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,120
<i>It's gone for good.</i>

1772
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,498
JIM: You never quit, do you?

1773
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:08,210
MUSKER: <i>And for us, this scene,
in this interior,</i>

1774
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,712
<i>despite all the changes in the story,</i>

1775
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,840
<i>most of this stayed relatively
as it was just in that</i>

1776
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:18,512
<i>we wanted to get this sort of
moment where Jim lets Silver go,</i>

1777
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:22,266
<i>and also, though, that Silver
beckons Jim to come with him</i>

1778
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,226
<i>and Jim having found his newfound
maturity,</i>

1779
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:28,188
<i>he really says, "No, I think
I got a future back home.</i> <i>"</i>

1780
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:32,901
<i>And it's, again, sort of a tent-pole
for us in the movie anyway.</i>

1781
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:40,284
KEANE: <i>There's an emotional chord
that you know you have to hit</i>

1782
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:41,702
<i>in these scenes.</i>

1783
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:45,163
<i>And Morph plays such
an important moment in this,</i>

1784
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:49,418
<i>because Morph has always
represented that inseparable</i>

1785
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,461
<i>element to Silver.</i>

1786
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,841
<i>And when he's given this choice</i>

1787
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:03,098
<i>of hanging on to Morph
or giving Morph to Jim,</i>

1788
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:06,810
<i>it's such a real gift.</i>

1789
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:10,188
RIPA: <i>Yeah, it's really heartfelt
because by this time,</i>

1790
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,400
<i>you know how much
Morph means to Silver.</i>

1791
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,028
I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second,

1792
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,574
but I met this old cyborg...

1793
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:24,453
MUSKER: <i>And this shot was added
late in the game of Silver</i>

1794
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,913
<i>because we felt that
we were on Jim so long</i>

1795
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,707
<i>and it's really the relationship
between the two of them,</i>

1796
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,250
<i>so we cut away from Jim
during part of it</i>

1797
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,460
<i>to feature Silver just as he said,</i>

1798
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,836
<i>"I met this guy
who kind of changed my life.</i> <i>"</i>

1799
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:36,340
<i>It just seemed more emotional
to be on Silver for that line.</i>

1800
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,467
<i>And this line, where he says,</i>

1801
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,678
<i>"I have a future, "
he used to say, "Greatness, "</i>

1802
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:44,222
<i>alluding back to where he said,
"You have the makings of greatness, "</i>

1803
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:46,308
<i>but it seemed a little bit comic</i>

1804
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,143
<i>and it was a question,
"Does it seem</i> too <i>swell-headed?"</i>

1805
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,645
<i>- And the future...</i>
- CONLI: <i>Perhaps glib.</i>

1806
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:52,564
MUSKER: <i>Glib, and "future" tied into
his earlier line where he says,</i>

1807
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,150
<i>"Yeah, what future?" and it just
seemed to round out the thing.</i>

1808
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,362
CLEMENTS: <i>Beautiful music here by
James Newton Howard.</i>

1809
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,239
MUSKER: <i>Yeah, the theme between
Jim and Silver that he stated earlier</i>

1810
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,491
<i>really sort of comes back around here</i>

1811
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,870
<i>and he added these violin overdubs,
the just really sweet, tender thing.</i>

1812
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:09,039
<i>Again, this was Barry Johnson's idea
to sort of have</i>

1813
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,333
<i>Morph dissolve into
a puddle of tears here.</i>

1814
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,418
<i>But it was Tom Schumacher
who encouraged us,</i>

1815
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:17,130
<i>toward the end of the film, to say,
"I think Jim should...</i>

1816
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,759
<i>"Or Silver should actually
give Morph to Jim as a gift.</i> <i>"</i>

1817
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,843
<i>And that was controversial</i>

1818
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,762
<i>'cause it was a question,
can you give a pet away?</i>

1819
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:24,971
CLEMENTS: <i>The pet owners in the...</i>

1820
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,598
CONLI: <i>Me, being a dog person,
I seriously questioned it</i>

1821
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,642
<i>because I couldn't imagine
giving my dog to somebody.</i>

1822
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,810
MUSKER: <i>Right,
but me not being a dog person,</i>

1823
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,144
<i>I just thought it would
really be emotional</i>

1824
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,396
<i>that the thing Silver cared about most,</i>

1825
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,648
<i>he actually found it
in the grace of his heart</i>

1826
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,609
<i>to bestow it and it became
more powerful on Silver's part.</i>

1827
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,194
<i>And I think Glen,
even though he is a dog owner,</i>

1828
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,239
<i>said, "Hey, I can see that.</i> '<i>'
So we reworked this ending.</i>

1829
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,241
CLEMENTS: <i>What made it work
was Silver realizing</i>

1830
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,202
<i>that Morph would actually
be happier with Jim.</i>

1831
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,787
<i>So then he gives him the order.</i>

1832
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,790
This is for your dear mother,

1833
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:54,000
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1834
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,298
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.

1835
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,053
MUSKER: <i>Neil Eskuri was our
artistic coordinator and he really helped</i>

1836
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:09,850
<i>the massive job of trying to relate
all the different parts of the puzzle</i>

1837
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:14,521
<i>between effects and color models
and layout,</i>

1838
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,691
<i>and really trying to make the process
as efficient and as rich as possible</i>

1839
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,693
<i>on the screen
and here at the end of the film</i>

1840
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,404
<i>as we go back to the space port,
he peopled that.</i>

1841
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,573
<i>I think it's the most complicated
exposure sheet.</i>

1842
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:26,616
<i>The exposure sheets
are the roadmap of these scenes,</i>

1843
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,118
<i>and I think this one</i>

1844
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,412
<i>took two weeks
just to assemble the sheet</i>

1845
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,165
<i>and there's just a kajillion
characters in there.</i>

1846
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,251
<i>It really has a rich feeling of
a dense, thriving metropolis.</i>

1847
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:40,922
<i>Thanks, Neil,
for expanding that universe out there.</i>

1848
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,092
CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah. Really
had a very complex job</i>

1849
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,136
<i>on this movie, and did a great job.</i>

1850
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:48,597
CONLI: <i>He came to us from</i> Dinosaur.

1851
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,267
<i>So he had this rich background in 3-D

everything was unified</i>

<i>Opposite of what he was
in the beginning.</i>

1863
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,682
KEANE: <i>He had to go through the
experience to get to where he's at now.</i>

1864
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,101
<i>He had to have met Silver.</i>

01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:39,689

KEANE: <i>So,
seeing Silver in the clouds here,</i>

1872
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,426
<i>it's an image that you know
that is always gonna be with Jim.</i>

1873
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,429
<i>That Silver's always
going to be watching over his shoulder.</i>

1874
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:17,269
<i>And it says something really strong
to families,</i>

1875
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:22,107
<i>to all of us who are growing up,
who want to reach your dreams,</i>

had the cards stacked against him,</i>

<i>and the most unlikely person possible</i>

1878

1879
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,122
<i>And it's just a great message.</i>

1880
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:41,710
<i>I feel like our films here
should have something to say.</i>

1881
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,797
<i>And this is a story
that was borrowed from</i>

1882
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:49,050
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson
hundreds of years ago,</i>

1883
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:54,472
<i>and adapted to our time
through Ron and John's vision.</i>

1884
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:59,895
<i>And it's just really satisfying
to see it actually up on the screen,</i>

1885
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,607
<i>and for this generation
with a new message to it,</i>

1886
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,193

was started a long time ago.</i>

Seventeen years!</i>

looking at this thing...</i>

1898
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,732

you should talk about this.</i>

1899

<i>The fact that you pitched this in 1985

MUSKER: <i>Same meeting
with</i> Little Mermaid.

1901
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:55,158
CLEMENTS: <i>Yes,
I originally pitched this at</i>

1902
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,785
<i>what they called a gong show,</i>

1903
01:30:56,868 --> 01:31:00,789
<i>which was sort of a meeting, actually,
with Michael Eisner</i>

1904

1905

1906

1907

on the back burner for a long time</i>

1909

1910
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:20,225
CONLI: <i>A great lesson in
persistence on this one.</i>

1911
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,102

1912
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:25,480
<i>it is a piece of literature that I loved
ever since I was a kid.</i>

1913
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,524
<i>It was kind of the book
that got me into reading</i>

1914
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:29,985
<i>and so the opportunity to work on it</i>

1915
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,571
<i>and the vision that I was able
to share with these guys,</i>

1916

It's been an amazing team.</i>

CLEMENTS: <i>It's been just
an incredible group of people.</i>

1918

MUSKER: <i>In terms of the technology,</i>

1919
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,333
<i>had this movie gotten going
17 years ago</i>

1920

<i>were not necessarily available then,</i>

1923
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,341
<i>so it's been to the movie's
good fortune, I would say,</i>

1924
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,427
<i>that it's taken this long
to get off the ground.</i>

1925
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,179
CONLI: <i>Had we started five years
earlier, we couldn't have got there.</i>

<i>Had we started 17 years ago,</i>

1927
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,517
<i>we couldn't have dreamt of
where we would end up.</i>

1928
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,687
CLEMENTS: <i>And the intention was
even like, when we were...</i>

1929
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:09,274
<i>I mean, John and I have been working
on this for a long period of time.</i>

01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,735
<i>Even between
</i>Little Mermaid <i>and</i> Aladdin,

1931
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:12,861
<i>we worked on it a little bit.</i>

1932
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,072
<i>Between</i> Aladdin <i>and</i> Hercules
<i>we worked on it a little bit.</i>

1933
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:19,743
<i>And even then, we conceived it
as a big action-adventure movie</i>

1934
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:23,830
<i>and really wanted to get that
kind of action-adventure</i>

1935
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,415
<i>cinematics into it,</i>

1936
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,461
<i>and had no idea
how that would be possible,</i>

1937
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:34,049
<i>and it turned out that by the time
we were actually able to do the film,</i>

1938
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:37,385
<i>technology had developed
that actually made it possible,</i>

1939
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,638
<i>but even then, a lot of stuff was
developed in the course of the movie</i>

1940
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:43,224
<i>that didn't exist when we began.</i>

1941
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:46,895
CONLI: <i>And that's a testament to
the team, 'cause the team was really...</i>

<i>Everyone embraced this film,
everyone embraced the story,</i>

1943

<i>and everyone embraced
the technology that was there.</i>

1944
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,652
MUSKER: <i>And took it into these
uncharted territories,</i>

1945
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:57,405
<i>technologically speaking
and artistically speaking,</i>

1946
01:32:57,489 --> 01:33:03,244
<i>in terms of character design,
acting choices, virtual sets, 3-D, 2-D,</i>

1947
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,497
<i>you name it, all the way down the line,</i>

1948
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,333
<i>we were doing things
we hadn't really done before.</i>

1949
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:12,337
<i>And, yeah, it was a testament
to the team that they really...</i>

1950
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,883
CLEMENTS: <i>We decided to go for this
kind of classical look to the movie</i>

1951
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:21,346
<i>and a very sort of dimensional,
classical look to the characters,</i>

1952
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,225
<i>which really put a big emphasis,
not only on</i>

1953
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:30,105
<i>that you needed superb acting,
but draftsmanship was so important.</i>

1954
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:33,566
<i>And we had just such amazing
animators on this film</i>

1955
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:37,987
<i>who were not only terrific actors,
wonderful actors,</i>

1956
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,490
<i>but could draw so beautifully</i>

1957
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:45,787
<i>and the quality of draftsmanship,
I think, is a little bit unprecedented.</i>

1958
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,456
CONLI: <i>I think a nod also goes
to the performers themselves.</i>

1959
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,625
<i>Because I think,
from an acting standpoint,</i>

1960
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,586
<i>there are incredible performances
in this thing.</i>

1961
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:57,173
<i>I think it's one of the best
vocal performances</i>

1962
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,800
<i>I've seen in an animated film.</i>

1963
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,010
CLEMENTS: <i>By the way,
</i>Treasure Planet <i>was a</i>

1964

1965
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,558
<i>There were many other
titles considered,</i>

1966
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,643
<i>I think, for various reasons,</i>

1967
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:11,855

1968
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:14,983
<i>It was the title we always wanted to

1969

<i>Robert Louis Stevenson's
</i>Treasure Island

1970

1971

better than any other title.</i>
