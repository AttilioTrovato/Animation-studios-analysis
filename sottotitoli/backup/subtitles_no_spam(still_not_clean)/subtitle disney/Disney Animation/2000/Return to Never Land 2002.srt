Save me!

553
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:46,162
Oh, you big brute, you!
Off with you.

554
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:49,123
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
And take your arms with you.

555
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,750
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

[Gasps] Hmm!

558
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,922

Blast that scurvy boy!

561
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:07,261
This is all his fault.

562
00:30:07,303 --> 00:30:09,514
Mr. Smee, pipe up the crew.

563
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:14,767

Tink, what is she doing?

566
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:21,731
It looks like she's leaving.

-Hey, Jane.
-Aah!

574
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,630
How come you want
to go home so bad?

575
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,756
I have to get back
to my family.

576
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:56,006
Why?

577
00:30:57,091 --> 00:31:00,678
Well, um, I don't want
to talk about it.

578
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,720
Why not?

579
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:05,139
If you must know,
we had a fight.

580
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:06,348
Why?

581
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,682
[Sighs] Oh.

582
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:10,851
I told my little brother
you weren't real.

583
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,187
What?! Why?

584
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,605
[Sighs] Well, oh, I don't know.

585
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:17,606
But I have to get back
and set things right.

586
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:18,774
Why?

587
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:20,026
Because!

588
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,568

Well, you know,
you can't get home that way.

593
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,501
I--I've got to try.

594
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:49,256
[Sniffles] Well...good-bye.

595
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,259
It was nice meeting you,

You OK?

606
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,076
I just want to go home.

607
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:33,997
Well, you know, the only way
out of here is to fly.

608
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,331
Come on, I'll show you how.

609
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,834
Ohh!

00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,179
you worthless dogs!

Set your sights for Peter Pan!

00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,806
Oh, goodness.

614
00:32:57,848 --> 00:33:01,852
Haven't we searched the island
a thousand times before?

615
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:05,479
I beg your pardon, Mr. Smee?

616
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:10,400
[Stammering] I said that, uh,
searching for Pan is, um, uh...

617
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:12,985
fun galore.

we have that boy in irons.

00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:31,957
I really don't think this wo--

625
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,253
Uhh. This is ridiculous.

626
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:36,753
I can't fly!

627
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,047
Well, of course you can't.
But I can!

628
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:40,380
I guess I'm just
smarter than you.

629
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:41,590
Ohh.

630
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,759

Oh, yeah, that's it.

634
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,931
Well, then,
it must be my good looks.

635
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,058
Or maybe
you're full of hot air.

if she can't fly home...

650
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,957

to move in with us.

Oh, how will I ever
get back home?

672
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:30,714
So, the girl can't fly,
yet she wants to go home.

what this means?
