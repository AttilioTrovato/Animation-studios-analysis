1
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,367
<i>Although each of the world's countries
would like to dispute this fact,</i>

2
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,910
<i>we French know the truth:</i>

3
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,245
<i>The best food in the world
is made in France.</i>

4
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,414
<i>The best food in France
is made in Paris.</i>

5
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:42,835
<i>And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.</i>

6
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,505
<i>Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,</i>

7
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,215
<i>booked five months in advance.</i>

8
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,009
<i>And his dazzling ascent to the top
of fine French cuisine</i>

9
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,512
<i>has made his competitors envious.</i>

10
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,807
<i>He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.</i>

11
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,184
<i>Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
</i>Anyone Can Cook!

12
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,395
<i>climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</i>

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,814
<i>But not everyone
celebrates its success.</i>

14
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,441
<i>Amusing title,</i> Anyone Can Cook!

15
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:09,570
<i>What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.</i>

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,240
<i>I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.</i>

17
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,119
<i>And, no, I don't think
anyone can do it.</i>

18
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,367
<i>This is me.</i>

19
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,163
<i>I think it's apparent I need
to rethink my life a little bit.</i>

20
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,873
<i>What's my problem?</i>

21
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,916
<i>First of all, I'm a rat.</i>

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,504
<i>Which means life is hard.</i>

23
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:14,886
<i>And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.</i>

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,807
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

25
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,101
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

26
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,813
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

27
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:29,358
<i>This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.</i>

28
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:33,070
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

29
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>This is my dad.
He's never impressed.</i>

30
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,577
<i>He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.</i>

31
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,122
<i>So, what's wrong with having
highly developed senses?</i>

32
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:47,376
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

33
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,421
<i>Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.</i>

34
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,842
<i>Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.</i>

35
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,386
<i>I was feeling pretty good
about my gift,</i>

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,931
<i>until Dad gave me a job.</i>

37
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,641
Clean.

38
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:02,975
Clean.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,477
<i>That's right. Poison checker.</i>

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,728
Cleanerific.

41
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,313
Cleanerino.

42
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,524
Close to godliness.

43
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,737
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

44
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,697
Never mind. Move on.

45
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,283
<i>Well, it made my dad proud.</i>

46
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:23,996
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,666
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

48
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,378
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

49
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,463
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

50
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,091
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

51
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,219
<i>Let's just say we have
different points of view.</i>

52
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,721
<i>This much I knew:</i>

53
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,809
<i>If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.</i>

54
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,394
<i>But to my dad...</i>

55
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,645
Food is fuel.

56
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,399
You get picky about what you put in the tank,
your engine is going to die.

57
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,067
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,652
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

59
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,612
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

60
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,322
where nothing is poisoned?

61
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,992
First of all, we are not thieves.

62
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,953
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

63
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,246
It's dangerous.

64
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,250
<i>I know I'm supposed to hate humans,
but there's something about them.</i>

65
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,713
<i>They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.</i>

66
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,257
<i>I mean, just look at what
they do with food.</i>

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,842
<i>How can I describe it?</i>

68
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,929
<i>Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.</i>

69
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,473
<i>There is excellence all around you.</i>

70
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:28,144
<i>You need only be aware
to stop and savor it.</i>

71
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,233
<i>Oh, Gusteau was right.</i>

72
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,069
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

73
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,071
<i>Oh, amazing.</i>

74
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,950
<i>Each flavor was totally unique.</i>

75
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:50,207
<i>But combine one flavor with another,</i>

76
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,085
<i>and something new was created.</i>

77
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,302
<i>So now I had a secret life.</i>

78
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,729
<i>The only one who knew
about it was Emile.</i>

79
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,231
Hey, Emile. Emile.

80
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,525
I found a mushroom.

81
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,987
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

82
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,491
<i>He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.</i>

83
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,326
Why are you walking like that?

84
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,412
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

85
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,581
Did you ever think about
how we walk on the same paws

86
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,874
that we handle food with?

87
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,043
You ever think about what
we put into our mouths?

88
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,211
All the time.

89
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,880
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

90
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,131
Well, go ahead.

91
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:42,968
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

92
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,929
What have you got there?

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,392
You found cheese?

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,230
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chèvre de pays!

95
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,899
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

96
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:57,983
And...

97
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,406
This rosemary! This rosemary

98
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:07,201
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

99
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,663
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'll... You know...

100
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,167
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

101
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,877
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

102
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,546
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

103
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,714
Emile!

104
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,716
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

105
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,300
We got to cook this.

106
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:27,888
Now, exactly how we
cook this is the real...

107
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,141
Yeah.

108
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,060
The key is to keep turning it.

109
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:37,732
Get the smoky flavor
nice and even.

110
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,025
That storm's getting closer.

111
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:45,030
Hey, Remy, you think that
maybe we shouldn't be so...

112
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,335
You got to taste this!

113
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,757
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,844
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

115
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,848
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

116
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,185
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

117
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:18,898
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

118
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,650
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

119
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,196
I know what this needs. Saffron.
A little saffron would make this.

120
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,823
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

121
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,867
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

122
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,918
- Saffron.
- Not good.

123
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,461
Saffron.

124
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,465
Don't like it.
She's going to wake up.

125
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,966
I've been down here a million times.

126
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,261
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

127
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,347
You've been here a million times?

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,142
I'm telling you, saffron will be just the thing.
Gusteau swears by it.

129
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,061
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

130
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,439
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

131
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,400
Wait. You read?

132
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:08,322
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

133
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,993
You could fill a book, a lot of books,
with things Dad doesn't know.

134
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:17,248
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

135
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,833
I don't like secrets.

136
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,753
All this cooking and reading
and TV-watching

137
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,172
while we read and cook.

138
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,342
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

139
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,885
Why do I let you?

140
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,600
What's taking those kids so long?

141
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,729
L'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

142
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,525
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

143
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,319
<i>Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.</i>

144
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,905
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

145
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,533
<i>Great cooking is not
for the faint of heart.</i>

146
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,244
<i>You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.</i>

147
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,413
<i>You must try things
that may not work.</i>

148
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,623
<i>And you must not let anyone
define your limits</i>

149
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,876
<i>because of where you come from.</i>

150
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,211
<i>Your only limit is your soul.</i>

151
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:11,302
<i>What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.</i>

152
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,387
Pure poetry.

153
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,514
<i>But it was not to last.</i>

154
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,767
<i>Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars</i>

155
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:23,564
<i>after a scathing review by France's
top food critic, Anton Ego.</i>

156
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,233
<i>It was a severe blow to Gusteau,</i>

157
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,403
<i>and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,</i>

158
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,616
<i>which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.</i>

159
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,201
Gusteau is dead?

160
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,634
Run!

161
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,305
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

162
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,285
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

163
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,997
Try to grab you.

164
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,294
Emile, swing to me.

165
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,456
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

166
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,088
- Let me through!
- The book.

167
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,550
Excuse me. Move, move.

168
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,901
Go, go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

169
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,780
Get the bridge up!
Move it, move it!

170
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,866
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

171
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,576
Push off. Come on.

172
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,745
Get hold!

173
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:49,376
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

174
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,004
Hey, wait for me!

175
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,053
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

176
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,764
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

177
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm coming!

178
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,519
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

179
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,688
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

180
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,732
Come on. Reach for it.

181
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,901
You can do it.

182
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,573
- Remy!
- Dad!

183
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,409
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

184
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,334
Guys, wait. Stop!

185
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,503
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

186
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,298
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

187
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,177
Dad?

188
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,306
Dad?

189
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,652
Which way?

190
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,579
<i>I waited</i>

191
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,499
<i>for a sound,</i>

192
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,420
<i>a voice,</i>

193
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,174
<i>a sign,</i>

194
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,011
<i>something.</i>

195
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,617
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

196
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,954
Why do you wait and mope?

197
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,667
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

198
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,295
probably forever.

199
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,465
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

200
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,886
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

201
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:50,766
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

202
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,060
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

203
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,521
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

204
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,357
If you focus on what
you've left behind,

205
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,817
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

206
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,153
Now go up and look around.

207
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,441
Champagne!

208
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,278
What are you doing?

209
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm hungry.

210
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,864
I don't know where I am,

211
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,658
and I don't know when
I'll find food again.

212
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,370
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

213
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:58,500
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

214
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,836
But I am hungry.

215
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,172
Food will come, Remy.

216
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,885
Food always comes to those
who love to cook.

217
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,234
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

218
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,782
Paris?

219
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,911
All this time I've been
underneath Paris?

220
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,206
Wow.

221
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,627
It's beautiful.

222
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,422
The most beautiful.

223
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,342
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

224
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,886
You've led me to your restaurant.

225
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,142
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is. I have led you to it.

226
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,644
I got to see this.

227
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,854
- Ready to go on table seven.
- Coming around.

228
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,648
- One order of steamed pike up.
- Coming up.

229
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,483
I need more soup bowls, please.

230
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,194
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

231
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,572
I need two salmon,
three salade composée, and three fillet.

232
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,574
Three orders of salade
composée working.

233
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,368
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

234
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,995
Three fillet working. I need plates.

235
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,748
- Fire seven.
- Three salade composée up.

236
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,792
Don't mess with my mise!

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,085
Open down low.

238
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,171
I'm getting buried here.

239
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,007
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

240
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,135
- <i>Bonjour</i>, chef.
- Hello, Chef Skinner.

241
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,762
- Evening, chef.
- Ordering <i>deux</i> fillet.

242
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,722
Hey, boss, look who is here.

243
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,225
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

244
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,935
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

245
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,230
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

246
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:29,025
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

247
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:33,321
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

248
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,282
- My mother?
- Renata.

249
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,201
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

250
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,913
Well, not...
She's been better. I mean...

251
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,290
She died.

252
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,585
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,297
Oh, don't be.
She believed in heaven, so she's covered.

254
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,924
You know, afterlife-wise?

255
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,853
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

256
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,398
I think she hoped it would help me,

257
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,901
you know, get a job here.

258
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,653
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

259
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,821
Any son of Renata's is more than...

260
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,575
Yes, well, we could file this and
if something suitable opens up...

261
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,743
We have already hired him.

262
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,580
What? How dare you
hire someone without my...

263
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,415
We needed a garbage boy.

264
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,543
Oh, garbage. Well...

265
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm glad it worked out.

266
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,598
I can't believe it.

267
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,060
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

268
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,396
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

269
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,148
Which one is the chef?

270
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,945
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

271
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,655
Who is next in command?

272
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,574
The sous chef. There.

273
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,787
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

274
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,415
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

275
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:11,711
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

276
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,631
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

277
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,926
You are a clever rat.
Now, who is that?

278
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,720
Oh, him? He's nobody.

279
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,889
Not nobody.
He is part of the kitchen.

280
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,891
No, he's a <i>plongeuror</i> something.

281
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,477
He washes dishes or takes out the garbage.
He doesn't cook.

282
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,814
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

283
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,149
How do you know?
What do I always say?

284
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,901
Anyone can cook.

285
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,905
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

286
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:42,617
Well, that is not stopping him. See?

287
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:47,998
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

288
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,461
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

289
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,547
It's your restaurant. Do something.

290
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,800
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

291
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,845
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

292
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,022
Table five coming up, right now.

293
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,197
- Coming down the line.
- Set.

294
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,375
Hot! Open oven!

295
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,645
Coming around.

296
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,669
<i>Oui</i>, chef.
One fillet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

297
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,733
Fire those soufflés for table six, <i>ja</i>.

298
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,860
- Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

299
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,618
Tonight, I'd like
to present the foie gras.

300
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,453
It has a wonderful finish.

301
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,058
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

302
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,268
<i>Oui</i>, chef.

303
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,895
Remy! What are you waiting for?

304
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,813
Is this going to become
a regular thing with you?

305
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,608
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

306
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,917
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

307
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,586
Move it, garbage boy!

308
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,881
You are cooking?

309
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:10,510
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

310
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,679
Where do you get the gall

311
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,391
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

312
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,518
I should have you
drawn and quartered!

313
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,688
I'll do it.
I think the law is on my side.

314
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,357
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

315
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,612
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

316
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,866
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

317
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,452
Soup?

318
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,788
Stop that soup!

319
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,224
Waiter.

320
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,145
Linguini!

321
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,813
You're fired!

322
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,941
F-I-R-E-D! Fired!

323
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,360
She wants to see the chef.

324
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,571
But he...

325
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,798
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

326
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:33,092
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

327
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:37,263
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

328
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,057
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

329
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,767
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

330
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,268
Someone is asking about your soup.

331
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,989
What are you playing at?

332
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,618
Am I still fired?

333
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,870
- You can't fire him.
- What?

334
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:04,290
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

335
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,667
If she write a review to that effect

336
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,752
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

337
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,005
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

338
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,383
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

339
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,635
if we don't uphold his
most cherished belief?

340
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,638
And what belief is that,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Tatou?

341
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,722
Anyone can cook.

342
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,316
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

343
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,986
He has taken a bold risk

344
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:37,490
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

345
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,827
If he wishes to swim
in dangerous waters,

346
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,578
who are we to deny him?

347
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,915
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

348
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,169
Since you have expressed such
an interest in his cooking career,

349
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,296
you shall be responsible for it.

350
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,216
Anyone else?

351
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,095
Then back to work.

352
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,307
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

353
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:08,938
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

354
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,941
Very close attention.

355
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:16,696
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

356
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,950
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

357
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,785
Rat!

358
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,748
- Rat!
- Get the rat.

359
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,000
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

360
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,710
It's getting away. Get it, get it, get it.

361
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,254
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

362
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,923
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

363
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,592
Do you know what
would happen to us

364
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,178
if anyone knew we had
a rat in our kitchen?

365
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,888
They'd close us down.

366
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,390
Our reputation is hanging
by a thread as it is.

367
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,644
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

368
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:29,143
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

369
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,395
They expect me to cook it again!

370
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,398
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

371
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,609
I was just trying to stay
out of trouble.

372
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,779
You're the one who was
getting fancy with the spices!

373
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:44,784
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

374
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,537
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

375
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,540
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

376
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:54,961
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

377
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:02,385
I need this job. I've lost so many.

378
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:07,181
I don't know how to cook, and now I'm
actually talking to a rat as if you...

379
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,308
Did you nod?

380
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,561
Have you been nodding?

381
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,772
You understand me?

382
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,983
So I'm not crazy!

383
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,236
Wait a second, wait a second.

384
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,031
I can't cook, can I?

385
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,785
But you...

386
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,247
You can, right?

387
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,959
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

388
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,461
Whatever you did, they liked it.

389
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,631
Yeah. This could work.

390
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,509
Hey, they liked the soup!

391
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:51,267
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

392
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,315
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

393
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,277
But we're together on this. Right?

394
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,488
Okay.

395
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,686
So this is it.

396
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:21,148
I mean, it's not much,
but it's, you know...

397
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,568
Not much.

398
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,281
It could be worse.

399
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,783
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

400
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,369
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

401
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,788
<i>Are you...</i>

402
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,165
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

403
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,584
<i>The best kind of dream.</i>

404
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,254
<i>One we can share.</i>

405
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,964
<i>But why here?</i>

406
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,049
<i>Why now?</i>

407
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,719
<i>Why not here?</i>

408
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,721
<i>Why not now?</i>

409
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,559
<i>What better place to dream
than in Paris?</i>

410
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,408
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

411
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,577
Oh, no.

412
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,872
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

413
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,791
I let a rat into my place and
tell him what's mine is his!

414
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,001
Eggs, gone!

415
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,504
Stupid! He's stolen food and hit the road!
What did I expect?

416
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:28,132
That's what I get for trusting a...

417
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,595
Hi. Is that for me?

418
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,274
That's good.
What did you put in this?

419
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:48,861
Where'd you get that?

420
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:56,786
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

421
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,376
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

422
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,794
Come on, Little Chef!

423
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,796
"Though I, like many other critic,

424
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,216
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

425
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,887
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

426
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,014
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

427
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,602
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

428
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,563
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

429
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,734
Well...

430
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,827
You know.

431
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:45,042
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

432
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:48,629
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

433
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,383
So let's do this thing!

434
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,679
I...

435
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:13,529
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

436
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:17,533
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

437
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,368
Soup.

438
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,424
You little...

439
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,103
You son of a...

440
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,071
You got...

441
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,506
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

442
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,175
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

443
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,677
We've got to figure out
something else.

444
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,013
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

445
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,849
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

446
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,644
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

447
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,980
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

448
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,399
Little Chef?

449
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,278
Oh, you're hungry.

450
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,996
Okay. So let's think this out.

451
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,668
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

452
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,503
human.

453
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,464
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

454
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,592
in a way that doesn't look like I'm
being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

455
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:00,803
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

456
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,889
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

457
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,891
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

458
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:06,934
We gotta communicate.

459
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:11,313
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

460
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,067
The rat! I saw it!

461
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,320
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

462
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,157
What are you doing in here?

463
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:27,288
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

464
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,747
Get out.

465
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:33,794
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

466
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:37,548
That was close.
Are you okay up there?

467
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,437
How did you do that?

468
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,953
That's strangely involuntary!

469
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:14,043
<i>One look and I knew we had
the same crazy idea.</i>

470
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,545
Okay.

471
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,933
Where are you taking me? Wait.

472
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,486
Wait. I'm sorry.

473
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,241
Okay.

474
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,252
Okay.

475
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,654
All right.

476
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:33,849
That should do it.

477
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:42,649
Congratulations. You were able
to repeat your accidental success.

478
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:47,446
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

479
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:52,034
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

480
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,496
Listen, I just want you to know

481
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,457
how honored I am to be
studying under such...

482
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,919
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

483
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,420
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

484
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,880
Well, I...

485
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,382
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

486
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,676
Because haute cuisine is
an antiquated hierarchy

487
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,429
built upon rules written
by stupid old men.

488
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,974
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

489
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,352
But still I'm here.
How did this happen?

490
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,063
Because, well, because you...

491
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,315
Because I am the toughest
cook in this kitchen.

492
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,067
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

493
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,111
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

494
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,404
Got it?

495
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,117
Wow!

496
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,997
Easy to cook. Easy to eat.
Gusteau makes Chinese food

497
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,208
Chine-easy.

498
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,880
- Excellent work, François, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

499
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:51,218
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

500
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,554
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

501
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:58,225
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

502
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,518
What are corn dogs?

503
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:04,064
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

504
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,482
Whip something up.

505
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:09,111
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

506
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:12,406
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

507
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:16,285
Yes. But, please, with dignity.

508
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,271
Get my lawyer!

509
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,232
Well, the will stipulates

510
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:51,111
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

511
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,529
no heir appears,

512
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:56,909
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

513
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,036
I know what the will stipulates.

514
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,416
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

515
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,589
There's not much resemblance.

516
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,217
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

517
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,471
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

518
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,849
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

519
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,101
Suddenly, some boy
arrives with a letter

520
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:28,190
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

521
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,775
Highly suspect!

522
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,735
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

523
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,445
- May I?
- Of course.

524
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,988
But the boy does not know.

525
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:39,451
She claims she never told him, or Gusteau,
and asks that I not tell.

526
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:43,538
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

527
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,541
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

528
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,169
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

529
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,214
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

530
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,132
Find out how much of this is real.

531
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,802
I will need you to collect
some DNA samples

532
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,637
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

533
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,058
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

534
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,019
He knows something.

535
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:10,273
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

536
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,739
What are you doing?

537
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,825
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

538
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,660
No! You waste energy and time!

539
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,746
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

540
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,998
Well, Mommy never had to face

541
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,666
the dinner rush when
the orders come flooding in,

542
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,209
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

543
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,669
and all of the different cooking times,

544
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,004
but must arrive
on the customer's table

545
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,172
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

546
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:36,967
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

547
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,723
What is this?
Keep your station clear!

548
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,516
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

549
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,184
Messy stations slow things down.

550
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,603
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

551
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,397
I'll make this easy to remember.

552
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,026
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

553
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:58,363
Your sleeves look like you
threw up on them.

554
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:01,158
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

555
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,367
Always return to this position.

556
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:06,079
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

557
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:09,082
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

558
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,793
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

559
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:13,628
I know the Gusteau style cold.

560
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:17,049
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

561
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,052
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

562
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:23,930
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

563
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,515
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

564
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,935
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

565
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,979
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

566
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:33,398
How do you tell how good
bread is without tasting it?

567
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:37,736
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

568
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:38,820
Listen.

569
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:43,784
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

570
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,037
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

571
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,081
and there are only
two way to get first pick.

572
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:53,001
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

573
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,837
<i>Voilà!</i> The best restaurant get first pick.

574
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,925
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

575
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:03,929
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

576
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,598
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

577
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:11,019
And then he get fired for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

578
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,980
- Horst has done time.
- What for?

579
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:17,442
No one know for sure.
He changes the story every time you ask him.

580
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,486
I defrauded a major corporation.

581
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,115
I robbed the second largest bank in France
using only a ballpoint pen.

582
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,742
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

583
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:28,537
I killed a man with this thumb.

584
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,747
Don't ever play cards with Pompidou.

585
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:34,417
He's been banned from
Las Vegas and Monte Carlo.

586
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:38,004
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

587
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:41,091
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

588
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,676
So you see.

589
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:47,139
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

590
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,642
- We?
- <i>Oui</i>. You are one of us now, <i>oui</i>?

591
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:55,480
<i>Oui.</i> Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

592
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,316
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

593
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,026
For taking it.

594
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,949
The rat!

595
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:11,204
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

596
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,710
Have you decided this evening?

597
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:20,881
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

598
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:24,551
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

599
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:25,719
I know about the foie gras.

600
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,637
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

601
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,890
What does the chef have that's new?

602
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,435
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

603
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,519
Yes. What do I tell them?

604
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,354
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

605
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:37,731
What are you blathering about?

606
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,941
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

607
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,527
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

608
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,447
This is simple.

609
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,699
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

610
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,451
something we haven't made in a while...

611
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:53,330
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

612
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:59,044
They are asking for food from Linguini?

613
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,922
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

614
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,632
Were we saying that?

615
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,385
Very well.
If it's Linguini they want

616
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:12,057
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

617
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,268
Something definitely off menu.

618
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:17,229
Oh, and don't forget to stress

619
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,814
- its Linguini-ness.
- <i>Oui</i>, chef.

620
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:24,069
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

621
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:29,491
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread à la Gusteau.

622
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,243
- Colette will help you.
- <i>Oui</i>, chef.

623
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:34,204
Now, hurry up.
Our diners are hungry.

624
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:37,082
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

625
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,917
Gusteau himself said so.

626
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,420
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

627
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,089
"Sweetbread à la Gusteau.

628
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,675
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

629
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,719
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

630
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:52,347
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

631
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,225
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

632
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:58,687
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

633
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,314
Lalo! We have some
veal stomach soaking, yes?

634
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,441
Yes! The veal stomach, I get that.

635
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:04,734
Veal stomach?

636
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,452
Okay.

637
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:24,879
I'll be right back. Where...

638
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,174
Hey, I got to...

639
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:32,554
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

640
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,806
Let's see, over here...

641
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,224
I'll be back.

642
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,435
Thank you.

643
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,812
Excuse me. I'm going to...

644
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,523
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

645
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,317
I'm going to pick that up.

646
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,610
I got some of that spice.

647
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,738
Okay.

648
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,072
What are you doing?
You're supposed

649
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,490
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

650
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:53,908
This is the recipe.

651
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,077
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

652
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,705
What else have you...
You are improvising?

653
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,249
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

654
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,585
You're right. I should listen to you!

655
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,879
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

656
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:08,548
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

657
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,675
- Where is the special order?
- Coming!

658
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,053
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

659
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:15,847
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

660
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,266
- The special?
- Come get it!

661
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,021
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

662
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:32,447
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

663
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:36,618
Sorry.

664
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,122
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

665
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,250
<i>Ja</i>. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

666
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:47,962
- Did you taste it?
- <i>Ja</i>, of course, before he changed it.

667
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,882
Good. What? How could he change it?

668
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,968
He changed it as it was
going out the door!

669
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,220
They love it!

670
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:58,056
Other diners are already asking
about it, about Linguini.

671
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,933
I have seven more orders!

672
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,685
That's wonderful.

673
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,525
I'd like one of those.

674
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,570
Special order!

675
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:17,409
What is that?

676
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,829
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

677
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:30,588
To Linguini.

678
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:33,258
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, <i>ja</i>?

679
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,718
Drink now, there's plenty.

680
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,475
Take a break, Little Chef.
Get some air.

681
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,520
We really did it tonight.

682
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,073
Got your toque.

683
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,451
Oh, seriously now.

684
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:04,289
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

685
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:07,041
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

686
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,962
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

687
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:16,050
The <i>plongeur</i> won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

688
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,887
He's gotten all he needs.

689
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,559
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

690
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:27,562
Good for you.

691
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,649
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

692
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:35,862
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

693
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:40,158
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

694
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:44,329
not to appreciate this
'61 Château Latour.

695
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:48,583
And you, <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini,
are no idiot.

696
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:52,420
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

697
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,112
- Remy!
- Emile?

698
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,323
I can't believe it! You're alive!

699
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,991
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

700
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,035
We figured you didn't
survive the rapids.

701
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,287
And what are you eating?

702
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,917
I don't really know.

703
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,212
I think it was some
sort of wrapper once.

704
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:39,050
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

705
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,637
No brother of mine eats
rejectamenta in my town.

706
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:55,525
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

707
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:59,904
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

708
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:03,157
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

709
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:08,037
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

710
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,749
So, where did you train, Linguini?

711
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,168
Train? All right.

712
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:18,881
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

713
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,300
- It's not.
- I knew it!

714
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:24,137
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

715
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,847
Monday was my first time.

716
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,725
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

717
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,102
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

718
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,439
Tell me, Linguini,
about your interests.

719
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:39,444
- Do you like animals?
- What? Animals? What kind?

720
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:44,032
The usual, dogs, cats,
horses, guinea pigs,

721
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,325
rats.

722
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:50,121
I brought you something to...
No, no, no, no!

723
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,873
Spit that out right now!

724
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,960
I have got to teach you about food.
Close your eyes.

725
00:54:56,419 --> 00:55:00,882
Now take a bite of...
No! No! No!

726
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,385
- Don't just hork it down!
- Too late.

727
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:05,887
Here.

728
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:10,558
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

729
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,104
- See?
- Not really.

730
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:18,441
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

731
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,569
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

732
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:24,781
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

733
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,328
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

734
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:34,040
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

735
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,125
Okay.

736
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:40,088
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

737
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,256
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

738
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,092
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

739
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,010
Now, imagine every
great taste in the world

740
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,096
being combined into
infinite combinations.

741
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,265
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

742
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,767
I think...

743
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,437
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

744
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,022
But that was interesting.

745
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:00,858
Most interesting garbage I ever...
What are we doing?

746
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,360
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

747
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,737
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

748
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,406
- Yeah! But...
- What?

749
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:09,450
Thing is, I kind of have to...

750
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:11,994
What do you "have to"
more than family?

751
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,371
What's more important here?

752
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,123
Well, I...

753
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,584
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

754
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,503
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

755
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,463
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

756
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,048
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

757
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:25,758
Nopety nopety no.

758
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:28,553
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

759
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,973
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

760
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,475
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

761
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,688
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

762
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,356
If you're going to name a food,

763
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,401
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

764
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:48,781
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

765
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:53,119
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

766
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:00,501
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

767
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,339
My son has returned!

768
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:34,786
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

769
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:38,748
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

770
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:43,336
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

771
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:46,964
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

772
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:52,053
- Yeah, well, about that...
- You look thin. Why is that?

773
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:55,681
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

774
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,354
It's tough out there in the
big world all alone, isn't it?

775
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,524
Sure, but it's not like
I'm a kid anymore.

776
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:07,318
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

777
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:11,239
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

778
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,867
Nothing like a cold splash
of reality to make you...

779
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,787
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

780
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:22,834
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

781
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,545
You didn't think I was going
to stay forever, did you?

782
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,880
Eventually, a bird's got
to leave the nest.

783
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,258
We're not birds. We're rats.

784
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,302
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

785
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:36,389
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

786
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:37,515
Maybe that's a good thing.

787
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:40,059
Hey! The band's really on tonight, huh?

788
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,395
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

789
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:45,022
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

790
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:47,191
I want to add something
to this world.

791
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,361
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

792
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,155
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

793
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:59,996
I've been able to observe them
at a close-ish sort of range.

794
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,373
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

795
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,127
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

796
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:10,548
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

797
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,594
You know, I'm going to stay here.

798
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:18,848
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

799
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:22,101
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

800
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,145
Is that a problem?

801
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:27,940
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

802
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,657
We're here.

803
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,337
Take a good long look, Remy.

804
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:52,089
Now, this is what happens

805
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:55,760
when a rat gets a little
too comfortable around humans.

806
00:59:56,677 --> 01:00:00,181
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

807
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,434
We must live carefully.

808
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,730
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

809
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:11,859
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

810
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,116
- No.
- What?

811
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:26,123
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

812
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,293
Can only be more of this?

813
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,715
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

814
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:40,054
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

815
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:43,724
And it starts when we decide.

816
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:48,562
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

817
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,796
Hey! Yeah.

818
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:13,064
Stop it.

819
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,682
Good morning.

820
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,353
Good morning.

821
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:57,900
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

822
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,527
That's big.

823
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,446
That's big. What did he say?

824
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:07,952
What?

825
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,538
What, you can't tell me?

826
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:17,294
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

827
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:18,796
Oh, I see how it is.

828
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:21,507
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

829
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,343
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

830
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,928
Wake up. Wake up.

831
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:30,057
I thought you were different.

832
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,811
I thought you thought
I was different.

833
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,188
I thought...

834
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:40,818
I didn't have to help you!

835
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:44,238
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

836
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,447
But...

837
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:50,953
I wanted you to succeed.
I liked you.

838
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,248
My mistake.

839
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,252
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

840
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:01,422
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

841
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:05,467
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

842
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,888
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

843
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,723
At least not without your help.

844
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:14,268
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

845
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:18,522
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

846
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,691
When I added that extra ingredient

847
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,652
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

848
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:25,946
that wasn't me either.

849
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,949
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

850
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,868
I would've followed the recipe.

851
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,328
I would've followed your advice.

852
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,246
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

853
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:38,542
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

854
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,294
But I...

855
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:41,962
Don't do it.

856
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,382
I have a secret.
It's sort of disturbing.

857
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,638
- I have a...
- What? You...

858
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:54,975
- I have a...
- You have a rash?

859
01:04:55,059 --> 01:05:00,356
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

860
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,732
Little...

861
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:06,987
- A tiny chef who tells me what to do.
- A tiny chef?

862
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,657
Yes. Yes. He's...

863
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:14,662
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

864
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:20,125
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

865
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:25,172
You inspire me.
I'm going to risk it all.

866
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:30,094
I'm going to risk looking like the biggest
idiot psycho you've ever seen.

867
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,429
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

868
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,556
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

869
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,393
Don't laugh!
I'm going to show you!

870
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:42,064
No! No!

871
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:29,820
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

872
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,823
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

873
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:36,035
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

874
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,662
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

875
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,622
What? What? Spit it out.

876
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:44,168
It's come back. It's popular.

877
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:52,092
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

878
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:53,302
My last review condemned it

879
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,928
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

880
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:59,224
I said, "Gusteau has finally found
his rightful place in history

881
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:03,103
"right alongside another
equally famous chef,

882
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:04,980
"<i>Monsieur</i> Boyardee."

883
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,065
Touché.

884
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:09,568
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

885
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,696
- The last word.
- Yes.

886
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,115
Then tell me, Ambrister,

887
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:19,953
how could it be popular?

888
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:25,459
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

889
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,712
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

890
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:30,047
He is Gusteau's son.

891
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:34,051
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

892
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,469
The boy knows!

893
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,555
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

894
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,060
He's toying with my mind like a cat
with a ball of... Something.

895
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,604
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

896
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,773
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

897
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:49,566
Yes. He's consorting with it.

898
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,236
Deliberately trying to make
me think it's important.

899
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,822
- The rat.
- Exactly!

900
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:58,742
Is the rat important?

901
01:07:58,951 --> 01:08:02,204
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

902
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,581
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

903
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:07,334
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

904
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:10,003
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

905
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,091
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

906
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:17,428
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

907
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,595
But, oh, no!

908
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:22,933
I refuse to be sucked
into his little game of...

909
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:31,650
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

910
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:53,464
I can't fire him.
He's getting attention.

911
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:55,924
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

912
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:58,469
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

913
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,220
What are you so worried about?

914
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,555
Isn't it good to have the press?

915
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,308
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's
name getting headlines?

916
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,810
Not if they're over his face!

917
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:10,689
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

918
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:15,903
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

919
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,155
The deadline passes in three days.

920
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,158
Then you can fire him whenever
he ceases to be valuable

921
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,410
and no one will ever know.

922
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:26,371
I was worried about
the hair sample you gave me.

923
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,916
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

924
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:33,587
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

925
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,511
- No, no, no.
- What?

926
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,930
Try this. It's better.

927
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:59,112
Well, because you...

928
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:24,346
Rat!

929
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:33,146
Disgusting little creatures.

930
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,951
<i>I was reminded how fragile it all was.</i>

931
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:48,996
<i>How the world really saw me.</i>

932
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:53,750
<i>And it just kept getting better.</i>

933
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:55,419
Remy!

934
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,341
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

935
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:05,095
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

936
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:09,099
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

937
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,060
Emile, that's exactly
what I said not to do!

938
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,937
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

939
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:17,316
I didn't think you meant them.
Look, I'm sorry.

940
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,901
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

941
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:24,573
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

942
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:25,991
Wait here.

943
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,123
It's locked?

944
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:44,843
- Remy, what are you doing in here?
- Okay. Emile shows up with...

945
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:48,889
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

946
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:51,141
Yeah, it's a disaster.

947
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:54,895
Anyway, they're hungry,
the food safe is locked and I need the key.

948
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:59,191
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

949
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:03,111
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

950
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:05,822
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

951
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:07,991
you think I'd be hawking
barbecue over here?

952
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:09,159
Or microwave burritos?

953
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,328
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

954
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,246
About as French as a corn dog!

955
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:14,456
Coming soon!

956
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:16,458
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

957
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,168
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

958
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,920
I cannot control how they
use my image, Remy.

959
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,422
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

960
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:27,552
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

961
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:30,931
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

962
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,099
Here it is.

963
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,434
Hey. Your will!

964
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:39,564
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

965
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,485
Linguini?

966
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:47,072
Why would Linguini
be filed with your will?

967
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:49,116
This used to be my office.

968
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:13,849
He's your son?

969
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,810
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

970
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:20,897
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

971
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:24,735
Well, your son is the rightful
owner of this restaurant!

972
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,863
No! No! The rat!

973
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:36,663
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

974
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:39,166
- It's getting away!
- Hey, Mr. Chef!

975
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:20,058
- You! Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

976
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,105
Bottoms up, Linguini!

977
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:28,942
Cheers, <i>ja</i>.

978
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:38,511
- Chef! Chef!
- Chef Linguini!

979
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,766
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

980
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,267
What is the secret to your genius?

981
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:48,021
Secret? You want the truth?

982
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:54,110
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

983
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:56,571
But you weren't aware of
that fact until very recently.

984
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:57,614
No.

985
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,492
And it resulted in your taking
ownership of this restaurant.

986
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,118
How did you find out?

987
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:05,497
Well, some part of me just knew.

988
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:07,374
The Gusteau part?

989
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:13,380
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

990
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,216
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

991
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:19,928
Something's stuck in my teeth.

992
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,724
Health Inspector.

993
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,477
I wish to report a rat infestation.

994
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:31,147
It's taken over my...
Gusteau's restaurant.

995
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,399
<i>Gusteau's, eh?</i>

996
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:36,695
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

997
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,905
<i>It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!</i>

998
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,866
<i>Monsieur</i>, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

999
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:44,077
But the rat! You must...

1000
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,789
It stole my documents.

1001
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:53,003
- It's past opening time.
- He should have finished an hour ago.

1002
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:57,090
<i>Bonjour, ma chérie.</i>
Join us.

1003
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,342
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1004
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,429
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1005
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:05,932
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1006
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:09,853
- It's him.
- Ego?

1007
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:10,937
Anton Ego!

1008
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:12,439
Is that Ego?

1009
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,607
I can't believe it.

1010
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:18,028
- You are <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini?
- Hello.

1011
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,657
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1012
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:26,453
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1013
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,747
as you are new to this game.

1014
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:31,249
- Game?
- Yes.

1015
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,419
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1016
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:39,674
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1017
01:18:39,841 --> 01:18:41,968
You're Anton Ego.

1018
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:46,890
You're slow for someone
in the fast lane.

1019
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:50,977
And you're thin for someone
who likes food.

1020
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:58,651
I don't like food. I love it.

1021
01:18:59,027 --> 01:19:03,656
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1022
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:08,661
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1023
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:11,873
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1024
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:22,592
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1025
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,845
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1026
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,265
Don't give me that look.

1027
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:31,559
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1028
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:36,106
How am I supposed to concentrate
with you yanking on my hair all the time?

1029
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,440
And that's another thing.

1030
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:40,443
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1031
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:43,154
Colette knows how to cook,
too, you know.

1032
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,781
All right, that's it!

1033
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,620
You take a break, Little Chef.

1034
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:51,955
I'm not your puppet,

1035
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:55,667
and you're not my
puppet-controlling guy!

1036
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,043
The rat is the cook.

1037
01:19:57,127 --> 01:20:00,046
You cool off and get
your mind right, Little Chef.

1038
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:03,133
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1039
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:07,595
You stupid...

1040
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:13,351
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1041
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:17,313
Yeah, it's like you're his
fluffy bunny or something.

1042
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:19,774
I'm sorry, Remy.

1043
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:20,859
I know there are too many guys.

1044
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:21,943
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1045
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,862
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1046
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,989
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1047
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:29,075
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1048
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:30,326
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1049
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,829
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1050
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:35,999
Little Chef?

1051
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:50,221
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1052
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,551
Little Chef?

1053
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:30,595
Little Chef?

1054
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:32,931
Hey, Little Chef.

1055
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:36,309
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1056
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:40,647
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1057
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,026
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1058
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,987
Look, I don't want to fight.

1059
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:50,823
I've been under a lot of,
you know, pressure.

1060
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,327
A lot has changed in not
very much time, you know?

1061
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,703
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1062
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:57,705
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1063
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,541
people will be disappointed.

1064
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,543
It's weird.

1065
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,588
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1066
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:08,466
because nobody's ever
expected anything of me.

1067
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,344
And the only reason anyone
expects anything from me now

1068
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,638
is because of you.

1069
01:22:15,223 --> 01:22:16,933
I haven't been fair to you.

1070
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:20,520
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1071
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:22,438
You've been a good friend.

1072
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,692
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1073
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,903
What is this?

1074
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,072
What's going on?

1075
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,576
Hey...

1076
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,161
You're...

1077
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:40,623
You're stealing food?
How could you?

1078
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:43,876
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1079
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,296
Get out!
You and all your rat buddies!

1080
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:47,797
And don't come back

1081
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,384
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1082
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:02,729
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1083
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:06,691
We are what we are,
and we're rats.

1084
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:11,946
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1085
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:13,823
Steal all you want.

1086
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,868
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1087
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:33,885
Do you know what you
would like this evening, sir?

1088
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:38,806
Yes, I'd like your heart
roasted on a spit.

1089
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,271
Come in!

1090
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:49,108
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1091
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:53,112
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1092
01:23:56,616 --> 01:24:00,119
Attention. Attention, everyone.

1093
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,747
Tonight is a big night.

1094
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:07,126
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1095
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:11,506
I mean, Ego.
He's coming. The critic.

1096
01:24:12,173 --> 01:24:15,176
And he's going to order something.

1097
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,804
Something from our menu.

1098
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:22,600
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1099
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,560
Just can't leave it alone, can you?

1100
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:28,314
You really shouldn't be here during
restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1101
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:29,649
I'm hungry!

1102
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:32,402
And I don't need
the inside food to be happy.

1103
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:35,571
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1104
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:37,990
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1105
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:43,496
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1106
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:52,338
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1107
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,967
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1108
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,511
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1109
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:02,557
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1110
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,393
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1111
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:11,566
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1112
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:13,526
Yeah! Let's...

1113
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,194
Okay.

1114
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,532
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1115
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:23,786
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1116
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:27,665
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1117
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:34,589
<i>Au revoir,</i> rat!

1118
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:44,474
Do you know what you
would like this evening, sir?

1119
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:46,100
Yes, I think I do.

1120
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:50,730
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1121
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,899
you know what I'm craving?

1122
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:57,236
A little perspective.

1123
01:25:57,403 --> 01:26:02,492
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1124
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:05,411
Can you suggest a good wine
to go with that?

1125
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:10,416
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1126
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,709
I am...

1127
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,588
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1128
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,050
and no one else seems
to have it in this bloody town,

1129
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:20,676
I'll make you a deal.

1130
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,889
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1131
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:29,018
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1132
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,937
I'm afraid I...

1133
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:35,024
Your dinner selection?

1134
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:40,488
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1135
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:44,075
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1136
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:50,706
I will have whatever he is having.

1137
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,050
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1138
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:04,303
We are in a cage
inside the car trunk

1139
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:07,390
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1140
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:11,352
No, I'm the one in a cage.
I've given up.

1141
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:14,063
You are free.

1142
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,650
I am only as free as you
imagine me to be.

1143
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,985
As you are.

1144
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:23,739
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1145
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:26,242
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1146
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:29,078
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1147
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,122
You only tell me stuff
I already know!

1148
01:27:31,205 --> 01:27:34,250
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1149
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,335
Why do I need to pretend?

1150
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:40,047
But you don't, Remy.

1151
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,508
You never did.

1152
01:27:51,434 --> 01:27:53,436
No. My other left!

1153
01:27:53,603 --> 01:27:55,438
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1154
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:57,940
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1155
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,233
Dad!

1156
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:02,403
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1157
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,034
I love you guys!

1158
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:11,120
Where are you going?

1159
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,789
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1160
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:17,460
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1161
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:26,969
It's your recipe.

1162
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:29,138
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1163
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,141
I didn't write it down.
It just came to me.

1164
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,311
Then make it come to you again, <i>ja</i>?
Because we can't serve this!

1165
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:36,395
Where's my order?

1166
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,856
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1167
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:40,024
This is what they're ordering.

1168
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:42,485
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1169
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:44,278
We cannot be all out.
We just opened.

1170
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:47,365
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1171
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:49,617
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1172
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,077
I don't know what I did.

1173
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,912
We need to tell
the customers something.

1174
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,914
Then tell them... Tell them...

1175
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:03,339
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1176
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,508
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1177
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:09,679
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1178
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:11,013
Rats!

1179
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,350
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1180
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,435
Don't touch him!

1181
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:21,107
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1182
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,694
I know this sounds insane, but...

1183
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:27,363
Well, the truth sounds
insane sometimes.

1184
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,575
But that doesn't mean
it's not the truth.

1185
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:36,539
And the truth is,
I have no talent at all.

1186
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:41,210
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1187
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:46,424
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1188
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:49,301
He's been controlling my actions.

1189
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,306
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1190
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:57,643
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1191
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,646
You've been giving me
credit for his gift.

1192
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,523
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1193
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,609
But, hey, you believed
I could cook, right?

1194
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:11,490
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1195
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,410
We can be the greatest
restaurant in Paris,

1196
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:19,999
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1197
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:23,127
What do you say? You with me?

1198
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:12,069
Dad.

1199
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:19,118
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1200
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:23,372
I was wrong about your
friend and about you.

1201
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:27,626
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1202
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:30,588
I can't choose between
two halves of myself.

1203
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:34,550
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1204
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,636
This really means that much to you?

1205
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:48,647
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1206
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:51,817
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1207
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:03,454
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1208
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:05,789
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1209
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:32,358
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1210
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:38,030
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1211
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,824
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1212
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:52,503
We need someone to wait tables.

1213
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:10,813
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1214
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:13,190
Please, take all of the time you need.

1215
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:18,946
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1216
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:25,577
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1217
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,997
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1218
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,667
Easy with that sole meunière.
Less salt. More butter.

1219
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,752
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1220
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:37,548
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1221
01:34:37,715 --> 01:34:40,342
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composée.

1222
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:43,595
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1223
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:47,933
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1224
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,436
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1225
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,522
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1226
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,773
Sorry.

1227
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,529
Colette, wait! Colette.

1228
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:04,992
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1229
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:06,660
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1230
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,246
Just tell me what
the rat wants to cook.

1231
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:14,835
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1232
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,963
Are you sure you want
to serve this to Ego?

1233
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:40,986
What? I am making ratatouille.
Well, how would you prepare it?

1234
01:36:13,936 --> 01:36:17,147
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1235
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:09,783
No, it can't be.

1236
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:14,037
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1237
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:22,671
I can't remember the last time

1238
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:26,091
I asked a waiter to give
my compliments to the chef.

1239
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:29,845
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1240
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:32,055
of having my waiter be the chef.

1241
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:35,184
Thanks, but I'm just
your waiter tonight.

1242
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:38,729
Then who do I thank
for the meal?

1243
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,273
Excuse me a minute.

1244
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:53,285
You must be the chef...

1245
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,537
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1246
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:57,706
until all the other customer have gone.

1247
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,918
So be it.

1248
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:25,150
<i>At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.</i>

1249
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:31,281
<i>But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.</i>

1250
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:40,958
<i>He doesn't react beyond asking
an occasional question.</i>

1251
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:45,837
<i>And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...</i>

1252
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,589
Thank you for the meal.

1253
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:50,592
<i>...and leaves without another word.</i>

1254
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:56,807
<i>The following day his review appears.</i>

1255
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:03,438
<i>In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.</i>

1256
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:07,859
<i>We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those</i>

1257
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:12,030
<i>who offer up their work and
their selves to our judgment.</i>

1258
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:17,661
<i>We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.</i>

1259
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:24,710
<i>But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1260
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:28,797
<i>the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful</i>

1261
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,217
<i>than our criticism designating it so.</i>

1262
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:36,680
<i>But there are times when
a critic truly risks something</i>

1263
01:39:36,763 --> 01:39:41,101
<i>and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.</i>

1264
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:45,814
<i>The world is often unkind to new talent,
new creations.</i>

1265
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:48,483
<i>The new needs friends.</i>

1266
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:52,321
<i>Last night,
I experienced something new,</i>

1267
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:57,492
<i>an extraordinary meal from
a singularly unexpected source.</i>

1268
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,329
<i>To say that both the meal
and its maker</i>

1269
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:03,915
<i>have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking</i>

1270
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:06,752
<i>is a gross understatement.</i>

1271
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:10,339
<i>They have rocked me to my core.</i>

1272
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:14,509
<i>In the past, I have made
no secret of my disdain</i>

1273
01:40:14,593 --> 01:40:19,598
<i>for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."</i>

1274
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:26,104
<i>But I realize only now do I
truly understand what he meant.</i>

1275
01:40:26,396 --> 01:40:30,359
<i>Not everyone can become
a great artist,</i>

1276
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:34,780
<i>but a great artist can come
from anywhere.</i>

1277
01:40:35,364 --> 01:40:38,617
<i>It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins</i>

1278
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:42,579
<i>than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,</i>

1279
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:45,540
<i>who is, in this critic's opinion,</i>

1280
01:40:45,624 --> 01:40:49,878
<i>nothing less than
the finest chef in France.</i>

1281
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:55,425
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.</i>

1282
01:40:55,759 --> 01:40:59,054
<i>It was a great night.
The happiest of my life.</i>

1283
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:03,308
<i>But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.</i>

1284
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,895
<i>Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,</i>

1285
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,564
<i>and of course they ratted us out.</i>

1286
01:41:09,898 --> 01:41:11,566
<i>The food didn't matter.</i>

1287
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:14,027
<i>Once it got out there were
rats in the kitchen,</i>

1288
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:16,196
<i>oh, man, the restaurant was closed</i>

1289
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:19,032
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1290
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:21,076
But don't feel too bad for him.

1291
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:24,663
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1292
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,582
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

1293
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:37,884
Got to go. Dinner rush.

1294
01:41:45,434 --> 01:41:47,144
You know how he likes it.

1295
01:41:52,482 --> 01:41:54,109
Thanks, Little Chef.

1296
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,618
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1297
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:06,872
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

1298
01:42:07,956 --> 01:42:09,833
Surprise me.

1299
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:18,675
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1300
01:42:22,095 --> 01:42:25,807
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1301
01:42:27,684 --> 01:42:30,812
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
