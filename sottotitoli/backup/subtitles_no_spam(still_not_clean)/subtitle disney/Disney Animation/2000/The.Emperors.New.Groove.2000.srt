1
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,486
Aah!

2
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,743
Will you take a look at that?

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,202
Pretty pathetic, huh?

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,787
Well, you'll never believe this,

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,041
but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,709
And not just any human being.

7
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,210
That guy was an emperor.

8
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,337
A rich, powerful ball of charisma.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,714
Oh, yeah!

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,633
This is his story.

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,552
Well, actually my story.

12
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,889
That's right. I'm that llama.

13
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,391
The name is Kuzco...

14
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,852
Emperor Kuzco.

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,731
I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,066
Oh, is that hard to believe?

17
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,318
Look, I tell you what.
You go back aways...

18
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,404
You know, before I was a llama,
and this will all make sense.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,199
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,409
Oh-ho. Look at me!

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,078
That's me as a baby.

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,082
Ahem!

23
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,374
All right, let's move ahead.

24
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,602
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,604
There are despots and dictators

26
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,148
Political manipulators

27
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,486
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

28
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,613
There are kings and catty tyrants

29
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,825
Who are so lacking in refinements

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,744
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

31
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,455
He was born and raised to rule

32
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,125
No one has ever been as cool

33
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,419
In a thousand years of aristocracy

34
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,965
An enigma and a mystery

35
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,008
In Mesoamerican history

36
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,637
The quintessence
of perfection that is he

37
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,432
Okay, this is the real me. Not this.

38
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,892
This. Not this.

39
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,477
Winner! Loser.

40
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,314
Okay, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command.

41
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,774
Check this out.

42
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,526
Butler.

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,986
Chef.

44
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,988
Theme song guy.

45
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,656
Oh, yeah!

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,658
He's the sovereign lord of the nation

47
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,286
He's the hippest cat in creation

48
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,330
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z

49
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,876
And this perfect world will spin

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,128
Around his every little whim

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,006
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

52
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,048
Me.

53
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,175
What's his name?

54
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,636
Kuzco

55
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,013
That's his name

56
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,806
Kuzco

57
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,933
He's the king of the world

58
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,019
Kuzco

59
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,854
Is he hip or what?

60
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,814
Kuzco

61
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,524
Yeah

62
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,153
Gow!

63
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,322
You threw off my groove!

64
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,617
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.

65
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,536
Sorry!

66
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,538
You were saying?

67
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,124
What's his name?
Kuzco

68
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,628
Kuzco

69
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,842
That's his name

70
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,721
Is he hip or what?

71
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,267
Don't you know
he's the king of the world?

72
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:52,147
Whoa, yeah

73
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,565
Ow!

74
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,109
Ha!

75
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,194
Boom, baby!

76
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,739
Aah! Your Highness,
it is time for you to choose your bride.

77
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,241
All righty.

78
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,825
Trot out the ladies.

79
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,994
Let's take a look-see.

80
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,497
Hate your hair. Not likely.

81
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,540
Yikes, yikes, yikes.

82
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,253
And let me guess.
You have a great personality.

83
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,088
Is this really the best you could do?

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,924
Oh, yes. Oh, no. I mean, perhaps...

85
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,926
What is he babbling about?

86
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,262
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up.

87
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,057
Anyway, still wondering
about that llama in the opening?

88
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,644
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.

89
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,773
First, there's Pacha.

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,734
Uh, excuse me.
I'm here to see Emperor Kuzco.

91
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,319
You see, I got this summons...

92
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,156
Inside, up the stairs,
and to the left. Just follow the signs.

93
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,034
Oh, great. Thanks a lot.

94
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,414
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.

95
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,456
Oh!

96
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,792
Uh, pardon me. That's mine.

97
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,918
Oh, here you go.

98
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

99
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,048
Aah! Oh, hey. Are you all right?
Here. Let me...

100
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,009
- Oh, you're so very kind.
- What happened?

101
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,220
Well, I threw off the emperor's groove.

102
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,430
- What?
- His groove!

103
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,182
The rhythm in which he lives his life,
his pattern of behavior.

104
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,309
I threw it off,

105
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,811
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

106
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,814
Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.

107
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,691
Don't throw off his groove!

108
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,775
Oh, okay.

109
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,319
Beware the groove.

110
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,820
Hey, are you gonna be all right?

111
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,488
Groove.

112
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,574
You see what I mean?

113
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,327
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is,

114
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,786
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.

115
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,998
And why
have you come here today?

116
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,543
Well... Your Highness...
I mean, Your Grace.

117
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,338
Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.

118
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,674
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor,

119
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,344
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.

120
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,763
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.

121
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,848
Every decade or so
she gets a new one.

122
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,767
This year's model is called Kronk.

123
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,854
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.

124
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,565
Uh!

125
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,525
Yep, that's Kronk.

126
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,445
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

127
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,073
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

128
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,158
and I'm thinkin' that's got to stop.

129
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,495
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

130
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,704
What was it again?

131
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,955
Um, food.

132
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,210
Ha! You really should have thought
of that before you became peasants.

133
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,713
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

134
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,216
But I... Okay.

135
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,303
Ugh.

136
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,138
The nerve of
some of those peasants, huh?

137
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,724
Tell me about it. Aah!

138
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,809
Hi there.

139
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,394
Ooh, Your Highness.

140
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,478
Ahem.

141
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,397
Oh, oh, oh. Um...

142
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,232
Uh, you were doing it again.

143
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,235
Doing?
Doing... Doing what?

144
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,569
Doing my job.

145
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,489
I'm the emperor,
and you're the emperor's advisor.

146
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,324
- Remember that?
- But, Your Highness,

147
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,993
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

148
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,078
Whoa!

149
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,122
Look at these wrinkles.

150
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,417
What is holding this woman together?

151
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,754
What the...
How long has that been there?

152
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,090
Good thinkin', Yzma.
What do you say, Kuzco?

153
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,716
Whoa! No touchy!

154
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,593
No touchy. No touch.

155
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,304
Uh, excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

156
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,931
Oh, great. Send him in.

157
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,641
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.

158
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,725
Fired?

159
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,311
What do you mean, fired?

160
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,896
Um, how else can I say it?

161
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,566
You're being let go,
your department's being downsized,

162
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,152
you're part of an outplacement,
we're going in a different direction,

163
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,196
we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick. I got more.

164
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,407
But I... You... Uh...

165
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,575
Uhh.

166
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,952
But... But, Your Highness,

167
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,663
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

168
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,875
for many, many years.

169
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,752
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.

170
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,046
You just hit yours 50 years ago.

171
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,800
So, who's in my chair?

172
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,469
Oh, oh! I know! Yzma.

173
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,970
Yzma's in your chair, right?

174
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,764
Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.

175
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,016
Got it!

176
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,642
Oof!

177
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,978
Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up.

178
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,189
I'm okay. I'm fine.

179
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,608
Ah.

180
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,445
Okay. Show him in.

181
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,239
Ahem.

182
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,533
Uh, Afternoon, Your Highness.

183
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,327
I'm here
because I received a summons...

184
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,121
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

185
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,123
Um, Pacha.

186
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Anyway, I got this summons...

187
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,376
Pacha.

188
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,338
That's right.
You are just the man I wanted to see.

189
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,506
I am?

190
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,091
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

191
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,513
You can fix my problem, can't you?

192
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,515
Sure. I'll do what I can.

193
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,100
Good, good.
That's just what I wanted to hear.

194
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,521
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

195
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,857
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

196
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,776
We also herd the llamas that you...

197
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,280
My village?

198
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,490
Oh, yeah.

199
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,158
You got a pretty sweet little setup there

200
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,827
on top of that hill, don't you?

201
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,374
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop
for the last six generations.

202
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,125
Uh-huh.

203
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,129
So tell me, where do you find
you get the most sun?

204
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,509
Oh, I'd say just on the other side
of those trees.

205
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,222
When the sun hits that ridge just right,
these hills sing.

206
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,765
Well, that settles it.

207
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,725
- Really?
- Yep. Problem solved.

208
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,060
Thanks for coming.

209
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,646
That's it? That's all you wanted me for?

210
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,483
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okay'd this spot for my pool.

211
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,486
Uh, your pool?

212
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,197
Boo-yah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia,

213
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,909
my ultimate summer getaway
complete with water slide.

214
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,120
- What?
- Isn't it great?

215
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,497
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!

216
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,249
I'm so happy.

217
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,251
Uh... Uh...

218
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,504
Um... I don't understand
how this could happen.

219
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,131
Well, let me clear it up for you.

220
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,426
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word,

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,386
and your town will be destroyed

222
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,763
to make way for this...

223
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,271
So, if I were you, I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

224
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,314
on the way home.

225
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,774
But, um, where will we live?

226
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,109
Hmmm.

227
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,362
Don't know, don't care. How's that?

228
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,114
Oh, but wait. You can't...

229
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,745
When I give the word,

230
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,956
your little town thingy will be bye-bye.

231
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,791
Bye-bye!

232
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,126
Oh, wait. No...

233
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,086
Boo-hoo.

234
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,797
Oh, yeah.
Everything was goin' my way.

235
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,967
Or so I thought.

236
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,093
He can't get rid of me that easily.

237
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,223
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

238
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,934
Does he... A little to the left.

239
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,813
Have any idea of who he's dealing with?

240
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,983
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

241
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,236
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

242
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,863
Yeah, go figure.

243
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,865
Well, it's better
you're takin' out your anger

244
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,950
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

245
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,245
That's it, Kronk! That's it!

246
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,040
I'll get rid of Kuzco.

247
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,167
The real Kuzco?

248
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,670
Of course the real Kuzco.

249
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,505
Don't you see? It's perfect.

250
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,049
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

251
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,678
I'll take over and rule the empire.

252
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,179
Brilliant!

253
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,890
So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

254
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,685
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

255
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,353
soon to be the two of us.

256
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,938
And I'm one of those two, right?

257
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,022
To the secret lab!

258
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,236
Pull the lever, Kronk.

259
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,696
Wrong lever!

260
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,197
Huh?

261
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,283
Why do we even have that lever?

262
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,453
Get out of my way!

263
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,623
Please remain seated

264
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,834
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times.

265
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,210
Whee!

266
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,795
Faster, faster!

267
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,381
Yzma, put your hands in the air!

268
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,967
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

269
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,849
Ah, how shall I do it?

270
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,517
Oh, I know.

271
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,728
I'll turn him into a flea,

272
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,438
a harmless little flea,

273
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,398
and then I'll put that flea in a box,

274
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,316
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

275
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,277
and then I'll mail that box to myself,

276
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,571
and when it arrives...

277
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,406
I'll smash it with a hammer!

278
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,868
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!

279
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,952
Genius, I say!

280
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,792
Or, to save on postage,

281
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,794
I'll just poison him with this.

282
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,255
Take it, Kronk. Oh, ho, ho.

283
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,007
Feel the power.

284
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,091
Oh...

285
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,176
I can feel it.

286
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,261
Our moment of triumph approaches.

287
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,098
It's dinner time.

288
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,527
So, is everything ready for tonight?

289
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,113
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad

290
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,615
and then see how we feel after that.

291
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,909
Not the dinner...

292
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,243
The you-know...

293
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,496
Oh, right. The poison...

294
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,789
The poison for Kuzco,

295
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,208
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

296
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,542
Kuzco's poison.

297
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,712
- That poison?
- Yes! That poison.

298
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,922
Got you covered.

299
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,131
Excellent.

300
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,468
A few drops in his drink,
then I'll propose a toast,

301
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,637
and he will be dead before dessert.

302
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,139
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

303
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,308
Boom, bam, baby!

304
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,726
Let's get to the grub.

305
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,687
I am one hungry king of the world.

306
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,650
So, no hard feelings about being let go?

307
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,361
None whatsoever.

308
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,532
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

309
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,535
Drink. Right.

310
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,010
Your Highness.

311
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,513
Is something burning?

312
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,265
My spinach puffs!

313
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,938
Ahem.

314
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,817
So, he seems nice.

315
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,527
He is.

316
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,532
He's what, in his late 20s?

317
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,868
I'm not sure.

318
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,536
Saved 'em!

319
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,704
- That's great.
- Great!

320
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,955
- Good job.
- Very good job.

321
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,790
Watch it. They're still hot.

322
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,375
Ahem.

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,710
Ahem!

324
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,339
Kronk. The emperor needs his drink.

325
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,260
Right. Oh, right.

326
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,061
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

327
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,354
Well...

328
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,689
Oh, uh...

329
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,817
Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the...

330
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,902
Mmm.

331
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,238
Oh... Uh... Warm side.

332
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,284
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

333
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,411
Yes, Kronk.

334
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,746
Riveting.

335
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,081
A toast to the emperor!

336
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,876
Long live Kuzco!

337
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,253
Don't drink the wine.

338
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,755
Poison.

339
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,763
Ah! Tasty.

340
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,766
Finally!

341
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,559
Good work, Kronk.

342
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,770
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

343
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,064
Now to get rid of the body.

344
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,275
Okay! What were we saying?

345
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,612
Uh, we were just making a toast

346
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,947
to your long and...

347
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,867
Healthy rule.

348
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,536
Right. So what are you gonna do?

349
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,997
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

350
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,999
and I really mean a long time.

351
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,292
Ahem.

352
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,129
It might be difficult
for someone of your age

353
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,090
adjusting to life in the private sector.

354
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,969
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend? Ha, ha.

355
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,388
Now,
about you finding new work...

356
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,973
Hit him on the head.

357
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,599
That's gonna be tough.

358
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,850
More broccoli?

359
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,602
Because you're... You know.

360
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,980
Let's face it. You're no spring chicken,

361
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,273
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

362
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,819
What? A llama?

363
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,862
He's supposed to be dead!

364
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,656
Yeah, weird.

365
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,993
Let me see that vial.

366
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,622
This isn't poison.

367
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,626
This is extract of llama.
Ugh!

368
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,337
You know, in my defense,
your poisons all look alike.

369
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,631
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

370
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,260
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

371
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,846
What about dinner?

372
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,349
Kronk, this is kind of important.

373
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,518
How about dessert?

374
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,187
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.

375
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,814
And coffee?

376
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,858
All right. A quick cup of coffee.

377
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,986
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

378
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,743
Cha cha cha cha

379
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,202
Guess where I am right now.

380
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,538
Uh-huh. In the bag.

381
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,958
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.

382
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,502
Hey!

383
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,422
Ugh,
he's doing his own theme music?

384
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,100
Big, dumb, and tone deaf.

385
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,853
I am so glad
I was unconscious for all of this.

386
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,400
Mission accomplished.

387
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,331
You're not
just gonna let him die like that, are you?

388
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,041
My shoulder angel.

389
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,709
Don't listen to that guy.

390
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,213
He's trying to lead you
down the path of righteousness.

391
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,091
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

392
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,218
- Oh, come off it.
- You come off it!

393
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,302
- You.
- You.

394
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,637
- You.
- You infinity.

395
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,721
Uhh!

396
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,890
Listen up, big guy.

397
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,559
I got three good reasons why
you should just walk away.

398
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,436
Number one... Look at that guy!

399
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,772
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.

400
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,650
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

401
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,111
Oh, right. That's a harp...

402
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,320
And that's a dress.

403
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,655
Robe!

404
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,281
Reason number 2.

405
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,408
Look what I can do.

406
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,619
But, what does that
have to do with anything?

407
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,788
No, no. He's got a point.

408
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,289
Listen, you guys.

409
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,167
You're sort of confusing me, so begone!

410
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,337
Uh, or, uh, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.

411
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,131
That'll work.

412
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,320
Um,
what's with the chimp and the bug?

413
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,822
Can we get back to me?

414
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,118
Oh, boy. Think, think, think.

415
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,329
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

416
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,087
What am I gonna tell the village?

417
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,674
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. Okay.

418
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,134
What do I do? What do I do?

419
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,468
Aah!

420
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,391
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

421
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,684
Ugh!

422
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,986
Oh, hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me.

423
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,155
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

424
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,948
Comin' through. Hey, you with the cart!

425
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,825
Uh-oh!

426
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,119
This is not good.

427
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,122
Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back
to haunt me.

428
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,593
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

429
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,844
Measure me again!

430
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,806
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.

431
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,558
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him

432
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,602
- to have grown in the last five minutes.
- Mmm! Mmm!

433
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,063
Isn't it?

434
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,107
Look how much you've grown!

435
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,652
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again. Measure me.

436
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,654
Dad's home!

437
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,324
Hey!

438
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,118
Come here.

439
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,664
Dad! I ate a bug today!

440
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,457
Oh! Was Mom baking again?

441
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,001
Heh. Don't tell her I said that.

442
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,460
I heard that.

443
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,254
Okay, everybody, move aside.

444
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,006
Lady with a baby comin' through.

445
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,801
Dad, Dad, Dad! Look at how big I am!

446
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,386
We were all measured today.

447
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,470
Oh.

448
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,888
I'm going through a growth spurt.

449
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,057
I'm as big as you were
when you were me.

450
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,559
Mmm-hmm. Sure are.

451
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,478
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

452
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,732
Okay, okay, you two.

453
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,818
Our deal was that you could stay awake
until Daddy came home.

454
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,695
Now say good night.

455
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,989
Dad, do we have to?

456
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,536
No, you two can stay up.

457
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,455
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

458
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,165
how much we love each other.

459
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,292
Right, honey?

460
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,418
- Ew!
- Blecch!

461
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,753
Good night.

462
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,505
So what did the emperor want?

463
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,590
Ahem.

464
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,884
You know what? He couldn't see me.

465
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,345
- Couldn't see you? Why not?
- I don't know.

466
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,888
Well, that's just rude.

467
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,140
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

468
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,224
No, no, no, no. No.

469
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,977
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

470
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,187
Honey...

471
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,730
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

472
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,273
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

473
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,359
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.

474
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,028
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while,

475
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,281
but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.

476
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,200
That kind of behavior just...

477
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,451
Uhh!

478
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,120
I gotta go wash something.

479
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,013
Pacha? You okay?

480
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,264
Hmm?

481
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,642
Oh, yeah.
I'm just a little tired from the trip.

482
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,102
Um...

483
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,562
I'm gonna go put Misty away.

484
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,910
Hi. Excuse me.

485
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,078
Two seconds here.

486
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,080
Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember?

487
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,791
This story's about me, not him.

488
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,584
Okay. You got it? All right.

489
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,628
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

490
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,765
Huh?

491
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,352
Whoa!

492
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,938
Uh. Oh...

493
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,023
Where'd you come from, little guy?

494
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,817
No touchy.

495
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,777
Aah! Demon llama!

496
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,279
Demon llama? Where?

497
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,363
- Aah!
- Aah!

498
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,368
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

499
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,037
Ow! My head.

500
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,416
Okay, demon llama. Just take it easy.

501
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,294
I mean you no harm.

502
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,004
What are you talking about...

503
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,298
Oh, wait. I know you.

504
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,716
You're that whiny peasant.

505
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,719
Emperor Kuzco?

506
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,762
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

507
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,099
Uh. How did... Um.

508
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,643
You don't...

509
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,270
Look like the emperor.

510
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,938
What do you mean
I don't look like the emperor?

511
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,440
Uh... Oh...

512
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,858
Do this...

513
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,278
What is this, some kind of little game
you country folk like to...

514
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,071
It can't be! Aah!

515
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,949
Aah! Aah!

516
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,161
My face! Aah!
My beautiful, beautiful face!

517
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,330
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

518
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,873
Wait, okay, Your Majesty.

519
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,333
Llama face!

520
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,168
What happened?

521
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,338
I'm tryin' to figure that out, okay?

522
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,969
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

523
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,304
Wait a minute.

524
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,805
I remember you.

525
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,266
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool

526
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,394
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

527
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,479
Oh!

528
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,023
And you turned me into a llama!

529
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,025
What? No, I did not.

530
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,818
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.

531
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,362
Why would I kidnap a llama?

532
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,532
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.

533
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,866
What?

534
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,703
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit.

535
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,456
Okay. I have to get back to the palace.

536
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,751
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

537
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,712
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

538
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,590
Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go.

539
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,722
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

540
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,727
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

541
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,647
You want to run that by me again?

542
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,569
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind

543
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,238
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

544
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,577
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

545
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,705
I don't make deals with peasants!

546
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,041
Then I guess I can't take you back.

547
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,751
Fine. I don't need you.

548
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,461
I can find my own way back.

549
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,754
I wouldn't recommend it.

550
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,048
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

551
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,341
Nice try, pal.

552
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,385
No, really. I'm telling you,
there are jaguars and snakes

553
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,597
- and quicksand.
- I'm not listening.

554
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,391
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

555
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,727
Oh. Heh.

556
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,770
Still not listening.

557
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,439
Ah, you...

558
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,107
Fine. Fine.

559
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,483
Go ahead!

560
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,654
If there's no Kuzco,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

561
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,448
Takes care of my problem.

562
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,497
Hmm.

563
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,298
Scary jungle. Right.

564
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,635
Oh, a leaf. Oh, it might attack me.

565
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,011
Oh! It's a scary tree.

566
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,388
I'm afraid. Ha ha.

567
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,643
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,

568
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,479
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

569
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,815
Okay, where am I?

570
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,153
What...

571
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,322
Help me! Help me!

572
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,990
Help me! Ohh!

573
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,159
Uhh.

574
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,869
Too late.

575
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,331
Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

576
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,671
Aah!

577
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,257
What do you want?

578
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,094
Oh, for me?

579
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,970
Why, I don't know what to say.

580
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,682
Ow!

581
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,016
Hit the road, Bucky.

582
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,021
Aah! Ow!

583
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,606
Huh?

584
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,899
Huh?

585
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,027
Huh?

586
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,238
Uh-oh.

587
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,374
No, no. No, no, no, no.

588
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,417
No, no. No, don't.

589
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,382
Ha!

590
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,888
No!

591
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,734
Aah!

592
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,993
You killer jaguars...

593
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,036
Whoa!

594
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,471
Aah!

595
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,272
Don't worry, Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.

596
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,528
Maybe I'm just new
to this whole rescuing thing,

597
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,113
but this, to me,

598
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,240
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

599
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,493
- wouldn't you say?
- No, no, no. It's okay.

600
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,827
This is all right.

601
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,454
We can figure this out.

602
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,540
I hate you.

603
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,628
No!

604
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,214
Aah! Ow!

605
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,264
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

606
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,642
Aah! Ow!

607
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,352
Ow!

608
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,103
Uhh!

609
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,487
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

610
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,738
Uh-oh.

611
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,991
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.

612
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,827
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

613
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,453
Most likely.

614
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,538
Bring it on.

615
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,498
Boo-yah!

616
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,458
Whoo!

617
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,363
Your Highness.

618
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,115
Your Highness, can you hear me?

619
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,201
Oh, boy. Come on, breathe.

620
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,954
Breathe!

621
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,707
Ohh. Why me?

622
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,090
Ugh!

623
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,466
All right.

624
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,721
- Ohh!
- Aah!

625
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,559
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

626
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,149
For the last time, it was not a kiss.

627
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,401
Well, whatever you call it...

628
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,362
It was disgusting.

629
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,115
And if you would've done what
I ordered you to do in the first place,

630
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,327
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

631
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,621
Aw!

632
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,374
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

633
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,959
I'll have Yzma change me back,

634
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,046
and then I'll start construction
on Kuzcotopia.

635
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,213
Oh, yeah.

636
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,759
Okay, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

637
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,552
Mmm-hmm.

638
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,846
I just think if you really thought about it,

639
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,432
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

640
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,975
And why would I do that?

641
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,020
Because...

642
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,563
Deep down, I think you'll realize

643
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,233
that you're forcing an entire village
out of their homes just for you.

644
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,319
And that's...

645
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,987
Bad?

646
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,447
Well, yeah.

647
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,909
Nobody's that heartless.

648
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,952
Mmm.

649
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,454
Now take me back.

650
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,082
What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

651
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,084
All you care about
is building your summer home

652
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,710
and filling it with stuff for you.

653
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,712
Uh, yeah. Doy. Me.

654
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,714
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

655
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,133
You're the only one that doesn't
seem to be with the program,

656
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,802
eh, Pacha?

657
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,972
You know what? Someday,
you're going to wind up all alone,

658
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,265
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

659
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,601
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.

660
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,438
Now, for the final time, I order you
to take me back to the palace.

661
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,316
Looks to me like you're stuck out here,

662
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,111
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

663
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,740
Because unless
you change your mind,

664
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,075
I'm not taking you back.

665
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,952
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

666
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,999
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

667
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,792
Somebody's throwing stuff.

668
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,752
You going to build a fire or what?
What's going on?

669
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,172
He's never going to change his mind.

670
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,677
How am I ever going to get out of here?

671
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,707
And so, it is with great sadness

672
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,463
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

673
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,841
Taken from us so tragically

674
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,844
on the very eve of his 18th birthday.

675
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,179
Poor little guy.

676
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,473
His legacy will live on in our hearts...

677
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,766
He never had a chance.

678
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,809
For all eternity.

679
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,522
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

680
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,024
Back to work.

681
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,705
Kronk, darlin',

682
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,085
I must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons,

683
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,547
but now that Kuzco is dead,
all is forgiven.

684
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,299
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's...

685
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,510
He's dead, all right.

686
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,639
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he... than he is right now.

687
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,432
Unless, of course, we killed him again.

688
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,560
I suppose.

689
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,938
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.

690
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,774
Kronk...

691
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,442
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

692
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,568
Kronk...

693
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,654
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.

694
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,616
- Ahh!
- Kuzco is dead, right?

695
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,118
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

696
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,496
I need to hear these words.

697
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,915
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

698
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,959
He's still alive?

699
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,294
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

700
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,963
Kronk...

701
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,383
I just thought I'd give you the heads-up
in case Kuzco ever came back.

702
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,135
He can't come back!

703
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,305
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward,
especially after that lovely eulogy.

704
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,849
You think?

705
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,853
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!

706
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,646
Now let's move!

707
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,772
Dad, look out!

708
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,817
Tipo, what is it?

709
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,986
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log

710
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,865
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death!

711
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,408
All right, all right, it's okay.

712
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,202
- It was awful!
- It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down.

713
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,829
It was just a dream.

714
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,498
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.

715
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,501
Oh.

716
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,296
Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

717
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,463
That's right.

718
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,424
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

719
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,467
Yeah, like that would ever happen.

720
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,178
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.

721
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,470
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

722
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,930
Yeah-huh.

723
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,392
Good night, you two.

724
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,476
Night, Mom!

725
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,239
Brr!

726
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,949
Uh, hey.

727
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,080
Thanks.

728
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,207
Oh.

729
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,834
No problem.

730
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,795
Feels like wool.

731
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah.

732
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,506
Alpaca?

733
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,966
Oh, yeah, it is.

734
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,384
Oh, yeah, I thought so.

735
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,054
It's nice.

736
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,680
My wife made it.

737
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,932
Oh, she knits?

738
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,683
Crochets.

739
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,977
Crochets? Nice.

740
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,270
Thanks.

741
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,195
So...

742
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,491
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

743
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,825
we'd...

744
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,746
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know...

745
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,081
I might...

746
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,042
Are you saying...

747
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,669
You've changed your mind?

748
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,420
Oh, well, I...

749
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,925
Because you know that means you're
doing something nice for someone else.

750
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,760
No, I know that. I know.

751
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,929
And you're all right with that?

752
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,264
Yes.

753
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,604
What?

754
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,734
Don't shake unless you mean it.

755
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,868
All right.

756
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,206
Let's get you back to the palace.

757
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,083
Oh, by the way, thanks.

758
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,711
No...

759
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,462
Thank you.

760
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,810
Okay.
Once we cross this bridge,

761
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,312
it's only an hour to the palace.

762
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,689
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.

763
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,815
I believe it.

764
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,150
- What was that?
- Nothing.

765
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,651
Ohh!

766
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,486
Whoa!

767
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,654
Kuzco!

768
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,824
Kuzco!

769
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,492
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

770
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,163
No. I don't think I will.

771
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,497
You're going to leave me here?

772
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,833
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

773
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,543
but I kind of like this better.

774
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,253
I thought you were a changed man.

775
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,757
Oh, come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

776
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,592
So all of it was a lie?

777
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,761
Well, yeah. No, wait.

778
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,931
Uh, yeah, yeah. It all was a lie.

779
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,224
Toodles.

780
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,560
We shook hands on it!

781
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,983
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

782
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,651
You need hands.

783
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,529
Ha. Okay. Buh-bye.

784
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,614
Ah!

785
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,283
Are you okay? Are you all right?

786
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,410
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right.

787
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,120
Good!

788
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,164
That's for going back on your promise!

789
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,794
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me
and taking me to your village...

790
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,713
Which I'm still gonna destroy,
by the way.

791
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,881
No touchy.

792
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,965
Ohh!

793
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,760
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

794
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,637
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

795
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,222
but, oh, you proved me wrong.

796
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh, boo-hoo.
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

797
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,477
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

798
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,396
and then all my problems
would be over.

799
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,564
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.

800
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,066
Let's end this.

801
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,192
Ladies first.

802
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,402
Aah!

803
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,204
Ohh!

804
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,671
Ow! Ow!

805
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,631
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

806
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,970
What are we gonna do?

807
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,513
Aah!

808
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,807
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

809
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,102
We're gonna die! That's it for me!

810
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,771
No, we're not. Calm down.

811
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,024
I have an idea. Give me your arm.

812
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,527
Okay, now the other one.

813
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,698
When I say go, push against my back,

814
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,826
and we'll walk up the hill. Ready?

815
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,952
Go.

816
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,621
Ow! You did that on purpose.

817
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,541
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!

818
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,961
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

819
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,212
Ready?

820
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,464
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

821
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,048
Your right or mine?

822
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,383
I don't care. Mine.

823
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,551
Well, why yours?

824
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,802
Okay, your right! Ready?

825
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,472
- Okay, got it.
- Okay, right.

826
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,182
Left. Right.

827
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,101
Look, we're moving!

828
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,644
Aah!

829
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,689
Don't look down! Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.

830
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,441
Right. Left.

831
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,151
Right. Left.

832
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,153
Right. Left.

833
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,905
Right!

834
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,991
Now what, genius?

835
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,993
Working on it.

836
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,162
Okay, here's the deal.

837
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,373
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

838
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,210
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

839
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,338
You're just gonna have to trust me!

840
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,177
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy,

841
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,513
or this would be really difficult.

842
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,766
Almost.

843
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,267
Got it!

844
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,394
It's stuck.

845
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,480
Take your time. No hurry here.

846
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,359
Scorpions!

847
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,527
Kuzco!

848
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,653
Aah!

849
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,112
Oh, no!

850
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,703
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

851
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,165
Huh?

852
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,838
Whoa!

853
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,891
Huh?

854
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,686
Look out!

855
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,105
Ohh.

856
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,734
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Ooh, look at me and my bad self.

857
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,696
I snatched you right out of the air.

858
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,116
"Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me."

859
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,993
Well, not today, pal. Uh-huh.

860
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,828
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

861
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,998
You just saved my life.

862
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,374
Huh?

863
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,585
So?

864
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,919
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

865
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,421
That there is some good in you after all.

866
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,589
- Oh, no.
- Admit it.

867
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,673
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

868
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,049
- Nuh-huh.
- I think there is.

869
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,759
- Nuh-huh.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.

870
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,762
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.

871
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,059
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

872
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,687
Right. Sure.

873
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,772
Well, we better get going.

874
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,192
With that bridge out,
it's a four-day walk to the palace.

875
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,695
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?

876
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,238
I shook on it, didn't I?

877
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,908
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize
that doesn't change a thing.

878
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,786
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

879
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,538
Well, four days is a long time.

880
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,457
Who knows?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

881
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,625
Uh-huh.

882
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,001
Four days.

883
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,919
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

884
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,421
Not good.

885
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,966
No, no, no!

886
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,261
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace

887
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,305
and still no sign of Kuzco.

888
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,557
Where is he?

889
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,725
Kronk!

890
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,809
Kronk here.

891
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,895
I'm getting tired. Pull over.

892
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,313
Sure thing. Kronk out.

893
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,486
Ooh! Aah!

894
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,987
Aah! Ohh!

895
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,201
Perfect.

896
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,079
These are my best shoes.

897
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,500
I hate this jungle.

898
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,378
Oh, look.

899
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,505
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

900
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,299
- Just one more for exotic bird bingo.
- Ahh!

901
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,301
- I am loving this.
- Ahh!

902
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,520
Get away from me!

903
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,066
Yeah. Tell me about it.

904
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,486
No, no, it's not you.

905
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,780
She's not the easiest person
to get close to.

906
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,865
There's a wall there. Trust me.

907
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,535
Are you talking to that squirrel?

908
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,495
I was a Junior Chipmunk.

909
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,206
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

910
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,457
Please continue.

911
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,839
Aah! Why me? Why me?

912
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,383
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

913
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,260
This poor little guy has had it rough.

914
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,304
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

915
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,723
Oh.

916
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,642
A talking llama? Do tell.

917
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,189
Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you.

918
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,400
Well, then you ask him.

919
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,652
I hate being in the middle.

920
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,070
Squeaky,

921
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,822
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

922
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,910
Jaguars? No kidding? Brutal.

923
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,754
Uh, could you give us a little room here?

924
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,088
Oh, sorry.

925
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,759
A little bit more, please.

926
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,012
How is this?

927
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,263
Yeah, that's good.

928
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:11,058
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

929
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,311
Squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

930
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,283
Low blood sugar, huh?

931
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,993
Yeah. It's a curse.

932
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,578
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

933
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,288
you're walking the rest of the way.

934
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,428
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,
home of the mug...

935
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,934
- Of meat. What'll it be?
- Ahem.

936
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,854
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

937
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,106
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

938
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,151
We're on our honeymoon.

939
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,654
Bless you for coming out in public.

940
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,490
So that's two specials.

941
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,034
And an onion log. To split.

942
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,333
Ordering! I need two heartburns
and a deep-fried doorstop on table 12!

943
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,338
Okay,
so I'll admit this was a good idea.

944
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,341
When will you learn
that all my ideas are good ones?

945
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,467
That's funny,

946
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,845
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

947
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,513
being chased by jaguars,

948
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,515
lying to me
to take you back to the palace

949
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,850
were all really bad ideas.

950
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,936
Oh, yeah, anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

951
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,274
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

952
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,150
Mazel tov.

953
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,322
Oh, boy.

954
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,992
Ooh. Ugh.

955
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,374
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you.

956
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,879
Where are you going?

957
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,298
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

958
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,883
You're gonna get us thrown out.

959
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:10,511
Please. With this disguise, I'm invisible.

960
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,642
Heh.

961
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,313
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

962
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,191
That is the last time
we take directions from a squirrel.

963
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,904
I should have done away with Kuzco
myself when I had the chance.

964
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,909
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

965
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,039
Uh-oh.
I'll get you another one there, Yzma.

966
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,583
You using that fork there, pal?

967
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,376
Hey, don't I know you?

968
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,586
I don't think so.

969
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,922
- Wrestled you in high school?
- Don't remember that.

970
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,340
Metal shop? I got it!

971
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,675
Miss Narca's interpretive dance,
two semesters.

972
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,802
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

973
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,055
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

974
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,016
I don't think we've ever met,
but I gotta go.

975
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,351
Don't worry. I'll think of it.

976
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,770
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.

977
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,772
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

978
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,065
Psst. Hey!

979
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,900
So I'm just checking to make sure

980
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,818
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

981
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,572
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

982
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,074
Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.

983
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,283
It's a simple question.

984
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,036
Is there or is there not anything edible

985
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,329
- on this menu?
- Gah!

986
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,792
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!

987
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,920
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

988
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,838
All right, buster, that's it!

989
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,424
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

990
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,509
Yeah, but I...

991
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,304
I try and I try, but there's no respect
for anyone with vision. That's it!

992
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,973
There's just nothing I can do about it!

993
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,391
Please don't go.

994
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,726
Three pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

995
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,771
two chili cheese samplers,
a basket of liver and onion rings,

996
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,816
a catch of the day,
and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.

997
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,026
You got all that, honey?

998
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,861
Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

999
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,656
basket of grandma's breakfast,
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

1000
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,824
What's going on?

1001
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,826
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

1002
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,412
What is he doing in there?

1003
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,624
Ugh.

1004
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,876
- Come on!
- In a minute. I'm still hungry.

1005
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,044
No, Kuzco!

1006
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,629
Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

1007
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,631
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

1008
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,466
- You got it?
- Can do.

1009
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,969
What's taking so long?

1010
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,304
- Pickup!
- Kronk! What are you doing?

1011
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,682
- Kinda busy here.
- Why am I not surprised?

1012
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,975
Your order's up!

1013
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,268
Ohh!

1014
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,228
Oh, well, while you're at it,

1015
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,689
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

1016
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,024
Check. Pickup!

1017
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,526
You know what? On second thought,
make my omelet a meat pie.

1018
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,694
Meat pie. Check.

1019
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,820
Kronk!

1020
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,906
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?

1021
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,867
- I'll have to charge you full price.
- Ooh!

1022
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,869
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

1023
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,662
You got it.
Want cheese on those potatoes?

1024
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,372
Thank you, Kronk. Cheddar will be fine.

1025
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,207
- Cheddar spuds coming up.
- Spuds yes, cheese no.

1026
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,251
- Hold the cheese.
- No, I want the cheese.

1027
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,461
Cheese me no like.

1028
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,628
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

1029
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,796
Come on, make up your mind!

1030
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
Okay, okay, on second thought...

1031
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,591
Make my potatoes a salad.

1032
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,859
Excuse me.
You see that woman over there?

1033
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,238
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

1034
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,745
One, two, three, four...

1035
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,081
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you

1036
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,750
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too

1037
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,211
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true

1038
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,670
Ho-ho-ho.

1039
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,422
It's your birthday?

1040
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,093
What are you doing?

1041
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,886
Look, there's two people
in there looking for you.

1042
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,888
- What?
- A big guy and a skinny old woman.

1043
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,099
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

1044
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,185
- Oh, yeah.
- That's Yzma and Kronk! I'm saved!

1045
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,020
Trust me, they're not here to save you.

1046
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,605
They'll take me back to the palace.

1047
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,315
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

1048
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,441
I can take it from here.

1049
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,194
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

1050
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,904
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

1051
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,116
- No. I can't let you!
- What? Wha...

1052
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,118
Oh, oh, I get it!

1053
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,537
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

1054
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,956
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

1055
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,165
No!

1056
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,708
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

1057
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,127
Will you just listen to me...

1058
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,588
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!

1059
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,714
What?

1060
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,967
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

1061
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,051
- Go!
- But...

1062
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,220
Go on! Get outta here!

1063
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,389
Fine! Hmph!

1064
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,351
- Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
- What'd I do?

1065
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,313
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!

1066
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:36,110
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

1067
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,320
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go.

1068
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,322
Not even on your birthday.

1069
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,575
Kuzco must be eliminated.

1070
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,786
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug.

1071
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,329
You got a point.

1072
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,665
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

1073
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,920
Pacha!

1074
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,509
Pacha?

1075
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,216
So this is where you came in.

1076
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,219
See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.

1077
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,221
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

1078
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,388
and took everything I had.

1079
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,015
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?

1080
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,392
What? I'm just telling them
what happened.

1081
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,894
Who you kidding, pal?

1082
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,271
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

1083
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,106
Well, yeah, but...

1084
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,900
Just leave me alone.

1085
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,264
The peasant at the diner!

1086
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,934
He didn't pay his check.

1087
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,614
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

1088
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,993
who disappeared into the crowd
with Kuzco on the back of his cart.

1089
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,494
He must have taken him
back to his village,

1090
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:54,623
so if we find the village, we find him,
and if we find him, we find Kuzco.

1091
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,668
Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.

1092
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,879
- Yzma!
- What?

1093
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,131
Aah!

1094
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,300
This had better be good!

1095
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,489
Yuck!

1096
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,242
So,
there we were standing on the cliff,

1097
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,495
and the ground started to rumble.

1098
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:18,582
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

1099
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,709
Do you believe that?

1100
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,754
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here,

1101
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,716
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

1102
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,011
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

1103
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,180
He's a lousy llama.

1104
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,809
I mean, a really lousy llama.

1105
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,323
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know,

1106
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,411
what I said to you back at the diner,
that, I didn't really...

1107
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,790
So, you tired of being a llama?

1108
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,293
Yes!

1109
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,339
Okay, we're just gonna stop
at the house and get some supplies.

1110
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,383
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1111
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,094
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1112
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,303
My relatives?

1113
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,264
We just sent them up to your house.

1114
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,432
What did they look like?

1115
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,227
See, there was this big guy
and this older woman who was...

1116
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,062
How would you describe her?

1117
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,564
Scary beyond all reason.

1118
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,023
Yeah, that's it.

1119
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,318
So, remind me again
how you're related to Pacha?

1120
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,614
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great-aunt.

1121
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,868
Twice removed.

1122
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,120
Uh-huh.

1123
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,955
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1124
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,624
Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

1125
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,502
One fell off and bumped his head

1126
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,755
You know, I am so sorry
that you had to come all this way,

1127
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,300
but as I said to you before,

1128
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,886
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

1129
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,721
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.

1130
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,766
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1131
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,310
Oops!

1132
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,436
Silly me.

1133
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,771
No, no. Allow me.

1134
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,569
She's hiding something.

1135
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,488
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1136
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,656
Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go.

1137
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,158
Grr!

1138
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,994
So, while we're waiting for Paca...

1139
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,289
- Pacha.
- Oh, yes. Um...

1140
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,833
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1141
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,253
You know, why don't you just come
back when Pacha gets home?

1142
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,381
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...

1143
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,717
Excuse me, won't you?

1144
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,677
I think I left something in the oven.

1145
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,307
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

1146
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,100
- Kronk, it's time!
- Okay!

1147
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,102
Grr!

1148
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,731
So, we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab, and change him back.

1149
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,274
- Hi there!
- Aah!

1150
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,860
- Um, that was him.
- Whoops.

1151
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:54,988
You know what?

1152
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,491
I don't believe
you're really my great-aunt.

1153
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,826
You're more like my great-great-great...

1154
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,621
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

1155
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,039
Thanks, honey.

1156
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,000
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

1157
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,045
- Great-great-great...
- Grr.

1158
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,881
All right! Are you through?

1159
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,883
- Great-great-aunt.
- So, where were we?

1160
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,510
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until...

1161
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,554
I show you the house. Of course.

1162
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,890
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1163
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,351
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1164
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,438
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

1165
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,232
There is no handle in here.

1166
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,568
There's not? Are you sure?

1167
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,570
All right, I've had enough of this.

1168
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,031
Tell us where the talking llama is and
we'll burn your house to the ground.

1169
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,742
Uh, don't you mean "or"?

1170
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,496
Tell us where the talking llama is
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

1171
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,581
Well, which is it?

1172
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,499
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1173
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,794
That's it! Kronk, break the door down!

1174
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,922
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

1175
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,091
I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way.

1176
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,176
I'll break it down myself.

1177
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,887
- A-one...
- Okay, kids, you know what to do.

1178
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,889
- Two...
- Right, Mom!

1179
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,474
Three!

1180
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,393
Aah!

1181
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:20,907
Okay, children, on your mark,
get set, go!

1182
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:24,453
Ow, ow!
Stop it, you little brats!

1183
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,787
Huh?

1184
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,205
Ow!

1185
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,168
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1186
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,713
Well, I had a great time.

1187
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,008
Let's not wait until the next
family reunion to get together.

1188
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,217
Kronk!

1189
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,428
I gotta run.

1190
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,457
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

1191
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,253
Please remain seated

1192
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,255
and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.

1193
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,215
Aah!

1194
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,635
Huh?

1195
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,266
- What does it look like?
- I don't know. Just keep looking.

1196
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,559
Over here!

1197
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,563
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1198
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,732
Oh, my.

1199
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,650
Looking for this?

1200
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,654
No! It can't be!

1201
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,614
- How did you get back here before us?
- Uh...

1202
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,909
How did we, Kronk?

1203
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,204
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.

1204
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,498
Oh, well, back to business.

1205
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,292
Okay, I admit it.

1206
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,043
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1207
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,921
but, Yzma,
do you really want to kill me?

1208
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,258
Just think of it as you're being let go,

1209
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,594
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1210
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:49,306
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1211
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,601
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

1212
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:57,564
I know. It's called a cruel irony
like my dependence on you.

1213
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,274
I can't believe this is happening!

1214
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,443
Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

1215
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,903
- No!
- Aah!

1216
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,446
Ah-ha!

1217
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,031
Oh, okay.

1218
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,908
Finish them off.

1219
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,330
Hey, you're not
backing down now, are you, big guy?

1220
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,124
Uh, where's the other guy?

1221
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,252
Yo!

1222
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,213
Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss?

1223
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,964
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife

1224
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,300
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1225
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,094
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1226
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,346
and quite honestly...

1227
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,390
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1228
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,934
This one simple thing.

1229
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,435
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

1230
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,603
Whoa! Now.

1231
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,564
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1232
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,649
Ouch.

1233
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,900
And do you want to know
something else?

1234
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,985
I've never liked your spinach puffs.

1235
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,446
Never!

1236
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,367
That's it. She's going down.

1237
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,952
Now, now, remember, guys.

1238
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,205
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1239
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,709
That'll work.

1240
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,802
Strange. That usually works.

1241
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,262
And so does this!

1242
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,013
Ah, should have seen that coming.

1243
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,557
Whoa!

1244
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,851
Aah!

1245
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,727
Give me that vial!

1246
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,356
- Oof!
- Ah! Ha ha!

1247
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,780
Oops! Clumsy me.

1248
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,242
Which one? Which one?

1249
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,831
Better hurry. I'm expecting company.

1250
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,879
Kill them! They murdered the emperor!

1251
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,841
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... Kuzco!

1252
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,217
They're not listening to me!

1253
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,219
Just take 'em all!

1254
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,103
Get them!

1255
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,315
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?

1256
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,859
You're excused. Anyone else?

1257
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,360
No, we're good.

1258
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,737
Get them!

1259
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,489
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1260
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,785
Uh, Pacha? A little help!

1261
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,873
Come on! Come on!

1262
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,834
Aah!

1263
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,716
Oh, please be something with wings.

1264
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,055
Yeah! We're flyin'!

1265
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
Uh-oh.

1266
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,772
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

1267
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,649
- I'm picking the next one!
- Fine by me!

1268
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,858
Give me that one!

1269
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,612
Don't you say a word.

1270
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,494
Quick! Drain the canals!

1271
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,288
Open up!

1272
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,086
Yay! I'm a llama again!

1273
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,295
Wait...

1274
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,973
There they go! After them!

1275
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,476
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

1276
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,857
Grr!

1277
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,163
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

1278
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,667
- Aah!
- Ah!

1279
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,378
No!

1280
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,932
I'll take that.

1281
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,476
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

1282
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,646
Ow! Hey, get her off!

1283
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,733
- Get her off me!
- Ohh!

1284
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,237
Aah! Ow!

1285
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,784
Drink the potion!

1286
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,411
Okay, okay.

1287
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,038
Where did it go? Where is it?

1288
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,582
Looking for this?

1289
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,127
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?

1290
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,087
Oh, well.

1291
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,547
No! Don't drop it!

1292
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,008
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!

1293
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,052
I'm going to drink it!

1294
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,888
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

1295
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,557
I'm going to kill you!

1296
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,317
Aah!

1297
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,693
Aah! Uh-oh!

1298
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,543
Whoa!

1299
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,047
Ohh!

1300
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,008
Kuzco!

1301
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,551
Be right there! Give me a minute!

1302
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,472
Kuzco! Whoa!

1303
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,392
Kuzco!

1304
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,442
The vial!

1305
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,371
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

1306
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,916
You know, pal, you could have told me
that before I set it up.

1307
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,293
Aah!

1308
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,132
Huh?

1309
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,724
The vial!

1310
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,893
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

1311
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,414
- I win.
- Whoa!

1312
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,751
Got it!

1313
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,754
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

1314
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,890
Here, let me get this for you.

1315
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,437
Well, see ya on the other side.

1316
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,950
Now, you stop being so hard
on yourself. All is forgiven.

1317
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,035
You're sure?

1318
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,829
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

1319
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,539
and it won't be the last.

1320
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,499
What can I say? I'm a rebel.

1321
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,876
Whoa-ho-ho! Tiger.

1322
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,128
Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later.

1323
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,922
Okay, buddy, take care.

1324
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,758
He's a sweet guy.

1325
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,728
So, you lied to me.

1326
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,440
- I did?
- Yeah.

1327
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:41,069
You said when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

1328
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,321
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

1329
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,448
and I did not hear any singing.

1330
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,036
So...

1331
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,916
I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill. Thank you.

1332
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,380
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

1333
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,423
No, no, I'm sharp, I'm on it.

1334
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,633
Looks like you and your family

1335
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:06,010
are stuck on that tuneless
hilltop forever, pal.

1336
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:19,023
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

1337
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,526
In case you're interested.

1338
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,489
Ha!

1339
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,991
Boom, baby!

1340
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,784
Ha! Boom, baby!

1341
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,582
You'd be the coolest dude in the nation

1342
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,710
Or the hippest cat in creation

1343
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,130
But if you ain't got friends
then nothing's worth the fuss

1344
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,758
A perfect world will come to be

1345
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,844
When everybody here can see

1346
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,221
That a perfect world begins and ends

1347
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,515
A perfect world begins and ends

1348
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,351
A perfect world begins
and ends with us

1349
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,604
"My acorn is missing."

1350
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,565
Squeak squeakin'
squeak squeakity.

1351
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,191
"Did you eat the acorn?"

1352
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,319
Squeaker
squeak squeak squeakin'?

1353
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,237
"You owe me a new acorn."

1354
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,531
Squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeaker...

1355
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,784
Squeakin'.

1356
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,286
I'm so proud of you guys.

1357
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:21,127
In the quiet time of evening

1358
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:27,800
When the stars assume their patterns

1359
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:33,139
And the day has made his journey

1360
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,562
And we wondered just what happened

1361
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,358
To the life we knew

1362
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,235
Before the world changed

1363
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:49,155
When not a thing I had

1364
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,949
Was true

1365
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,746
But you were kind to me

1366
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,791
And you reminded me

1367
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:04,712
That the world is not my playground

1368
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:10,760
There are other things that matter

1369
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:16,391
And what is simple needs protecting

1370
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:23,231
Or my illusions all would shatter

1371
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,608
But you stayed

1372
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:29,570
In my corner

1373
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:34,325
The only world I know was upside-down

1374
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,956
And now the world and me

1375
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,750
We know you carry me

1376
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:48,214
You see the patterns in the big sky

1377
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:53,928
Those constellations look like you and I

1378
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:59,725
Just like the patterns in the big sky

1379
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:05,273
We could be lost, we could refuse to try

1380
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,109
But we made it through

1381
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,487
In the dark night

1382
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:17,076
Who would those lucky guys
turn out to be

1383
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,497
But that unusual blend

1384
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,043
Of my funny friend and me

1385
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,677
I'm not as clever as I thought I was

1386
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:41,851
I'm not the boy I used to be because

1387
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,604
You show me somethin' different

1388
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:47,607
You show me somethin' pure

1389
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,945
I always seemed so certain
But I was really never sure

1390
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,282
But you stayed

1391
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,327
And you called my name

1392
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:04,582
When others would have
walked out on a lousy game

1393
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,587
And look who made it through

1394
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,465
But your funny friend and me

1395
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,969
You see the patterns in the big sky

1396
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,095
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1397
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,808
Those constellations look like you and I

1398
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:28,689
That tiny planet and the bigger guy

1399
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:34,362
I don't know whether
I should laugh or cry

1400
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:39,742
Just like
the patterns in the big sky

1401
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,619
We'll be together

1402
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,872
We'll be together till the end this time

1403
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,250
You don't know, you don't know

1404
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:51,420
Don't know the answer
or the reason why

1405
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,964
We'll stick together

1406
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:57,218
We'll stick together till the day we die

1407
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,807
If I had to do this all a second time

1408
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,980
I won't complain or make a fuss

1409
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,401
Who would the angels send

1410
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,529
But that unlikely blend

1411
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,615
