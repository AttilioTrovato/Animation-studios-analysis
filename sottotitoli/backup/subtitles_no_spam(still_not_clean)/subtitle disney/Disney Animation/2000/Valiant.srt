1
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,661
I think I saw something!

2
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,022
Steady lads! We're almost home. 

3
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:44,183
Just a few flaps more and we'll 
be over the white cliffs of Dover!

4
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,024
Falcon!

5
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,344
- 5 o'clock and coming in hot!
- Then lift it 30!

6
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:59,787
Stay with me, private! Private!

7
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:17,110
Wing commander Gutsy.
This just in from a sea gull near Dover!

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,110
- None of them made it back alive.
- None of them?

9
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,872
- But those were some of our top fliers.
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a messenger pigeon.

10
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:33,394
If we don't find some more birds fast,
our goose is going to be cooked.

11
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,482
VALIANT

12
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,924
BIRDS ON THE MARCH

13
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,445
Across the nation and the globe

14
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,245
pigeons are taking wing
in the fight for freedom.

15
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:25,646
Delivering top secret messages
from behind enemy lines,

16
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:30,007
these fine feathered aviators are
the pride of the allied forces.

17
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:35,048
It's the Royal Homing Pigeon
Service that leads the way.

18
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:39,530
Whether cutting through enemy
lines or just cutting wise.

19
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,529
These proud pigeons are
the model of birdhood.

20
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,570
But don't count out the doves.

21
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,571
War bond birds play a vital role
in raising seeds for the troops.

22
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:51,772
Wait a minute! Ahoy mates!

23
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:57,133
Nursing doves at two o'clock.
Now that's what I call a task force.

24
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,653
Laundry bird bath. Why not?

25
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,134
These hearty heroes need to look their best.

26
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:06,215
Of course not just any pigeon
can make the cut.

27
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,575
But there's always room for 
a few brave recruits.

28
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:13,577
And there they go. Off to
another exciting mission.

29
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,218
Homing pigeons, we salute you!

30
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,419
This is the shot boys, watch this.

31
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,299
Two in the corner, eight...

32
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,981
- Valiant, do you mind?
- Oh sorry. Felix!

33
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:32,221
Felix, I could do it!
I could do that, Felix!

34
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,741
- Do what, lad?
- I could be one of those brave recruits.

35
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:39,143
Taking wing in the fight for freedom,
I know I could! I know it!

36
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:43,423
Valiant! What, did I ever tell you?
When I was your age,

37
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,064
I was already on the shores of France.

38
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:49,065
Aquatic brigade.
Gull division.

39
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:53,026
If it weren't for me wooden drumstick
and that shrap of a limb poopdeck,

40
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,107
- I'd be out there right now.
- Maybe you're right.

41
00:03:56,227 --> 00:04:00,227
I'm just what they're looking for,
a pigeon with that something extra.

42
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:05,509
You know it's not a bloke's wing span
that counts, it's the size of his spirit!

43
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,430
Hey everybody! Look outside!

44
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,830
Look at that move!

45
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:26,193
Royal Homing Pigeon Service! Magnificent!

46
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,076
Commander Gutsy!
The most decorated pigeon ever!

47
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,477
- Thank you very much! Yes! Much obliged. 
- Come and have a drink with me now!

48
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:47,358
- What would it be, boys?
- Bug juice, shaken, not stirred.

49
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,999
The RHPS always drinks on the House!

50
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,881
- Bug juice. Shaken. Not stirred.
- Merci beaucoup ma chérie.

51
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,281
He spoke French!

52
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:09,043
- So, what's the news from the front?
- Can't say of course. Classified.

53
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:15,165
But danger is our business. And I'm
sorry to say, business is all too good.

54
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,966
Let me through! Got to get
to wing commander now!

55
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,806
- Excuse me, Wing Commander!
- Yes?

56
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:26,527
- Sir, where do I sign up?
- Aren't you a bit on the wee side?

57
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,288
Talking about a small wingspan pip-squeak.

58
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,490
There's always a place
for a few valiant birds.

59
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,330
Sign up is tomorrow in London.

60
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,931
Love to stay and chat, but
duty calls and we must answer.

61
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,612
Beaks up, boys!
Let's make wing.

62
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:53,413
Hip hip hurray!

63
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,780
Herr General!

64
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,261
Welcome back, General Von Talon.

65
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,702
-Congratulations, sir. Another triumph!
-Ya woll mein General!

66
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,463
Under the Geneva Convention as an officer

67
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,224
I have the right to be treated as a pigeon of war.

68
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:42,225
Have no fear, you vill be.

69
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,025
Take him to the cage!

70
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,586
Get your talons off me! Filthy vultures!

71
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:59,348
Pigeons, pathetic little creatures.

72
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,670
You don't eat your prisoners at war, do you?

73
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,790
Eat you!

74
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:10,351
I'm a vegetarian.

75
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,111
And yet you wear a leather cape?

76
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:21,273
- Who is your contact in the resistance?
- You know they'll send a crack team to rescue me?

77
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,875
Rescue you?
You're a pigeon!

78
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:30,076
- How important do you think you are?
- VIP. Very Important Pigeon!

79
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:37,837
Very Impudent Pigeon!
Who is your contact in the Resistance?

80
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:39,877
-Oh no.
-Speak!

81
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:43,639
This canary will never sing.

82
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:49,960
- Listen to your mother, you can't go!
- Mum, there's a war going on and I want to do my bit!

83
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,521
- Buy why! Why! Why!
- Oh, mum! Good bye.

84
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,242
Those falcons are going to tear you apart!

85
00:07:57,362 --> 00:08:00,603
- oh Mum!
- My dear little baby!

86
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:01,722 
Mother, that's not helping!

87
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:10,045
- Mother, honestly, I'm going to be fine!
- You were such a cute little egg!

88
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:15,526
Mum, I'm not an egg anymore!
It's time I left the nest.

89
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,527
No one thinks I can do this.

90
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:21,167
Maybe my only chance to show them
and myself that they're wrong!

91
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,088
Well, at least have some
breakfast before you go.

92
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,010
Oh Mum, Mum! Aargh! No. Thanks!

93
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,330
- Valiant!
- Right then.

94
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,771
I love you.
Good bye!

95
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,812
He'll always be little to me.

96
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:49,774
- Ahoy there Valiant!
- I'm off now Felix! Wish me luck!

97
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:53,775
- Good luck!
- Good bye!

98
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:57,295
That boy is gonna get creamed.

99
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,536
LONDON 57

100
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,098
Valiant pigeon! Fearless flier!

101
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,578
Pride of the Allied forces.

102
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:13,338
Feared by the enemy.
Loved by the ladies. Humble.

103
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,980
Spits danger smack in the eye!

104
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,183
Look at that!
It's London!

105
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:39,784
Alright. Listen up. This is easy. I mean for 
intelligent guys like you, I can tell ya,

106
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:42,186
All you gotta do - keep your eyes on 
the pebble. You can't go wrong.

107
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,507
She is shy. Give her a chance and 
she will give you the slip.

108
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:48,388
Find her and the crumbs is yours!
Easy as pie.

109
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,548
I don't know how I stay in business. There it is. 
Not under that one. Where is it now?

110
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,830
Find her and the crumbs is yours!
Which one is it under?

111
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,910
- That one!
- That one?

112
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,550
Oh, no! Bad luck again!

113
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,511
Give it one more go? Law of averages.
I think you're gonna win this time.

114
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,712
Serious thing, which
one has the pebble?

115
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,393
Wow! In all the excitement I forgot myself.

116
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,673
Why don't you gents say to a game of...

117
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:20,435
- You big cheat! Give me my crumbs back!
- On the level gents. Listen, I know what you're thinking...

118
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:22,235
Come and get me, falcons!

119
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,036
Strike me down if I tell you lie.

120
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,397
Look at him. That was lucky.

121
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:35,958
Prayers were answered. 
That's never worked before but...

122
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:40,319
-Hello, mate! 
-I lost control, but then...-you could not have 
picked a better time to have dropped in.

123
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,120
- Bugsy's the name.
- I'm terribly sorry, I'm Valiant.

124
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,920
- So what brings you to my manor?
- Well, I've come to be an aviator.

125
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,042
With the Royal Homing Pigeon Service.
Fighting for king and country!

126
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:56,203
You don't say. Well, I've never been much
of a hope and glory bird myself.

127
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:59,204
I'm rather partial to a little
something called freedom.

128
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,124
Yeah, oh yeah, I flit about as I please.

129
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:03,244
No one telling me what to do, or when to do it.

130
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:07,805
- Are those flies?
- Oh, they're friends of mine.

131
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:13,526
So, RHPS recruit in the head.
Good idea! Right this way mate.

132
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:15,807
I'm feeling rather patriotic
myself all of a sudden.

133
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,888
- There he is!
- Come on, after him.

134
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,530
Let's keep going, come on.

135
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,891
He's here somewhere.
I can smell him.

136
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,092
Follow my lead, mate.

137
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:38,933
- Hello. Two to enlist please.
- Valiant pigeon.

138
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,733
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Never heard of you.

139
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,254
Valiant pigeon.
The Valiant pigeon.

140
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,735
- You don't have Valiant on your list?
- No!

141
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:50,055
- Clerical error.
- Should I have?

142
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:54,335
Yes, I think you should have. Look at him!
He's a perfect specimen. Do something.

143
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:57,297
He's as fast as lightning,
strong as knocks.

144
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,537
Very tall for his height. Stand up.
Sit back down again.

145
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:04,858
The bird's a legend in the Starling Hump???shire area.

146
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,220
Too small! Ye should be yea high
and you're not even "hey" high.

147
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,820
- Charming, that's charming that is.
- And you!

148
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:21,543
- Have ye by any chance heard of a birdbath?
- Sad truth is, I've got me a rare feather condition.

149
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,583
Can't go near a bath. Or look at a bath.
It makes me itch.

150
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,184
Clear off the territory. Get lost!

151
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:32,585
- But, Wing Commander Gutsy...He....
- Yes. Wing Commander Gutsy. That's right.

152
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,825
Valiant's best mate.
They went to school together.

153
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:36,585
You don't wanna get on
the wrong side with him,

154
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,507
if he hears about this you're
gonna lose those stripes, mate.

155
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:44,468
- You know Wing Commander Gutsy, you say?
- Well... Oh, yeah.

156
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:50,189
- Well, that makes a difference. Sign here.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

157
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:53,270
There he is!
You dirty clowns!

158
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,750
When I get hold of you,
I'm gonna knock your beak off!

159
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,391
- Hey! That's it! Enough.
- Get your wings of me!

160
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,352
- Where do I sign up?
- Just sign here.

161
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,994
- All right gents, in you go.
- Thank you, sir.

162
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,154
Who is this Gutsy geaser anyway?

163
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,915
If I see your ugly face around
here, I'm gonna have you!

164
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,917
- We made it!
- Safe and sound.

165
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,916
We're in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service!

166
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,157
The elite of the elite! Fighting
the heroic battle to save...

167
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,717
- To save... 
-To save our tail feathers,which worked like a charm. 
Even though I say so myself.

168
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:34,919
So with that I'll be hittin' the skyway.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,160
Cheers mate, good luck. God bless.

170
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
If you make it back in one piece, be sure to...
...look me up...

171
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,642
Hello? Hello?

172
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:50,682
Gents, hello! Hello!

173
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:57,205
- No! There's been a terrible mistake!
- Trust me, this is all gonna work out brilliantly.

174
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:06,404
Hey! Come on! Come back!
I've been shainghaied.

175
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:28,251
That's a bit bright.

176
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:44,775
- Sorry about that.
- I didn't mean to hurt ya little fella.

177
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:48,856
Hey, little fella! It's not the
size of your wing span, no!

178
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:51,976
- It's the size of your spirit!
- If you say so, mate.

179
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:55,898
- Can't argue with that.
- I'm Tailfeather, this is Toughwood, my brother.

180
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,738
Not the sharpest beak on the block.

181
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,339
- What?
- But...

182
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,980
If you're ever in the scrum, there's
no better bird to have on your team.

183
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,220
Absolutely.

184
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:10,821
- Nice to meet you. I'm Valiant.
- Valiant? It's good to meet you.

185
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,062
- Let's go! It's two for Tailfeather.
- Six to none.

186
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:26,664
For quite an elite unit, on quote they
seem to be letting almost anything in with wings.

187
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:29,064
Including those flies, circling your bottom.

188
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:33,586
- Koi! Who do you think you are?
- I'm Lofty Thadious Worthington Pigeon.

189
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,747
I come from a long and
honourable line of warrior pigeons.

190
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,587
Hello lads!

191
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:43,749
I trust you've had a pleasant journey.

192
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,790
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say
the ride was a bit bumpy on the way in.

193
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,950
Maybe, check the suspension on that motorbike.

194
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:58,392
And actually we are a wee bit thirsty, if we could 
have some cold drinks, that would be nice.

195
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:03,353
Oh, oh good, that can certainly be arranged.

196
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:09,194
Right up! When did I sprout beak feathers
and turn into a flamingo!?!

197
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:17,836
Now fall in! Feather brains.Fall in!

198
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,037
For the next six weeks
your tails belong to me.

199
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:26,678
You'll learn to march like birds,
fly like birds and fight like birds.

200
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:30,439
I will make birds of you turkeys 
even if it kills you!

201
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:37,041
- Except you. You won't last a week.
- Permission to die trying, sir!

202
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,322
It's like this, ladies. You will shape up
and you will shape up fast

203
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:46,083
or I will personally drum you out of the corps!

204
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:50,244
Funny, you should...I would love to get drummed out.
I was gonna bring it up if you hadn't.

205
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:54,485
- Hey, leave him alone! He helped me to...
- Pipe down, pip-squeak!

206
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:59,445
I'm more interested in having
you all drop and give me 50

207
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:02,527
courtesy of your short little friend here.

208
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:07,648
Training at last.

209
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:13,649
I say ol'Bean. Wouldn't it be more sporting if the
chap who actually committed the infraction...

210
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,451
Gentlemen, welcome to the
Royal Homing Pigeon Service.

211
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,053
For the last time, what was your mission?

212
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,814
And where are these
messages coming from?

213
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:37,135
Very well. Have it your way.

214
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:45,137
- Do you want us to pluck out his feathers?
- And to clip his wings?

215
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,937
Let his feelings?

216
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:54,098
No, worse. Much worse.

217
00:17:56,098 --> 00:18:00,100
We have ways of making you squawk.

218
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:10,902
What kind of birds are you?

219
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,823
What is this yoddling music!

220
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:44,230
One two, one two and halt!

221
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,871
Now fall out and report
to the nursing doves.

222
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,592
- Hello nurse.
- Look at her!

223
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:00,073
- Well, I've been waiting for you.
- Do you have a little something

224
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,874
for a brave pigeon about to
go into battle? Hey, darling?

225
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:05,395
It just so happens I do
have something for you.

226
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,796
- Did you hear that?
- Is this what you had in mind?

227
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:18,317
Wow. It's awfully big. You're
kind of short for a nursing dove.

228
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:23,759
Look who's talking, I'd say you're kind
of short for a carrier pigeon.

229
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,601
- I'm Valiant by the way.
- All right then Valiant. I'm Victoria.

230
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:37,122
I know you lads have had a tiring day,
and what you need is a nice relaxing shower.

231
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,606
Then I'll treat ya to a fancy dinner.

232
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,649
We'll get your little feather cut.

233
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,852
Set you up with some uniforms.

234
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,174
- Oh, beg your pardon.
- Did that hurt?!
- Did that?!

235
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:33,094
That's it!

236
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:37,295
Come here!

237
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:41,377
And we'll all turn in for a good night's sleep.

238
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:51,619
So this is where the smelly rotten
bits of disgusting refuse sit out.

239
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,660
And our sleeping quarters would be where?

240
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,501
I'll never sleep in here.

241
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:10,584
- Well, this isn't so bad.
- Oh, just like home.

242
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:20,466
I've had enough!

243
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,147
Speak!

244
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:32,108
Lieutenant Mercury, Royal
Homing Pigeon Service, 4121444697.

245
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,869
Bring me the truth serum.

246
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,470
Come on, come on.

247
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:50,473
- One shot of this and we will know everything.
- I'll never talk! Never! Never!

248
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,355
Wakey wakey!

249
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:13,638
You bird brains are Squad F.
You know what that means?

250
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,759
- Squad Fantastic!
- I've got it! Squad Formidable!

251
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,599
Philosophical!

252
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,480
No, it means you are
the fliers of the future.

253
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:32,482
The far future!
But my job, somehow, is

254
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:36,002
to make you the carrier pigeons of today.

255
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:44,565
Good maneuver. It might help
if you kept your eyes open.

256
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:47,245
- Better get you back to your nursing dove.
- Thanks, Bugsy.

257
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:53,446
You must really like it here, because this is
the third time this week you've been in to see me.

258
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,808
- I wish you'd be more careful.
- Oh, don't you worry.

259
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,528
Where I come from, danger is our business.

260
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,928
Oh yeah, we spit danger in the eye.

261
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:04,249
If the condition, I can take it.

262
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,130
- And where do you come from?
- West Nestington.

263
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,771
That's near Nestington, it's
close to the west of it actually.

264
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:14,132
Oh, Valiant!

265
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:20,413
Well I have to return to my duties, so...

266
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:27,215
- Good bye.
- Oh, Valiant wait!

267
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:35,017
As homing pigeons it's our
duty to transport messages.

268
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:39,218
In the worst of conditions
wind, hail, sleet, snow,

269
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:42,818
bombs exploding, bullets flying
and as if that weren't enough,

270
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:48,019
mother nature has the audacity
to create a little something called

271
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,619
The Falcon.

272
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,661
Twenty pounds of pigeon eating muscle,
measuring five of your wing spans.

273
00:23:54,781 --> 00:24:00,102
They like to blind side their prey,
at speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour.

274
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:02,502
But not to bite. Not yet.

275
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:06,263
The first strike is merely for impact.
They'll let you drop of it.

276
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:11,865
Making sure you're defenseless, and
scoop you up in their razor sharp talons.

277
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:21,547
And in the dark of the night you'll have not but a
split second to recognize friend from foe.

278
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:25,948
Friend or foe?

279
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:27,068
- Foe!
- No!

280
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:30,829
You idiots, it's a pigeon!
Friend or foe?

281
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:32,630
- Foe! No!
- Friend!

282
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,110
- No, it's a foe.
- Yes, yes!

283
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,951
Friend or foe?

284
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:43,872
- Friend!
- Friend!

285
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:54,234
99. 100. 101. 102.

286
00:24:56,475 --> 00:25:02,316
To survive his mission a pigeon must have
the strength to carry his message capsule.

287
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,880
You must have the speed
to fly like the wind.

288
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:31,763
He must have the agility
to outmaneuver the enemy.

289
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:41,766
And he must have the
endurance to battle the elements,

290
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:45,526
flying long distances over raging seas.

291
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,649
- Me again.
- Valiant.

292
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:01,050
Oh, my favourite!
How did you know?

293
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:19,973
The parrot says to me "How about we do a loop o loop?"
I says I can't loop a loop.

294
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:28,855
He says, "Why ever not?" I say, "Well, I'm afraid of heights!"
He says, "You afraid of heights? That's ridiculous!"
Maybe to you mate. But not to me.

295
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,738
- That's it!
- Come on!

296
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:42,779
- Afternoon Monty!
- Hello Guts. What news?

297
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,540
Not good I'm afraid. We just
lost Squadron E over Belgium.

298
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,261
That means these new
recruits are our only chance.

299
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:55,742
- They'll have to leave tomorrow.
- You can't be serious.

300
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,984
They haven't even finished their training.

301
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:12,706
Sorry, but those are the orders. Have
them ready at 18:00 tomorrow Monty ol'boy. Cheers.

302
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:21,668
Commandor Gutsy is here, so I
suppose you'll be shipping out soon.

303
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:26,189
I know! I know! I can't wait! This is
the moment I've been waiting for!

304
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:30,351
Well, I'd like to be part of
what you come home to.

305
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,591
I don't care if you're a hero. Just
concentrate on the getting back.

306
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,434
You need to understand something, lads.

307
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,676
Our losses have been heavy. We got to stop it.

308
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:59,997
You're all we've got! And so
today we fight for our country.

309
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:07,798
Tomorrow our feathers may be plucked from our 
lifeless bodies, our innards spread like jam on toast,

310
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,560
And our bones fed to rabid weasels. But never mind that.

311
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,522
On this day, in this place,
let it forever be known

312
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:26,123
that you, pigeons did your
part in the heroic battle for...?

313
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:30,284
- Seeds!
- Freedom!

314
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:34,725
Right! You will be Commander
Gutsy's support wing.

315
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:40,646
I'll expect you to do whatever it takes
to ensure the success of his mission.

316
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:46,008
Chaps, the message we have been sent
to carry is of the utmost importance.

317
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:48,488
The outcome of the war could well depend on it.

318
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:54,089
We pigeons have never been entrusted
with a more critical or dangerous mission.

319
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,410
May you fly straight! And may
your instinct guide you home.

320
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:07,292
- What did Gutsy mean by 'highly dangerous'?
- I don't know. But I can tell you this.

321
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:15,214
I am a bird of principle. And
my number one principle is

322
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,895
don't get involved with anything
called 'highly dangerous'!

323
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:24,897
And I will never violate my core beliefs. Do
not ask me to violate my core beliefs.

324
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,417
You're talking to the wrong pigeon.

325
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:35,458
Sir, point of clarification please.
Regarding that highly dangerous mission.
I got a doctor's note. - Zip it Stinky.

326
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,620
Sure, I understand. I truly regret that I have 
but one life to give for my country.

327
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,461
- I'd love to die. Can't. Not Sunday. Bad for me.
- Are you finished?

328
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:50,582
Not quite, listen, maybe I'm not
that conscientious, but I do object.

329
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,503
Get back to the barracks! Now!

330
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,585
Do I still have to go on
the dangerous mission?

331
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:00,584
- Now!
- Yep.

332
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:04,145
- I'll take that as yes, I do.
- Now!

333
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:17,348
- Hey, hey. Where are you going?
- Keep it down, mate.

334
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:21,749
- Got some serious flying ahead.
- Flying, what do you mean flying?

335
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:24,310
- Flying to where?
- Back to old Trafalgar square, son.

336
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:29,031
- You're not leaving, you'll break up the team.
- Team? I'm not a team player.

337
00:30:29,031 --> 00:30:33,471
Old bug Buster plays solo. Maybe the question isn't
why I'm leaving, but why you're staying?

338
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:36,913
Why am I staying? Because
it's my duty, it's our duty!

339
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,274
Hold on! Sorry!
Have I missed something?

340
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:43,635
Did we start this? No.
Did we make those?

341
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:48,235
Or those? I've seen them before, mate.
And it's not a pretty sight.

342
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:52,756
The truth is, I'm scared. Alright?

343
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:57,318
Don't tell them that.
Cause I'll deny it.

344
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,958
- Well, I'm scared too.
- Then come with me.

345
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:06,280
- Trafalgar Square will be ours. Come on!
- But we didn't make Trafalgar Square either. 

346
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,160
Where do we go when they start
dropping bombs there?

347
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:15,683
- No, I'm staying. I'm doing my bit.
- Yeah. They're lucky to have you, mate.

348
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,723
Anyway, keep your wings dry, yeah?

349
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,644
- What's happenin'?
- What's going on?

350
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:33,165
It's time for me to fly the coop, all right?
So, I guess this is farewell.

351
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:36,807
- Wait, where are you goin'?
- You can't just leave, Bugsy.

352
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:42,007
Look, I've got urgent
business to take care of.

353
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,689
I better catch the wind
while it's blowing.

354
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,610
Look me up when you get back, yeah?!
You know where I'll be!

355
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:11,054
Gentlemen, take your places!

356
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:17,055
Our mission is to be dropped behind
enemy lines in occupied France.

357
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,496
To make contact with
the French resistance.

358
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:24,217
To get a vital top secret message and bring it
back here by sun down tomorrow.

359
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:29,179
Good luck. The fate of the freedom
loving world depends on us.

360
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:18,350
- Wait!
- Hey, Bugsy!

361
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:21,791
You can't go without me!
I can't let you get all the glory!

362
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,036
Good luck, lads.

363
00:33:55,439 --> 00:34:00,039
- Hey, Bugsy! Thanks for coming back!
- I'll tell you the truth,

364
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,679
it's the first worth while thing I've ever done.

365
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:04,881
We're gonna be fine. Right, Lofty?

366
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:10,041
Indubitably! Birds of a feather and all that. What?

367
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:15,762
- Right Lofty ol'mate. We stick together.
- Hey Tailfeather, can you believe that

368
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,844
we're the ones they pick to send on the
most important mission in World War II?

369
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,364
- Yeah!
- Me too!

370
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:30,686
Truthfully, I'm not a good singer anyway.
Always off key.

371
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:37,888
- Enough already! You've been chattering for days!
- Hey, who gave me the serum?

372
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:39,648
You want me to talk, okay I'm talking.

373
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,330
Truth be told, I'm glad you did this. Homing
Pigeon racket is all well and good,

374
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,370
but it's a stiff upper beak 
rubbish all the time.

375
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,730
I got feelings and I wanna express them.

376
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,291
I always used to think my favourite color was blue, 
cause it's for boys. Now I realise. . .

377
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,491
Shut up! Shut up!

378
00:34:57,253 --> 00:35:00,333
I demand better treatment I mean
the mice don't treat me like this!

379
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,653
You know those charming litle Resistance chappies
with their fabulous view over the harbour

380
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,615
the last time I was in the attic in St. Pierre...

381
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,815
St. Pierre?

382
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:18,338
O the truth serum is genious.
Cover his cage!

383
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:24,098
- I'm curious what is your favourite color?
- Pink!

384
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:30,820
Not like a hot pink, or a pastely pink,
just a kind of, well of, a pink pink.

385
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,381
You know what I mean, 
none of the rinky dink pinks. 

386
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:40,462
- Excuse me.
- I like pink too.

387
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:53,145
Come on! Cheer up, Valiant!
Stiff upper beak.

388
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:58,467
- Gentlemen, get ready to drop!
- Are you ready to drop?

389
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,627
I think I've dropped already!

390
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:09,390
It's okay to be scared, fellows!
I'd be worried if you weren't.

391
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,429
It won't get better,
but you'll get used to it!

392
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,550
Go! Go! Go!

393
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:26,914
It's jammed!

394
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:33,074
- Sir, let me help you!
- No! Go now! That's an order!

395
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:34,675
Yes, sir.

396
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,318
Come on Gutsy,
get out off there!

397
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,799
Oh, come on.

398
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:16,163
- Hello? Hello? A little help chaps?
- Hold on there, we'll get you out of there now.

399
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:20,485
Cheers! A bit of a tenuous landing that.
But I dare say it could've been worse.

400
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:21,886
- Look out! 
- O my!

401
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:27,047
- Sorry Lofty.
- Not to worry, old chap.

402
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:30,087
I say, a bit of a muddle, this.

403
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:34,689
- But at least we're all in one piece.
- Not quite all.

404
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:37,449
- Where's Gutsy?
- He was still in the plane.

405
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:42,851
- What do you mean he was still in the plane?
- His cage got stuck. I don't think he got out.

406
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:47,011
Ah, well that's it! We're dead!
We're finished! It's been a good run. Nice knowing you.

407
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:49,411
You're quite mistaking, ol'boy.
I'm sure he made it out.

408
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:52,973
Gutsy always makes it out, he's going to
come and find us any minute now.

409
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:54,534
And give us the plans for the mission.

410
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:04,175
- Then who has the back-up plan?
- You want the back-up plan?

411
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:09,176
- We die. That's the back-up plan.
- But I'm not ready to die!

412
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:15,258
- Am I ready? No one's asked me!
- So many books to read! Regrets!

413
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,258
That's it. We're dead. 
Thank you very much.

414
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:18,939
Everyone be quiet. Quiet!

415
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,459
We need a plan.

416
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,460
And the plan is, is to find a safe
location to plan the next move.

417
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:36,383
- You heard the bird.
- So our plan is to make a plan?

418
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,463
Come on.

419
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,305
France is spooky.
(Vive la France!)

420
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:55,387
Quiet! Did you hear that?
There's someone in there!

421
00:38:55,387 --> 00:38:57,947
Somebody better go and have a look.

422
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,750
All right, I'll go.

423
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:25,754
All right you turkies, let's go.

424
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:31,435
Valiant, just pull yourself together.
There's nothing in here.

425
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:35,796
Unless you're counting guns, bombs,
all the falcons, the pigeon-eating falcons.

426
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,037
Pigeon-eating falcons!

427
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:50,558
Tailfeather, let's take you out of the grail.
- Vive la France!

428
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,421
Pardonnez-moi, my pigeon friends.
You are the RHPS, non?

429
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:05,083
- Yes sir.
- French Résistance, Mars Division.
- Well, I'm glad to see ya. I'll tell you.

430
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,844
- How did you not find us?
- Well, there was the plane and the explosion.

431
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:11,365
And this gleaming and bleeding.

432
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:17,285
More screamings and beggins and cryings,
whinings, winging, yelling, boohooing.

433
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:19,446
- Enough about that.
- Absolutely.

434
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:20,607
Definitely, yep.

435
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:25,848
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Charles De Girl.

436
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:33,690
- De Girl? Why did they call you De Girl?
- Because I am a girl. The one and only girl.

437
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,171
- I like France.
- Do you speak French?

438
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:42,211
- Well, mais oui...
- Does 'o là là' mean anything to you?

439
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,572
Or 'va va voom! Oh yeah! Does bonjour..?

440
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:51,094
All right! We don't have time for this!
You have a message, we have a mission.

441
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:53,894
- Let's get on with it!
- Not so fast, monsieur!

442
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:58,135
This is Rallo. He's an expert in sa...

443
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:01,296
Sabotage!

444
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,576
Sabotage!

445
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,100
Pardon.

446
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,620
Now monsieur, before you
continue on your mission,

447
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,981
it's our national custom to...
- Break the bread?

448
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,982
- And cut the cheese.
- Thank you for your hospitality,

449
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:31,382
but we just don't have time to eat.
And anyway we're birds.

450
00:41:31,382 --> 00:41:34,823
- We don't eat cheese.
- We don't?

451
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:39,345
- Look, about that message.
- We will take you to it. But the road is dangerous.

452
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:41,785
And guarded by the enemy falcon.

453
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:46,306
But this cannot be a problem for
such highly trained pigeons.

454
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:50,867
- That is why you are squad A, oui?
- The things is you see...

455
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:53,307
- Squad B?
- Not squad B.

456
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:54,668
Squad C?

457
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:58,429
So then you are squad D?

458
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:03,390
Just between us, squad D was never
really what it was all cracked up to be.

459
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,231
I will not lie to you, you will
definately be eaten the falcons.

460
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:16,074
- Wow, that was some fine fromage.
- Can you burp on cue?

461
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,913
I can burp on all the letters. Not just Q.

462
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:23,275
Watch this. A. B. C.

463
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:26,996
Shhh! Be silent! The falcons!

464
00:42:30,957 --> 00:42:33,877
- I say!
- Excuse me.

465
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:51,441
Come on.

466
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:58,403
Falcons!

467
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,044
All clear!

468
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,490
Stop that!

469
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:35,531
Oh, Squad F.

470
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:38,772
- We are here.
- This is invigorating.

471
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:42,692
The attic! There it is!
Fly, English pigeons! Fly!

472
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:47,454
- Oh, dear. Sorry.
- Dirty bird!

473
00:43:47,454 --> 00:43:50,934
Lofty pigeon at your service.
Hold on, mademoiselle.

474
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:53,975
He's heavy, this one!

475
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,656
- There they are
- Faster!

476
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,257
Sabotage!

477
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:14,700
To the right! Over there!
I'm gonna get you!

478
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:27,343
Hold on, De Girl!

479
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,344
This is it!

480
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:38,785
I must do the secret knock.

481
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,706
- Who is it?
- De Girl.

482
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:46,147
- We must do the secret password.
- Jacques, there is no time!

483
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:50,708
- 'Ba, ba black sheep. Have you any?'
- Wine?

484
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,269
No, no, that is yesterday's password.

485
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:54,549
- Trees?
- No.

486
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:55,389
- Seeds?
- No, no.

487
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:57,910
- Petunias?
- Falcons!

488
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,950
Jacques, move it!

489
00:45:10,152 --> 00:45:13,993
- Let me give you le message.
- You can give me le massage.

490
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:15,954
Can you make sure it's a full body massage.

491
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:21,315
Message! The message that is to go to
London. Our freedom depends on it.

492
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,717
And who will carry them?

493
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:33,358
- Wait. I'll take it.
- Bugsy?
- Extraordinary!

494
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:38,440
- And you said you weren't a team player.
- Well we'll see now won't we?.

495
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,399
- Good luck, Bugsy.
- May you fly straight.

496
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,440
And let our instincts guide us home.

497
00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:56,683
Good bye. And good luck, pigeons!

498
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,446
Okay, farewell.

499
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,087
Absolutely charmed.

500
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:18,328
Just one tiny thing. How are we gonna
get out of here! We're trapped!

501
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:23,250
I've got an idea!
I've got an idea!

502
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,450
Where are they?

503
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:44,774
Let's go!

504
00:46:53,616 --> 00:46:57,137
- Hey, it worked like a charm!
- They'll be teaching that one at the academy!

505
00:46:57,137 --> 00:47:02,978
- I just hope the others are okay.
- You can't count on it!
- Evasive action!

506
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,623
Let's go.

507
00:47:26,185 --> 00:47:32,226
Get your claws off him! I say let go!
I'm the one you want!

508
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:44,548
You can't do better than
that, you English pigeon!

509
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,028
Bugsy!

510
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:04,352
- Bugsy!
- Dinner time!

511
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:21,036
Bugsy!

512
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:29,198
It was not easy, Herr General. 
But I have...

513
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:36,400
captured their leader!
- The leader?

514
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,160
No, perhaps, assisstant leader.

515
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:44,562
- But more importantly, Herr General.
- Get on with it!

516
00:48:46,322 --> 00:48:48,163
May I present you with...

517
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:52,043
the message! Ta-ta.

518
00:48:57,485 --> 00:49:00,845
The high commander will be pleased!

519
00:49:03,846 --> 00:49:09,847
There will be medals, photographs,
commemorative stamps!

520
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,929
I will personally deliver it to him.

521
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:24,811
They must be desperate indeed to give the
message to this putrid smelling reject.

522
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:32,733
Oh no, Dennis! You've squooshed!
He was my favourite.

523
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:40,694
I am putrid stinky rotten. Eat me,
you'll be sick for a week.

524
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:43,935
- Take him away!
- No!

525
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:48,657
I've got a doctor's note. 
I've got a feather condition!

526
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:54,458
Wait. On second thoughts
he may prove useful.

527
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,697
Yes! Oh, yes!

528
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,499
Oh, thank you.
You're very wise.

529
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,661
What would you like?
Cards? We can play cards.

530
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:08,021
Find the pebble?
I've got a lovely voice.

531
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:15,583
That probably annoys ya...

532
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:20,985
I was thinking more along the lines
of a celebration dinner.

533
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,865
Celebration dinner!
Brilliant idea!

534
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,504
I cook well! Not I cook well!

535
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,786
I won't be in it. I can make the dinner.
Bread crumbs! You'll love...

536
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:31,826
Oh, you haven't tried my
bread crumb bird-seedy thing.

537
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:36,428
No, pigeon under glass.

538
00:50:36,428 --> 00:50:39,988
It was a lovely liebfrau milch reduction.

539
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:55,991
What did you do to him?

540
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:05,794
- You're all right, mate?
- Wait a minute now!

541
00:51:05,794 --> 00:51:08,835
It's a feng-shui. 
That little bell should be over there!

542
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:17,116
Who was I kidding?
I don't belong here.

543
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:23,038
I've let everyone down. Bugsy wouldn't 
even be here if it weren't for me.

544
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,000
Chaps! There's Valiant! Look! Follow me!

545
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,120
Hey! Lofty! Toughwood!

546
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:43,523
- Chaps!
- Gutsy! You're alive!

547
00:51:43,523 --> 00:51:44,803
What happened?
Tell us what happened!

548
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:46,843
Plane exploded. Chute gave out.

549
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,605
Free fall at 3000 feet. Set upon 
by a pack of wolves.

550
00:51:50,684 --> 00:51:54,445
Flew through barbed wire, picked up
some shrapnel from a stray grenade.

551
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,006
Fought my way to the rendez-vous 
when here we are.

552
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,566
Right! We can dispense
with the chit chat.

553
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:02,086
I'm guessing the falcons have acquired the message.

554
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,407
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Bugsy?

555
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:09,209
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The falcons got Bugsy and the message.

556
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:12,009
- Which way did they go?
- That way.

557
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:13,849
Oh, no!

558
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,531
Britania rules the waves!

559
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:29,973
Come on, pull yourself
together. Snap out of it!

560
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:35,855
Come-on Bugsy ol'boy, let's find us
a way out of here.

561
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:38,055
Where there's a will, there's a way.

562
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,216
Right. You chaps sit tight.

563
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:45,017
I'll fly in avoiding the various,
clever booby traps and deadly ambushes.

564
00:52:45,017 --> 00:52:47,977
Then subdue any resistance.
And secure the message.

565
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:50,658
Absolutely. Gutsy by
name. Gutsy by nature.

566
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:05,381
I will bathe.

567
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,743
- Bring me my best cape.
- Yes, Herr General.

568
00:53:27,627 --> 00:53:30,868
- Join the army you said.
- You did, it was your idea.

569
00:53:31,747 --> 00:53:33,028
I'll have none of this! I'm not listening!

570
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:39,429
I'm afraid it's not as
simple as I thought.

571
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:43,989
This is a highly fortified bunker stuffed
to the gills with enemy falcons.

572
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:47,311
There's only one opening, scarcely
big enough for a hummingbird.

573
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:53,553
It's down the barrel of that gun.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid it's hopeless.

574
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:02,435
I'll do it!

575
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:02,929
Bugsy?

576
00:55:22,613 --> 00:55:25,814
I'm too young to die!
I can't believe it!

577
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:27,054
- Hey!
- Hey?

578
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:29,534
- Valiant?
- Bugsy.

579
00:55:32,816 --> 00:55:36,456
Hey! The message!
It's in there.

580
00:55:47,418 --> 00:55:53,180
Oh, no! Red says strong and decisive!

581
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,580
- Red it is!
- Yes, General!

582
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:03,822
- No wait, the blue was the actual trim.
- As many capes as you like,General.

583
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:05,422
They're coming!

584
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,663
Valiant, get down!

585
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:23,907
- How many capes does someone need?!
- I'm sick of capes! I hate capes!

586
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,150
Here it goes.

587
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:51,274
- Now, I'll get you out of here Bugs.
- It's of no use, he took the key with him.

588
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:55,394
- Complete the mission!
- But Bugsy! I can't!

589
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:58,515
Forget about me! You've got the
message, now get out of here!

590
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:00,715
- No, Bugsy!
- Go.

591
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:08,797
Don't! Don't do it!

592
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,040
Underlink?

593
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:28,602
- Underlink!
- Ya, Herr General!

594
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:32,482
- My beak brush!
- Ya, Herr General.

595
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:46,006
- Cufflink?
- Ya, Herr General!

596
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:50,166
- My talon clippers.
- Ya, Herr General!

597
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:02,850
Valiant! They're coming!

598
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,930
- Get him!
- Stop him!

599
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:14,372
What's going on!

600
00:58:14,372 --> 00:58:17,013
- Bugsy!
- Valiant!

601
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:20,334
Come on, last chance. Get up!

602
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:26,135
What is that repulsive odeur?!

603
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:30,975
Not to rush or anything,
gotta go! Come on!

604
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,377
Well done, my lad!

605
00:58:34,297 --> 00:58:37,538
- You're from Squadron E, right?
- It's a long story, I'll tell you later!

606
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,221
You idiots!

607
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:53,942
Valiant! Bugsy! On cue!

608
00:58:57,502 --> 00:58:59,622
- We did it!
- You made it! 

609
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:05,024
- And the message?
- Yes, sir! Safe and sound.

610
00:59:05,864 --> 00:59:08,225
- Good man!
- Thank you, sir.

611
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:13,345
Right lads, we have a message
to deliver. Let's make wind!

612
00:59:20,907 --> 00:59:24,908
Those falcons are gonna think
twice before they try to mess with us!

613
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:30,470
Enemy fliers!
Toughwood! Tailfeather!

614
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,070
- Figure of 8! Disperse!
- Yes, sir!

615
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:46,674
Come on lads, attack formation!

616
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:50,034
Valiant, complete the mission.
You know where to go.

617
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,996
Keep it tight now!
Let's go chaps!

618
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:31,324
You look tired, little bird? Wouldn't
you like a rest in my belly?

619
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:42,000
- So you are the elite? The best of the best?
- There's more to me than meets your eye.

620
01:01:15,574 --> 01:01:18,294
I hope I'm gonna make it.
I think I'm gonna make it.

621
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:20,254
I'm going to make it!

622
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:44,460
You can't escape me, pigeon!

623
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:21,428
Valiant back so soon!
And alive! Excitable boy!

624
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,030
Falcon! Sound the alarm!

625
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,633
Sound the alarm!

626
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:21,963
It's just you and me now, pigeon!
This is where it ends.

627
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:25,604
You are nothing but
a lowely roof pigeon.

628
01:03:25,604 --> 01:03:27,404
You are no match for a falcon royal.

629
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,966
It's just as I imagined!
Pieces and shreds!

630
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:39,567
Valiant!

631
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:50,729
- You great ugly .... 
- .... you dirty falcon!

632
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:25,377
Come out, little birdy. I may
even spare your puny little life!

633
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:34,260
Just stay calm.
You can do this!

634
01:04:49,662 --> 01:04:50,584
You pip-squeak!

635
01:04:51,543 --> 01:04:54,864
My name is not pip-squeak!
My name is Valiant!

636
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:05,786
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a message to deliver.

637
01:05:07,827 --> 01:05:08,907
That's my boy!

638
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:28,392
Valiant? You've made it?

639
01:05:29,871 --> 01:05:30,952
Valiant pigeon.

640
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:34,713
Sir, I have a message to deliver.

641
01:05:57,278 --> 01:05:58,238
