1
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,827
That one.

2
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,958
Here, boy.

3
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,547
You're heavy.

4
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,968
And slobbery.

5
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,684
There.

6
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,353
You're a good boy.

7
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,023
You're my good boy.

8
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,157
Hello?

9
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,704
Penny, I don't have much time.

10
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,540
Daddy? Are you okay?

11
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,377
Something's come up at work, honey.

12
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,046
Daddy's not gonna be home
for a while.

13
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,216
I don't understand.

14
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,261
You can't go back
to the house, Penny. Okay?

15
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,139
What's happening?

16
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,935
It's all right. You won't be alone.
You have Bolt.

17
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,480
I've altered him.

18
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:35,005
He can protect you now.

19
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,735
The doctor has been taken care of,
which, of course, is wonderful news.

20
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,780
Everything is positioning nicely.

21
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,492
There he is. Dr. Calico.

22
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,914
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

23
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:14,836
His guts will spill, one way or another.

24
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,464
Never! I'll never talk.

25
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,092
Daddy!

26
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:25,681
You're beginning to irk me, professor.
I am irked, and that will not do.

27
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,266
Has the package arrived?

28
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,689
I think it might make our dear friend
a bit more communicative.

29
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,024
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

30
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,029
Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me
on the first flight.

31
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,379
Bolt, let's go.

32
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,991
We only need the girl.

33
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,193
What?

34
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,529
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

35
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:12,245
Bolivia! Bolivia! Calico's in Bolivia!
Near Lake Rogaguado!

36
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,540
Lake Rogaguado! I should've known.

37
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,883
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

38
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,327
Bolivia.
There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

39
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,175
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

40
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,438
Bolt, fetch.

41
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,749
Puppy!

42
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,499
Good boy. Airport.

43
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,428
Bolt, speak.

44
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,220
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

45
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,891
Mission accomplished.

46
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,395
That's a keeper.

47
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,399
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

48
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,573
Don't worry, Bolt.
You saved the day again.

49
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,079
All right. Good job. Let's strike the set.

50
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,793
We're gonna need a cable guard on set
for that move tomorrow.

51
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,419
Yeah. All right.

52
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,258
Good boy. Airport.

53
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,269
Bolt, speak.

54
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,024
- Boom mike.
- We got a boom mike.

55
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,776
It's a boom mike.

56
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,238
That's sloppy.

57
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,158
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

58
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,620
Who cares
if the dog sees a boom mike?

59
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,914
What? Who's that?

60
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,960
Forgive me for answering a question
with a question,

61
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,879
but who are you?

62
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,716
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

63
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,971
Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network,

64
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,973
what do you see here?

65
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,727
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

66
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,983
Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

67
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,652
Am I missing something?

68
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,530
You're missing everything, Mindy.

69
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,574
You see a dog.

70
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:28,872
I see an animal who believes with
every fiber of his being, every fiber,

71
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,666
that the girl he loves is
in mortal danger.

72
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,793
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

73
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:38,173
the likes ofwhich has never
been captured on screen before!

74
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,093
Never, Mindy from the network!

75
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:47,140
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

76
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,602
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

77
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:55,690
and it's why we most certainly
do not let the dog see boom mikes!

78
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,196
Because, Mindy from the network,

79
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:09,287
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

80
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,374
Wow. Okay.

81
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,503
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

82
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,049
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

83
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,425
There's always a happy ending.

84
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,929
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-33-year-olds are unappy.

85
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,680
They're not happy with happy.

86
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,682
So maybe you should, I don't know,

87
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,518
spend a little less time
worrying about the dog's Method acting

88
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,686
and more time figuring out

89
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,314
how to stop 20-year-olds in Topeka
from changing the channel.

90
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,192
Because if you lose
so much as half a rating point,

91
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,571
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

92
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,241
How's that for real?

93
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,454
There. Perfect.

94
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,750
You saved me again, Bolt.

95
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,422
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

96
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,051
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

97
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,393
You got them, Bolt.
No one's gonna hurt me.

98
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,772
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

99
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,068
Come here, buddy. Come here.

100
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,738
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

101
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,784
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

102
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,288
Well, what do we have here?

103
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,417
Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot.

104
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,732
Bolt. You know I have to go.

105
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,082
Yeah, you're my good boy.

106
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,260
There she is. My little superstar.

107
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,512
Let's get to that Teen Vogue
cover shoot.

108
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,682
Mom, I wanna take Bolt home
this weekend.

109
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,142
Well, I...

110
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,144
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

111
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:43,274
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

112
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,613
So I can bring Bolt home?

113
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,450
As your friend I say, "Yes, absolutely,"

114
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,288
but as your agent, I have to remind you
this is Bolt's world.

115
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,958
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

116
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,169
But he never gets to be a real dog,

117
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,296
and it would only be for the weekend,
and I just want...

118
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,965
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

119
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,260
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it. Pin in.

120
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,513
There you go.
Now, let's let that hang there a bit,

121
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,640
and then we'll address that
when we've thought things through.

122
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,266
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

123
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,435
Smiles all around?
Let's get out of here. Come on.

124
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,064
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

125
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,775
Look at this face.

126
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,277
I have a little girl at home,
love of my life.

127
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,696
I would do anything for her,

128
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,741
and I would trade her for you
in a heartbeat.

129
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,868
True story.

130
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,579
That reminds me,
we need to be getting over to wardrobe.

131
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,831
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

132
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,958
- I need her in hair.
- I just...

133
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,709
Can I get her for five minutes
in makeup?

134
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,546
I wanna go for something more natural.

135
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,887
So the dog thinks this is all real?

136
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,764
Oh, yeah, you're new.

137
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,475
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

138
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,396
Whenever I get the chance,
this is the perfect way to unwind.

139
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,817
I like to start with an evil laugh.

140
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,698
Hello, hairballs.

141
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,742
You may have won today, Bolt,

142
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:21,080
but in the end,
we will get your little Penny.

143
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,750
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

144
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:29,297
Ultimately, it will destroy you,
along with your fiendish puppet master!

145
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,717
- Wow!
- I know, right? Okay, watch this.

146
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,429
She's a goner, dog.

147
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,725
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

148
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:48,733
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

149
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,278
I would superbark you both
back into the hole you crawled out of,

150
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,822
but I need you alive
because I've got a little message

151
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,283
for you to take back
to your Green-Eyed Man.

152
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,744
You tell him
his old friend Bolt said he better...

153
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,162
Is it long?

154
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,998
- Is what long?
- The message.

155
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,668
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

156
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,004
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

157
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,173
You know what? Why don't we do this?

158
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,509
You remember
the first half of the message,

159
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,302
and then I'll remember the second,

160
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,471
and then we can pass it on
to the Green-Eyed Man together.

161
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,390
Now, I don't care how
the message is translated, all right?

162
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,934
Just do it, okay.

163
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,311
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

164
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:29,232
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

165
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,943
You tell the Green-Eyed Man
that reckoning...

166
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,569
Way too many words.

167
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,989
I was, like, "What?"
And then I was, like, "Huh?"

168
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,327
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

169
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,496
Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao.

170
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,999
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

171
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:57,176
Get back here,
you sick, revolting, loathsome little...

172
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,261
Dogs.

173
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,721
Cats.

174
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,940
I'll never let them get you, Penny.

175
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,294
Are you ready, Bolt?

176
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:39,719
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

177
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:50,604
And driver.

178
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,106
Thanks, Larry.

179
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,360
All right, Scooter. Find the grate.
Ready on the rubber bars.

180
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,825
And track with them.

181
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,788
The Calico supercomputer.

182
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,960
Lfwe can access it, we'll finally learn
where they're keeping my father.

183
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,397
The weapors hot.

184
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,567
Heat vision time.

185
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,528
Bolt, stare.

186
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:40,821
Now!

187
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,503
Nice move.

188
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,090
Come on. Come on.

189
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,597
Such devotion.
It brings tears to my eyes.

190
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,015
Calico.

191
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,355
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organization.

192
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:22,405
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

193
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,198
Bolt!

194
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,412
World domination is within my grasp!

195
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,552
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

196
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,555
You ask for
unappy 18-to-33-year-olds,

197
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:52,726
I give you unappy 18-to-33-year-olds.

198
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,646
Bolt! It's okay, Bolt. I'm fine.

199
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,190
Guards, stop her!

200
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,651
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

201
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,404
Listen to him.
He needs to know I'm okay.

202
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,573
Nope, you're not okay.

203
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,659
You've been kidnapped
by the fiendish Dr. Calico,

204
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,703
at least
that's what the dog needs to think,

205
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,289
butjust imagine,
close your eyes and imagine

206
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,418
how excited he'll be
when he saves you tomorrow. Okay?

207
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,628
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

208
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,589
- Please, just let me...
- What...

209
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,883
Wait a second,
what's that behind your ear?

210
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,342
Is that a...

211
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,762
Yes, it is. It's a pin. Let's do this.

212
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,558
Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation.

213
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,351
And we will not take it down,
no, ma'am,

214
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,103
until this matter is resolved.

215
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,355
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

216
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,775
The DVD release junket.
Let's get going. It's a big push.

217
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,612
I want to go with a modern look,
something that says,

218
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,780
"I'm 13, and I'm fine with that."

219
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,118
All right, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

220
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,254
I've been working on my evil laugh.

221
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,300
'Cause everybody has an evil laugh.
Like that.

222
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,636
Okay, here's the thing.
You're not ready for the evil laugh.

223
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,347
You could do a chuckle,
like a mildly upset chuckle,

224
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,015
after my evil laugh.

225
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,976
Listen to mine. Hey, Bolt.

226
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,395
Big fan!

227
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,232
Bolt! Come back!

228
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,403
I'm too late.

229
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,406
- Bolt! Help!
- I'm coming, Penny!

230
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,992
Bolt! Help!

231
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,664
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

232
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,669
Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!

233
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,056
Penny!

234
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,697
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

235
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,231
Okay! Hey! Hey!

236
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,576
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

237
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,169
The Green-Eyed Man.

238
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,782
Penny! Penny!

239
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,305
Penny!

240
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,809
Target acquired.

241
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,032
It ends here.

242
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,002
Penny!

243
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,005
Penny? They moved her.

244
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,138
There's no time
for formalities, brothers.

245
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,682
My persors in danger, and I...

246
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,351
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

247
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,894
You wanna sniff mine first?

248
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,021
- What?
- Not from around here, are you?

249
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,566
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

250
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,778
Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie?

251
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,530
Hey! Wait!

252
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:22,055
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

253
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,225
Buddy.

254
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,689
You got your head stuck pretty good,
huh, guy?

255
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:35,569
Hey, guys, come here. Check this out.
He's got his melon stuck.

256
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,406
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

257
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,912
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

258
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,582
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

259
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:56,173
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this.
Turn and pull. Turn and pull.

260
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,301
Forget about it. You'll be out, no time.

261
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:14,983
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

262
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:23,242
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

263
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,953
This has the Green-Eyed Man
written all over it.

264
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,996
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

265
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:32,835
You know, I gotta say something,
if I could say something here.

266
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,338
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

267
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,050
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

268
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,888
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

270
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,014
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

271
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,517
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

272
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,643
Listen, listen!

273
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:53,313
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

274
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,693
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

275
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,321
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

276
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,162
No, I don't know. I thought I knew.

277
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,958
Hey, you ever hang out down on
14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?

278
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,084
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,545
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

280
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,173
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridonculous.

281
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:21,800
Absolutely ridonculous.

282
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,678
Capisce, ridonculous.
You know what that means?

283
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,680
You pigeons are useless.

284
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,893
I need someone on the inside,
someone close to the Green-Eyed Man.

285
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,811
A cat.

286
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:35,230
A cat?

287
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,024
Yeah, a cat.

288
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,568
And when I find him, when I find him,

289
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,738
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

290
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,368
I think we knowjust the cat.

291
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,043
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

292
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,838
Okay, Saul, nice work.

293
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,882
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

294
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,718
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

295
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:10,557
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

296
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,351
Good day, Mittens.

297
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,522
Louie? What is this?

298
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:22,110
It was a slow week.
That's half ofwhat I got.

299
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,199
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

300
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,785
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

301
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,498
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

302
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,458
Not the claws! Please.

303
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,919
I'm holding these bad boys back,
best I can,

304
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,089
but, thing is, it's not up to me.

305
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,633
The stomach's got a direct line
to these babies

306
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,095
and I'm picking up a lot of chatter.

307
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,722
So, I'll talk to the claws,

308
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,935
but in exchange,
next week all your food comes to me.

309
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,354
But that's not our deal.

310
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:01,108
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

311
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,778
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

312
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,447
Mark my words, Mittens.

313
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:10,951
One day
someone's gonna stand up to you.

314
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,620
Someone's gonna teach you a lesson.

315
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,288
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

316
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,958
You should be!

317
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,459
Okay! Yeah!

318
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,003
Where is she?

319
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,132
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

320
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,300
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

321
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,929
Look, buddy, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

322
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,933
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.

323
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,601
Tell the dog, make him happy.

324
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,312
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

325
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,651
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

326
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,822
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

327
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,825
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

328
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,203
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

329
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,458
Looks like we're gonna do this
the hard way.

330
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,712
Hey, you're crazy, man!

331
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,216
Hey, Joey. Did we go too far in this?

332
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:12,220
You kidding?
This is the best day of my life.

333
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,847
You work for the men in black,

334
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,599
who work for the man
with the green eye.

335
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,227
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

336
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:23,857
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

337
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,902
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk!

338
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,572
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

339
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,618
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

340
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,036
Blue eyes?

341
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,956
Green! Yes, green! The one green eye!

342
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:45,045
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

343
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,382
I know. It's disgusting. I disgust myself.

344
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,094
Hollywood.

345
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,848
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

346
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,613
You know, I hope you appreciate
the risk I'm taking here.

347
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,075
Every bone
in my evil cat body is telling me

348
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,203
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

349
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:25,585
Okay. This is a top, top secret map
of the entire Earth.

350
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,341
Now we're over here,
by the green lady with the big torch,

351
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,885
and my boss has Penny locked up...

352
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:40,767
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

353
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,146
Now all you need to do
is get from here to there.

354
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:50,652
Well, I told you where to find her so
if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

355
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,446
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

356
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,534
Excuse me? That wasrt the deal.
We had a deal!

357
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,494
Your deal just expired.

358
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,958
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago. The irony.

359
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,465
Perfect.

360
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:19,806
Padlocked.

361
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,897
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked
claws under these mitts.

362
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:31,151
Do not, I beg of you, do not make me
bring out these bad boys.

363
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:32,986
It gets ugly.

364
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,407
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

365
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:41,703
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

366
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,247
Now I'm concerned
on a number of levels.

367
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,373
- Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

368
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:46,541
- Watch it, though.
- You got it?

369
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,877
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

370
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,671
You're scraping the fur off my...

371
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,509
Oh, boy. This thing is heavy.

372
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,888
Hey, hey. Put it down. I forgot the keys.

373
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,642
I'll be right back.

374
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,902
Hey, lucky penny!

375
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,197
Thanks! Now move your butt.

376
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,032
- Okay. Up on your end.
- All right, just a little bit.

377
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,493
- Like that? A little bit more.
- Yeah. I got... No, I got mine.

378
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,911
You got it?

379
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:35,423
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey.

380
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:38,260
Bobby, you guys are looking at me like,
"He don't know."

381
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,554
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

382
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,391
Hey, you'll remember it tonight
when you're preening.

383
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,726
Right, that's what'll happen.

384
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,920
I have got some good news.

385
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,630
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

386
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:20,010
I just booked you
on The Tonight Show, lead guest.

387
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,594
That's right.

388
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:27,183
Which means just absolutely nothing
if Bolt is still missing.

389
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,686
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

390
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,605
The Tonight Show, who cares?
I don't care.

391
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,442
It's okay, baby.

392
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:39,279
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

393
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:43,616
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

394
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,121
I bet Bolt would want you
to do The Tonight Show.

395
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,293
Or maybe not.

396
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,632
Bolt loves you very much, sweetie,
and you're here.

397
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,136
He couldn't have gone far.

398
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,229
So, if you got superpowers,

399
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,025
I guess that would make you,
what, like, some kind of superdog?

400
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,485
That informatiors classified.

401
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,321
Come on.
Like, what's your best power?

402
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,824
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

403
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,120
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

404
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,623
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

405
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,333
What's it to me?

406
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,127
I have a superbark.

407
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,880
A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me.

408
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,345
What exactly
does one do with a superbark?

409
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,848
I really can't talk about it. It's classified.

410
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,684
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

411
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,939
You're awfully attached
to this Penny character, huh, Wags?

412
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,526
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

413
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,988
And if you ask me,
the only good person is a...

414
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,329
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

415
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,707
Tuck and what?

416
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,891
What?

417
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:35,562
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

418
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,605
It's called blood, hero.

419
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,067
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

420
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,445
So if you wanna keep it
inside your body, where it belongs,

421
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,241
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

422
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,244
Yeah, well, normally,
I'm a tad more indestructible.

423
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:56,249
Must've been the... Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

424
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,002
What are you doing? Put that down!

425
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,921
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

426
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:05,925
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

427
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,595
I'm gonna seriously wound you
with this Styrofoam.

428
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,681
Are you mad?
You don't know the power of Styrofoam.

429
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:13,433
You bet I'm mad, baby,

430
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,188
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

431
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,733
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

432
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,739
That's a weird place to put a piano.

433
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,619
Are we gonna have
any more problems, cat?

434
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,289
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

435
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,795
- What is that?
- What?

436
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,547
That! Okay.

437
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,467
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

438
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,886
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

439
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,055
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

440
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,223
I can't think straight.

441
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,975
I don't believe this. You're hungry.

442
00:39:57,102 --> 00:40:00,313
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

443
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,402
There's your antidote.

444
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,404
Food.

445
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,240
All right, who wants burgers?

446
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,075
- I'll take one.
- Me, too!

447
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,660
What's this?

448
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,996
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

449
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,666
You know, beg.

450
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,169
Do the dog face.

451
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,422
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

452
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,843
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth
who doesn't know how to beg.

453
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,847
Okay, if you want the... The antidote,

454
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,684
you're gonna have to do
exactly what I say.

455
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,436
No. Not likely.

456
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,189
You're a degenerate creature
of darkness.

457
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,525
Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said,

458
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,944
all I'm asking you to do
is just tilt your head a little.

459
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,530
You can do that, can't you? Come on.

460
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,866
More. More.

461
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,535
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

462
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,704
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

463
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,038
Oh, boy.

464
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,709
Okay. Try it the other way.

465
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,211
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

466
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:11,050
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

467
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,386
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

468
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:18,391
Hold it. Right there.
And ever so slightly, look up.

469
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,394
Soup is on, baby!

470
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,575
Here you go!

471
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,702
Yes!

472
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,667
Look at the little guy.

473
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,923
Beat it, stupid cat!

474
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,183
Why do you care?

475
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,602
I want to know what really happened...

476
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,521
- And why does that matter to you?
- Because I'm involved!

477
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,357
- With Ridge?
- With James!

478
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,400
If you and James were romantic,
I wanna know about it.

479
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,027
What, so you can...

480
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,737
Come on down!

481
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,530
Gilligan, why don't you stop that.

482
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,367
Come on, no Whammies!
No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!

483
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,702
For weather on the ones,
here's Lester.

484
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,953
It really does help,

485
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,539
and it really releases
the serotonin, and...

486
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,584
Hey, man, this time we'll do it my way.

487
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,385
Well, hello, puppy.

488
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,055
Did you come for some of Grandma's
butter bean dumplings?

489
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:41,224
You wait right there.

490
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,893
One of these days,
I'm gonna pound y'all to the ground.

491
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,978
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

492
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,902
Look at you.
You are quite the little actor, huh?

493
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:55,405
I haven't eaten like this in ages.

494
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,574
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

495
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,577
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

496
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,580
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

497
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:09,252
Every week new RVs bring us
new suckers who bring us new food.

498
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,088
Look around! It's perfect.

499
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,095
Do my eyes deceive me?

500
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,140
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

501
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,436
Or could it be my hero?

502
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,105
Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

503
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,445
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

504
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:42,285
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

505
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,037
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've established that. Who are you?

506
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,374
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

507
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,960
Well, you know,
my ancestry isn't all hamster.

508
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:54,964
I'm one-sixteenth wolfwith, you know,
a little wolverine in there somewhere,

509
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,799
but that's besides the point.

510
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,721
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

511
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,056
He can outrun speeding missiles

512
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,477
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

513
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,899
And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

514
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,902
Wait a minute.
You've seen the superbark?

515
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,070
Have you been observing me?

516
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,492
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

517
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,993
Oh, it's nothing, really.

518
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:25,995
But I'm always so vigilant.

519
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,916
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

520
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,253
If you say so. Hey, check it out.

521
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:41,761
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh? It's like we're twins.

522
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,764
Yeah. Scary.

523
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,517
So, where's Penny?

524
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,769
She was kidnapped
by the Green-Eyed Man.

525
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:54,273
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

526
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,610
Grave danger. I know.
But I've captured this cat.

527
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:01,280
An agent of the Green-Eyed Man,
I presume?

528
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,450
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

529
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:10,122
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

530
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,961
Penny's the most wonderful person
ever, and she loves Bolt.

531
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,798
And he's awesome,
and you're a monster!

532
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:23,052
How dare you disrupt their relationship
with your evil!

533
00:45:23,136 --> 00:45:25,471
Die! Die!

534
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,057
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

535
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:31,602
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

536
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,814
You're right. We need her alive.

537
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,900
- "We"?
- Yes!

538
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,487
Bolt, I can be a valuable addition
to your team.

539
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,573
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

540
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:48,327
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

541
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,164
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

542
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,834
The road'll be rough.

543
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,085
I have a ball.

544
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,503
There's no turning back.

545
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,589
Guess I'll have to roll with the punches.

546
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,507
Easy won't be part of the equation.

547
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,592
Promise?

548
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,261
I gotta warn you.
Going into the belly of the beast,

549
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,679
danger at every turn.

550
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,015
I eat danger for breakfast.

551
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,433
You hungry?

552
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,852
Starving!

553
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,437
Welcome aboard!

554
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:19,108
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

555
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:21,027
I don't know what's going on here,

556
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,781
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

557
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,533
My limit is one.

558
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,701
He's coming with us.

559
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,370
But I... Hey!

560
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,623
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

561
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,668
I agree. Now,
we need to find a fast set ofwheels.

562
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,505
I've got a better idea. Follow me.

563
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,396
Okay. So what we do here is
we give the target a quick flyover,

564
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,232
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead center.

565
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,984
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

566
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,487
Just the knowledge that every minute
spent in your company

567
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,906
becomes the new greatest minute
of my life.

568
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,078
No! Forget it! How do you say
"No way I'm doing this" in crazy?

569
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,829
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

570
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,665
That's the problem!

571
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,417
Would you relax?

572
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:22,380
Every time he did this on the magic box
it was awesome.

573
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,759
Magic what?

574
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,595
You know,
the magic box people stare at.

575
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,598
Wait a minute. Does this magic box
have moving pictures on it?

576
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,184
Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best.

577
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:39,355
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

578
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,691
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

579
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,527
Let it begin. Let it begin. Let it begin!

580
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,780
Wait! You are not a superhero...

581
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,206
What are you doing?

582
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,557
Mittens!

583
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,059
Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive!

584
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,812
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

585
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,064
Take my paw. I'll save you.

586
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,817
No, you won't! You're not really a...

587
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,127
Bolt!

588
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,089
Saboteur.

589
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,178
You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

590
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,638
Help him? Yeah, right.

591
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,684
Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her!

592
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,613
I can't hold it.

593
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,619
Let go, you monster!

594
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,953
Bolt!

595
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,653
The real world hurts, doesn't it?

596
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,322
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

597
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:56,116
Get down here, cat.
We don't have time for this.

598
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,827
I'll get a ladder.

599
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:03,707
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

600
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:09,755
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

601
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,173
That's preposterous.

602
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,341
Think about it, Bolt.

603
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:15,010
Since you got lost, none of your powers
are working, are they?

604
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,013
For the first time, you're hungry,
you're bleeding.

605
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,100
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

606
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,937
in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?

607
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,356
It's my mark of power, cat.

608
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,567
It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog.

609
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,236
You're ridiculous. Now get down here.

610
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,155
No.

611
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,034
Mittens, so help me,
I will superbark you out of that tree.

612
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,371
Yeah. Go nuts.
Let's see how that works out for you.

613
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:44,540
You leave me no choice.

614
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,721
The superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

615
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,559
It's not true. It's just not true.

616
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,482
Wow. That one felt really super.

617
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,735
Wait. No, it didn't.

618
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:18,574
Okay, okay. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

619
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:24,872
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop.
I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's...

620
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,920
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

621
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,840
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

622
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,842
Bolt!

623
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,260
Come here!

624
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:14,421
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

625
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,547
Bolt!

626
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,509
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

627
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,432
That is not Bolt.

628
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,853
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

629
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,441
You know, when I was little,
I wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

630
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,194
but my parents got me
a baseball glove.

631
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:39,363
So, you know what I did?

632
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:43,993
I pretended that baseball glove
was a bicycle,

633
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,037
and I rode it to school every day.

634
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,747
True story.

635
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,166
It's not him.

636
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,127
I think it's him. I do.

637
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,882
Thank you. Look, kid.
It's time we were honest with you.

638
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,052
Lfwe don't get back into production,
people are going to lose theirjobs.

639
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,846
Good people, with families.

640
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,347
But Bolt's still out there, and...

641
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,099
Now, we feel for you,

642
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,351
and the last thing we wanna do
is ask a little girl

643
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,813
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

644
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:14,857
We need you to move on.

645
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,444
We need you to let Bolt go.

646
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:48,223
Must be made of Styrofoam.

647
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,478
No, no! No, no, no, please, please,
it can't end like this!

648
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,606
Stop worrying, cat!
I'll get us out of here.

649
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,985
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

650
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,447
And no heat vision.

651
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,074
Listen to me, okay?

652
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:09,119
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

653
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,414
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

654
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:17,127
The ones that look like you, Bolt.
But the rest of us never come back out.

655
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,047
I said I'll get us out of here, all right?

656
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,016
My hero.

657
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:50,035
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

658
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,956
I've been expecting your call.

659
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,660
Would you give it up already?

660
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:34,872
You're liquefying
whatever brains you have left.

661
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:41,503
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

662
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,097
I did it! I'm back!

663
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,434
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

664
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,603
Fully awesome!

665
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,607
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

666
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,776
Rhino? What are you doing here?

667
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,529
Nothing.
I was enjoying an evening stroll

668
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,700
and thought I'd just pop the hatch
on that containment unit.

669
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,120
You opened the door?

670
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,955
Yes, I did!

671
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:23,378
That's great, Rhino.
Yeah, that's really good.

672
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,632
All right. Let's go get the prisoner back.

673
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:44,316
I can't do it.

674
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,987
What did you say?

675
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,781
I can't.

676
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,991
Who are you?

677
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:55,244
Rhino, you just don't under...

678
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,829
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

679
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,916
Who singlehandedly destroyed
the Green-Eyed Mars undersea labs?

680
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,084
Me, but...

681
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:07,339
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

682
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,008
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

683
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,095
You! You can, Bolt,

684
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,180
because all over this planet,

685
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,267
there are animals
who feel like they can't.

686
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:24,940
Like a little hamster who once spent
his days in an RV park,

687
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:29,528
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

688
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:35,784
and be told, "You did it.
You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."

689
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,620
They need a hero, Bolt.

690
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,874
Someone who, no matter
what the odds, will do what's right.

691
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,296
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

692
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,842
can become possible
if you're awesome!

693
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,805
Well,
you're right about one thing, Rhino.

694
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,683
Mittens does need a hero,

695
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,228
and I guess I'll have to do.

696
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:08,233
Such modesty!
Now, who's going to save that cat?

697
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,319
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

698
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,486
Me.

699
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,657
I'll get my ball.

700
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,716
Over there.

701
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:36,928
There it is.

702
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:46,938
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

703
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,275
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

704
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,612
We're gonna have to do things
a little differently.

705
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,366
Stealth mode.

706
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,205
Good night, Ester.

707
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,915
Good night, Lloyd.

708
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,714
Lloyd?

709
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,053
Lloyd Spoon,
you jump out and scare me,

710
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,806
and I'm gonna pepper-spray you again!

711
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,813
I swear, it's like I work with toddlers.

712
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,069
Threat nullified.

713
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,242
I feel alive.

714
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,165
There's a guard.

715
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,834
I'll snap his neck.

716
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,586
We need to get him away
from that door.

717
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,430
- Ball?
- Ball?

718
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,350
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

719
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,273
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

720
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,036
Mittens?

721
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:30,459
Bolt? What are you doing here?

722
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,377
I'm busting you out.

723
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,882
You... You came all the way back here
for me?

724
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,133
Yeah.

725
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,303
But how'd you... I mean,
you don't have any superpowers.

726
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,971
- I know.
- Really?

727
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:46,183
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

728
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,728
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

729
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,688
- No.
- Me neither.

730
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:58,653
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?

731
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,281
Hey, wait.
Where'd you get that hamster?

732
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,116
Give it. Give it.

733
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:05,410
Hey, wait!

734
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,204
Initiating escape.

735
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,043
What the... Hey!

736
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,921
Lloyd! Block the door!

737
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,923
Block the door, block the door,
block the door!

738
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,966
Superbark. Superbark!

739
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:48,537
Sweet Sister Frances!
What did you do to my new truck?

740
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,622
You hold on right there!

741
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,749
Golly, Ester!

742
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,795
Both you boys need serious help!

743
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,046
Spicy eyes!

744
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,134
We need a ride.

745
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,096
I've got a big one. You're welcome.

746
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,989
I can't believe it.

747
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:28,159
My whole life I've wanted to see
a real live superbark.

748
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,998
You are legendary.

749
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,179
Mittens? Lf...

750
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,642
If I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

751
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,312
I mean, what...

752
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,108
Don't worry about it.

753
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:04,321
Being a regular dog is, like,
the greatest gig in the world. Okay?

754
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,699
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

755
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,118
A little-known cat secret.

756
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:11,953
You know why we hate dogs?

757
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,206
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

758
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,294
But what do dogs do?

759
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,047
Slobber, sleep,
chase tails, chew shoes.

760
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,466
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

761
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,218
You know,
most dogs live in a place like this,

762
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,221
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

763
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,891
Out of this? But... But...

764
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,893
And this is your dog bowl.

765
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,979
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

766
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,315
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

767
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,691
How cool is that?

768
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,363
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

769
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,574
It doesn't get better than that.

770
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,161
You... You seem to know a lot
about these places.

771
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,330
Yeah, I did my time in one of these,

772
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,666
but I'm more of an alley cat at heart,
you know?

773
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,919
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

774
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:08,301
Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome!

775
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,804
He's... He's beyond awesome!

776
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,807
He... He's be-awesome!

777
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,059
He's...

778
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,938
I... I am be-awesome.

779
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:30,907
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece de résistance.

780
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,536
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

781
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,454
- Why?
- Just do it.

782
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,130
This... This is awesome!

783
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,758
And stick your tongue out.

784
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,307
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

785
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,018
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

786
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,530
I have got so much to give

787
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,367
I swear I do

788
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,663
I may not have nine lives

789
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:22,667
But this one feels brand-new

790
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:27,338
Yes, I've lived a good one

791
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:31,634
I have tried to be true

792
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:36,347
There are some things I never realized

793
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,559
Till I met you

794
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:46,983
How the wind feels on my cheeks

795
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:55,033
When I'm barking at the moon

796
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:01,748
There is no home
like the one you've got

797
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:06,669
'Cause that home belongs to you

798
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,842
Here I come

799
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,013
Back to you

800
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:21,434
There is no home
like the one you've got

801
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,688
'Cause that home belongs to you

802
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:30,902
Well, I was in trouble bad

803
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:34,447
I was so confused

804
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:38,785
I may not see in color, babe

805
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:43,373
But I sure can feel blue

806
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:47,961
I have been a lot of things

807
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,464
They may not all be true

808
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:56,886
My experience was so mysterious

809
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:00,056
Till I met you

810
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:07,105
Now the sun will rise in the east

811
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:15,446
But I'm barking at the moon

812
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:21,911
There is no home
like the one you've got

813
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:26,416
'Cause that home belongs to you

814
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,006
Here I come

815
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,926
Back to you

816
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:41,306
There is no home
like the one you've got

817
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:45,602
'Cause that home belongs to you

818
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:49,939
There is no home
like the one you've got

819
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:54,193
'Cause that home belongs to you

820
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:00,867
There is no home
like the one you've got

821
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:07,749
'Cause that home belongs to you

822
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,177
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

823
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,431
Come on. I've got a surprise for you.

824
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:30,188
Okay, okay. No peeking.
All right, now, open them.

825
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,110
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

826
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,947
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

827
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:43,868
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

828
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:45,620
Mittens, I...

829
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,956
I found this really soft pillow thing
for you.

830
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,292
And get this. I found some Styrofoam,
and I stuffed it inside,

831
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,211
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

832
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,295
You know what I mean?

833
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,713
Mittens, I don't think that...

834
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:01,135
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

835
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,470
Yeah, well, I don't think that I...

836
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:04,639
Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof.

837
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,642
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

838
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,145
What?

839
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,731
We're one waffle away from Penny.

840
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,402
You're still going back to her?

841
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,738
Mittens, she's my person.

842
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,910
Ear, ear.

843
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,958
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

844
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,419
Now, how about this? Is that real?

845
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:39,340
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

846
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:43,886
How about that, Bolt? She's an actress.

847
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,514
She's just pretending.

848
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,182
Not Penny.

849
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:52,103
There is no Penny. She's fake.

850
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:53,980
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

851
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:57,358
No, no, Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?

852
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,862
They act like they love you.
They act like they'll be there forever,

853
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,948
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

854
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,200
and take their love with them,

855
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,871
and leave their declawed cat behind
to fend for herself!

856
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:21,799
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

857
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,720
I...

858
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,974
I'm sorry, Mittens,

859
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:34,103
but Penny is different.

860
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,066
Then go.

861
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,904
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

862
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,282
I never should've taken pity on you.

863
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,994
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

864
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,005
You take care, Mittens.

865
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,629
That meat lover's pizza
is not loving me back at all.

866
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:44,841
Hey there, Rhino.

867
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,509
Morning, cat.

868
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,303
Where's Bolt?

869
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,055
He's...

870
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,392
He's gone.

871
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,227
Bolt left?

872
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:01,149
Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you

873
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:05,778
that he had to face
the Green-Eyed Man alone.

874
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:13,244
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

875
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,663
But he doesn't need us anymore.

876
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,625
Trust me,
I've seen it a million times before.

877
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,836
In the cold, dark night before the battle,

878
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,340
when the steely fangs of evil
are sharpened and poised to strike,

879
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,927
the hero must go
and face his greatest challenge alone.

880
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,514
But if Bolt's taught me anything,

881
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,393
it's that you never abandon a friend
in a time of need.

882
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,063
When your teammate's in trouble,
you go.

883
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,941
Whether they ask or not, you go,

884
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,068
not knowing if you're coming back
dead or alive...

885
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,237
He went the other way.

886
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,363
You go!

887
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:53,492
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to pierce your hide, you go.

888
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,517
Penny.

889
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:24,982
No way. Wow. Bolt.
I'm a really big fan of yours, brother.

890
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,734
I'm Blake.
This is my writing partner, Tom.

891
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:28,236
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

892
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,862
- Wow!
- Oh, no.

893
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,906
And this is our personal assistant, Billy,

894
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,741
who was supposed
to wait up on the wire.

895
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:35,284
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

896
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,827
and there's something
I've always wanted to tell you

897
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,246
if I ever got a chance to meet you,
and now it's...

898
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,081
Okay, Billy, that was horrifying,
what you just did.

899
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,249
Why don't you make yourself useful.

900
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,417
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

901
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,419
Whole wheat is not the same thing
as whole grain, Billy!

902
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,255
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

903
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,631
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

904
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,008
Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going.

905
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,219
I know. I know you're a busy dog,
but if you've got a second,

906
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:55,012
we'd love to pitch you an idea
for your show.

907
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,348
Tom's better at pitching.
I'll let him take it from here.

908
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:59,433
Tommy's got the spotlight.

909
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:03,688
Wait for it.

910
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,817
- Aliens.
- Snap!

911
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,987
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

912
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,364
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

913
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,157
You can't touch us.

914
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,328
I love it. But I'll tell you what.

915
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:23,624
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

916
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:27,962
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

917
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,130
We got a nibble.

918
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,300
Don't freak out.
This is how you blew it with Nemo.

919
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,886
We open, exterior, outer space,
late morning...

920
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,056
...a fiery comet to reveal Penny...

921
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:41,726
...faced by a man-eating squid!

922
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:54,321
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

923
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,823
we fade to black.

924
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,242
And we have a great pop song
for the end credits.

925
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,828
Talk to your people.
We're ready to move on this.

926
01:15:00,912 --> 01:15:02,538
He's so on board!

927
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,757
There it is!

928
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,263
The most terrifying place on Earth.

929
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:35,696
Hello. How are you doing today?

930
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,032
Hi. I'm here to see Joe Mateo.

931
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:44,538
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

932
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,542
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

933
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,127
Rhino! Hold up!

934
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:53,047
Hold up!

935
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,883
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

936
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:01,430
Listen, this may be really hard for you
to understand,

937
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,517
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

938
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,353
I mean, sometimes, sometimes
you think something's really real

939
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,854
and it's not. And sometimes...

940
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,316
All of my training has prepared me
for this moment.

941
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,609
This is complicated.

942
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:15,694
Die! Die!

943
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,699
Prepare yourself, foul man-beast,

944
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,702
for I will beat your pancreas
with your spleen,

945
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,747
and then I will rip your liver
out of your...

946
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,544
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

947
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,755
I had a hamsterjust like you
when I was a kid.

948
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,424
His name was Mr. Sparkles.

949
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,037
Bolt?

950
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:10,749
Bolt! You're okay!

951
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,128
You came back.

952
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,639
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

953
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:40,571
You're my good boy.

954
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:07,222
Good boy.

955
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:11,143
Okay, people. Let's move it
to stage seven and do it for real.

956
01:18:18,818 --> 01:18:19,985
I miss him.

957
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:23,614
I know, honey. I do, too.

958
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,953
First positions, please.

959
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:42,383
Okay, hold still for me, sweetie.

960
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,105
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

961
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,816
And action.

962
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:15,124
Professor, I'd like to thank you
for granting us access

963
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:19,378
to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

964
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:22,089
You know I'd never do such a thing.

965
01:19:22,173 --> 01:19:28,887
Unless it was the only way
to save your little girl's life!

966
01:19:28,888 --> 01:19:29,888
Penny!

967
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,308
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

968
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:37,229
Your dog is nowhere near...

969
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,068
Get that dog!

970
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,702
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy. Come here.

971
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,045
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

972
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,053
Hey, Wags.

973
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,807
Mittens? What are you doing here?

974
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,100
Long story short,

975
01:20:15,226 --> 01:20:19,104
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

976
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,856
But that is not important now.

977
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:24,526
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

978
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,237
And why aren't you in there?

979
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,657
You were right about her, Mittens.

980
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:35,621
She... Well, it wasrt real.

981
01:20:35,955 --> 01:20:39,458
No, Bolt. It is real.
I was in there just now.

982
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:43,295
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenearted.

983
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,966
She doesn't wantjust any dog.
She loves you.

984
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:54,431
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

985
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,646
Bolt, you're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

986
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,689
Mittens, be quiet.

987
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,108
No. You need to hear this.

988
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,276
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

989
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,029
What is it?

990
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:11,824
Penny.

991
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:15,160
Help! Please, help! Help!

992
01:21:15,286 --> 01:21:16,495
Hold on!

993
01:21:17,997 --> 01:21:19,790
Please! Help!

994
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,723
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

995
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,851
Yeah. You better run.

996
01:21:42,313 --> 01:21:43,605
I'm on your six.

997
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,731
What do we do?

998
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,651
Just make sure
I get inside that building.

999
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,071
Bolt?

1000
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:54,741
Is anyone still in there?

1001
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,368
I don't know.

1002
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:04,376
Coming through.

1003
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:07,504
It's a good day to die!

1004
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,548
Not on my watch, rodent.

1005
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:39,870
Bolt!

1006
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,802
I knew you'd come back.

1007
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,409
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

1008
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,196
Bolt.

1009
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,451
Bolt, just go on out.

1010
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:04,621
Go.

1011
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,166
It'll be okay.

1012
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:18,719
You're my good boy.

1013
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:21,805
I love you.

1014
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:35,652
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

1015
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,975
Hey, did you hear that?

1016
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,101
- Yeah.
- What is that?

1017
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,228
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

1018
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:19,529
It's the superbark!

1019
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,283
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

1020
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,410
Come on, let's go!

1021
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,301
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

1022
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:49,226
All right, we got an RT coming through,
people. Make a hole!

1023
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,105
For your own safety,
keep moving away from the building.

1024
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,613
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

1025
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:06,743
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

1026
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:11,123
She's stable, but we're gonna take her
to the hospital just to be safe.

1027
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,092
I'm so sorry this happened.

1028
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,302
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

1029
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,014
No mother should ever have to go
through something like this,

1030
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:33,687
but I promise you
we're going to make this work for us.

1031
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:38,150
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

1032
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,193
This is so great!

1033
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,991
We quit.

1034
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:49,369
No, no! Wait!
Let's not make any rash decisions.

1035
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,122
Let's put a pin in it.

1036
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:07,262
I'm afraid your injuries
were more severe

1037
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:09,764
than we had previously thought,
my dear.

1038
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:13,393
We had to completely reconstruct
your face.

1039
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:17,314
Have a look.

1040
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:24,821
Well, at least Calico
won't be able to recognize me.

1041
01:27:29,368 --> 01:27:30,660
Calico!

1042
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,090
Bolt!

1043
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,404
Aliens.

1044
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,286
That is totally unrealistic.

1045
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,289
Absolutely ridonculous.

1046
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:19,709
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

1047
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,713
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

1048
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,475
Hey, silly doggy.

1049
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:44,901
That's a keeper.
You wanna go play outside?

1050
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:48,071
You wanna go play outside? Let's go!

1051
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:03,336
Does that dog look familiar?

1052
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:07,299
Nope.
I never seen him before in my life.

1053
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,639
Come on.

1054
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,016
There is no home

1055
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,976
Bolt! Come on, buddy!

1056
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:22,355
Like the one you've got

1057
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:29,279
'Cause that home belongs to you

1058
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,678
Nobody listens to me

1059
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:55,972
Don't hear a single thing I've said

1060
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,350
Say anything to soothe me

1061
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,769
Anything to get you from my head

1062
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,687
Don't know how I really feel

1063
01:30:02,813 --> 01:30:05,440
The faith it takes
to make like I don't care

1064
01:30:05,524 --> 01:30:07,233
Don't know how much it hurts

1065
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:09,778
To turn around
like you were never there

1066
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:13,323
Like somehow you could be replaced

1067
01:30:14,825 --> 01:30:18,828
And I could walk away
from the promises we made

1068
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,706
And swore we'd never break

1069
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:23,249
- I thought I lost you
- I thought I lost you

1070
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:26,211
When you ran away to try to find me

1071
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:30,924
I thought I'd never see
your sweet face again

1072
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:35,470
I turned around and you were gone
And on and on the days went

1073
01:30:35,554 --> 01:30:40,058
But I kept the moments that we were in

1074
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:43,895
'Cause I hoped in my heart
you'd come back to me, my friend

1075
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:46,398
And now I got you

1076
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,528
But I thought I lost you

1077
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:56,741
I felt so empty out there

1078
01:30:56,867 --> 01:30:58,910
And there were days I had my doubts

1079
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:01,079
But I knew I'd find you somewhere

1080
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:03,748
'Cause I knew I couldn't live without

1081
01:31:03,874 --> 01:31:06,876
You in my life for one more day

1082
01:31:08,295 --> 01:31:10,422
And I swore I'd never break those

1083
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,007
- Promises we made
- Promises we made

1084
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:17,595
I thought I lost you
When you ran away to try to find me

1085
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:22,100
I thought I'd never see
your sweet face again

1086
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:26,771
I turned around and you were gone
And on and on the days went

1087
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:31,401
But I kept the moments that we were in

1088
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:35,196
'Cause I hoped in my heart
you'd come back to me, my friend

1089
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,490
And now I got you

1090
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,662
But I thought I lost you

1091
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,333
I told myself I wouldn't sleep

1092
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:51,504
Till I'd searched the world
from sea to sea

1093
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:59,095
I made a wish upon a star
I turned around and there you were

1094
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:02,432
- Now here we are
- Now here we are

1095
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:06,644
Here we are

1096
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:07,854
I thought I lost you

1097
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:10,523
I thought I lost you, too

1098
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:14,402
I thought I lost you

1099
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:15,987
Yeah

1100
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:20,658
I thought I lost you
When you ran away to try to find me

1101
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:25,163
I thought I'd never see
your sweet face again

1102
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:29,834
I turned around and you were gone
And on and on the days went

1103
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,380
But I kept the moments that we were in

1104
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:38,176
And I knew in my heart
you'd come back to me, my friend

1105
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,553
And now I got you

1106
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:48,520
But I thought I lost you

1107
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:51,314
I thought I lost you, too

1108
01:32:52,191 --> 01:32:55,819
So glad I got you, got you

1109
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,865
So glad I got you
Yeah, yeah

1110
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:09,541
- I thought I lost you
- I thought I lost you, too
