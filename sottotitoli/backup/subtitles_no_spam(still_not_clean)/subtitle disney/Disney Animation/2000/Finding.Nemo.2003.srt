1
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,305
MALE FISH: Wow.
FEMALE FISH: Mmm.

2
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,600
- Wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
- Wow.
- Yes, Marlin.

4
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,022
I see it. It's beautiful.

5
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,817
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,612
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,574
Oh, yeah!

8
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,744
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

9
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,247
- My man delivered.
- It wasn't so easy.

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,208
A lot of clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,962
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

12
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,299
You did good
and the neighborhood is awesome.

13
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,968
(LAUGHTER OF YOUNG FISH)

14
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:45,772
- So you do like it, don't you?
- No, no, I really do like it.

15
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,817
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,819
great schools, amazing view,

17
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,447
but do we really need so much space?

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,033
Coral, honey,
these are our kids we're talking about.

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,242
They deserve the best.

20
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,622
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

21
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,832
- right by their bedroom window!
- Shh!

22
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,502
- You're going to wake the kids.
- Oh, right. Right.

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,466
Aw, look.

24
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,886
They're dreaming.

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,307
- We still have to name them.
- All of them? Right now?

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,560
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,771
And this half Coral Jr.

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,315
- Okay, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

29
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,816
Nemo?

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,695
We'll name one Nemo,
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

31
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,698
In a couple of days,
we're going to be parents!

32
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,908
Yeah.

33
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,578
- What if they don't like me?
- Marlin...

34
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,330
There's over 400 eggs.

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,583
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,921
What?

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,341
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

38
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,634
Well, I remember.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,553
Excuse me, miss.
Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

40
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,847
- Marlin.
- Look closer.

41
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,142
- CORAL: (LAUGHS) Get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here!

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,438
Where did everybody go?

43
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,030
Coral, get inside the house.

44
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,993
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

45
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,745
You. Right now.

46
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,749
No!

47
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,472
(MARLIN GROANS)

48
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,019
Coral!

49
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,610
Coral?

50
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,322
Coral?

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,201
(GASPS)

52
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,497
Coral!

53
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,376
Coral!

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,467
Coral?

55
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,617
There, there.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,660
It's okay. Daddy's here.

57
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,872
Daddy's got you.

58
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,130
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

59
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,506
Nemo.

60
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,921
First day of school! Wake up!
Come on. First day of school.

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,218
I don't want to go to school.

62
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,094
- Not you, Dad. Me.
- Okay.

63
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,180
Get up! Time for school!

64
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,768
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
- Oh, boy!

65
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,977
Nemo!

66
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,813
- First day of school!
- Don't move.

67
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:58,400
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

68
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,319
- You feel a break?
- No.

69
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

70
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,367
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?

71
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,369
- Answer the question.
- Three.

72
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,830
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

73
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,791
Three. That's all I have?

74
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,876
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,212
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

76
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,133
Sure you want to go to school this year?

77
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,929
- You can wait five or six years.
- Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

78
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,223
- Forgot to brush.
- (SIGHS)

79
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,767
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

80
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,310
- Yes.
- Brush.

81
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,896
- I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

82
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,856
- Where?
- There.

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,317
Right there. And here and here.

84
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,540
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

85
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,834
What do we have to remember
about the ocean?

86
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,420
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

87
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:04,300
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

88
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,593
Then we go out and back in.

89
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,596
Then one more time. Out and back in.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,349
- If you want to do it four times...
- Dad...

91
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,351
All right. Come on, boy.

92
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,690
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

93
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,401
- I doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

94
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,154
- No, and I don't plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?

95
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,448
Sea turtles? I don't know.

96
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,950
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

97
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:34,204
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

98
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:38,834
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him,
after I'm done talking to the shark.

99
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,961
Hold on. Wait to cross.

100
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,590
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

101
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,926
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

102
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,554
That snail was about to charge.

103
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,474
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

104
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,685
- Bye, Mom.
- I'll pick you up after school.

105
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,482
Come on, you guys.
Stop it. Give it back.

106
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,568
Come on. We'll try over there.

107
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,572
Excuse me.
Is this where we meet his teacher?

108
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,159
- Look who's out of the anemone.
- Yes, shocking, I know.

109
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,619
- Marty?
- Marlin.

110
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,661
- Bob.
- Ted.

111
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,747
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

112
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,625
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

113
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,002
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

114
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:26,298
That's a misconception. Clownfish are
no funnier than any other fish.

115
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,842
- Come on, Clowny.
- Do something funny.

116
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,178
All right. I know one joke.

117
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:35,307
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

118
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,101
Well, he swims up.

119
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,021
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

120
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,523
And then the sea cucumber...

121
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,819
I'm mixed up. There was
a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

122
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,737
None of them were walking...

123
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,949
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr. Johanssen's yard now!

124
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,035
All right, you kids!

125
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,162
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

126
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,623
Can I go play, too? Can I?

127
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,459
I would feel better if you go play
over on the sponge beds.

128
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,964
- (MOTHER GASPS)
- (BABY CRIES)

129
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,924
That's where I would play.

130
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,012
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

131
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,558
- Hey, what did I do?
- Be nice. It's his first time at school.

132
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,144
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

133
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,270
Dad...

134
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,107
See this tentacle?
It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

135
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,570
But you can't really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.

136
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,655
I'm H2O intolerant.

137
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,158
I'm obnoxious.

- Okay.
- You live in what kind of home?

Anemonemenemone.

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,466
We're going to stay together.

159
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,177
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

- Bye, Dad.

They're going to the Drop Off?

169
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,456
Are you insane?

170
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,417
Why don't we fry them up now

Sandy Plankton saw one.

Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

201
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,355

I'm going to go touch the butt.

Good thing I was here.

212
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,879
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

213
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,507
- I wasn't.
- This does not concern you.

You can't swim well.

- I can swim fine, Dad, okay?
- No. It's not okay.

216

You shouldn't be near here.

Wait a minute. What is going on?

302
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,887
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

It's all right. I understand.

(LAUGHS)

322
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:24,330
So, what's a couple of bites like you
doing out so late?

323
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,374
Nothing. We're not even out.

324
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,709
Great.

325
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,297
Then how would you morsels like to
come to a little get-together I'm having?

326
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,593
- You mean like a party?
- Yeah, right. A party.

327
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,846
- What do you say?
- I love parties. That sounds like fun.

328
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,516
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,019
Come on. I insist.

330
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,605
Okay. That's all that matters.

331
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,402
DORY: Look. Balloons. It is a party.

332
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:59,407
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

333
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,242
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

334
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,884
Anchor! Chum!

335
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,720
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

336
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,598
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

337
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,559
We've gone through the snacks
and I'm starving.

338
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,770
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

339
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,480

340

341
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,069
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

342
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,779
Let us all say the pledge.

343
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,739
ALL: I am a nice shark,

344
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,200
not a mindless eating machine.

345
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,955
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

346
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,707
Fish are friends, not food.

347
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,417
Except stinking dolphins.

348
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,379
Dolphins!
Yeah, they think they're so cute.

349
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,591
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin.
Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

350
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,220
Today's meeting is step five:
Bring a Fish Friend.

351
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,514
- Do you all have your friends?
- Got mine.

352
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,018
DORY: Hey there!
BRUCE: How about you, Chum?

353
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,814
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

354
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,524
friend.

355
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,568
BRUCE: It's all right, Chum.

356
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,571
Help yourself to one of my friends.

357
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,116
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

358
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,828
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

359
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,121
Hello, Bruce.

360
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,416
It has been three weeks
since my last fish, on my honor,

361
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,793
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

362
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,671
- You're an inspiration to us.
- Amen.

363
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,633
- Right, then. Who's next?
- Pick me. Pick me.

364
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,552
- The little sheila down the front.
- Whoo!

365
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,888
Come on up here.

366
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,557
Hi. I'm Dory.

367
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,184
Hello, Dory.

368
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,604
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

369
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,733
- Hey, that's incredible.
- Good on you, mate!

370
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,818
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

371
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:03,114
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

372
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,533
Me? I don't have a problem.

373
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,077
- Okay.
- ALL: Denial.

374
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,455
Just start with your name.

375
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,790
Okay. Hello.

376
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,919
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

377
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,505
- A clownfish? Really?
- Go on. Tell us a joke.

378
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,757
I love jokes.

379
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,052
I actually do know
one that's pretty good.

380
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,556
There was this mollusk
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

381
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,060
Normally they don't talk,
but in a joke, everyone talks.

382
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,146
The sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

383
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,942
Daddy!

384
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,568
Nemo!

385
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,779
Nemo! (LAUGHS)

386
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,865
- I don't get it.
- For a clownfish he's not that funny.

387
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:50,411
No, he's my son.
He was taken by these divers.

388
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,956
You poor fish.

389
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,334
- Humans. Think they own everything.
- Probably American.

390
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,463
(TEARFULLY) There is a father
looking for his little boy.

391
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,590
MARLIN:
What do these markings mean?

392
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:06,552
- (SOBS) I never knew my father.
- Come here.

393
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,763
- We're all mates here.
- I can't read human.

394
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,933
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

395
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,352
- Guys.
- No, Dory.

396
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,813
- That's mine. Give it back.
- Cut it out.

397
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,566
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

398
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,486
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

399
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,490
Dory, are you oka... (SNIFFS)

400
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,075
Oh!

401
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,661
That's good.

402
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,538
Intervention!

403
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,250
- Just a bite.
- You hold it together, mate.

404
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,169
- Fish are friends, not food.
- Food!

405
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,755
Dory, look out.

406
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,717
I'm having fish tonight.

407
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,093
Remember the steps, mate.

408
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,142
Just one bite.

409
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,731
G'day.

410
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,029
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way to escape.

411
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,992
- Who is it?
- Help me find a way out.

412
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,870
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

413
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,373
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way out.

414
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:21,627
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé."
I wonder what that means.

415
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,796
- It's spelled just like the word "escape."
- Let's go.

416
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,966
Here's Brucie!

417
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:31,095
- Wait a minute. You can read?
- I can read? That's right!

418
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,680
Then here. Read this now.

419
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,685
He doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

420
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,812
Don't fall off the wagon.

421
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,360
Oh, no! It's blocked.

422
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,032
No, Bruce!

423
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,576
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

424
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,828
He's really... A nice guy.

425
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,497
I need to get that mask.

426
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,040
You want that mask? Okay.

427
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,501
No, no, no, no!

428
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,128
Quick. Grab the mask.

429
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,177
Oh, no. Bruce.

430
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,428
What?

431
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,350
Swim away!

432
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,851
DORY: Is the party over?

433
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:19,936
(PING)

434
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,029
Nice.

435
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,992
Dad!

436
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,038
Daddy?

437
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,229
SHERMAN: Barbara.

438
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,106
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

439
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,609
- And I'll need more cotton rolls.
- All right.

440
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,738
Hello, little fella.

441
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,158
Beauty, isn't he?

442
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,744
I found that guy struggling for life
and I saved him.

443
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,372
- Has that Novocain kicked in yet?
- (PATIENT GABBLES)

444
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,377
Bubbles!

445
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,884
- My bubbles.
- He likes bubbles.

446
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,511
(FRIGHTENED CRIES)

447
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,892
(WHIMPERS)

448
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,354
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
- Aagghh!

449
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,942
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

450
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,236
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

451
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,572
Do you know where my dad is?

452
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,283
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

453
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,701
Pet store?

454
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,913
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.

455
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,414
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.

456
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,749
EBay.

457
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,293
- Which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

458
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,671
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aagghh!

459
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,008
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

460
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,426
- Clean him!
<i>- Oui.</i>

461
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,554
- Ocean.
<i>- La mer.</i>

462
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,892
<i>Voilà.</i> He is clean.

463
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:29,023
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

464
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,859
Uh... Big and blue?

465
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:32,985
I knew it.

466
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:36,489
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

467
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,160
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

468
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,330
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

469
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,498
(MUFFLED CALL)

470
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,543
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

471
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,002
- Yes!
- Boy, oh, boy.

472
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,255
- What have we got?
- Root canal.

473
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,589
It's not going to be pretty.

474
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,341
Aagghh!

475
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,842
- Clamp installed?
- Yup.

476
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,346
- What did he use to open?
- Glidden drill. He favors that one.

477
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,349
I can't see, Flo.

478
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,518
(MUMBLES) Agh!

479
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,187
- Schilder Technique.
- That's a Hedstrom file.

480
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,731
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

481
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,818
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

482
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,571
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

483
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,739
There I go. Little help. Over here.

484
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll go deflate him.

485
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:21,909
Pffft!

486
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,912
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

487
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,291
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

488
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,753
- Nigel.
- What did I miss?

489
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,840
- Root canal. A doozy.
- What did he use to open?

490
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,592
- Glidden drill.
- He favors it.

491
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,845
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

492
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,889
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

493
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,559
- The dentist took him off the reef.
- An outie.

494
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,395
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

495
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,731
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

496
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:56,193
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

497
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,199
The picture broke.
This here's Darla. She's my niece.

498
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,326
Going to be eight this week.

499
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,579
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

500
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,081
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

501
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,958
You're her present.

502
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,044
Shh! It's our little secret.

503
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,420
Well, Mr. Tucker,

504
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,840
while that sets up, I'm going to
go see a man about a wallaby.

505
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,593
Uh-oh. Darla!

506
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,347
- What's wrong with her?
- She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

507
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,893
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

508
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,687
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

509
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,232
She's a fish killer.

510
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:39,820
I can't go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.

511
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,200
- Daddy! Help me!
- He's stuck.

512
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,207
Nobody touch him.

513
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,464
Can you help me?

514
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,884
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

515
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,720
- Gill...

00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,043
Why do I have to tell you again?

689
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,629
- I don't get tired of it.
- All right, here's the thing.

690
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,926
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

691
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,388
- By myself.
- Okay.

692
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,015
You know. Alone.

693
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:20,020
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

694
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,191
- Huh?
- I don't want to hurt your feelings.

695
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,985
- You want me to leave?
- Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

696
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,654
I just can't afford any more delays.

697
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,616
You're one of
those fish that cause delays.

698
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,744
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

699
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,288
- They're delay fish.
- You mean...

700
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,626
- You mean you don't like me?
- Of course I like you.

701
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,170
Because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

702
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,422
It's a complicated emotion.

703
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,259
Don't cry. I like you.

704
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,469
Hey, you!

705
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,555
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

706
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,559
- I don't remember. Were you?
- No, no. We're just...

707
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,520
Do you guys know how I can get...

708
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,315
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

709
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:06,900
Mmm-hmm.

710
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,903
Okay.
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

711
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,696
What are we? Take a guess.

712
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,825
- DORY: I've seen one of those.
- I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

713
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,868
- Wait.
- It's a swordfish.

714
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,538
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

715
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,540
Where's the butter?

716
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,875
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Lobster.

717
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,377
- Saw that.
- What?

718
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,504
- Lots of legs.
- DORY: Clam?

719
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,797
Close enough.

720
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,341
♪ <i>It's a whale of a tale
I'll tell you, lad</i> ♪

721
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,677
- They're good.
- Somebody give me directions?

722
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:37,556
- "Would somebody give me directions?"
- (DORY LAUGHS)

723
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,975
- I'm serious.
- Blah, blah, me, me.

724
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,518
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

725
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,186
Thank you.

726
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,480
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

727
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,400
What's the matter?

728
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,610
While they're doing impressions,

729
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,237
I am miles from home

730
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,364
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

731
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:57,200
- I bet that's frustrating.
- My son is out there.

732
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,202
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo.

733
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:02,914
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

734
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,666
I'm helping you.

735
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,336
Wait right here.

736
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,756
- Guys.
- Is he bothering you again?

737
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,425
No, he's a good guy.

738
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,886
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

739
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,472
Heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

740
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,932
Sydney? Oh, sure.

741
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,935
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

742
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,397
- Sure do.
- Hey, they know Sydney!

743
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:31,109
- You wouldn't know how to get there?
- Follow the EAC.

744
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,778
That's East Australian Current.

745
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,948
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

746
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,492
that direction.

747
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,119
Then you got to follow that for about...

748
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:43,955
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

749
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,125
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

750
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,710
MARLIN: Great! That's great!

751
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,837
- Dory, you did it.
- Oh, please.

752
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,131
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

753
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,467
- Fellas, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

754
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,011
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

755
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,181
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

756
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,849
- Ma'am. One more thing.
- Yes?

757
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:06,561
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

758
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,731
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

759
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,066
Hey!

760
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,778
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

761
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,698
Wait. I've got to tell you something.
Whoa.

762
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,369
Nice trench.

763
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,831
Hello! (ECHO)

764
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:33,004
- Let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

765
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:37,050
- We're going to swim over this thing.
- Little red flag going up.

766
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,178
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

767
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:43,390
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

768
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,268
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

769
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,478
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.

770
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:49,980
Come on. Trust me on this.

771
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,440
- Trust you?
- Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

772
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,943
- Something shiny!
- Where?

773
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,988
- It just swam over the trench. Come on.
- Okay.

774
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:05,954
- Boy, it sure is clear up here.
- Exactly.

775
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,247
And look at that.

776
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,625
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

777
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:14,212
- Hey, little guy.
- You wanted to go through the trench.

778
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:18,717
I shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

779
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,844
Come here, little Squishy.

780
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,304
(BABY TALK)

781
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:23,680
Ow!

782
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,933
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy.

783
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:28,393
Shoo! Get away.

784
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,353
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it.

785
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,897
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

786
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,858
How come it didn't sting you?

787
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,402
It did. Hold still.

788
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:42,741
I live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

789
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,868
You're going to be fine.

790
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:48,246
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

791
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,874
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

792
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:55,503
Don't move.

793
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,633
This is bad, Dory.

794
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,887
- Boing. Boing.
- Dory!

795
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,639
You can't catch me.

796
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,350
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

797
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,268
not sting you!

798
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,688
- The tops don't sting you.
- DORY: Two in a row. Beat that.

799
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,398
Listen to me. I have an idea.

800
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,275
- A game.
- A game?

801
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,027
I love games. Pick me.

802
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,657
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

803
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,283
- Okay!
- Rules.

804
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,869
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

805
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,539
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

806
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,417
Wait!

807
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,544
Go faster if you want to win.

808
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,047
- Dory!
- Boing, boing, boing!

809
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,092
Wait a minute.

810
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:43,593
Whee!

811
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:46,304
So, we're cheating death now.

812
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,973
We're having fun at the same time.

813
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,767
I can do this. Just be careful.

814
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,519
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

815
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,062
I don't think so!

816
00:46:57,357 --> 00:47:00,735
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

817
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,279
- The question is, are you hungry?
- Hungry?

818
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,865
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to
eat my bubbles!

819
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,494
Duck to the left, back
and coming over, right there!

820
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,374
The clownfish is the winner!

821
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,918
We did it. Look at us!

822
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,253
Dory?

823
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,756
Oh, no.

824
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:27,053
Dory! Dory! Dory!

825
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,516
Dory!

826
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,017
(SIZZLING)

827
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:34,978
Aagghh!

828
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,523
DORY: Am I disqualified?

829
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,692
You're doing fine. You're winning.

830
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,528
Stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

831
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,781
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

832
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:48,324
That's it!

833
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,622
Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake.

834
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,917
Stay awake!

835
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,048
- (WEAKLY) Awake...
- P. Sherman...

836
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,260
- Awake...
- 42 Wallaby Way...

837
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,013
- Wake up.
- Sydney.

838
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,139
MARLIN: Nemo...

839
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,698
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

840
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:29,908
Yeah.

841
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,870
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

842
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,122
He's not looking for me.

843
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:38,291
He's scared of the ocean.

844
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,169
Peach? Any movement?

845
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,922
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

846
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,673
Keep on him.

847
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,137
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

848
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,598
- I was aiming for the toilet.
- The toilet?

849
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,559
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

850
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:59,646
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

851
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:04,776
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

852
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,945
The bubbles, the bubbles!

853
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:11,115
Potty break! He just grabbed the
<i>Reader's Digest.</i> We have 4.2 minutes.

854
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,784
That's your cue.

855
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,245
- You can do it, kid.
- We got to be quick.

856
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:19,624
Once you get in, swim to the bottom
and I'll talk you through the rest.

857
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,708
Okay.

858
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,169
- Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.
- (TAKES A DEEP BREATH)

859
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,972
- Nicely done. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

860
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,974
Here comes the pebble.

861
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,692
- Now, do you see a small opening?
- Uh-huh.

862
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,903
Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan.

863
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:53,408
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

864
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,330
Careful, Sharkbait.

865
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,083
- I can't do it.
- This isn't a good idea.

866
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,877
He'll be fine. Try again!

867
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,545
Okay.

868
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:09,299
GILL: That's it, Sharkbait.

869
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,634
Nice and steady.

870
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,098
- I got it, I got it!
- He did it.

871
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,393
That's great, kid.
Now swim up the tube and out.

872
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,954
Oh, no! Gill!

873
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,957
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

874
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,542
- Help him!
- What do we do?

875
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:47,503
- Oh, no!
- Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

876
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,175
- Help me!
- Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

877
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:56,888
No!

878
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,890
- Feed me more.
- That's it!

879
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,100
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

880
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,687
- I got it.
- Pull!

881
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,822
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

882
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:19,661
No. We're done.

883
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:24,123
(WHIMPERS)

884
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,259
CRUSH: Dude?

885
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,887
Dude?

886
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,473
Focus, dude.

887
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,517
Dude?

888
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,812
He lives. Hey, dude.

889
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,021
(MARLIN GROANS)

890
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,526
- What happened?
- I saw the whole thing, dude.

891
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,029
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

892
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:58,324
- Then you were, like, whoa...
- What are you talking about?

893
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:05,289
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

894
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,582
Awesome.

895
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,543
Oh, my stomach.

896
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,422
Man, no hurling on the shell.
I just waxed it.

897
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:16,968
- So, Mr. Turtle...
- Dude, Mr. Turtle is my father.

898
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,553
Name's Crush.

899
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,638
Crush? Really?

900
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,473
Okay, Crush.

901
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,935
Listen, I need to get to
the East Australian Current.

902
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:27,478
EAC?

903
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,105
Dude...

904
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,357
You're riding it, dude.

905
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:33,234
Check it out.

906
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,716
Okay, grab shell, dude.

907
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,010
Grab what?

908
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,521
Righteous! Righteous!

909
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,986
So,

910
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,574
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

911
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,660
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

912
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:26,954
Dory! Is she all right?

913
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,582
Oh, little blue.

914
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:30,833
She is sub-level, dude.

915
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:37,048
Dory, Dory! Dory!

916
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,217
Oh, Dory.

917
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,927
(DORY MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY)

918
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,805
I'm so sorry.

919
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:47,350
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

920
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,436
...twenty-nine, 30!
Ready or not, here I come!

921
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,273
There you are.

922
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,484
Catch me if you can.

923
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,287
Up you go!

924
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:11,999
(LAUGHTER)

925
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,091
Oh, my goodness.

926
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:24,262
Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

927
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,898
Whoa! That was so cool.

928
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:38,776
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

929
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,030
- Did you see what I did?
- You so totally rock, Squirt.

930
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,782
Give me some fin.

931
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:45,950
Noggin.

932
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,368
Dude.

933
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:52,874
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

934
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,419
- Jellies? Sweet.
- Totally.

935
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,714
I must have done
something you all liked, dudes.

936
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,924
- You rock, dude.
- Ow.

937
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:05,011
Curl away, my son.

938
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,971
It's awesome, Jellyman.

939
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,433
When the little dudes are eggs
we leave them on a beach to hatch,

940
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:14,478
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find
their way back to the big ol' blue.

941
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,647
- All by themselves?
- Yeah!

942
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:19,650
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

943
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:23,905
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

944
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,701
(LAUGHTER)

945
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,329
- Hey, look, everybody.
- I know that dude.

946
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,705
It's the Jellyman.

947
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,209
- Well go on. Jump on him.
- Turtle pile!

948
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,002
Wait. Kids!

949
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,962
- You funny?
- Where's your shell?

950
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:42,340
- Do your stripes come off?
- I need to breathe.

951
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,634
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

952
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:47,720
- One at a time.
- Mr. Fish, did you die?

953
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,931
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

954
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:53,517
- So where are you going?
- You see, my son was taken.

955
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,853
My son was taken away from me.

956
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:58,648
- No way!
- What happened?

957
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,692
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

958
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,278
- Come on.
- Please.

959
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,530
Well, okay.

960
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,993
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

961
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:13,329
This is going to be good. I can tell.

962
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:17,541
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

963
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,962
Maybe he wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

964
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,380
I don't know.

965
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,882
He swam in the open water to this boat

966
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:28,427
and these divers appeared
and I tried to stop them.

967
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,389
The boat was too fast,
so we swam out in the ocean...

968
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,640
He couldn't stop them.

969
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,518
Then Nemo's dad,
he swims out to the ocean

970
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,853
and they bump into three sharks.

971
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:40,356
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

972
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,150
- That's amazing.
- Then dives thousands of feet...

973
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:47,405
Straight into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

974
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,949
The only thing
they can see down there is...

975
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:53,744
This big, horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

976
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,329
Then he has to blast his way...

977
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,374
These fish have been
searching the ocean for days

978
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,251
on the East Australian Current.

979
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,378
He may be on his way here right now.

980
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,088
That should put him in
Sydney Harbour...

981
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,548
In a few days.

982
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,591
This guy will stop at nothing...

983
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,469
...stop at nothing until he finds his son.
I hope he makes it.

984
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:13,389
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

985
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,523
Mine. Mine. Mine.

986
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,365
Would you just shut up?

987
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:35,244
- You're rats with wings.
- This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

988
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,998
- He was taken off the reef by divers...
- There. Take it.

989
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,626
Say that again.
You said something about Nemo.

990
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,420
Mine. Mine. Mine.

991
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,422
(GROWLS)

992
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,215
Mine.

993
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,469
Last I heard,
he's heading towards the harbor.

994
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:52,887
Brilliant!

995
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,069
Is he doing okay?

996
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,405
I don't know, but whatever you do,
don't mention D-A-R...

997
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,533
It's okay.
I know who you're talking about.

998
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,085
Gill?

999
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:27,546
Gill?

1000
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:30,257
Hey, Sharkbait.

1001
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,720
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
- GILL: I'm the one who should be sorry.

1002
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:40,226
I was so ready to get out,
so ready to taste that ocean,

1003
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,604
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1004
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:47,108
Nothing should be worth that.

1005
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,945
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1006
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,243
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

1007
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,453
- What the...
- Aaggh!

1008
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:03,124
Well, that's one way
to pull a tooth. (LAUGHS)

1009
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:08,629
Darn kids. Well, good thing
I pulled the right one, eh?

1010
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:09,964
Pssst!

1011
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,174
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

1012
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,969
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1013
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,221
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1014
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,931
I've got to speak with him.

1015
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,059
Your dad's been fighting the ocean
looking for you.

1016
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:24,145
My father? Really?

1017
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,063
He's traveled hundreds of miles.

1018
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:29,358
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish.
- Sharks?

1019
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:32,361
- That can't be him.
- Are you sure? What was his name?

1020
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,447
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

1021
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,115
- Marlin?
- That's it.

1022
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,785
- The clownfish from the reef.
- It's my dad! He took on a shark!

1023
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:42,872
- I heard he took on three.
- Three?

1024
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,249
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1025
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,501
After you were taken by Diver Dan,

1026
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,587
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1027
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,838
Really?

1028
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:54,508
He's giving it all he's got
and then three sharks capture him.

1029
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,386
He blows 'em up
and then dives thousands of feet

1030
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,930
and gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth!

1031
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:02,558
He ties this demon to a rock.
And his reward?

1032
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,019
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

1033
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,230
Now he's with sea turtles
on the East Australian Current

1034
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,775

right now, to Sydney!

- What a good daddy.
- He was looking for you after all.

01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,453
- He's swimming in the filter!
- Not again!

01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,044
- No!
- You've got your life ahead of you.

01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,046
- We'll help you.
- Get him out.

1040
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,346
- Get him out of there.
- Come on. Grab the end.

Yeah, I can hear you.

All right, we have less than
48 hours before Darla gets here.

1049

This tank will get plenty dirty
in that time,

- That's it, dude.

1060
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:42,533
- Of course it is.
- First, find your exit buddy.

- Yes.

you're saying. Say the first thing again.

We can look together.

our newest member got home safely.

Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something.

Love you, Dad.

I love you, too, son.

Sorry.

BARBARA: Mmm-hmm?

1563
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:46,937
I don't understand it.

1564
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,315
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee
and it breaks.

1565

Had to clean the tank myself,
take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

You got it. That's it. You can do it.

01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,960
That's the shortest red light
I've ever seen.
