Are you ready for the hive yet?

00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,898
All I am is ready!

15
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:56,324
How do I look? I mean,
does this log make me look fat?

16
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,663
Like the best honey tree
a little bee will ever see.

17
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,796
Oh, boy!

18
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,811
Rabbit, what are you doing?

19
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:26,272
Can't you tell? I'm lullabying
the bees for our big plan!

20
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,775
They seem to like Beethoven.

21
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:37,450
Eeyore, what are you doing?

22
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,910
I've got to use my big voice
to tell the bees about the new hive.

23
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,171
Buzz, buzz! Great new hive.

24
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:50,962
Tigger, could you tell me
what you're doing?

25
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:54,636
I have to hold the fake hive
high enough for the bees to see.

26
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,800
It's the biggest part of the plan.

27
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,969
That's what Tiggers do best.

28
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:03,137
You do seem bigger than usual.

29
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,314
Hello, Piglet.

30
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,442
What are you all doing?

31
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,028
Harvesting honey, of course.
It's all in the plan.

32
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,782
First, Rabbit will lure the bees
with beautiful music.

33
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:23,120
Then, Eeyore tempts the bees
into their new hive.

34
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:28,298
Then Tigger holds up the hive
for the bees to see.

35
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,920
And then comes the best part.

36
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,715
We get honey from their old hive.

37
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:37,255
Can I help you with your big plan?

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,351
Thank you, Piglet,
but perhaps another time.

39
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,761
When we have a bit smaller of a plan.

40
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,524
Or when you're a bit bigger
of a piglet.

41
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,181
I'm sorry, Piglet.

42
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:51,729
But I'm afraid
this is a very big plan.

43
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,128
Places, everyone.
I've gotten their attention.

44
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,128
Great new hive.

45
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,132
Do the bees know the plan?

46
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,596
Piglet,
don't get in the way of our big plan.

47
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,393
I'm getting kinda itchy
around my knees.

48
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,606
Oh, dear!

49
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,282
Get the little guy!

50
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,841
OK, Rabbit.

51
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,511
We're geniuses!

52
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,555
Sticky geniuses!

53
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:12,233
Oh my! Oh, goodness!

54
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,396
The sweet taste of success.

55
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,066
Our plan worked perfectly.

56
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,152
Didn't think it would work.
But it did.

57
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,416
Congratulations to us all.

58
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:29,126
Hooray for Pooh!

59
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,785
- And Rabbit.
- And Eeyore.

60
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:35,048
- And Tigger, too.
- But I was the...

61
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:39,843
Oh, Piglet, I'm sorry that you
couldn't be part of our big plan.

62
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,842
But I thought I...

63
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,345
For a minute there, I thought
I was going to break out in hives.

64
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,278

I thought Tiggers hated honey.

87
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:02,405
They do, to eat. But to stop the
itching, there is nothing betterer.

88
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,032
Did you hear something? I'm afraid
I've got some honey in my ears.

89
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,407
What's that, Pooh? I can't hear you
over all that buzzing.

90
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,291
Whose buzzing?

91
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,169
Bees!

92
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,463
What say we break for lunch?

93
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:25,050
- What about our honey?
- It's your honey or your life!

94
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,423
- Come on!
- Oh, boy!

95
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:32,306
Oh, bother!

96
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,732
- Oh, joy!
- Thanks, donkey boy!

97
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,613
- Thanks, Eeyore.
- Any time. You're welcome.

98
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,572
Quick! Make a beeline for Piglet's!

99
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,507
Run faster!

100
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,268
Hurry!

101
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:26,692
- They're gone.
- Or maybe just pretendering.

102
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:28,858
Bees are sneaky like that.

103
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,447
I was right.

104
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,205
You got stung out there?

105
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:47,637
No. I got stung right here,
where I can keep an eye on it.

106
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,796
Is everyone all right?

107
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,923
Tigger's here, Eeyore's here,
Pooh is here, I'm here.

108
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,679
Who am I forgetting?

109
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:00,436
I don't know. Let's ask Piglet!

110
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:03,146
- Oh, bother.
- Are you all right, Pooh?

111
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,521
I just landed on my... self.

112
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:09,401
Say, what do we have here?

113
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,704
Oh, please, Tigger!
It's just a drawing in a scrapbook.

114
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,967
But it reminds me of
the bestest family reunion I ever had.

115
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:44,891
Oh, look. There's the day little
Piglet caught his first heffalump.

116
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:48,734
That was no heffalump. That was
just Pooh with a jar on his head.

117
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:52,358
I forgot how much I look like
a heffalump with a jar on my head.

118
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:56,489
He captured Rabbit, all right.

119
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,657
Let me see.

120
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,411
That doesn't look a thing like me.

121
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,415
What's next?

122
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,793
What's that tiny pink dot?

123
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,804
I believe it's Piglet.

124
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,891
Where is Piglet?

125
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,766
We must have lost track of him
after we got chased by the bees.

126
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:25,481
But he's so little.
He could be in big danger.

127
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,937
We have to find him
and make sure he's all right.

128
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,363
But how will we find him?
He could be anywhere.

129
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,941
Think!

130
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,199
You know, since this is
a book of Piglet's memories,

131
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,458
maybe it remembers where Piglet is.

132
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:48,372
Brilliant deduction there, Pooh boy.
It's a regular Piglet map.

133
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,791
That's the silliest thing
I've heard.

134
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:54,005
Let's start with page one.

135
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,966
Page one remembers Owl's house.

136
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:01,935
Way to go, Pooh boy!

137
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,770
Why, I bet that little fella's there
right now. Let's go find him.

138
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,432
Then off to Owl's house we go.

139
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,567
He has an answer for everything.

140
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:14,948
Not to Owl's!
We'll be there all day.

141
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,525
You can never
get a word in edgeways...

142
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,948
Goodbye, honey.

143
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:36,466
I may be small,
but in the biggest, helpfulest way!

144
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:53,276
Eeyore? Where are you?

145
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,736
Tigger? Where are you?

146
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,320
Oh, no! The bees!

147
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,709
What can I do?

148
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,934
Well, I did help you get the haycorn,

149
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,095
and bring you across the river.

150
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:28,265
Maybe my friends need me.

151
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,655
I have to find them.

152
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,113
Owl, have you seen Piglet?

153
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:46,446
Piglet? Of course I've seen Piglet.
Many times!

154
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,460
He's about so high,
with little pink ears...

155
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:53,958
No, we mean now.
Have you seen him this morning?

156
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,047
I can't imagine
that he's changed that much.

157
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,631
This is the part
where Owl goes on for a while.

158
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,183
As a matter of fact,
I just saw him go by.

159
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,311
He was just here?

160
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,517
Come on, let's go.

161
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,521
Or is missing. You could start,
of course, in the obvious place...

162
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:22,990
As I was saying, I have some great
stories about my second cousin.

163
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,783
Rupert stowed away
on a three-masted...

164
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,949
Eeyore! Come on!

165
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,078
As I was saying,
the great expedition...

166
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,580
What an expedition it was!

167
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,501
I told you this was a silly idea.

168
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,671
But he was just at Owl's.

169
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,765
That scrappety book
<i>does</i> know where he's going.

170
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,768
Well, Owl's house was on page one.

171
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,846
How about page two?

172
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:53,687
- Which is a picture of...
- Kanga's house.

173
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,026
Well, then, Kanga's house
is where we'll look for Piglet.

174
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,438
I think you must be right, Rabbit.

175
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,070
Piglet has always liked
visiting Kanga's.

176
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,204
Not always.
There was one time, I remember.

177
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,951
Oh, yes. When Kanga and Roo
first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.

178
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:16,504
- Remember, Rabbit?
- No, I don't seem to recall.

179
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,212
Here, this'll remind your rememberer.

180
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:23,631
- No!
- You came up with a big plan, Rabbit.

181
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,929
I told you, I don't remember.

182
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,093
There it is.

183
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,932
You know, if I remember correctly,

184
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,693
this story is really about Piglet.

185
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:43,315
I just don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

186
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,537
I tell you, we won't be safe
until they're out.

187
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,579
Out of the Hundred Acre Wood.

188
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:55,666
Isn't it a bit early to be spying?

189
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,328
I've never seen anything like it.

190
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,500
It's actually moving in.

191
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,717
Roo, dear.

192
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,602
Here I am, Mama.

193
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:16,563
- It's an invasion!
- Do you think they're fierce?

194
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,229
What does fierce look like?

195
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,237
That's what fierce looks like.
She swallowed him whole.

196
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,994
Oh, dear!

197
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,957
He'll be eaten for sure.

198
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,169
Are you all right?

199
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:50,970
- Don't eat me!
- Why, you must be Piglet.

200
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,805
When Christopher Robin said
you'd be dropping by, I had no idea.

201
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,725
You know Christopher Robin?

202
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:02,728
Oh, yes. He told us all about you
and Pooh and Rabbit and Tigger.

203
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,229
The ones hiding in the tree
over there.

204
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,735
Hello, dears.

205
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,577
Did you hear that?
She called us "dears".

206
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:15,332
I'm Kanga and somewhere around here
is baby Roo.

207
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,494
I'm not a baby.

208
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:20,789
See! I can do this.

209
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:28,387
Well, it's very nice of you
to go out of your way to welcome us.

210
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,228
Sorry.

211
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:36,103
Oh, Roo!

212
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,893
Piglet, it's almost breakfast time.

213
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:42,601
Would you like to come in
for a little bite, perhaps?

214
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,614
I do like the sound
of the taste of that.

215
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:54,244
No, no, no. We're all due
on the other side of the wood.

216
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,408
And we can't be late.

217
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:00,456
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

218
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,547
Might I get that little something
to go?

219
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,043
Come on!

220
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,921
Aren't they dears?

221
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,259
One: Pooh will distract Kanga
long enough for...

222
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,635
Two: Tigger and I to take Roo
from her pouch.

223
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,227
And three: Replace him with Piglet.

224
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,850
That is very simple.
Just three little steps and...

225
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:27,440
What? Replace Roo with me?

226
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:32,110
You and Roo are the same size.
Kanga won't know the difference.

227
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:35,536
Not until it's too late.

228
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:38,292
How much too late?

229
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:42,243
Until after we say "Aha!"

230
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,920
What do you think?

231
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:56,347
Haha? Why would we say "Haha"?

232
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,393
Not "haha", Piglet.

233
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,223
Aha!

234
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:05,735
It's a word to say, "This is how
things are, and were meant to be."

235
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,945
Kanga will know that we know where
Roo is, and we'll only give him back

236
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:15,576
if she promises to leave the
Hundred Acre Wood and never return.

237
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:19,708
How is she going to know that
that is what "Aha" means?

238
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:24,039
Because we'll practice saying it
in just the right way.

239
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,206
We're counting on you, Piglet.

240
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,506
Everyone pretend
that their flower is Kanga.

241
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,672
Ready... set...

242
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,698
There you all are.
Oh, you brought flowers.

243
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:57,073
What nice new neighbours!

244
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,248
All right, I'm going.

245
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,583
Roo, dear. Time to come inside.

246
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,753
In a minute, Mama.

247
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:20,428
- Ready, Pooh?
- Yes, except for one small thing.

248
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,770
- What's that?
- What is it I'm supposed to do?

249
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:29,646
Talk to her very hard,
so that she doesn't notice anything.

250
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,315
Of course!

251
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:36,570
Come on, Roo. Hop in. Let's go inside.

252
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,737
Kanga!

253
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,613
Talk to her very hard. About what?

254
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,664
Anything!

255
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:49,663
I was just wondering...
That is... Do you think that...

256
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,631
Is that a fish in that tree?

257
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,793
- Which tree, dear?
- Up there.

258
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,392
Snug as a pig in a blanket.

259
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,600
What are you playing, Mr Rabbit?

260
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:06,854
That's not a fish, Pooh Bear.
It's a bird.

261
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,853
Yes, but is it a starling
or a mackerel?

262
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:15,277
It looks kinda wiggly.
It could be a jellyfish.

263
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:18,201
It's tough to say.

264
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:21,240
If you'll forgive me, dear,
we really must be going.

265
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,619
Peanut butter and jellyfish.

266
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,784
Ma, look!

267
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:35,586
Let's do it again. This is a fun game.

268
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,007
Are you all right in there, Roo?

269
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,176
I'm OK.

270
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:46,221
All right, Roo, dear.

271
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,526
Slow down!

272
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:55,363
Rabbit! Oh, Roo!

273
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,580
What was that word?

274
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,990
Aha?

275
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:09,330
That's the word.

276
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,294
Help!

277
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,879
Oh, my, Roo, dear.
You've lost your bounce.

278
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,389
I think it's time for your fishy oil.

279
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,970
Fishy oil? What fishy oil?

280
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:31,223
It'll help you bounce nice and high.

281
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:35,979
You don't want to grow up
small and weak like Piglet.

282
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:40,116
Now, did you have something
you wanted to tell me, Roo?

283
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,357
No...

284
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:44,529
Down the hatch!

285
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,585
See that? You got your bounce back.

286
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:03,172
If you're a good little Roo,
I'll let you have another spoonful.

287
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,342
No!

288
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,521
Oh, dear. I'm a goner!

289
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:16,189
You act like
I'm going to cook you for dinner.

290
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,236
Aren't you?

291
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:20,398
Why, of course not.

292
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm going to give you a bath.

293
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,076
Cook me instead!

294
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:35,672

I'm afraid to find out.

323
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:53,471
There's always two things you get
after your bath.

324
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:58,476
A cookie, and a kiss...

325
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,938
Well, it's a very subtle distinction.

326
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:14,119
But you see, a jellyfish sounds more
like a "Bleugh. Hi, I'm a jellyfish!"

327
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,662
Here, Tigger, Pooh Bear.

328
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:19,289
Look! Another creature
of the fiercerous kind!

329
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:23,090
Rabbit was right!

330
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:25,250
But it's me! Piglet!

331
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:30,672
Nah! The Piglet we know
isn't half as fuzzy as you.

332
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:34,050
You can't pull the fluff
over our eyes.

333
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:36,515
Pooh. Tell him who I am.

334
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:39,273
Well, I'd love to, whoever you are.

335
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:44,102
Come to think of it, he might be
a fuzzy fringed thingamawhatsit.

336
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:49,569
No, no, this is more of the feather
furred frizzamambobble variety.

337
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,363
But can we be sure, Tigger?

338
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:55,864
I'll prove it to you.

339
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,998
Piglet, where did you come from?

340
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,924
Lucky thing that fuzzy fringed
thingamabob didn't catch you.

341
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:13,512
- What did you find out?
- Awfully fierce and fiercely awful?

342
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,099
At first I thought so,
but then I found out...

343
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:20,055
she's very nice.

344
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,023
Hello, dears.

345
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:32,574
She called us "dears" again!
I could get used to this.

346
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:35,619
Would you like to come in
for that little something?

347
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,365
I'd love to.

348
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,956
- I love little somethings.
- But what do we tell Rabbit?

349
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:45,084
Mama, look at me.

350
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:49,003
You gotta see Mr Rabbit's garden.

351
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,673
You hear that? <i>Mr</i> Rabbit!

352
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:56,049
He's got carrots and lettuce
and beans, and we played...

353
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,514
Settle down, dear.

354
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,809
Now, what do we say to Mr Rabbit?

355
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:04,063
Thank you, Mr Rabbit. I had fun.

356
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,278
Well, I certainly enjoyed myself, too.

357
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:10,485
And you can call me Rabbit.

358
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,358
I like you, Rabbit.

359
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,120
I like you too, Roo.

360
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:25,997
You're right, Piglet.
This <i>is</i> the way things are.

361
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,164
And were meant to be.

362
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:37,798
If it weren't for Piglet,
I wouldn't be friends with Roo.

363
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:41,806
And we'd never have found out
how nice Kanga was.

364
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:45,146
We'd never have any of Kanga's songs.

365
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,810
Or her hugs.

366
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:52,607
Or her cookies. Which my nose
is telling my tummy are right nearby.

367
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:02,954
Kanga! We're so glad you didn't leave.

368
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:05,957
What are you talking about, Tigger?

369
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,121
How Piglet took a bath for us.

370
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,962
Not just any old buddy'd do something
that brave for his friends.

371
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,128
Don't know if I would.

372
00:29:17,682 --> 00:29:22,059
It was a very biggish thing
for a littlish guy to do.

373
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:27,056
We're so worried about him, because
we lost him at the honey harvest.

374
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:31,562
So we're using his book of memories
to find him.

375
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:37,482
- We hope.
- Oh, dear Piglet!

376
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:41,242
But he's so small!
He could be in big danger!

377
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,248
Mama, may I help and look for Piglet?

378
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,494
Sorry, Eeyore.

379
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,958
- Can I, Mama? Can I?
- Of course, dear.

380
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,126
Piglet needs your help.

381
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:58,007
Pooh, would you like a cookie
before you go?

382
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:01,015
My heart tells me I should
keep looking for Piglet.

383
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,551
But you dears will need something
to keep your strength up.

384
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:09,146
My tummy says yes!

385
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,937
I just thought Piglet would need
to keep his strength up, too.

386
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,907
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye-bye, dear.

387
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,869
- So, where do we look first?
- The scrapbook will give us an idea.

388
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,035
It's a book of memories.

389
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:32,046
It remembers where Piglet is.

390
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,207
Try page three.

391
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,503
Page three shows all of us
at the North Pole.

392
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:42,672
That was the day we made our most
splendiferous discovery of all!

393
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,009
Then that's where we shall look!

394
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,142
This is not the way
to the North Pole.

395
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,266
Last time,
if I reconnoitre correcticly,

396
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:54,984
the North Pole was 40 minutes
south-easterly in that direction,

397
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:57,028
this way, magnetically speaking.

398
00:30:57,114 --> 00:31:00,530
No. Last time, we went this way.

399
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:03,239
No, that would be the northeast pole.

400
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:07,742
No, no, no and no! I know
what I'm talking about. It's this way!

401
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:14,083
Perhaps if we told the story, the
story would tell us how to get there.

402
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:19,295
- Don't forget the part about Piglet!
- Piglet? How does Piglet fit in?

403
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:23,716
Roo's right. It really is a story
about Piglet, isn't it?

404
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:26,180
Nine-ety eight, nine-ety nine,

405
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,938
seventy-twosie and thirteen-ety...

406
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,512
and thirty-sixety...

407
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:35,475
gravity-defiant, Tiggerific bounces!

408
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:39,022
Look out below!

409
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:53,662
Hello, Tigger. Hello, Piglet.

410
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:59,548
What are you doing?

411
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:01,924
Just waiting for the other shoe
to fall.

412
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:08,433
I knew it.
These things always travel in pairs.

413
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,853
These are Christopher Robin's
big boots.

414
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:14,347
That can mean only one thing.

415
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,649
An expedition!

416
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:23,110
A which-pedition?

417
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,578
Yes, an expedition.
It's when you go off to find a thing.

418
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:31,661
- What are we going to find?
- The North Pole.

419
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:35,629
- Is it scary?
- What is it?

420
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:38,465
Yeah, we never found
one of them before.

421
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:41,550
Well, it's a thing you discover.

422
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:44,802
- Are bears good at discovering it?
- And Tiggers?

423
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:50,643
Everyone will come along. And if you
see the North Pole, shout "Eureka!"

424
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:53,301
Why would we do that?

425
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:56,149
Because it means,
"There's the North Pole."

426
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,315
- Eureka!
- Where?

427
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,361
Gesundheit!

428
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,650
Sorry. I was just practising.

429
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,485
We need a marching song.

430
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:13,033
A marching song to help us along.

431
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:18,081
- ♪ <i>Sing ho, for the life of a bear!</i>
- That's me!

432
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:22,217

I like that song.

454
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,710
Silly old bear.

455
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:51,974
- Would you like a haycorn, Pooh?
- No, thank you.

456
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:55,509
But a cookie would be nice.

457
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:57,679
Or a banana.

458
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:06,313
Christopher Robin,

459
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,691
perhaps I could find it easier

460
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,026
if only I were sure...

461
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,868
that is, if I knew
what the North Pole looked like.

462
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,574
Well, it's kind of...

463
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,793
It's sort of...

464
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,463
Well, I suppose we'll know exactly
what it is when we see it.

465
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:34,633
Are we there yet?

466
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:39,217
Pooh!

467
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:42,931
I just fed my tummy
and it's still calling me.

468
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,818
Hey, look at me, Pooh.

469
00:35:46,904 --> 00:35:50,273
- I am.
- Pooh, I'm swimming.

470
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:53,652
Just a moment, Roo.
I'm talking to my tummy.

471
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,536
Of course you're swimming.

472
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,112
You shouldn't have had
that second cookie.

473
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:00,994
That's not your stomach, Pooh.
It's Roo.

474
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,959
Oh, my! Roo!

475
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:06,580
I don't believe expotitions
usually go into the water.

476
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,548
Quick!

477
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,630
Don't panic. Everything's fine.

478
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:17,637
Nobody's in any kind of...
Specially not Roo.

479
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:21,974
Do something! Everyone! Do anything!

480
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:25,599
Don't worry, Roo boy! I'll save you.

481
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:31,990
Thanks, Tigger.
But I don't think I need saving.

482
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,114
I can help.

483
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:39,577
Piglet, stay out of the way
while we save Roo.

484
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,121
Don't want to have to rescue
two little guys.

485
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,037
Catch onto my tail, Roo.
I'll pull you out.

486
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:49,254
Just tell me when you're on.

487
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:59,677
Rabbit, Roo, are we going swimming?

488
00:37:02,563 --> 00:37:05,517
Maybe we can use this to save Roo.

489
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:09,735
- Give me a push, Pooh.
- Thank you, Piglet.

490
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:14,652
Now I've got him.
Faster, Pooh. Faster.

491
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:17,067
- Pooh?
- Where is he, Rabbit?

492
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,283
Pooh, look the other way.

493
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:26,330
I can see him perfectly from here.

494
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,496
Are you sure, Rabbit?

495
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:32,627
You're right.
You can see better from up here.

496
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,794
There he is.

497
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:45,185
Roo? Are you OK?

498
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:48,099
I got you, Roo! I got you.

499
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,269
Here he is, Kanga!

500
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:54,731
Oh, where'd he go?

501
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:05,709
You can rescue me now.
I'm getting kind of tired.

502
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:11,710
Use the pole. Use the pole.

503
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,795
No time for fishing, Piglet.
We gotta save Roo.

504
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,975
Grab on, Roo.

505
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,392
Pooh, could you please hold this?

506
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:37,610
Did you see me swimming? That's
called swimming, what I was doing.

507
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,735
Pooh Bear!

508
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:44,450
Pooh Bear,
where did you find that stick?

509
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,411
- What stick?
- That stick.

510
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:51,333
Well, I was standing here
without a stick,

511
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:56,084
and then I had a stick, so...
maybe the stick found me.

512
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:59,877
Assembled adventurers,
the expedition is over.

513
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:03,222
Pooh has discovered the North Pole.

514
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:06,144
- This?
- That.

515
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,848
Eureka!

516
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,269
Well, I'll be! That's
the North Pole, all right, all righty!

517
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:15,437
I should have seen it myself.

518
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:18,783
But... Oh...

519
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:20,942
Eureka!

520
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:27,372
Pole-erific! Positively magnetic!

521
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,830
Goodness! Where's Eeyore?

522
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:33,204
Did you grab on yet, Roo?

523
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:36,132
Roo?

524
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,293
Somebody?

525
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,256
Anybody?

526
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:52,059
Hooray for Pooh!
I always liked that story.

527
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:54,475
It has such a lovely end.

528
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:58,780
But nobody said hooray for Piglet.
He was so brave.

529
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,356
For someone so small.

530
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,028
And Piglets hate water.

531
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:07,864
Come to think of it, so do Tiggers.

532
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,839
Thank you, tail!

533
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:18,587
Thank you, Piglet. Wherever you are.

534
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:22,590
Look! Piglet's scarf.

535
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,673
That's it! Come on, let's go.

536
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:26,841
Missed him again.

537
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:36,184
Oh, my. You know, Piglet's scarf
never goes anywhere without Piglet.

538
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:38,898
This is more serious than I thought.

539
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:41,609
Maybe he's in grave danger.

540
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,190
Maybe heffalump's got him.

541
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:46,858
- Heffalumps?
- Or a woosel!

542
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:49,456
- Woosels!
- And now, he's out there somewhere.

543
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:51,267
- Woosels!
- And now, he's out there somewhere.

544
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,083
With this storm blowing in.

545
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh, goodness!

546
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:59,542
Goodness! Do you think
he's going to be all right?

547
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:03,334
Piglet shall be very all right indeed.

548
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,964
Don't let his small size worry you.

549
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:10,806
Once, he even made a whole house.

550
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,021
He did?

551
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:16,771
Do you know the story
of "The House at Pooh Corner"?

552
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,528
- No.
- Oh, yes, it's right here.

00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,439

554
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,404
On page four.

555
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:25,816
That's after three.

556
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,038
It's a lovely tale.
Don't you think so, Tigger?

557
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:31,749
Tigger?

558
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:37,080
- Pooh Corner, remember?
- Is this story about Piglet, too?

559
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:40,419
Why, yes, Roo, it is.

560
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:43,675

of every story.

I was just thinking, Pooh.

568
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:20,708
Were you thinking
of a way to keep warm?

569
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:27,044
Actually, I was thinking about how
you have a house, and I have a house,

570
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:31,467
and Rabbit and Owl and
Christopher Robin all have houses,

571
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,848
but poor Eeyore has nothing.

572
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:38,057
Well, that's certainly something
we can think about.

573
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:41,650
Think, think, think.

574
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:44,652
I've got it!

575
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:47,774
Got what?

576
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:54,162
We'll build Eeyore a house of his own.

577
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:57,202
That's a wonderful idea, Pooh.

578
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:01,630
But, where shall we build it?

579
00:43:07,303 --> 00:43:09,379
Well...

580
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:11,381
Right here.

581
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:13,846
Because this is where I thought of it.

582
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:16,426
And since this
is where I thought of it,

583
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,356
we shall call this place Pooh Corner.

584
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:22,231
Pooh Corner?

585
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,861
Pooh, I was thinking along with you.

586
00:43:26,948 --> 00:43:29,236
Yes, that's true, Piglet.

587
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:32,824
So, we could call this place
Pooh and Piglet Corner.

588
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:37,121
If Pooh Corner didn't sound better,
which it does.

589
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,078
Being smaller and more like a corner.

590
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:42,921
So, Pooh Corner it is.

591
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,666
Look, snow somersaults.

592
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,045
Bother!

593
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,722
I tried to stop, but it's snow use!

594
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:00,555
Get it? Snow use!
So, what you doing?

595
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:04,147
We're going to build Eeyore
a house at Pooh Corner.

596
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:08,315
What a Tiggerific idea!
What are you going to build it with?

597
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:11,157
We haven't decided.

598
00:44:11,242 --> 00:44:15,405
I just bounced by
a humongerous pile of sticks.

599
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:18,414

What is it?

I suppose I was.

00:48:07,603 --> 00:48:09,679
Weren't you awfully cold?

653
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:14,897
I've been colder. Last night,
for instance, it got downright...

654
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:20,193
- Freezing.
- So I did it. I built myself a house.

655
00:48:20,283 --> 00:48:22,608
Hear that?
Eeyore built himself a house.

656

Just a leaky pile of sticks.

657
00:48:26,038 --> 00:48:29,158
Did you say sticks?

658
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,833
- So you have seen it!
- I have? Seen what?

659
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,328
The funny thing about houses is,

660
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:39,752
they never know if they're coming
or going. So they do.

661
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:44,091
Well, someone, somewhere,
must know something.

662
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:46,258
I do!

663
00:48:48,102 --> 00:48:51,305

- A high-stepping pig high-faluter!

664

I believe it's Piglet on stilts.

665
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:58,603
Eeyore's house is over there.

666
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:03,775
Come on, I'll show you.

00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,446
Toodle-oo.

668
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:29,640
- Look at that.
- Well, I'll be...

669
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:31,803
Oh, my goodness!

670
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:35,599
Welcome home, Eeyore.

671
00:49:47,828 --> 00:49:50,746
It's my house, all right.

672
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,416
But I'm sure this isn't
where I built it.

673
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:58,172
Where you built it? But I...

674
00:49:58,256 --> 00:50:02,633
I suppose the wind
must have blown it over here.

675
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:05,629
The wind?

676
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,097
Oh, yeah, the wind!

677
00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:11,931
It's been known to do strange
and windy-like things.

678
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:14,937
I think the wind had a little help.

679
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,098
Right, Piglet?

680
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:21,642
The important thing is,
Eeyore has a house.

681
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:25,023
And here it is.
And it's as good as ever.

682
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:28,698
- And even never betterer.
- You really think so?

683
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:32,120
Oh, yes. Much more better than ever,
even, Piglet.

684
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:35,041
Just one thing bothers me.

685
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:38,292
Oh, dear. What might that be?

686
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:40,952
Afraid I'll lose it again.

687
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:45,876
Don't worry, Eeyore. I put up a sign,
so you'll always know where it is.

688
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:48,047
Pooh Corner!

689
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:52,054
Nice.

690
00:50:52,143 --> 00:50:54,349
Hooray for Eeyore's house.

691
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:59,270

695
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,659
What?

696
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:17,124
It's a little crowded. But it'll do.

697
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,418
And that is how Piglet got the idea

698
00:51:23,507 --> 00:51:27,256
that you, Eeyore,
should have your own house.

699
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:31,179
You mean Piglet built Eeyore's house
all by himself?

700
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:34,848
Yes, and that's
just how much Piglet cares.

701
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:38,601
Best house I ever had.

702
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:42,354
And named it after me.

703
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:20,438
Oh, dear. We'd better find him soon.
Roo's getting cold.

704
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:43,957
Perhaps we should look
in the book again.

705
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:46,620
I just got a Tiggerific idea!

706
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:49,717
Let's see where the book ends
and go there.

707
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:52,803
No, if we do this
in an orderly manner,

708
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:54,762
we'll find him much quicker.

709
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:58,300
Now, let's see.
We've been there, and there...

710
00:52:58,394 --> 00:53:01,395
But orderlier
doesn't seem to be working, does it?

711
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,181
All I'm concerned about
is finding Piglet.

712
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:09,605
- I want to find him, too!
- We all want to find him!

713
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:11,943
Rabbit, look!

714
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:14,903
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

715
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:21,743
- You're ruining it.
- I am not.

716
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:25,748
Hand it over, bunny boy. Finding
Piglets is what Tiggers do best.

717
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:27,665
It's what rabbits do best.

718
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:31,291
- Tiggers!
- No, rabbits.

719
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:33,761
Stop fighting!

720
00:53:33,846 --> 00:53:38,389
Be careful. That's the only way
we have to find Piglet.

721
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:00,071
There goes our map.

722
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,909
And Piglet's memories.

723
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:12,760
I only wanted to find Piglet.

724
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,296
We all did.

725
00:54:23,896 --> 00:54:27,846
We'd better go back to Piglet's.
We have to get Roo warm and dry.

726
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:41,485
I do wish I'd called it

Yes, yes, come on.

Poor Piglet! Oh, goodness!

Piglet!

Look! Oh, look what I found.

758
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:12,182
It's one of Piglet's scrapbook pages.

759
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:13,679
Look, another one.

760
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:16,058
We can put Piglet's book
back together.

761
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:20,358
- Then we can find him in no time.
- Let's keep looking.

762
00:59:20,443 --> 00:59:21,723
I found one.

763
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:26,567
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

764
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:30,610
Eureka!

765
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:32,945
- I think...
- I found...

766
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,956
Another!

767
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,833
We're getting closer.

768
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:40,955
- Here's one.
- How many does that make?

769
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:43,288
- Another.
- Piglet will be so happy.

770
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:45,458
What's that over there?

771
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,716
Come back, memory!

772
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:02,934
One more scrappy page
for Piglet's scrappety book.

773
01:00:03,653 --> 01:00:06,488
Hey, look. There it is!

774
01:00:06,572 --> 01:00:10,440
- But how will we get it?
- We need help.

775
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:16,906
That's gotta be dangerous.
What could he be thinking?

776
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:18,873
- Who?
- Pooh.

777
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,375
Now, no-one panic!

778
01:00:23,464 --> 01:00:25,504
The first thing we do is not to panic.

779
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:29,541
Somebody do something! Do anything!
Oh, my goodness!

780
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:35,717
Oh, my goodness!

781
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:40,553
- What are you doing?
- I'm just getting Piglet's memories.

782
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,896
- Oh, bother!
- Pooh needs help.

783
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,904
Oh, bother, bother!

784
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:55,119
Rabbit was right.
We could use a little help.

785
01:00:55,204 --> 01:00:59,498
Here you go, buddy boy.
We made you a rescue rope.

786
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:02,494
- Out of us.
- Me, too.

787
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:04,837
It's our plan.

788
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,637
- Oh, my!
- Pooh, what are you waiting for?

789
01:01:15,057 --> 01:01:16,967
The rescue rope isn't rescuing.

790
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:19,266
We need a little bit more.

791
01:01:19,353 --> 01:01:21,725
We just need a little help.

792
01:01:21,814 --> 01:01:25,598
- Who's small enough?
- Oh, dear! Who can help?

793
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:28,728
Piglet!

794
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:37,077
You can do it!

795
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,623
My friends need me!

796
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,832
Hang on, Pooh!

797
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:45,745
Oh, I'm hanging. Piglet!

798
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,024
Oh, Piglet! Your memories!

799
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:49,270
We never got to tell Piglet
how we feel about him.

800
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,985
Poor Pooh.

801
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:54,024
Should have told them
when we had the chance.

802
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:08,541
Here you go, Rabbit.

803
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:10,538
Something must be very sad.

804
01:03:10,631 --> 01:03:13,169
Well, of course it's sad.

805
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:15,335
Pooh!

806
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:19,256

807
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:20,973
Thank goodness you're safe.

808
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:23,217
We're so glad to see you.

809
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:26,221
Glad to see me?

810
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:28,935
It's so good to have you back again.

811
01:03:29,025 --> 01:03:33,153
We've been following your memories
all over the Hundred Acre Wood.

812
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:34,981
And they've led us right to you.

813
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:39,236
Too bad
they're all floating down the river.

814
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:42,826
- Goodness!
- Oh, no!

815
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:46,458
Oh, bother!

816
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:49,745
We're ever so sorry, Piglet.

817
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:52,375
The scrapbook's not that important.

818
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:55,631
But it showed us the great things
you've done.

819
01:03:55,718 --> 01:03:59,301
Oh, I've never done anything great.

820
01:03:59,388 --> 01:04:01,761
Well, of course you have!

821
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:05,514
- Let's tell him, everyone.
- No, let's show him!

822
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:13,690
I can't stand the excitement.

823
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:15,687

I'm so big!

828
01:04:41,722 --> 01:04:44,474
- Well, of course you are.
- Why, you're double XL!

829
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,603
If it weren't for you, Piglet,
I wouldn't be friends with Roo.

830
01:04:48,688 --> 01:04:52,057
Yeah, and thanks for saving me
with the North Pole.

831

Piglet...

832
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:58,520
Pooh Corner's not a bad place to live.

833
01:04:58,614 --> 01:05:01,188
I'd say this calls for a celebration.

Come on, you can do better than that.

Get him, Roo!

838
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:28,927
That's funny.
