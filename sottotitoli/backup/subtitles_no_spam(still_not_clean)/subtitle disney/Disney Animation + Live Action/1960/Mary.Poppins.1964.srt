00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,657
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

2
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,953
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

3
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,665
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

4
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,920
Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you

5
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:14,258
Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo

6
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,330
All right, ladies and gents.

7
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,958
Comical poems
suitable for the occasion,

8
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,753
extemporised and thought up
before your very eyes.

9
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,006
All right, here we go.

10
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,885
(SINGING) Room here for everyone
Gather around

11
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,262
The constable's responstable.

12
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,638
Now, how does that sound?

13
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,764
Hmm...

14
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,647
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you

15
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,651
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...

16
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,236
- Grrrr.
...with Andrew!

17
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,779
Arf! Arf!

18
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,617
- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!

19
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,911
Ah, Mrs Cory

20
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,997
A story for you

21
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,416
Your daughters were shorter than you,

22
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,044
but they grew.

23
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,178
Dear Miss Persimmon...

24
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,556
Yes?

25
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,185
Wind's in the east

26
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,897
Mist comin' in

27
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,608
Like something is brewin'

28
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,611
About to begin

29
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,033
Can't put me finger
on what lies in store

30
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,828
But I feel what's to happen

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,289
All happened before

32
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,375
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,586
I'm sorry. Where was I?

34
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,407
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,955
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

36
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,709
Crikey.

37
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,419
Bless you, guv.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,130
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

39
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,798
No charge.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,262
Oh, it's you. Hello.

41
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,101
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

42
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,978
All right. Come with me.

43
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,940
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

44
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,570
Nice little spot, you might say.

45
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,573
Number 17 is just down a bit.

46
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,871
Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

47
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,373
is the home of Admiral Boom,

48
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,500
late of His Majesty's navy.

49
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,630
Likes his house shipshape
and Bristol fashion at all times.

50
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,802
(BLOWS BOS'N'S WHISTLE)

51
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,599
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

52
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,727
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

53
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,898
What he's famous for is punctuality.

54
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,233
The whole world
takes its time from Greenwich,

55
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,362
but Greenwich
takes its time from Admiral Boom.

56
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,198
What cheer, Admiral?

57
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,451
Good afternoon! Where are you bound?

58
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,996
Some parties want to see number 17.

59
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,041
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

60
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,251
Some advice, young man.

61
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,254
Storm signals are up at 17.

62
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,590
Heavy weather brewing there.

63
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,176
Thank you, sir. I'll keep an eye skinned.

64
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,930
Here we are.

65
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,559
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.

66
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,103
(SHOUTING)

67
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,439
Hello, hello, hello. The admiral's right.

68
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,693
Heavy weather brewing at number 17,
and no mistake.

69
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,904
Leave her alone!

70
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,448
Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!

71
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,617
Let her go and good riddance.

72
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,786
I never liked her from the moment
she set foot in the door.

73
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,833
But who'll get stuck with the children?
Me, that's who!

74
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,127
Her and her high and mighty ways.

75
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,337
And that face of her
that would stop a coal barge, it would.

76
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
Indeed, Mrs Brill!

77
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,632
I wouldn't stay in this house
another minute

78
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,301
for all the jewels in Christendom.

79
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,971
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!

80
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,430
Stand away from that door!

81
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,058
What'll I tell the master
about the children?

82
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,643
It's no concern of mine.

83
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,896
Those beasts ran away from me.

84
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,277
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?

85
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,321
You think the lion got them?

86
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,991
They're fond of
hanging around the cage.

87
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,993
I've said my say.

88
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,871
I've done with this house forever.

89
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,664
Hip, hip, hooray!

90
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,709
Don't stumble on the way out.

91
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,253
No, no, Katie Nanna!

92
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,046
(SINGING)

93
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,716
Mrs Banks. She's home.

94
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,760
(SINGING)
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

95
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,306
And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

96
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,433
Good evening, Katie Nanna and Ellen.

97
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,685
The meeting was glorious!

98
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,023
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.

99
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,442
You should have been there!

100
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,278
And Mrs Ainslie
was carried off to prison.

101
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,488
Singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

102
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,533
Madam, I've always given my best...

103
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,535
Thank you, Katie Nanna.

104
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,621
I knew you were one of us.

105
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,542
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

106
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,588
And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes

107
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,550
Though we adore men individually

108
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:16,222
We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid

109
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,306
Mrs Banks...

110
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,060
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

111
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,730
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

112
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,275
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

113
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,571
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

114
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,824
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

115
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,744
I don't wish to offend, but...

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,998
From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,961
From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise

118
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,589
Political equality
and equal rights with men

119
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:55,261
Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again

120
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,057
No more the meek
and mild subservients we

121
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:06,188
We're fighting for our rights militantly

122
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,731
Never you fear

123
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,943
If I may have a word...

124
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,864
So cast off the shackles of yesterday

125
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,451
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

126
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,956
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

127
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,627
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

128
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,920
"Well done"

129
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:30,963
Mrs Banks!

130
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,090
"Well done"

131
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,092
Mrs Banks!

132
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,969
What is it, Katie Nanna?

133
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,472
I have something to say to you.

134
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,016
Where are the children?

135
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,228
The children, to be precise,
are not here.

136
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,771
They've disappeared again.

137
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,399
That's really careless of you.

138
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,401
That's the third time this week.

139
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,028
The fourth, madam.

140
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,488
I've had my fill.

141
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,324
I'm not one to speak ill of the children.

142
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,367
When do you expect them home?

143
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,912
I couldn't say.
If you'd compute my wages...

144
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,124
Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?

145
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,834
What will Mr Banks say?

146
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,338
He'll be cross
when he finds the children missing.

147
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,176
Put these away.
The cause infuriates Mr Banks.

148
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,888
I beseech you, please reconsider.

149
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,348
Think of the children.

150
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,352
Think of Mr Banks.
He was just getting used to you.

151
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,065
Posts, everyone!

152
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,658
4, 3, 2, 1...

153
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,993
Fire!

154
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,885
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

155
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,891
Bit early tonight, Admiral?

156
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,103
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

157
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,480
How's the world of finance?

158
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,689
Never better.

159
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,984
Money's sound,
credit rates are moving up,

160
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,905
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.

161
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
How about you?

162
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,159
Bit chancy, I'd say.

163
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,703
The wind's up. The glass is falling.

164
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,540
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.

165
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,253
Banks, you're steering into
a nasty piece of weather.

166
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,337
Banks!

167
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,339
Do you hear me?

168
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,429
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy. Allow me.

169
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,349
Hmph!

170
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,977
What a very pretty hat.

171
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,946
(SINGING)
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

172
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,158
Much as a king astride his noble steed

173
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,242
Thank you.

174
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,580
When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife

175
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,499
How pleasant is the life I lead

176
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,877
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.

177
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,630
I run my home precisely on schedule

178
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,593
At 6:01, I march through my door

179
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,805
My slippers, sherry, and pipe
are due at 6:02

180
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,600
Consistent is the life I lead

181
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,893
George, they're missing.

182
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,644
Splendid, splendid.

183
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,356
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

184
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,194
King Edward's on the throne
It's the age of men

185
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,198
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege

186
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,743
I treat my subjects
servants, children, wife

187
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,162
With a firm, but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige

188
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:55,334
It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion
are scrubbed and tubbed

189
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,920
And adequately fed

190
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,132
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

191
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:07,721
Ah, lordly is the life I lead

192
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,641
Winifred, where are the children?

193
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,935
They're not here, dear.

194
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,356
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?

195
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,942
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

196
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,737
They're missing.
Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

197
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,698
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

198
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,788
The police station. Quickly, please.

199
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,208
We needn't bother the police.
The fact is...

200
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,377
Facts cloud the issue.

201
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,548
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.

202
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,884
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...

203
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,886
Oh.

204
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:52,891
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.

205
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,644
- George Banks here.

It's a matter of some urgency.

207
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,068
Please send a policeman.

208
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,404
The policeman's here, George.

209
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,032
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.

210
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,743
Thank you so much. Good night.

211
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,996
Come in, constable.

212
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,792
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.

213
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,295
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?

214
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,672
Come along now.

215
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,759
Jane.

216
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,261
Michael.

217
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,013
Winifred, don't be emotional.

218
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,392
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

219
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,894
Children, come here at once.

220
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,859
Well?

221
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,946
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...

222
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,324
And the kite was too strong.

223
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,286
The kite ran away, sir, not the children.

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,789
Thank you. I'll manage this.

225
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,793
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.

226
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,171
Perhaps if you helped us...

227
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,924
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.

228
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,551
Only last week...

229
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,137
I'm very grateful to you, constable.

230
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,600
The cook will
find you a plate of something.

231
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,936
I shall now return to my duties.

232
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,271
Thank you, constable.

233
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,318
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

234
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,945
"Cook will find something."

235
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

236
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,329
You'll want to discuss it.

237
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,706
I would, indeed.

238
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,084
Ellen, take the children upstairs.

239
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,752
Yes, sir.

240
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,838
I knew it.

241
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,550
Who bears the brunt of everything?

242
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,052
Me, that's who.

243
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,931
They don't want
an honest working girl here.

244
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,600
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.

245
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,560
Sorry.

246
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,773
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.

247
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,900
She looked solemn, cross.

248
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,529
Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

249
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,364
I'll do better next time.

250
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:18,120
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.

251
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,496
I quite agree.

252
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,374
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task,

253
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,754
requiring insight, balanced judgement,
and an ability to read character.

254
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,339
Under the circumstances,

255
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:34,469
it might be apropos
to select the next person myself.

256
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,846
Would you, George?

257
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,141
I'll do this properly.

258
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,059
I'll advertise in The Times.

259
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,395
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.

Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.

A British nanny must be a general

264
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,244
The future empire lies within her hands

265
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,540
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

266
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,376
It is a nanny who can give commands

267
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,920
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.

268

A British bank is run with precision

269
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,511
A British home requires nothing less

270
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:21,433
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools

271
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,021
Without them
disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

272
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,565
In short, you have a ghastly mess

273
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,237
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.

274
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,698
- Father.
- Yes?

275
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,787
We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.

276
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,622
I should think so.

277
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,875
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.

278
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,127
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.

00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,581
I never give references.

357
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,666
I believe it very old-fashioned.

358
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,627
We'll see about that then.

359
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,754
Now then, the qualifications.

360
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,134
Item one, "A cheery disposition."

361
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,886
I am never cross.

362
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,929
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."

363
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,640
Obviously.

364
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,561
Item three, "Play games, all sorts."

365
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,230
They'll find my games
extremely diverting.

366
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,859
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.

367
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,277
Excuse me.

368
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,821
Item four, "You must be kind."

369
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,991
I am kind, but extremely firm.

370
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,327
Have you lost something?

371
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,413
That paper. I thought that I...

372
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,041
You are George Banks?

373
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,335
And you did advertise for a nanny?

374
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,837
George Banks.

375
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:48,963
Very well, then.

376
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:55,345
Tore it up, turned it over,
threw it in the...

377
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
Are you ill?

378
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,891
I hope not.

379
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,477
About my wages...

380
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,313
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.

381
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,107
We must be clear on that.

382
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,861
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.

383
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,868
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.

384
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,587
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

385
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,842
I'll see the children now.

386
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,027
Close your mouth. We are not codfish.

387
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,449
Don't stand there. Best foot forward.

388
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,909
Spit spot.

389
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,498
- George?
- Aah!

390
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,668
I thought you were
interviewing nannies.

391
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,461
I was, I was.

392
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,046
You've selected one already?

393
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,798
Yes, it's done.

394
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,635
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.

395
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,179
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.

396
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,141
I'd have muddled everything.

397
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:27,520
Is she everything
that we hoped she'd be?

398
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,649
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...

399
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,027
Will she be firm and give commands?

400
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,030
Will she mould our young breed?

401
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,199
Winifred, I think she will.

402
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,869
I think she will!

403
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,706
In that case, perhaps
Ellen should dismiss the others.

404
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,499
The others?

405
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,502
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?

406
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,672
Tell the others
the position's been filled.

407
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,009
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

408
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,930
How many nannies
does this house need?

409
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,478
The position has been filled.

410
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,779
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

411
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,114
Rather like a bear pit.

412
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,784
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.

413
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,161
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.

414
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,623
Your room has a lovely view.

415
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,792
Hmm...

416
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,546
It's not exactly Buckingham Palace...

417
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,217
Still, it's clean.

418
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,513
Yes, it will be quite suitable.

419
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,306
Just needs a touch here and there.

420
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,394
First things first.

421
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,815
The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

422
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,621
Oh!

423
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,915
This will never do.

424
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,007
I much prefer
seeing all of my face at once.

425
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,970
But there was nothing in it.

426
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,474
Never judge things
by their appearance, even carpetbags.

427
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,851
I never do.

00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,776
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

Hmm... A little more light perhaps.

430
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,756
We'd better watch this one.

431
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,634
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

432
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,386
Much better.

433
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,265
Now, let me see.

434
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,442
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.

435
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,319
- What?
- My tape measure.

436
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,614
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.

437
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,748
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.

438
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,250
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.

439
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,418
Good.

440
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,171
Come along, then. Quickly.

441
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,424
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

442
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,514
Just as I thought.
"Extremely stubborn and suspicious."

443
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,683
- I am not.
- See for yourself.

444
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:58,606
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.

445
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,609
Now you, Jane.

446
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:08,074
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

447
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,701
How about you?

448
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,622
Very well. Hold this for me.

449
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,628
As I expected.

450
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,757
"Mary Poppins,
practically perfect in every way."

451
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,803
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.

452
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,222
I've always liked it.

453
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,724
Shall we move?

454
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,186

did you not request games?

455
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,980
Yes.

456
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,400
First we'll play
"Well Begun Is Half Done."

457
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,068
That sounds suspicious.

458
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,321
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."

459
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,657
I told you she was tricky.

460
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,618
Shall we begin?

461
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,580
It is a game, isn't it?

462
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,416
Depends on your viewpoint.

463
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,588
You see, in every job that must be done,
there is an element of fun.

464
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,842
You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.

Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot

- Hello, Bert.

536
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,904
You know Jane and Michael.

537
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,574
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?

538
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,827
We're going to the park.

539
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,496
To the park?

540
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,165
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

541
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,459
Other nannies go to the park.

542
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,629
When you're with Mary Poppins,

543
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,966
quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"

544
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,844
the most unusual things happen.

545
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,388
What are you talking about?

546
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,682
It's not my place to say,

547
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,020
but she probably has in mind
a jolly holiday.

548
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,938
Something along these lines.

549
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,403
That's always good. Here we go.

550
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,824
(GURGLE)

551
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,784
(SCREECH POP)

552
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,663
(GURGLE)

553
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:35,831
(SCREECH POP)

554
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,293
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

555
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,544
World famous artistes

556
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:45,257
performing death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.

557
00:39:45,800 --> 00:40:07,404
Ta-da!

558
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,038
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.

559
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:21,752
A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.

560
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:28,050
Though you can't see it, there's
a little country fair down that road.

561
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,511
I don't see any road.

562
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,638
What? No road?

563
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,103
Just wants a bit of something here

564
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,483
and a bit of something there.

565
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,485
There.

566
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,322
A country road
suitable for travel and high adventure.

567
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,533
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?

568
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,286
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?

569
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,914
Now's the time. No one's looking.

570
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,625
Oh, please. Please.

571
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,003
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.

572
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,090
All right. I'll do it myself.

573
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,050
Do what?

574
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,468
Bit of magic.

575
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,345
- Magic?
- It's easy.

576
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,638
Let's see.

577
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,640
You think.

578
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,518
You wink.

579
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,938
You do a double blink.

580
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,108
You close your eyes and jump.

581
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,365
Is something supposed to happen?

582
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,868
Bert, what utter nonsense.

583
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:36,743
Oh.

584
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,623
Why do you complicate things?

585
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,959
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.

586
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,752
1, 2...

587
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,981
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

588
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,194
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.

589
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,696
You look fine, too, Bert.

590
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,990
Isn't there a fair?

591
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,244
Down the road and behind the hill.

592
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,705
I hear the merry-go-round.

593
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,833
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.

594
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,967
(SINGING) Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May

595
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,137
I feel like I could fly

596
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,557
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.

597
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:45,062
Have you ever seen
the grass so green

598
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,440
Or a bluer sky

599
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,739
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

600
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,408
Mary makes your heart so light

601
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,202
You haven't changed.

602
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,206
When the day is grey and ordinary

603
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,417
Mary makes the sun shine bright

604
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,585
Oh, honestly.

605
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,506
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

606
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:17,469
The daffodils are smiling at the dove

607
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,807
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

608
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,270
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

609
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,732
You are light-headed.

610
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:34,861
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

611
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,198
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

612
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,134
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

613
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:01,221
Mary makes your heart so light

614
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,642
When the day is grey and ordinary

615
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:09,813
Mary makes the sun shine bright

616
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,484
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

617
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,405
The daffodils are smiling
at the dove, oink, oink

618
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,160
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

619
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:27,372
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

620
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:34,004
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

621
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,883
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

622
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,481
Thank you.

623
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,025
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

624
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:28,702
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

625
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,955
Gentlemen like you are few

626
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,457
A vanishing breed.

627
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,961
Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert

628
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,839
Underneath your blood is blue

629
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,215
Common knowledge.

630
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,470
You'd never think
of pressing your advantage

631
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,807
Forbearance
is the hallmark of your creed

632
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:55,228
A lady needn't fear
when you are near

633
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,566
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

634
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,987
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

635
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,575
A jolly, jolly holiday with you

636
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,173
Waiter! Waiter?

637
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,779
Now then, what would be nice?

638
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,697
We'll start with raspberry ice

639
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,701
And then some cakes and tea

640
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,287
Order what you will

641
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,498
There'll be no bill

642
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,417
It's complimentary

643
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,710
You're very kind.

644
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,922
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.

645
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,840
You're our favourite person.

646
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,467
Right you are.

647
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:08,843
It's true that...

648
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,637
Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winning

649
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,472
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'

650
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,057
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming

651
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,392
Felicia, Janice and Lydia

652
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,769
Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet

653
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,396
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

654
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,523
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane

655
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,483
Convivial company, time and again

656
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:27,070
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports

657
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:31,616
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
is Mary Poppins and there we stop

658
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:14,219
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

659
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:17,972
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

660
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,432
Woo!

661
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,270
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

662
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:37,158
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

663
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:38,011
Yahoo!

664
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,937
Yahoo! Yahoo!

665
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,608
Our own private merry-go-round.

666
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,695
Nice. Very nice, indeed,

667
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,363
if you don't want to go nowhere.

668
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,159
Who says we're not going anywhere?

669
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,452
Oh, guard!

670
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,038
Righto, Mary Poppins.

671
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,291
Thank you.

672
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,138
They're off!

673
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,725
Mary Poppins leads by two lengths,
Jane's second by...

674
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,876
My horse is the fastest.

675
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,756
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?

676
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,843
Is that the best you can do?

677
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,386
Hurry up, boy!

678
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,930
Not so fast, please. Michael.

679
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,101
Bert, you're just as bad.

680
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,604
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

681
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,899
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

682
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,697
Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

683
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,325
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.

684
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,958
Follow me, please.

685
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,935
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?

686
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,065
I say.

687
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,735
Have you...

688
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,903
Ever?

689
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,447
Never!

690
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,000
View halloo.

691
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,628
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

692
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,588
View halloo?

693
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,965
(PLAYING)

694
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,386
Faith and Begorra.
'Tis them redcoats again.

695
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,227
Oh, musha, musha.

696
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,104
Poor little bloke.

697
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,231
Let's give him a hand.

698
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,609
Saints preserve us.

699
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,194
Yikes!

700
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,032
Tally ho! Da-doo da-doo!

701
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,085
Up you go. Now hang on.

702
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,801
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.

703
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,391
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.

704
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,186
Faster, me beauty. Faster!

705
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:08,489
Riders, would you be kind
and let me pass?

706
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,367
Certainly, ma'am.

707
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,078
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

708
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,095
Excellent time, gentlemen.

709
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,181
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.

710
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,892
Ahem.

711
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,770
Oh, how nice.

712
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,941
Hooray! Yay! Yay!

713
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,323
Hold still. Watch the dickie bird.

714
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,578
- How does it feel to win?
- Well...

715
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,914
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.

716
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,084
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...

717
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,796
Extreme good looks, may I say?

718
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,173
No words describe your emotion?

719
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:12,261
Gentlemen, on the contrary,
there's a very good word.

720
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,889
- Right?
- Tell them.

721
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,724
Right.

722
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:21,646
(SINGING)
It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

723
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,816
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

724
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,860
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

725
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,072
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

726
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:37,578
Um diddle diddle diddle
um diddle ay

727
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,373
'Cause I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

728
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,709
Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

729
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,796
But then one day I learnt a word
that saved me aching nose

730
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,841
The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes

731
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:53,302
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

732
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,305
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

733
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,225
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

734
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,228
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

735
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:07,984
Um diddle diddle diddle
um diddle ay

736
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,028
He travelled all around the world
And everywhere he went

737
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,823
He'd use his word and all would say,
"There goes a clever gent"

738
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,076
When dukes and maharajas
pass the time of day with me

739
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,829
I say me special word
and then they ask me out to tea

740
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,291
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

741
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,210
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

744
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,011
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:39,015
You can say it backwards...
Dociousaliexpiistifragicalirupes.

746
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,100
- Bit too much?
- Indubitably.

747
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,936
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay

748
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,106
Just summon up this word
and then you've got a lot to say

749
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,026
But better use it carefully
or it could change your life

750
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,446
For example, I said it to me girl.

751
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,157
Now me girl's me wife.

752
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,660
And a lovely thing she is.

753
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:03,873
She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

754
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:13,007
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,059
Jane, Michael!

757
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,440
Stay close now.

758
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,405
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

759
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,158
There's more where they came from.

760
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,746
Meantime, I'm changing businesses.
This is hot chestnut weather.

761
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,248
Come along, children.

762
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,833
- Bye, Bert.
- Bye-bye.

763
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,170
- Bye.
- Bye, Jane and Michael.

Da da da da dum

766
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,863
No, I won't take your nasty medicine!

767
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,369
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

768
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,497
People with wet feet
must take their medicine.

769
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,545
I don't want it.

770
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,838
Oh!

771
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,101
Lime cordial! Delicious!

772
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,103
Strawberry! Mmm!

773
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,028
Rum punch.

774
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,238
Quite satisfactory. (HICCUP)

775
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,327
You won't ever leave us, will you?

776
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,580
Do you have a handkerchief?

777
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,498
Will you stay if we're good?

778
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,377
A pie crust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

779
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:16,172
Whatever would we do without you?

780
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,883
I'll stay until the wind changes.

781
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,552
How long will that be?

782
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,721
It's time to go to sleep.

783
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,767
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!

784
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:28,934
Did they?

785
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,103
We jumped into Bert's picture.

786
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,856
The horses fled the carousel.

787
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,108
And we went riding!

788
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,028
Tally ho! Tchunga! Tally ho! Yoicks!

789
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,071
Really?

790
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,449
Don't you remember?
You won the race.

791
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,578
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.

792
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,122
I saw you do it.

793
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,751
Another word
and I'll summon a policeman.

794
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,836
I saw it happen!

795
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:59,048
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

796
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,842
We're much too excited.

797
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,260
Very well. Suit yourselves.

(SINGING) Stay awake

799
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:13,062
Don't rest your head

800
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,649
Don't lie down

801
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:21,779
Upon your bed

802
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,907
While the moon

803
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:31,247
Drifts in the skies

804
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:35,292
Stay awake

805
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:39,588
Don't close

01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:44,927
Your eyes

807
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,264
Though the world

808
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:52,643
Is fast asleep

809
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:57,064
Though your pillow's

810
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:01,235
Soft and deep

811
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,239
You're not sleepy

812
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:09,618
As you seem

813
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:14,832
Stay awake

814
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:21,714
Don't nod and dream

815
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:29,096
Stay awake

816
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:34,894
Don't nod

817
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:41,942
And dream

818
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,001
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle, glorious.

819
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,005
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.

820
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,466
A double charge? Aye, sir.

821
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,719
Shake things up a bit, what?

822
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,182
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

823
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,352
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.

824
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:21,941
After our meeting, we're all going
to throw things at the prime minister.

825
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,569
How distinguished you look today.

826
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:28,697
What's all that fearful caterwauling?

827
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,199
It's cook singing.

828
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,370
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.

829
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,456
Since you hired Mary Poppins,

830
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:41,126
the most extraordinary thing
has come over the household.

831
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:46,048
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.

832
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:51,178
She and cook fight
like cats and dogs, but today...

833
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:54,848
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.

01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,150

837
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,655
And shut the window.
That bird's giving me a headache.

838
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,240
Yes, sir.

839
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,873
Quiet!
You're giving the master a headache.

840
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,421
I'm sorry you're unwell.

841
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,880
Who said I'm unwell?

01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,509

everyone's so confoundedly cheerful.

you don't know what to say.

Yes, well, I always know what to say.

this unseemly hullabaloo?

I don't think there's anything to explain.

859
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,145
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

860
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,814
I should like to be quite clear.

861
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,068
I am not out of sorts.
I'm in a perfectly equable mood.

862
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,862
I do not require
being made to feel better!

863
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,658
You're always saying you want
a cheerful and pleasant household.

864
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:41,121
I should like to make a differentiation
between cheerful and...

Excuse me, dear.

01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,708
Posts, everyone, please!

867
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,961
I have no objection to cheerfulness.

868
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,963
I expect certain decorum.

869
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:53,175
I don't propose standing idly by

870
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,219
and letting Poppins
undermine the discipline...

about this household

Yes, dear?

877
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,863
Have this piano repaired.

878
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,825
I like to have it in tune.

879
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,452
But, George, you don't play.

880
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,706
That is entirely beside the point!

Now, let me see.

882
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,182
We must go to the piano tuners,

883
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,020
then to Mrs Cory's shop
for some gingerbread,

884
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,651
then to the fishmonger's
for dover sole and prawns.

are we off upon today?

890
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,918
Going to fight the Hottentots?

891
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,212
Dig for buried treasure?

892
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,423
We're going to buy fish.

893
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,718
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.

894
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,344
Aye, aye, sir.

895
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,055
Let's put our backs into it.

896
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,350
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.

898
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,729
Andrew.

899
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:32,232
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!

900
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,778
Slow down. I can't understand a word.

901
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,363
Woof! Woof! Woof!

902
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,324
Again?

903
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,409
The poor man.

904
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,870
Woof! Woof! Woof!

905
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,501
Woof! Ah-choo!

906
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,919
Bless you.

907
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,506
Woof! Woof! Woof!

908
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,842
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.

909
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,803
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!

910
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,097
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."

911
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,559
- And?
- He didn't say anything.

912
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,770
You know best.

913
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,272
I thought we were buying fish.

914
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,733
There's been a change of plans.

915
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,821
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

916

(WHIMPERING)

917
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,457
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

918
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,417
You should go home and rest.

919
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,044
Woof!

920
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,641
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.

921
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,685
How is he?

922
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,437
He's never been worse.

923
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:54,773
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

924
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,401
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.

925
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,152
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!

926
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,321
Oh, Uncle Albert.

927
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,740
Bless my soul.

928
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,451
It's Mary Poppins. I'm delight... Ha-ha!

929
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,829
I'm delighted to see you.

930
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,622
Uncle Albert, you promised.

931
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,542
Ha-ha! I know.

932
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,004
I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!

933
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:21,049
But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!

934
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,053
When I start, it's up with... Ha ha ha!

935
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,723
That's what happens.

936
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,349
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!

937
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,561
Oh, my! I can't help it.

938
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,313
Ha ha ha!

939
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,440
I just like laughing.

940
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,317
Ha ha! Ha ha!

941
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,321
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.

942
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,867
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.

943
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,537
Last time,
we took three days to get him down.

944
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,000
(SINGING) I love to laugh

945
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,501
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

946
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,629
Loud and long and clear

947
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,755
Ha!

948
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,341
I love to laugh

949
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,800
Ha ha ha ha!

950
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,511
It's getting worse every year

951
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,638
Ha ha ha!

952
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,890
The more I laugh

953
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,183
Ho ho ho!

954
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,727
The more I fill with glee

955
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,270
You're no help!

956
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,772
The more the glee

957
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,649
Ha ha ha ha!

958
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:21,109
The more I'm a merrier me

959
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,277
Hoo hoo hoo!

960
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,279
It's embarrassing.

961
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:27,616
The more I'm a merrier me

962
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,326
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

963
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,913
Ha ha ha ha!

964
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:37,209
Some people
laugh through their noses

965
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,670
Sounding something like this

966
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,421
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!

967
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,589
Dreadful.

968
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,216
Sss-sss-sss!

969
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:48,637
Some people laugh through their teeth
Goodness sakes

970
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,223
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

971
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,307
Sss sss sss!

972
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,893
Not at all attractive.

973
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,521
Some laugh too fast

974
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,356
Hee hee hee hee!

975
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,234
Some only blast

976
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,194
Ha!

977
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,864
Others they twitter like birds

978
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,117
Hee hee hee hoo!
Hee hee hee hoo!

979
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,744
You're as bad as he is.

980
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,748
Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind

981
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,251
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!

982
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,003
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!

983
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,504
Hee ha ho huh?

984
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,386
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside

985
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:34,057
And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do

986
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,183
Ha ha ha!

987
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,936
I've got to let go

988
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,856
With a ho ho ho ho

989
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,107
Ha ha ha ha!

990
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:47,237
And a ho ho ho, hoo!

991
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,072
How nice!

992
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:52,284
I was hoping you'd turn up.

993
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,203
We always have a jolly time.

994
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,459
We love to laugh

995
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,044
Ha ha ha ha!

996
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,337
Loud and long and clear

997
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,464
Hoo hoo hoo!

998
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,507
We love to laugh

999
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,718
Ha ha ha ha!

1000
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,803
So everybody can hear

1001
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,138
Ha ha ha!

1002
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,640
The more you laugh

1003
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,226
Don't you start. Come back here.

1004
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,561
We fill with glee

1005
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,645
Hee hee hee!

1006
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,190
And the more the glee

1007
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,566
Ha ha ha ha!

1008
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,611
The more we're a merrier we

1009
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,245
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1010
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,498
Pull up a chair.

1011
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,503
I say, you're a sight.

1012
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,924
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

1013
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,093
He works in a watch factory.

1014
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,887
What's he do?

1015
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,766
He stands about all day
and makes faces.

1016
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,021
Makes faces in a watch factory!

1017
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,525
You made that up.

1018
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,281
That's good.

1019
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,075
Such behaviour.

1020
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,960
It's disgraceful
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

1021
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,296
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1022
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,174
What's the name of his other leg?

1023
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,137
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

1024
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,391
Children, it's tea time.
I won't have schedule interruptions.

1025
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,643
Please stay.

1026
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,104
Look, I have tea ready for you.

1027
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,981
And it's getting cold.

1028
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,651
I had hoped that maybe you would...

1029
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,949
Splendid! Thank you very much.

1030
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,076
Mind the bread and butter.

1031
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,327
Now watch, children.

1032
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,456
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

1033
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,793
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

1034
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,546
If I must, I must.

1035
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,551
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

1036
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,345
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

1037
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,807
- Bert?
- None for me.

1038
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:24,436
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

1039
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,814
Pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

1040
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:31,568
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

1041
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:37,324
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

1042
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,494
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

1043
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,373
My friend said,
"From September to March."

1044
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,297
Jane! Control yourself!

1045
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,885
Children, please sit up properly.

1046
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,598
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

1047
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,892
I'm having fun.

1048
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,312
I wish you could always stay here.

1049
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,357
We'll have to. There's no way down.

1050
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,692
Oh, there is a way.

1051
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,114
I hate mentioning it because
you must think of something sad.

1052
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,075
Do it, please.

1053
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,078
Let me see.

1054
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,580
I've got the very thing.

1055
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:29,709
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

1056
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:36,091
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

1057
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,344
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

1058
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,555
Then he said, "I'll replace your cat."

1059
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,017
She said,
"Okay, but can you catch mice?"

1060
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,524
I started out saying...

1061
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,901
I try. Really, I do.

1062
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:58,488
But everything ends up so hilarious.
I can't...

1063
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,615
I can't help...

1064
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,663
That will be enough of that.

1065
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,124
It's time to go home.

1066
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,418
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

1067
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,796
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

1068
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,091
Come along, children.

1069
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,844
Must you really go?

1070
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:26,725
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

1071
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,147
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

1072
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,816
Don't worry. We'll return soon.

1073
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,901
It was lovely.

1074
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,822
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

1075
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,490
Thank you.

1076
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,785
Uncle Albert,

1077
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,581
I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.

1078
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,001
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

1079
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,588
Righto. It's about me granddad.

1080
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,007
One night, he had a nightmare.

1081
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,053
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.

1082
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,680
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

1083
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:09,434
He says, "A little down in the mouth."

1084
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,525
There's nothing like a good joke.

1085
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,738
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.

1086
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,964
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

1087
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,301
I say, Banks!

1088
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,720
Is anything the matter, Banks?

1089
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,639
Banks!

1090
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,190
We're so glad you're home!

1091
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,026
We had the most wonderful afternoon.

1092
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:04,739
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1093
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:07,826
We don't know anyone called Smith.

1094
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,664
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

1095
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,667
And a party on the ceiling.

1096
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,502
Children, be quiet.

1097
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,463
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

1098
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:21,673
Oh?

1099
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,175
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

1100
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,804
Please return to your room.

1101
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,558
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?

1102
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,351
As you wish.

1103
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:39,858
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.

1104
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,781
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?

1105
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,032
I'm afraid so.

1106
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,119
I have to dress for my rally.

1107
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,165
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

1108
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,461
Mary Poppins,
I confess I'm disappointed in you.

1109
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,214
She's for it. I've heard this before.

1110
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,467
I don't deny I'm partially responsible

1111
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:10,263
for allowing
the children's worthless frivolity.

1112
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,141
But they must learn
the seriousness of life.

1113
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,435
But they're only children.

1114
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,645
In light of what's happened...

1115
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,482
George, are you certain?

1116
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,150
I believe I am.

1117
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:25,737
(SINGING)
A British bank is run with precision

1118
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,657
A British home requires nothing less

1119
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:34,204
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools

1120
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:39,542
Without them
disorder, chaos, moral disintegration

1121
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,628
In short, you have a ghastly mess

1122
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,338
I quite agree.

1123
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,175
The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught

1124
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,678
That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought

1125
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:55,391
I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,

1126
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,811
consorting with racehorse persons,
fox hunting...

1127
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,273
I don't mind that. It's tradition.

1128
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,360
But parties on the ceiling?

1129
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,362
Having tea parties on the ceiling?

1130
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,365
And other highly questionable outings...

1131
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,742
If they must go on outings

1132
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:17,622
These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality

1133
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,624
These silly words like

1134
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,251
Superca...

1135
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,044
Super...

1136
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,462
Supercal...

1137
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,506
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1138
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,174
Yes, well done.

1139
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:34,389
And popping through pictures
have little use, fulfil no basic need

1140
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,309
They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth

1141
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,394
They must learn

1142
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,938
About the life you lead

1143
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,356
Exactly.

1144
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,570
They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book

1145
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,447
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row

1146
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,740
Quite right.

1147
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,578
When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up

1148
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,747
Their little cup of joy should overflow

1149
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,082
Precisely.

1150
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,877
It's time they learnt
to walk in your footsteps

1151
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:05,962
My footsteps.

1152
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,840
To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride

1153
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,924
With pride.

1154
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,676
Tomorrow, just as you suggest

1155
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,181
Pressed and dressed
Jane and Michael will be at your side

1156
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,101
Splendid! You've hit the nail...

1157
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,770
At my side? Where are we going?

1158
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,606
To the bank.

1159
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,733
- The bank?
- Yes.

1160
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,485
Tomorrow's an important day.

1161
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,363
I'll see they
have a proper night's sleep.

1162
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,462
Did I say
I'd take the children to the bank?

1163
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,131
It sounded that way.

1164
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,299
And why not?

1165
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,884
Capital idea.

1166
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:58,389
Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.

1167
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,308
Quite right. Good idea.

1168
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,226
Quite right.

1169
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,357
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.

1170
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,108
What do you mean?

1171
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,943
Weren't you sacked?

1172
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:13,988
Sacked? I am never sacked.

1173
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:16,741
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!

1174
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,452
Neither am I a maypole.

1175
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,162
- But...
- Goats butt.

1176
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,455
Birds fly.

1177
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,668
Children going out with their father
get some sleep.

1178
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,544
An outing with Father?

1179
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:32,048
He's never taken us on an outing.

1180
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,093
He's never taken us anywhere.

1181
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,136
How did you manage it?

1182
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,847
You gave him the idea.

1183
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,141
How impertinent!

1184
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,019
Me giving ideas to people? Really.

1185
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:47,689
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.

1186
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:52,443
Michael, the city!
Father can point out the sights.

1187
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,862
Most things he can.

1188
01:23:55,572 --> 01:24:00,993
Sometimes people, through no fault
of their own, can't see past their nose.

1189
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,579
Past their nose?

1190
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,583
Yes. Sometimes
a little thing is quite important.

1191
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,711
Oh, look. The cathedral.

1192
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,089
Father passes that every day.

1193
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:19,137
(SINGING) Early each day
to the steps of St. Paul's

1194
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:24,892
The little old bird woman comes

1195
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:32,900
In her own special way
to the people she calls

1196
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:40,158
Come buy my bags full of crumbs

1197
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,911
Come feed the little birds

1198
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,290
Show them you care

1199
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:53,921
And you'll be glad if you do

1200
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,258
Their young ones are hungry

1201
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,720
Their nests are so bare

1202
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:05,349
All it takes is tuppence

1203
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:11,105
From you

1204
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,901
Feed the birds

1205
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,112
Tuppence a bag

1206
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:21,616
Tuppence, tuppence

1207
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,286
Tuppence a bag

1208
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,456
Feed the birds

1209
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,084
That's what she cries

1210
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:38,800
While overhead, her birds fill the skies

1211
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,011
All around the cathedral

1212
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,639
The saints and apostles

1213
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,812
Look down as she sells her wares

1214
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:54,315
Although you can't see it

1215
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,819
You know they are smiling

1216
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,447
Each time someone shows

1217
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:07,411
That he cares

1218
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:14,585
Though her words are simple and few

1219
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:18,256
Listen, listen

1220
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,219
She's calling to you

1221
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,681
Feed the birds

1222
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:30,434
Tuppence a bag

1223
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,647
Tuppence, tuppence

1224
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:39,110
Tuppence a bag

1225
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:15,563
Though her words are simple and few

1226
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:19,025
Listen, listen

1227
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:24,196
She's calling to you

1228
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,450
Feed the birds

1229
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:32,371
Tuppence a bag

1230
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:38,419
Tuppence

1231
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:45,468
Tuppence a bag

1232
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:11,786
Now, remember.
Be on your best behaviour.

1233
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,371
Isn't it your bank?

1234
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:17,208
As a younger officer, it is, sort of.

1235
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,960
Michael, look.

1236
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,880
It's her!

1237
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:25,549
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.

1238
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,760
Just like Mary Poppins said.

1239
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,470
You see her?

1240
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,932
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?

1241
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,267
Listen, she's saying it.

1242
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,145
Feed the birds.

1243
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,814
Tuppence a bag.

1244
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,067
Of course she's saying it.

1245
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,611
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

1246
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:48,781
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.

1247
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,159
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.

1248
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,661
But Mary Poppins...

1249
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:59,208
I'm not interested in Mary Poppins
nor in hearing her name.

1250
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,252
But it's my tuppence.

1251
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,839
Michael, don't throw your money away!

1252
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,843
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.

1253
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,803
It's extremely interesting.

1254
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,508
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1255
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,052
My children.

1256
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,179
Why are they here?

1257
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,389
They're opening an account, sir.

1258
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,060
How much money do you have?

1259
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,271
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.

1260
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,315
Tuppence!

1261
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,234
Tuppence...

1262
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,320
Precisely how I started.

1263
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:19,747
That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.

1264
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,373
A giant?

1265
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,752
Father, these are Banks' children!

1266
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,046
They want to open an account!

1267
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,092
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.

1268
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,348
We can use more money
to put to work for the bank.

1269
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,562
You have tuppence?

1270
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,648
May I be permitted to see it?

1271
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,067
It's for feeding the birds.

1272
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:51,612
Feed the birds and what have you got?

1273
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,697
Fat birds!

1274
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,032
But...

1275
01:30:55,117 --> 01:31:01,330
(SINGING) If you invest your tuppence
wisely in the bank

1276
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:05,709
Safe and sound

1277
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,295
Soon that tuppence

1278
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,091
Safely invested in the bank

1279
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,470
Will compound

1280
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:22,560
And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest

1281
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:28,232
As your affluence expands

1282
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:36,907
In the hands of the directors

1283
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:39,827
Who invest

1284
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:46,083
As propriety demands

1285
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,920
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

1286
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:55,843
You see, Michael, you'll be part of
railways through Africa!

1287
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,595
Exactly.

1288
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,346
Dams across the Nile.

1289
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,184
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.

1290
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,476
Tell them more.

1291
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,521
Majestic self-amortizing canals.

1292
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:09,857
It fires the imagination!

1293
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:16,864
(SINGING) Plantations of ripening tea

1294
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:20,951
All from

1295
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:22,494
Tuppence

1296
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:28,125
Prudently, thriftily, frugally
invested in the...

1297
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,835
To be specific

1298
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,965
In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs

1299
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,968
Fidelity Fiduciary bank

1300
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,065
Give me the money, boy.

1301
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:54,151
I want to feed the birds.

1302
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:55,402
Banks!

1303
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,696
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...

1304
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:02,243
When you deposit
tuppence in a bank account

1305
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,369
Go on!

1306
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,288
Soon you'll see

1307
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,456
Tell him more!

1308
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,460
That it blooms
into credit of a generous amount

1309
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:15,839
Semi-annually

1310
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:21,262
And you'll achieve that sense of stature

1311
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:26,350
As your influence expands

1312
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:31,105
To the high financial strata

1313
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,858
That established credit now commands

1314
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,863
You can purchase
first and second trust deeds.

1315
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:41,657
Imagine the foreclosures,

1316
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,536
bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.

1317
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,620
Bankruptcies.

1318
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:47,705
Debtor sales.

1319
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,164
Opportunities.

1320
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:50,958
Private enterprise.

1321
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,126
Shipyards.

1322
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,627
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.

1323
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:54,753
Tanneries.

1324
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,630
Corporations, amalgamations.

1325
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,132
Banks!

1326
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,051
While stand the Banks of England,

1327
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,304
England stands.

1328
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,521
When fall the Banks of England,

1329
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,523
England falls!

1330
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,445
You see, Michael?

1331
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,655
All for the lack of...

1332
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,990
Tuppence

1333
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:24,158
Patiently

1334
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:25,617
Cautiously

1335
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:29,121
Trustingly invested in the...

1336
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:31,165
To be specific

1337
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:36,170
In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs

1338
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:40,883
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1339
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,511
Welcome to our joyful
family of investors.

1340
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:47,348
Give it back!

1341
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:48,515
Michael, behave...

1342
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,434
Give it to him.

1343
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:57,232
Give me back my money!

1344
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:00,361
The bank won't
give someone their money.

1345
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,779
I'm getting mine.

1346
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,739
Come along, every penny!

1347
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,200
And give me mine, too.

1348
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:12,956
Stop all payments.

1349
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,227
Give me my money!

1350
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,326
Children, come back!

1351
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:50,869
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!

1352
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,337
Come on!

1353
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:11,432
Stop those children!

1354
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:14,810
Aah!

1355
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,411
Come with me.

1356
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,537
Granny will hide you!

1357
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:51,847
Aah!

1358
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,641
Here, half a mo.

1359
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,518
Leave my sister alone.

1360
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,979
Your friend won't hurt you.

1361
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,900
Bert, it's you.

1362
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,402
In the flesh and at your service.

1363
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,197
You're filthy.

1364
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,699
Perhaps a smudge.

1365
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,076
It so happens
today I'm a chimney sweep.

1366
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,537
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1367
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,915
Don't take on so.

1368
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:20,834
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.

1369
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,294
Who's after you?

1370
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,337
Father.

1371
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,421
What?

1372
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,507
We went to his bank.

1373
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:29,843
We must have done
something dreadful.

1374
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,138
The police and army were after us.

1375
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,182
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1376
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,227
There must be some mistake.

1377
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,521
Your dad loves you.

1378
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,441
No, not with the look he had on his face.

1379
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,610
He doesn't like us.

1380
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,613
That don't seem likely, does it?

1381
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,156
It's true.

1382
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,243
Let's sit down.

1383
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,788
Begging your pardon,

1384
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,958
but my heart goes out to your father.

1385
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:05,087
There he is in that cold, heartless bank,

1386
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:08,799
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

1387
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:10,926
I don't like seeing
living things caged up.

1388
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,679
Father in a cage?

1389
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,807
Cages come in all sizes and shapes,

1390
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,892
even bank-shaped.

1391
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,145
Father's not in trouble, we are.

1392
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,356
Sure about that, are you?

1393
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,986
You've got your mother
to look after you,

1394
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,823
and Mary Poppins
and Constable Jones and me.

1395
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,284
Who looks after your father?

1396
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:38,912
When something happens,
what does he do?

1397
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:41,081
Fends for himself, he does.

1398
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,332
Who does he tell?

1399
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,126
No one.

1400
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,503
Don't blab his troubles.

1401
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:48,338
He pushes on at his job,

1402
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,174
uncomplaining, alone, and silent.

1403
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,468
He's not very silent.

1404
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,429
Michael, be quiet.

1405
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,390
Bert, does Father really need our help?

1406
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,852
It's not my place to say.

1407
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,189
But fathers can always do
with a bit of help.

1408
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,150
I'll take you home.

1409
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,703
(SINGING) Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1410
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,332
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1411
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,501
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1412
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,921
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1413
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,465
Or blow me a kiss

1414
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,926
And that's lucky, too

1415
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:41,058
Now as the ladder of life
has been strung

1416
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,519
You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung

1417
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,939
Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke

1418
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:51,026
In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke

1419
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,613
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1420
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:58,408
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1421
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,495
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1422
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,289
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1423
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:08,335
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1424
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:11,963
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1425
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:15,133
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1426
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:18,595
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1427
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:26,019
Ellen, whoever that is, send them away.

1428
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,854
I'm dreadfully late.

1429
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:28,897
Yes, mum.

1430
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,190
I'll be leaving.

1431
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:33,485
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better

1432
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,570
if you shake hands with him.

1433
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,782
It's the children, mum.

1434
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,534
I thought they were with their father.

1435
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,412
You haven't been running off,
have you?

1436
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,123
They haven't exactly been
running away, mum.

1437
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,500
They've been frightened
and should be looked after.

1438
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:52,421
Oh, of course, Mary Poppins will...

1439
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,923
Oh, no, it's her day off.

1440
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:56,383
Ellen, would you...

1441
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,553
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.

1442
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,679
Ask Mrs Brill...

1443
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,639
Not for 100 quid.

1444
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:06,226
It's baking day,
and you know how cook is.

1445
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,688
What about you, sir?

1446
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,399
You've been so kind.

1447
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:14,109
Me, mum?

1448
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,987
Lord mayor's got
a stopped-up chimney.

1449
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,740
How clever of you to know.

1450
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:21,783
Our drawing room chimney

1451
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:24,453
is in the most ghastly condition.

1452
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,080
Thank you so much.

1453
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:31,585
Besides, it will amuse the children.

1454
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:33,336
The lord mayor's going
to be terrible put out.

1455
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:34,963
Thank you so much.

1456
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,715
I do appreciate it.

1457
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:37,924
I must hurry.

1458
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:41,887
Our gallant ladies in prison
are waiting for me to lead them in song.

1459
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,598
Good-bye, my darlings.

1460
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,859
(SINGING)
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

1461
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,694
A broom for the shaft

1462
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,821
And a brush for the flue

1463
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:04,868
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1464
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,871
You see how wrong people can be?

1465
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:13,043
That's a doorway
to a place of enchantment.

1466
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:17,547
Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled

1467
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,884
'Tween pavement and stars

1468
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,595
Is the chimney sweep world

1469
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,349
When there's hardly no day

1470
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:29,518
Nor hardly no night

1471
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:34,314
There's things half in shadow

1472
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,900
And halfway in light

1473
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:42,072
On the rooftops of London

1474
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,035
Coo, what a sight

1475
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:50,288
I wish we could go up there.

1476
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:51,998
I like chimneys.

1477
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:57,087
Rightly so.
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1478
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,548
It's built tall up there on the roof.

1479
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:03,009
The wind blows across her top

1480
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,762
and draws the smoke right up the flue.

1481
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:09,432
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1482
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,352
It's like you've got a whale
at the end of the line, isn't it?

1483
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,603
Michael, be careful.

1484
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,273
Things happen around fireplaces.

1485
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,401
Oh, bother.

1486
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:25,031
JANE: Michael!

1487
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,576
Michael, come back down here!

1488
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,078
Michael, Michael, where are you?

1489
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,496
That's a bit awkward.

1490
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,416
Stop putting ideas in their heads.

1491
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,502
There goes another one.

1492
01:43:37,587 --> 01:43:38,587
Shall I go after them?

1493
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,632
They can't
gallivant up there like kangaroos.

1494
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,468
Michael, everything's going to be...

1495
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,477
Will you put your things on?

1496
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,983
Hurry up. Spit spot.

1497
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,818
Thought you'd left.

1498
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,570
We didn't mean to.

1499
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,280
No harm done.

1500
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:09,159
Truth is, this is
a fortuitous circumstance.

1501
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,535
Look there.

1502
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:16,750
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

1503
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,084
Why not, Mary Poppins?

1504
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,170
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.

1505
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,051
Oh, well... If we must, we must.

1506
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,847
Fall in.

1507
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:32,933
Look lively. Look lively.

1508
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,644
Jump to it. Get in line.

1509
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,896
Attention!

1510
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:41,650
Slope arms!

1511
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,027
Right turn!

1512
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,036
Quick march!

1513
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,234
Hello there!

1514
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,908
It's just good clean soot, Michael.

1515
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:38,790
Far as we go, right?

1516
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,166
Not at all.

1517
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:32,427
What did I tell you?

1518
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:34,179
The world's at your feet,

1519
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:37,891
and who sees it but the birds,

1520
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,977
the stars, and the chimney sweeps?

1521
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:51,821
Quite nice,

1522
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:55,075
but we've had enough night air.
Follow me, please.

1523
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,298
(SINGING) Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1524
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,008
When you're with a sweep

1525
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,511
You're in glad company

1526
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:18,473
Nowhere is there a more happier crew

1527
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:22,727
Than them what sings
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

1528
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:29,734
Chim chiminy chim chim
Cheree chim cheroo

1529

Cheroo!

01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:35,824
Cheroo! Cheroo!

1531
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,326
It's all me pals!

1532
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:42,122

Step in time! Step in time!

Step in time, step in time

1539
01:47:58,013 --> 01:47:59,472
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme

1540
01:47:59,598 --> 01:48:01,224
Step in time, we step in time

1541
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:03,476
Kick your knees up!

1542
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:06,604
Kick your knees up, step in time

1543
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:08,106

Kick your knees up, step in time

1545
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:12,277
Round the chimney!

1546
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:15,071
Round the chimney, step in time

1547
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:16,656
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme

1548
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,658
Round the chimney, step in time

1549
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:19,868

Flap like a birdie, step in time

Never need a reason

Flap like a birdie, in time

1553
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:27,625
Up on the railing!

1554
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:31,171
Up on the railing, step in time

Up on the railing, step in time

1557

Step in time

01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:43,057
Over the rooftops, over the rooftops

1562
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,893
Link your elbows!

1563
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:48,730
Link your elbows, step in time

1564
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:50,273
Link your elbows, link your elbows

1565
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,067
Link your elbows

When you step in time

1569
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:02,243
You step in time

1570
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,685
Mary Poppins, step in time!

1571
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:11,854
There you go, Mary Poppins!

1572
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,399
Lucky old Bert!

1573
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,906
Come on, Mary Poppins!

1574
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,078
Here we go!

1575
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,222
Ain't she marvellous?

1576
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:47,890
Ain't she beautiful?

1577
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,309
Lovely. Tell your mum.

1578
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:53,229
Hello, hello, hello!

1579
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,033
- More! More!
- Mary, do it again!

1580
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,403
Here we go.

1581
01:52:58,063 --> 01:52:59,939
We're being attacked by Hottentots!

1582
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:01,065
Aye, aye, sir.

1583
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,943
Cheeky devils! Give them what for!

1584
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,903
Empty the shot lockers!

1585
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,238
Aye, aye, sir!

1586
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,705
Move along, Mr Binnacle.

1587
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:18,082
Teach the beggars a lesson!

1588
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:24,922
Gun ready, sir.

1589
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:26,507
Stand by.

1590
01:53:26,592 --> 01:53:49,280
Fire!

1591
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,912
Well hit, sir!

1592
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,413
Very well hit!

1593
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,644
Aah! They're at it again!

1594
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:21,437
They're at it again, step in time

1595
01:54:21,522 --> 01:54:23,147
At it again, step in time

1596
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:27,860
They're at it again, step in time

1597
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:34,867
Ow!

1598
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:37,995
Ow! Step in time

1599
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,705
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme

1600
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,915
Whoa!

1601
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,083
Step in time

1602
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:47,505
Oh, Ellen, when you're free...

1603
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:51,008
Votes for women, step in time

1604
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:52,885
Not at the moment.

1605
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:53,928

02:09:28,302 --> 02:09:30,971
There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,

1789
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:33,014
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

1790
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:35,684
Guard it well. Good-bye!

1791
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:37,769
Where are you going?

1792
02:09:37,854 --> 02:09:41,815
I might pop through
a chalk pavement picture

1793
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:45,360
or seize a horse off a merry-go-round

1794
02:09:45,445 --> 02:09:46,862
or fly a kite.

1795
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:48,572
Only Poppins knows.

1796
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:51,199
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

1797
02:09:51,284 --> 02:09:53,577
She sings that ridiculous song.

1798
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,745
(SINGING) A spoonful of sugar

1799
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:58,123
Makes the medicine go down

1800
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:02,711
The medicine go down

1801
02:10:02,879 --> 02:10:04,004
The medicine...

1802
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:08,300
Mad as a March hare.

1803
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:17,058
A wooden leg named Smith.

1804
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:21,062
A wooden le...

1805
02:10:35,203 --> 02:10:36,745
Father.

1806
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:38,622
Father!

1807
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,582
Father, come down!

1808
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:42,083
Daddy!

1809
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:45,253
Daddy, come back!

1810
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:55,305
Wind's come around,

1811
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:58,391
blowing dead on from the west.

1812
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:02,562
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1813
02:11:02,939 --> 02:11:04,314
She only promised to stay

1814
02:11:04,398 --> 02:11:07,150
till the wind changed, right?

1815
02:11:07,944 --> 02:11:09,528
Bring my hat stand, please.

1816
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,034
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1817
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,040
What would happen to me

1818
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:25,627
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

1819
02:11:28,548 --> 02:11:31,675
That's right. George W. Banks,

1820
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,052
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1821
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,555
About 6'1 ", I'd say.

1822
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,183
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.

1823
02:11:40,268 --> 02:11:44,062
We discovered he'd
been discharged last night.

1824
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:47,482
No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.

1825
02:11:47,567 --> 02:11:49,484
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.

1826
02:11:49,569 --> 02:11:53,488
There's a spot popular with jumpers.

1827
02:11:53,656 --> 02:11:54,990
Really, Ellen!

1828
02:11:56,659 --> 02:11:59,703
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.

1829
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:02,747
No hanky-panky.

1830
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:05,917
Regular habits, as far as anyone knows.

1831
02:12:06,002 --> 02:12:08,503
(SINGING) The medicine go down

1832
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:10,171
Just a spoonful...

1833
02:12:10,256 --> 02:12:11,423
It's him!

1834
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,466
Or something similar.

1835
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:16,803
A little less noise on the premises.

1836
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,638
I can't understand the inspector.

1837
02:12:20,808 --> 02:12:23,810
Just a spoonful of sugar

1838
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:26,855
Makes the medicine go down

1839
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:29,441
You didn't jump in the river.

1840
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:31,693
How sensible of you.

1841
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:33,153
It's all right, sir.

1842
02:12:33,237 --> 02:12:34,946
He's been found.

1843
02:12:35,323 --> 02:12:37,407
No, alive,

1844
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:38,700
or so I presume.

1845
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,577
He's kissing Mrs Banks.

1846
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,204
What happened at the bank?

1847
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,750
I've been sacked, flung into the street.

1848
02:12:46,834 --> 02:12:48,752
A spoonful of sugar

1849
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:51,421
Makes the medicine go down

1850
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:55,759
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

1851
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:58,219
Dotty as you please.

1852
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,640
What were you doing in the cellar?

1853
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,558
First, where are the children?

1854
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:05,644
Jane! Michael!

1855
02:13:05,728 --> 02:13:07,020
Your father's calling.

1856
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:08,980
It doesn't sound like Father.

1857
02:13:09,065 --> 02:13:10,607
Jane! Michael!

1858
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,734
Run along. Spit spot.

1859
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:21,117
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1860
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:22,243
Spit spot.

1861
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:35,215
He mended it!

1862
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:41,763
It's wonderful!

1863
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:44,307
However did you manage it?

1864
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:47,519
(SINGING)
With tuppence for paper and strings

1865
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:50,855
You can have your own set of wings

1866
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:53,108
With your feet on the ground

1867
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:56,361
You're a bird in flight

1868
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:00,073
With your fist holding tight

1869
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:01,991
To the string of your kite

1870
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:04,703
Oh, oh, oh

1871
02:14:05,121 --> 02:14:08,623
Let's go fly a kite

1872
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,210
Up to the highest height

1873
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:15,505
Let's go fly a kite

1874
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:19,300
And send it soaring

1875
02:14:19,468 --> 02:14:22,804
Up through the atmosphere

1876
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:26,391
Up where the air is clear

1877
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:30,520
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1878
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:34,774
A proper kite needs a proper tail.

1879
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:36,526
That's what I said.

1880
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,653
Go fly a kite.

1881
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:44,033
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.

1882
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:47,704
Let's go fly a kite

1883
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:50,915
Up to the highest height

1884
02:14:51,208 --> 02:14:54,335
Let's go fly a kite

1885
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:58,006
And send it soaring

1886
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:01,676
Up through the atmosphere

1887
02:15:01,761 --> 02:15:05,138
Up where the air is clear

1888
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:09,350
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1889
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:15,106
When you send it flying up there

1890
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:18,568
All at once you're lighter than air

1891
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,612
You can dance on the breeze

1892
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,740
Over houses and trees

1893
02:15:23,866 --> 02:15:26,326
With your fist holding tight

1894
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:29,829
To the string of your kite

1895
02:15:29,914 --> 02:15:32,081
Oh, oh, oh

1896
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:36,169
Let's go fly a kite

1897
02:15:36,253 --> 02:15:39,547
Up to the highest height

1898
02:15:39,632 --> 02:15:43,009
Let's go fly a kite

1899
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:46,429
And send it soaring

1900
02:15:46,514 --> 02:15:48,807
There you are, Banks.

1901
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:50,975
Congratulations.

1902
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,602
Capital bit of humour.

1903
02:15:52,728 --> 02:15:55,063
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

1904
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,440
or Jones, whatever it was.

1905
02:15:57,525 --> 02:15:58,900
Father died laughing.

1906
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:02,278
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1907
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:05,490
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1908
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:07,992
Never seen him happier.

1909
02:16:08,077 --> 02:16:10,245
He left an opening for a new partner.

1910
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:12,580
Congratulations.

1911
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:16,251
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1912
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:19,838
Up through the atmosphere

1913
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:23,049
Up where the air is clear

1914
02:16:23,133 --> 02:16:27,178
Oh, let's go

1915
02:16:28,097 --> 02:16:29,138
Fly a kite

1916
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,686
Awk! That's gratitude for you.

1917
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:36,855
Didn't even say goodbye.

1918
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,231
No, they didn't.

1919
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:39,816
Look at them.

1920
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:44,279
They think more
of their father than of you.

1921
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:46,531
That's as it should be.

1922
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,908
Don't you care?

1923
02:16:48,993 --> 02:16:51,369
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

1924
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,954
to muddle their thinking.

1925
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,706
Is that so?

1926
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:58,376
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

1927
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,544
Really?

1928
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:03,172
Really. I know how you feel.

1929
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,260
If you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut...

1930
02:17:07,887 --> 02:17:11,347
That will be quite enough, thank you.

1931
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,246
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

1932
02:17:35,331 --> 02:17:36,664
Don't stay away too long.

1933
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:26,297
Oh, oh, oh

1934
02:18:26,382 --> 02:18:29,926
Let's go fly a kite

1935
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:33,429
Up to the highest height

1936
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:36,933
Let's go fly a kite

1937
02:18:37,017 --> 02:18:40,478
And send it soaring

1938
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,065
Up through the atmosphere

1939
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:47,652
Up where the air is clear

1940
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:52,323
Oh, let's go

1941
02:18:52,408 --> 02:18:55,535
Fly a kite
