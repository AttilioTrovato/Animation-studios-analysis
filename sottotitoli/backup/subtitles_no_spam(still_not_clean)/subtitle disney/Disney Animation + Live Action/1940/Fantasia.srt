1
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,837
How do you do?

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,638
My name is Deems Taylor,

3
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,798
and it's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,832
on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,271
and all the other artists and musicians
whose combined talents

6
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,110
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

7
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,318
What you're going to see

8
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,920
are the designs
and pictures and stories

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,998
that music inspired
in the minds and imaginations

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,429
of a group of artists.

11
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,914
In other words,
these are not going to be

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,679
the interpretations
of trained musicians.

13
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,950
Which I think is all to the good.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,277
Now, there are three kinds of music
on this Fantasia programme.

15
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,199
First is the kind that tells
a definite story.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,153
Then there's the kind that,
while it has no specific plot,

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,670
does paint a series of, more or less,
definite pictures.

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,233
Then there's a third kind,

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,352
music that exists simply
for its own sake.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,358
Now, the number that opens
our Fantasia programme,

21
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,836
the Toccata and Fugue,
is music of this third kind,

22
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,110
what we call absolute music.

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,393
Even the title has no meaning beyond
a description of the form of the music.

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,150
What you will see on the screen is a
picture of the various abstract images

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,111
that might pass through your mind

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,676
if you sat in a concert hall
listening to this music.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,473
At first you're more or less
conscious of the orchestra.

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,638
So our picture opens
with a series of impressions

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,512
of the conductor and the players.

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,315
Then the music begins to suggest
other things to your imagination.

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,910
They might be,
oh, just masses of colour.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,316
Or they may be cloud forms
or great landscapes

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,150
or vague shadows or geometrical objects
floating in space.

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,474
So now we present

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,673
<i>the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor</i>
by Johann <i>Sebastian</i> Bach,

36
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,951
interpreted in pictures
by Walt Disney and his associates,

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,355
and in music
by the Philadelphia Orchestra

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,990
and its conductor, Leopold Stokowski.

39
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,798
You know, it's funny how wrong
an artist can be about his own work.

40
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,310
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested

41
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,953
<i>was his Nutcracker Suite,</i>

42
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,753
which is probably the most
popular thing he ever wrote.

43
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,918
It's a series of dances
taken out of a full-length ballet

44
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,155
<i>called The Nutcracker</i>

45
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,397
that he once composed
for the St Petersburg opera house.

46
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,751
It wasn't much of a success
and nobody performs it nowadays,

47
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,270
but I'm pretty sure you'll recognise the
music of the Suite when you hear it.

48
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,836
Incidentally, you won't see
any nutcracker on the screen.

49
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,996
There's nothing left
of him but the title.

50
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,109
And now we're going to hear a piece of
music that tells a very definite story.

51
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,834
As a matter of fact, in this case,
the story came first

52
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,111
and the composer wrote the music
to go with it.

53
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,074
It's a very old story,
one that goes back almost 2,000 years.

54
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,556
A legend about a sorcerer
who had an apprentice.

55
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,718
He was a bright young lad,
very anxious to learn the business.

56
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,274
As a matter of fact,
he was a little bit too bright

57
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,756
because he started practising
some of the boss's best magic tricks

58
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,440
before learning how to control them.

59
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,711
One day, for instance,
when he'd been told by his master

60
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,674
to carry water to fill a cauldron,
he had the brilliant idea

61
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,236
of bringing a broomstick to life
to carry the water for him.

62
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,999
Well, this worked very well, at first.

63
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,158
Unfortunately, however,
having forgotten the magic formula

64
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,397
that would make the broomstick
stop carrying the water,

65
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
he found he'd started something
he couldn't finish.

66
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,231
Mr Stokowski. Mr Stokowski.

67
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,353
My congratulations, sir.

68
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,789
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

69
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,638
Gee, thanks.

70
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,832
Well, so long. I'll be seein' ya.

71
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,599
Goodbye.

72
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,474
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring...

73
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,559
I repeat,

74
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,355
when Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring,

75
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,631
his purpose was, in his own words,
to "express primitive life."

76
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,560
And so Walt Disney and his fellow
artists have taken him at his word.

77
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,353
Instead of presenting the ballet
in its original form,

78
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,031
as a simple series of tribal dances,
they have visualised it as a pageant,

79
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,960
as the story of the growth
of life on Earth.

80
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,276
And that story,
as you're going to see it,

81
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,630
isn't the product
of anybody's imagination.

82
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,674
It's a coldly accurate reproduction
of what science thinks went on

83
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,872
during the first few billion years
of this planet's existence.

84
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,629
Science, not art,
wrote the scenario of this picture.

85
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,559
According to science,
the first living things here

86
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,955
were single-celled organisms,

87
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,073
tiny little white or green blobs
of nothing in particular

88
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,396
that lived under the water.

89
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,909
And then, as the ages passed,
the oceans began to swarm

90
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,156
with all kinds of marine creatures.

91
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,079
Finally, after about a billion years,

92
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,839
certain fish, more ambitious
than the rest,

93
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,714
crawled up on land and became
the first amphibians.

94
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,798
And then,
several hundred million years ago,

95
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,834
nature went off on another tack
and produced the dinosaurs.

96
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,793
Now, the name "dinosaur"
comes from two Greek words

97
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,797
meaning "terrible lizard."

98
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,956
And they certainly were all of that.

99
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,116
They came in all shapes and sizes,

100
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,710
from little, crawling horrors
about the size of a chicken

101
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,832
to hundred-ton nightmares.

102
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,871
They were not very bright.

103
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,673
Even the biggest of them
had only the brain of a pigeon.

104
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,031
They lived in the air and water
as well as on land.

105
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,230
As a rule, they were vegetarians,

106
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,874
rather amiable
and easy to get along with.

107
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,356
However, there were bullies
and gangsters among them.

108
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,711
The worst of the lot,
a brute named tyrannosaurus rex,

109
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,469
was probably the meanest killer
that ever roamed the Earth.

110
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,438
The dinosaurs were lords of creation
for about 200 million years.

111
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,030
And then... Well,
we don't exactly know what happened.

112
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,960
Some scientists think that
great droughts and earthquakes

113
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,277
turned the whole world
into a gigantic dustbowl.

114
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,029
In any case,
the dinosaurs were wiped out.

115
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,991
That is where our story ends.

116
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,510
Where it begins is at a time
infinitely far back,

117
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,597
when there was no life at all on Earth.

118
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,358
Nothing but clouds of steam,

119
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,870
boiling seas and exploding volcanoes.

120
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,800
So now,
imagine yourselves out in space

121
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,229
billions and billions of years ago,

122
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,591
looking down on this lonely,
tormented little planet,

123
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,234
spinning through
an empty sea of nothingness.

124
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,039
And now we'll have
a 15-minute intermission.

125
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,916
Before we get into
the second half of the programme,

126
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,395
I'd like to introduce somebody to you,

127
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,319
somebody who's very important
to Fantasia.

128
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,590
He's very shy and very retiring.

129
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,076
I just happened to run across him
one day at the Disney studios.

130
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,997
But when I did, I suddenly realised

131
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,556
that here was not only an indispensable
member of the organisation,

132
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,150
but a screen personality whose
possibilities nobody around the place

133
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,474
had ever noticed.

134
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,514
And so I'm very happy to have
this opportunity to introduce to you

135
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,437
the soundtrack.

136
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,074
All right. Come on.

137
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,475
That's all right. Don't be timid.

138
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,753
Atta soundtrack.

139
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,235
Now, watching him, I discovered
that every beautiful sound

140
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,159
also creates
an equally beautiful picture.

141
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,875
Now, look. Will the soundtrack
kindly produce a sound?

142
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,190
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.

143
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,110
Well, that isn't quite
what I had in mind.

144
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,920
Suppose we hear and see the harp.

145
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,314
Now one of the strings, say, the violin.

146
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,475
And now... now, one of the Woodwinds,
a flute.

147
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,073
Very pretty-

148
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,112
Now, let's have a brass instrument,
the trumpet.

149
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,953
All right. Now, how about
a low instrument, the bassoon?

150
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,516
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?

151
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,395
Well, now to finish, suppose we see
some of the percussion instruments,

152
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,431
beginning with the bass drum.

153
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,471
Thanks a lot, old man.

154
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,113
The symphony that Beethoven
called the Pastoral,

155
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,596
his sixth, is one of the few pieces
of music he ever wrote

156
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,836
that tells something
like a definite story.

157
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,713
He was a great nature lover,
and in this symphony,

158
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,718
he paints a musical picture
of a day in the country.

159
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,717
Now, of course,
the country that Beethoven described

160
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,400
was the countryside
with which he was familiar.

161
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,114
But his music covers
a much wider field than that,

162
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,994
so Walt Disney has given the Pastoral
Symphonya mythological setting.

163
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,318
And that setting is of Mt Olympus,
the abode of the gods.

164
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,591
And here, first of all,
we meet a group of fabulous creatures

165
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,438
of the field and forest,

166
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,394
unicorns, fauns,
Pegasus, the flying horse,

167
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,000
and his entire family,
the centaurs,

168
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:04,318
those strange creatures
that are half-man and half-horse.

169
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,273
And their girlfriends,
the centaur-ettes.

170
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,438
Later on, we meet our old friend,
Bacchus, the god of wine,

171
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,596
presiding over a bacchanal.

172
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,472
The party is interrupted by a storm.

173
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,114
And now, we see Vulcan
forging thunderbolts

174
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,039
and handing them over to the
king of all the gods, Zeus,

175
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,196
who plays darts with them.

176
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,835
As the storm clears, we see Iris,
the goddess of the rainbow.

177
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,589
And Apollo, driving
his sun chariot across the sky.

178
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,551
And then Morpheus, the god of sleep,

179
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,240
covers everything
with his cloak of night,

180
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,113
as Diana, using the new moon as a bow,

181
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,438
shoots an arrow of fire
that spangles the sky with stars.

182
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,314
Now we're going to do one of the most
famous and popular ballets ever written,

183
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,751
<i>The Dance of the Hours</i>
from <i>Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda.</i>

184
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,440
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.

185
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,518
We see first a group
of dancers in costumes

186
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,836
to suggest the delicate light of dawn.

187
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,279
Then a second group enters

188
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:36,358
dressed to represent
the brilliant light of noon day.

189
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,040
As these withdraw, a third group enters

190
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,392
in costumes that suggest
the delicate tones of early evening.

191
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,877
Then a last group, all in black,
the sombre hours of the night.

192
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,514
Suddenly, the orchestra
bursts into a brilliant finale

193
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,111
in which the hours of darkness
are overcome by the hours of light.

194
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:58,869
All this takes place in the great hall
with its garden beyond,

195
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,470
of the palace of Duke Alvise,
a Venetian nobleman.

196
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,589
The last number
on our Fantasia programme

197
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,598
is a combination of two pieces
of music so utterly different

198
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:05,077
in construction and mood
that they set each other off perfectly.

199
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,475
<i>The</i> first is <i>A Night on Bald Mountain,</i>

200
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,479
by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modest Mussorgsky.

201
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,479
The second is Franz Schubert's
world-famous Ave Maria.

202
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,239
Musically and dramatically,
we have here a picture

203
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,715
of the struggle
between the profane and the sacred.

204
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,434
Bald Mountain, according to tradition,

205
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:26,677
is the gathering place
of Satan and his followers.

206
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,554
Here on Walpurgis Night, which is
the equivalent of our own Halloween,

207
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:34,275
the creatures of evil gather
to worship their master.

208
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,960
Under his spell, they dance furiously

209
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,674
until the coming of dawn
and the sounds of church bells

210
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:44,430
send the infernal army slinking back
into their abodes of darkness.

211
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,871
And then we hear the Ave Maria,
with its message of the triumph

212
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,879
of hope and life over the powers
of despair and death.
