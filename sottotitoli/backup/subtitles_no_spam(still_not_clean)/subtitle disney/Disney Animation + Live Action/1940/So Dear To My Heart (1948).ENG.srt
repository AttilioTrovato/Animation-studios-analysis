00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:38,953
<i>The greatest wealth
a man may acquire...</i>

3
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:42,187
<i>is the wisdom
he gains from living.</i>

4
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,074
<i>And sometimes out of
the small beginnings...</i>

5
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,670
<i>come the forces
that shape a whole life.</i>

6
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:07,267
<i>So dear to my heart</i>

7
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:11,144
<i>That Septembery day</i>

8
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:14,751
<i>When that old shady lane</i>

9
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:18,067
<i>We strolled</i>

10
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:23,469
<i>Was just turning
scarlet and gold</i>

11
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:28,107
<i>So dear to my heart</i>

12
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:32,872
<i>So dear to my heart</i>

13
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:37,188
<i>That Decembery day</i>

14
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:40,507
<i>When that first touch
of frost</i>

15
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:44,145
<i>And snow</i>

16
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,955
<i>Had painted each tree</i>

17
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,755
<i>In the road</i>

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,511
<i>So dear to my heart</i>

19
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:58,909
<i>So dear to my heart</i>

20
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>I still can picture
the flowers in a shower</i>

21
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:10,346
<i>And that picnic in July</i>

22
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:13,075
<i>And I still treasure</i>

23
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:17,752
<i>Each and every hour</i>

24
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,191
<i>Of those years</i>

25
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:24,030
<i>That had to fly</i>

26
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:30,749
<i>They're locked in my heart</i>

27
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,034
<i>In a corner apart</i>

28
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,586
<i>While I tenderly hold</i>

29
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,952
<i>The key</i>

30
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,869
<i>As long as I live</i>

31
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:48,232
<i>They will be</i>

32
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,876
<i>So dear</i>

33
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,505
<i>To my heart</i>

34
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:04,672
<i>I can still see
the old Kincaid homestead...</i>

35
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,986
<i>just the way it was then--</i>

36
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:10,512
<i>the split-rail fence,
the red barn...</i>

37
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:14,066
<i>and the chinked log cabin
with its little loft bedroom...</i>

38
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:16,306
<i>where I used to do
my dreaming.</i>

39
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:22,667
<i>And I can still see Granny
out there in the field...</i>

40
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:25,065
<i>and General Jackson
pulling her plough.</i>

41
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:30,264
<i>And just a mile or so away,
Fulton Corners...</i>

42
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,551
<i>the crossroads
of my small world.</i>

43
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:37,068
<i>At Grundy's General Store,
you could get most anything...</i>

44
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:40,387
<i>from jackknives
to fishhooks or candy.</i>

45
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,387
<i>That is,
if you had the money.</i>

46
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:44,387
<i>And if you didn't...</i>

47
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:49,231
<i>why, free for nothin', you might get
to see Old 99 go highballin' through.</i>

48
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:04,592
She's blowin' for a stop.
Uncle Hiram, come on!

49
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:14,311
Hey, Pa, she's a-stoppin',
she's a-stoppin'!

50
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,988
Well, I'll be.
Stoppin' right here.

51
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:47,589
Now, folks, you'll have to stand back.
Stand well back, please.

52
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:49,507
Give us plenty of room.

53
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,712
All right, Fred,
bring him out.

54
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:55,152
- Hang on to that dog, boy.
Stand back, folks.
- Quiet, Trumpeter. Quiet, boy.

55
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,589
<i>I can hardly believe my eyes.</i>

56
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:05,986
<i>Dan Patch himself.</i>

57
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,670
<i>The greatest racehorse
in the world.</i>

58
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:17,709
<i>Of course, I'd collected
a lot of pictures of him...</i>

59
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:22,745
<i>from calendars and magazines,
but I never dreamed
I'd get to look right at him!</i>

60
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:26,545
<i>Yet here he was,
right in Fulton Corners.</i>

61
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,912
<i>And they'd stopped the Limited
just so he could get some exercise.</i>

62
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,635
- Loose nail on his shoe, Abe.
- He must have pawed it loose,
Mr Burns.

63
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:37,311
- He gets restless travellin' so far.
- He'll have that shoe off
time we get to Louisville.

64
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,910
- There a blacksmith in this town?
- I'm a smith, sir.

65
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:43,784
- Could I get you to clinch
a new nail in his shoe?
- Sure.

66
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,912
- Bring your tools, Abe.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,386
Steady, boy.

68
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:07,552
- He wants your apple, kid.
- All right. He can have it.

69
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,627
Ain't wormy, is it?

70
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,747
All right.
You can give it to him.

71
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:17,506
<i>I can still feel the touch
of his soft, black nose...</i>

72
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,791
<i>and his warm breath
on my hand.</i>

73
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:24,708
<i>And I couldn't help thinkin'
how wonderful it'd be
to own a horse like him.</i>

74
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,307
What do I owe you?

75
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,266
- I'll just keep this nail.
- Thanks very much.

76
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:38,348
All right, boys, let's get rolling.
Stand back, folks, please.

77
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,267
Board!

78
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:04,155
<i>Oh, get out the way
for old Dan Patch</i>

79
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,830
<i>De diddle di diddle do
Dan Patch</i>

80
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,827
<i>Get out the way
for old Dan Patch</i>

81
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,271
<i>Git, git
git out of the way</i>

82
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,267
Bet you wouldn't
take $ 1 00 for it.

83
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:16,951
- Heck, no!
- City folks been payin'
as much as 50 cents...

84
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,311
for just a single hair
out of his tail.

85
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,512
- My goodness!
- Know what?

86
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:23,507
- What?
- I'm gonna get me a colt...

87
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:26,064
and raise him up to be
a world's champion like Dan Patch.

88
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,511
- Betcha Granny wouldn't let ya.
- Don't know why not.

89
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,668
I'd make a lot of money,
'cause he'd win all the races, I bet.

90
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:35,669
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
I'm afraid your horse'd
have quite a handicap.

91
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:39,032
- Why?
- Well, knowin' your granny...

92
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:42,791
I'm afraid he'd have to do
all of his racin' with a plough
hitched onto his tail.

93
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,203
<i>I knew what Uncle Hiram meant,
all right.</i>

94
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,487
<i>For Granny's job was more
than just raising me.</i>

95
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,004
<i>She had to run a farm single-handed...</i>

96
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,240
<i>and what with ploughing
and planting...</i>

97
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,288
<i>raising sheep,
spinning wool...</i>

98
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,203
<i>she had little time or patience
for my daydreams.</i>

99
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,643
<i>So, as I added today's big idea
to the collection in my scrapbook...</i>

100
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,688
<i>I knew my chances
were pretty slim.</i>

101
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,761
<i>Granny'd probably say no.</i>

102
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,369
<i>- But as the wise old owl put it:
- Yes, we'll gather...</i>

103
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,010
<i>''Nothing ventured, nothing gained.''
- at the river</i>

104
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,878
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

105
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,440
<i>Gather with the saints
at the river</i>

106
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,760
- That flows by--
- Granny!

107
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,206
Land sakes,Jeremiah Kincaid.
You still awake?

108
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,724
Why don't we trade
General Jackson for a mare?

109
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,847
What's the matter with old General
Jackson? We don't need no mare.

110
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,319
If we had a mare,
we could get a colt.

111
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,321
We don't need no colt.

112
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,446
Don't see why
we couldn't trade him off.

113
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,169
What good's
an old mule anyhow?

114
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,963
A mule is steady and reliable...

115
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,200
and he earns his livin'
by doin' honest work...

116
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,044
and that's the last time
I wanna hear you criticizing
poor old General Jackson.

117
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,041
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

118
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,918
- You get on back to bed.
- Can't sleep.

119
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,764
Well, you try countin' sheep instead
of colts, and you'll go to sleep.

120
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,920
Yes'm. Reckon the lambs
were born yet?

121
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,047
The lambs'll be born
in the Lord's good time.

122
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,243
I reckon I had better go and see.

123
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,163
Lemme go with you, Granny.
Please?

124
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,127
Well, I reckon.

125
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,770
As long as you're so wide awake
and full of ginger.

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,445
- Put on your boots.
- Yes, ma'am!

127
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,159
- Put on your jacket!
- Yes'm!

128
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,565
- Granny, they've come already!
- Yes, sir.

129
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,925
Three brand new ones!

130
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:10,448
All pert and sassy too.

131
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,920
Fetch me that pitchfork.

132
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,840
Granny, look!

133
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,720
Jezebel's got twins!

134
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,207
Gee! Ain't he a beauty?

135
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,564
Black as a lump of coal.

136
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,163
Look, Granny.
He ain't a bit afraid.

137
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,800
Nothing's born afraid.

138
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,001
Nice boy.

139
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,159
You hungry, little fella?

140
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,558
Hold still,Jezebel.
This little fella's hungry too.

141
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,685
Help me hold her, Granny.

142
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,484
What's the matter with you,
you fool sheep?

143
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,879
Hold still,
you ornery critter, you.

144
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,880
What's the matter with her?
Is she crazy?

145
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:31,487
Oh, sometimes
they're like that... with twins.
Especially when one of them's black.

146
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,560
You mean she won't take him?

147
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,721
- You mean she's gonna let him die?
- Well.

148
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,882
Maybe she'll take him
after we get outta here
and she can't see that he's black.

149
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,279
Here. Better wrap the little critter up
against the cold.

150
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,883
But, Granny, suppose she don't.

151
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:48,880
Suppose she don't take him.

152
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,085
Well, that's in the hands
of the Lord.

153
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:54,764
They're his critters, and their ways
are the ways he give 'em...

154
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,840
and there's nothin'
we can do about it.

155
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,765
The ways of nature
seem cruel sometimes and hard...

156
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,317
but there's a plan behind it all.

157
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,606
Oh, he knoweth
every sparrow that falleth.

158
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:30,600
Jeremiah, fetch me
another one of them flower sacks
for this little critter.

159
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,721
Jeremiah! I said
to fetch me one of them--

160
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,324
Tarnation.

161
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,482
Jeremiah Kincaid,
I'm puttin' my foot down.

162
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,567
I mean it.

163
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,200
If you think I'm gonna have
my kitchen smellin' like a stable,
you got another think comin'.

164
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,479
It ain't civilized,
it ain't sanitary and it--

165
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,761
Well. One of
my best dish towels.

166
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,360
It's got to be boiled anyway.

167
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,286
If you want to get it warm,
you'd better take it in by the fire.

168
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,008
- You mean I can--
- I mean that you can get it warm...

169
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,683
before you take it
back out where it belongs.

170
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,365
If we bottle-raise that lamb,
it'll get to be a pet.

171
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,963
Come time to market it,
you'll wanna keep it.

172
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,606
Besides, it's black.
I don't fancy black wool.

173
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:12,645
Never did.

174
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:18,081
And you know well as I do
we can't afford critters around here
that don't earn their keep.

175
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,160
Hard enough
to make ends meet as it is.

176
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,278
I'd take care of him, Granny.

177
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:28,760
I'd feed him and take care of him
and everything, Granny.

178
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,283
Oh, he'll grow up
to be underfoot.

179
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:33,678
I know the nature
of them black sheep.

180
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,239
Especially a ram.
He'll be into everything.

181
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,127
It ain't practical.
It just don't make sense.

182
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,847
You wouldn't be bad.
Would you, boy?

183
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,968
Might as well
warm his insides too.

184
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,319
Look at his face, Granny.

185
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,923
Hasn't he got
a cute little face?

186
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,079
Wicked little face,
if you ask me.

187
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,043
You gonna let me keep him?

188
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:16,085
Well, we'll see.

189
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,806
<i>So, that's how it all came about.</i>

190
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:25,484
<i>I'd traded my dream of owning
a champion racehorse...</i>

191
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,083
<i>for a measly
little old black lamb.</i>

192
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,317
<i>As the wise old owl put it...</i>

193
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,683
<i>''A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.''</i>

194
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,287
<i>Of course, I--</i>

195
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,678
<i>I knew Granny would never
let me keep him for good.</i>

196
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:56,446
<i>Not if he turned out to be
just an ordinary sheep.</i>

197
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:04,482
<i>Danny would have to
amount to something.
Something extra special.</i>

198
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:08,439
<i>A champion, for instance.</i>

199
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,565
Hey, if you're aimin'
to carry that wreath around,
you better keep your chin up...

200
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,116
and your feet
on the ground.

201
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,802
There.
That's better.

202
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,163
Makin' a champ
out of a critter like you...

203
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,239
won't be an easy thing to do.

204
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,239
Well, let's see now.

205
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,319
Come over here, Danny,
and we'll take a look.

206
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,399
Maybe get some help
from the wisdom book.

207
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,683
You know, just 'cause you're
a little old sheep...

208
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:46,407
don't mean you can't
get to the top of the heap.

209
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,277
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

210
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:56,243
Every dog has his day.

211
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,562
Yes. It sounds kinda corny,
I'll admit...

212
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:03,367
but we oughta find somethin'
that'll help a bit.

213
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,677
''A rolling stone--''

214
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,759
Nah, that don't fit.

215
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,884
Here we are, Danny.
This is it.

216
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,638
It's what you dew--

217
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:21,960
Eh? Oh! Y-Yes.

218
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:28,885
It's what you d-o
do with what you got that counts.
Yes, sir.

219
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,641
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

220
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,481
<i>And never mind
how much you got</i>

221
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:37,207
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

222
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:39,961
<i>That pays off in the end</i>

223
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:42,926
<i>You gotta start with
with what you got</i>

224
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:45,761
<i>If what you got
ain't such a lot</i>

225
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:48,681
<i>To make the most
of what you got</i>

226
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:51,487
<i>Here's what I recommend</i>

227
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,401
<i>You start by a-tryin'</i>

228
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,241
<i>And applyin'your best</i>

229
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:59,842
<i>If you try
there ain't no denyin'</i>

230
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:02,488
<i>There's a way
to feather your nest</i>

231
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:05,685
<i>- Hey!
- You gotta add how what you do</i>

232
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:08,566
<i>And multiply
by what you do</i>

233
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,367
<i>You think you can't win
but you do</i>

234
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,837
<i>And you get back dividends</i>

235
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:18,367
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

236
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,246
<i>And never mind
how much ya got</i>

237
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,240
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

238
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:27,206
<i>That pays off
in the end</i>

239
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:30,041
<i>It's the means
you ''applyeth''</i>

240
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,722
<i>That raises your stock</i>

241
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:35,720
<i>Look what David
did to Goliath</i>

242
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,606
<i>With a little old
hunk of rock</i>

243
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:41,361
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

244
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,440
<i>And never mind
how much you got</i>

245
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,122
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

246
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,438
<i>That pays off</i>

247
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,520
<i>In the end</i>

248
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,721
<i>Now lookee here, son
Stop a-sittin'</i>

249
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,561
<i>Gettin'somewhere
takes some gettin'</i>

250
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:04,720
<i>You can't sit and 'spect</i>

251
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:07,322
<i>- To get it
- Do oo-oo do oo-oo</i>

252
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,127
<i>Now the road to fame
takes muscle</i>

253
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,722
<i>Lots of work
and lots of hustle</i>

254
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:17,518
<i>So start right in
and hit it</i>

255
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,721
<i>Now if at first
you don't succeed</i>

256
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:24,527
<i>A lot of spunk
is what you need</i>

257
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,441
<i>Or someone else
will take the lead</i>

258
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,996
<i>So try, try, try again</i>

259
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:33,205
<i>Just get up
when you fall down</i>

260
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,438
<i>And don't be forlorn</i>

261
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:38,964
<i>Look how Joshua
busted that wall down</i>

262
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:41,357
<i>With a little old measly horn</i>

263
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:45,686
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

264
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,965
<i>And never mind
just how much you got</i>

265
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,926
<i>It's what you do
with what you got</i>

266
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,647
<i>That pays off
in the end</i>

267
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,684
<i>That pays off</i>

268
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,825
<i>In the end</i>

269
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,099
<i>In the end</i>

270
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,622
You ornery critter.
That's the last damage you're gonna do.

271
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,616
You got no business
bein' a pet anyhow.

272
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,138
You're just a sheep.

273
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,136
And you're gonna stay
where sheep belong.

274
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,739
He won't do it again, Granny.
Honest he won't.

275
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:29,022
It's not only what he's been doin'.
It's what you ain't been doin'.

276
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:31,494
Night and day
from the time he was born...

277
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:34,497
you've had nothin' else
on your mind 'cept that critter.

278
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,338
- Ya ain't been doin'
the weedin' or the hoein'.
- But, Granny, I was gonna--

279
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:40,781
And winter cord wood
ain't been pilin' up like it ought to.

280
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:44,255
From now on, you're not to be
neglectin' your chores.

281
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,018
And that critter's not to be
runnin' around loose.

282
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,096
- Do you understand?
- Yes'm.

283
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:14,263
Aw, gee whiz, Danny.

284
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,256
Granny, she don't understand.

285
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,381
She thinks you're
just an ordinary sheep.

286
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,663
Ya know what?
I'm gonna build you a pen...

287
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,942
so's you'll have lots of
sunshine and exercise...

288
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,016
and fresh air.

289
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:31,745
I saw some real wire fencing
at Grundy's store...

290
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,817
and I'm goin' down there right now
and see how much it costs.

291
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,855
This ain't as though
you were runnin' around loose.

292
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,936
Promise to behave
if I take ya?

293
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:18,815
Danny! Danny!

294
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:21,863
Get him out!
Go on, now!

295
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:24,743
- Look out! Get him out!
- Watch out, Danny! watch out!

296
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,295
- Infernal thing!
- Danny!

297
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,336
- Get out!
- Danny! Danny!

298
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:37,895
If you ever bring that
black varmint in my store again...

299
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,896
I'll draw and quarter him!

300
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,021
I will, so help me Hannah.

301
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,902
Look at my screen door!

302
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:47,658
I'll get it fixed,
Mr Grundy!

303
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,657
You're mighty right you will!
You're mighty right you will!

304
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,413
Wasn't Danny's fault. He was just
standin' there lookin' at the candy.

305
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:08,293
Old Fud Grundy snuck up and shot him
with a bean blower or something.

306
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:11,855
He jumped a little bit,
and some eggs fell out of a basket.

307
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:14,095
It was Mr Grundy
knocked over the flour barrel...

308
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,255
and he chased Danny
through the door.

309
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:20,664
Who chased him
through this door?

310
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:24,101
- Granny?
- Aw, gee whiz, Uncle Hiram.

311
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:26,745
All anybody ever sees
is the bad things.

312
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,544
Nobody ever notices
all the good things he can do.

313
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,219
- For instance.
- Well...

314
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,934
he can jump higher
and run faster...

315
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:40,222
than any other lamb
in Pike County, I'll bet.

316
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:44,376
If he was a horse,
he'd be a world's champion...

317
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,820
when he grows up.

318
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:48,861
- Uncle Hiram.
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,823
Horses get to be champions
by winnin' races.

320
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:55,864
- What about things that don't race?
- What kind of things, for instance?

321
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,617
Well, um--

322
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:01,664
Pigs, for instance, and cows,
and roosters, for instance.

323
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:05,656
And maybe sheep,
for instance?

324
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:11,020
Well, sheep, you'd take them
to the county fair.

325
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,665
Now, you take like
that ram of yours.

326
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,213
And, uh, make like
that I was the judge...

327
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,341
at the county fair,
for instance.

328
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:20,780
Stand him up there,
Mr Kincaid...

329
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:23,902
- so that I can look him over.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,419
Stand back, folks.

331
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,780
You too, little girl.

332
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:33,416
Keep a tight hold on that rope,
young man. That animal looks
to me like he's a killer.

333
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,700
I got him,Judge.

334
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:42,538
Chest:
1 2 feet and 1 1 inches.

335
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,380
Height to shoulder:

336
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:48,774
twenty-two feet
and four inches.

337
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,621
Teeth like a buzz-saw.

338
00:25:57,745 --> 00:26:00,657
Eyes like shootin' stars.

339
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:02,303
Mr Kincaid...

340
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:04,660
you've got quite
an animal there.

341
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,815
Yes, sir, and as judge
of this county fair...

342
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:09,658
it's not only my privilege and honour
but my bound and duty...

343
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,737
to present you
with the grand champion blue ribbon...

344
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:16,294
and...

345
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,296
the cash award.

346
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:20,376
Thank you,Judge.

347
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,296
Gee, look at all the clover.

348
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:49,060
Oh, boy! If he eats enough clover,
he'll get to be a champion.

349
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:51,659
A champion? Him?

350
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:55,454
I'm gonna take him to the county fair
and win the blue ribbon and cash award.

351
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:58,184
- You are not.
- I am so.

352
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:03,497
- Did your granny say you could go?
- Haven't told her yet, but I will.

353
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:07,574
If I helped you feed him
and everything...

354
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:10,543
maybe I could go
to the fair too. Huh?

355
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,496
Here she comes!

356
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:36,143
- Danny! Danny!
- Danny!

357
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:41,175
Danny! Danny!

358
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,940
- Danny!
- Danny!

359
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:50,862
<i>Granny don't like black sheep</i>

360
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:53,505
<i>She grabbed him
by the throat</i>

361
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,974
<i>Looks like
this here black sheep</i>

362
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,454
<i>Is a-gittin'Granny's goat</i>

363
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:00,775
<i>Baa, baa, black sheep</i>

364
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>Oh, what trouble
you've put Granny through</i>

365
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:07,502
- Baa, baa, black sheep
- It ain't so much what the lamb
is doin' to me...

366
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,496
as what it's a-doin' to the boy.

367
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,894
Ya needn't say a word about it,
'cause I made up my mind.

368
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:14,260
- I didn't say a word.
- Well, I know what you're thinkin'.

369
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:16,905
Outright disobedience is
one thing I won't stand for.

370
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:19,545
But, Granny, the boy
ain't exactly disobeyin' you.

371
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,900
I'd like to know what ya call it.
The barn door's open, ain't it?

372
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:23,896
The lamb's gone,
and so is the boy.

373
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,021
The lamb ain't
a-runnin' around loose.

374
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,573
The boy's got him
under control. Now.

375
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:31,976
I don't wanna be hard
on the boy, and...

376
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:34,977
I don't wanna sell the lamb,
less'n I have to...

377
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:37,420
but you don't know the half
of what we've been through...

378
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:41,817
and the very next time
that little varmint busts
something or gets into some--

379
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,941
What's that?

380
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,177
Under control, eh?

381
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,455
I'll get him, Granny!
I'll catch him!

382
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:15,779
Oh, give me strength.

383
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,977
Goodness' sake!
Go that way! Head him off!

384
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,456
Danny!

385
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,376
Gee whiz, Danny.

386
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,616
Aw, gee whiz.

387
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,976
The lamb'll be better off.

388
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,578
Mr Turner'll stop by in the morning
and take him away...

389
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,735
and find him
a good home somewhere.

390
00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:48,218
It ain't as if
I was sellin' him on the market.

391
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,500
Do you hear me?

392
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:54,100
And it ain't as if I was goin' back
on my word,Jeremiah...

393
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,745
'cause I never did say
you could keep the lamb.

394
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:59,544
I said we'd see.

395
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,900
So don't you go
feelin' mean...

396
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,294
and put out with your old granny
about it either.

397
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,376
You hear me?

398
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:12,981
You hear me?
Jeremiah!

399
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:18,696
Jeremiah?

400
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,221
What's a body gonna do?

401
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:33,018
<i>Granny Kincaid made a vow
to get rid of that lamb</i>

402
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:34,424
<i>She didn't know how</i>

403
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,860
<i>She changed her mind
by a happenstance</i>

404
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,698
<i>Gonna give that black lamb
one more chance</i>

405
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:42,060
<i>If you get outta this pen
you ornery critter</i>

406
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,454
<i>You'll end up
a fried lamb fritter</i>

407
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,900
<i>If you don't be good
and settle down</i>

408
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:49,180
<i>You'll be roasted
a golden brown</i>

409
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:51,460
See that, Danny?
You can't squeeze through anywhere.

410
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:56,300
- Nor butt it down neither.
- And you better not,
or you'll spoil everything.

411
00:32:56,385 --> 00:33:00,537
There it is-- hogtied,
horse-high and... bull-strong.

412
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,697
Gee, Uncle Hiram, look how big
his chest and shoulders are gettin'.

413
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,343
He's lookin' more like
a champion every day.

414
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:09,941
When are ya gonna ask Granny,Jerry?
When are ya? Huh,Jerry?

415
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,937
Well, she hasn't quite forgave him
for bustin' her rockin' chair.

416
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,459
Don't worry about that.
I got it fixed already as good as new.

417
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:18,503
- You have?
- You have?
- Yeah. I tell ya what.

418
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:21,145
Suppose when I
take it back tonight...

419
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:24,740
that I just accidentally
happen to mention something
about the county fair.

420
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:28,535
And before she knows
what's goin' on...

421
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,741
I'll put it over.

422
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:38,934
<i>Lavender's blue
Dilly dilly</i>

423
00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:41,015
<i>Lavender's green</i>

424
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:45,699
<i>If I were king
Dilly dilly</i>

425
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:47,820
<i>I'd need a queen</i>

426
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:52,140
<i>Who told me so
Dilly dilly</i>

427
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:55,375
<i>Who told me so</i>

428
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:58,695
<i>I told myself
Dilly dilly</i>

429
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,252
<i>I told me so</i>

430
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,973
<i>If your dilly dilly heart
feels a dilly dilly way</i>

431
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:08,101
<i>And if you answer yes</i>

432
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:11,620
<i>In the pretty little church
on the dilly dilly day</i>

433
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:14,343
<i>You'll be wed
in a dilly dilly dress</i>

434
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:18,656
<i>Of lavender blue
Dilly dilly</i>

435
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:21,542
<i>Lavender green</i>

436
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:25,663
<i>Then I'll be king
Dilly dilly</i>

437
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,941
<i>And you'll be</i>

438
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:32,414
<i>My queen</i>

439
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:44,422
<i>Oh, where have you been
Billy boy, Billy boy</i>

440
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:48,338
<i>Oh, where have you been
charmin'Billy</i>

441
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:52,463
<i>I have been to seek a wife
She's thejoy of my life</i>

442
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,742
<i>She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother</i>

443
00:34:56,824 --> 00:35:01,022
<i>Is she often seen in church
Billy boy, Billy boy</i>

444
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:04,574
<i>Is she often seen in church
charmin'Billy</i>

445
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:07,132
<i>Yes, she's often
seen in church</i>

446
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:09,692
<i>With a bonnet
white as birch</i>

447
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:14,175
<i>She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother</i>

448
00:35:14,264 --> 00:35:18,177
<i>Can she bake a cherry pie
Billy boy, Billy boy</i>

449
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:22,177
<i>Can she bake a cherry pie
charmin'Billy</i>

450
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:24,061
<i>She can bake a cherry pie</i>

451
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,374
<i>Quick as a cat
can wink its eye</i>

452
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:30,776
<i>She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother</i>

453
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:34,903
<i>- How old is she--
- How old is she
Billy boy, Billy boy</i>

454
00:35:34,984 --> 00:35:38,943
<i>How old is she
charmin'Billy</i>

455
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:41,982
<i>Three times six
Four times seven</i>

456
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:44,453
<i>Twenty-eight
and eleven</i>

457
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:48,537
<i>Oh, she's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother</i>

458
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,696
<i>She's a young thing</i>

459
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:56,096
<i>And cannot leave
her mother</i>

460
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:06,500
<i>Do do dee dee doop
Boop-boop boop-boop</i>

461
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,814
<i>Do do dee dee doop
Boop-boop boop-boop</i>

462
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:12,656
<i>Do do dee dee doop
Boop-boop boop-boop</i>

463
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:15,177
Do you know what that is,Jerry?

464
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:18,653
That's the tune you most usually hear
on a merry-go-round.

465
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:22,213
That's a funny thing, that tune
making me think of merry-go-rounds.

466
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:26,296
You know, the last time
that I heard a merry-go-round
was at the county fair.

467
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,541
You know somethin', Granny?

468
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,614
I know we ain't goin'
to no county fair...

469
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:35,137
if that's what all this rigamarole's
leadin' up to.

470
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:38,101
Who said anything about
goin' to the county fair?

471
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:40,299
You was fixin' to.

472
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:43,102
These children washin' dishes
without bein' told.

473
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:45,936
- I wasn't born yesterday.
- Now, wait a minute.

474
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:50,221
Haven't you got a notion about
takin' that black sheep of yours
to the county fair,Jeremiah?

475
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:52,498
- Well, I--
- Now, wait a minute, Granny.

476
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,575
I was a-thinkin' about
these ''kiwers'' of yours here.

477
00:36:57,663 --> 00:37:00,735
Thought maybe you'd like
to let the outlanders see what
a kiwer really looks like.

478
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:05,056
Sometimes I think you ain't
a day older than these young 'uns...

479
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:07,941
with all the tomfool notions
you get in your head.

480
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:12,175
Lots of folks don't think
county fairs are such tomfool notions.

481
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,254
All the best kiwer makers
in Pike County...

482
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:16,811
will more'n likely
take their kiwers.

483
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:19,212
And one of them kiwers
is gonna win the blue ribbon...

484
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,294
and the cash award.

485
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:24,181
Well, it won't be my kiwer,
'cause I ain't goin'.

486
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:29,936
Aw, Granny.
Why not?

487
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:32,696
'Cause I ain't a traipsin' woman
in the first place...

488
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:37,573
and I don't make my kiwers
for the sake of blue ribbons
and cash awards.

489
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,813
I make 'em
'cause they pleasure me.

490
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:46,861
Mama's already sent away
for the pattern for my new dress.

491
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:50,731
- What's that got to do with it?
- I was gonna wear it to the fair.

492
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:53,417
Tsk. Honey.

493
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:58,497
It's time you learned
not to go settin' your heart
on the daydreams of menfolks.

494
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:05,412
Well, it was just an idea.

495
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,688
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought it up in the first place.

496
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:14,168
Ya, when folks get old,
it's best they sit around the fire
and bake their shins.

497
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,244
Meanin' me.

498
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,451
- You ain't no spring chicken, Granny.
- I'll live to dance on your grave.

499
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,525
I'm afraid, Granny,
that your dancin' days are over.

500
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:30,724
I can dance you down any day!

501
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:34,328
Jeremiah, go turn on
''Cricket On The Fryin' Pan.''

502
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:38,843
- Yes'm. Excuse me.
- Get to your feet,
if you dare, Hiram Douglas!

503
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:41,049
That's right sassy talk
for a granny-woman!

504
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,249
''Old,'' huh?
I'll show you who's old.

505
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:48,082
''The Soldier's Joy''
played by the Kentucky Quintet.

506
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,289
A Morning Glory record.

507
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,804
<i>Well, buckle your belts
and tighten your traces</i>

508
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:57,884
<i>All clap hands
We're off to the races</i>

509
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:01,484
<i>Right hands cross
How do you do</i>

510
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,643
<i>Left hand back
And how are you</i>

511
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,564
<i>Take your honey
and give her a swing</i>

512
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,564
<i>Allemande around
the great big ring</i>

513
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,370
<i>Tra la la la la la la</i>

514
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,047
<i>Tra la la-la la-la</i>

515
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,044
<i>Swing old Adam
Swing old Eve</i>

516
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,283
<i>Swing your own
before you leave</i>

517
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:23,765
<i>Chase a rabbit
Chase a squirrel</i>

518
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,764
<i>Chase that pretty girl
'round the world</i>

519
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,445
<i>Now the possum
Now the 'coon</i>

520
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,569
<i>Chase that pretty boy
'round the moon</i>

521
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,450
<i>Promenade eight
till you get straight</i>

522
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,489
<i>Better hurry up, boys
And don't be late</i>

523
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:37,486
<i>Swing your partner, swing your dog
Swing that girl from Arkansas</i>

524
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:40,645
<i>Swing your grandma 'cross the hall
She ain't been swung
since way last fall</i>

525
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:44,043
<i>Swing her high, swing her low
Wanna keep on swingin'that calico</i>

526
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,725
<i>When you get to your gal again</i>

527
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:47,610
<i>Swing your sweetie
with a once and a half</i>

528
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:01,208
Jeremiah, turn on
''Fire In The Briar Patch.''

529
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,602
- No, don't do it,Jeremiah!
- Well, then turn it off.

530
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:07,766
Take it back. Get to your feet
and dance, or eat them words
and eat 'em proper.

531
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:10,083
You're as spry as a chickadee...

532
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,971
and can outdance anybody
at the county fair!

533
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:15,851
- We're gonna go!
- We're goin'!

534
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:19,209
Now, now. Come on.
Let's tidy up a bit, huh?

535
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,044
That's it.

536
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:28,250
We'll ride on the merry-go-round,
the Ferris wheel and everything.

537
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,530
And when Danny wins a blue ribbon
and the cash award...

538
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:34,923
and get off the train
at Fulton Township,
everybody'll be there.

539
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:38,528
And old Fud Grundy,
he'll turn green as a summer pickle.

540
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,728
Now hold on a minute,Jeremiah.

541
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,771
I didn't say that we were going
to the county fair.

542
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,447
In the first place, it costs money
to ride on the train...

543
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,444
and it costs money
after you get there.

544
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,366
Well, maybe I could,
uh, kinda help out in that direction.

545
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,287
Well, maybe you could,
but I've always paid my own way...

546
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,284
and I hope Jeremiah'll
always pay his.

547
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:03,285
I was talkin' about a little loan.

548
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,127
We'll have plenty of money
when Danny wins the cash award.

549
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:09,932
The Kincaids never spend money
they ain't got...

550
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:11,924
and we've no way to get it...

551
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,766
so just best forget
the whole thing.

552
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:19,053
But we can
get it somehow, Granny.

553
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,603
I know we can.
We can pray for it.

554
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,685
In this house,
we don't pray for cash money...

555
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,809
only for things
of the spirit.

556
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:38,448
Come on, Tilda. We better be gittin'.
It's time you were in bed.

557
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:45,166
Goodnight,Jerry.

558
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,642
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

559
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:23,822
Hey. Hey there!
Don't tell me you're givin' up?

560
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:29,341
Now where there's a will
there's a way to do it

561
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:33,421
But you'll never get there
if you don't stick to it

562
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,067
Now let me tell you about a fella
who had the right stuff...

563
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:44,299
and wouldn't give up
even when the goin' got rough.

564
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:48,897
Now, uh--

565
00:42:48,988 --> 00:42:51,786
Christopher Columbus
a-livin'in Spain

566
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,587
Showed capacity
for usin'his brain

567
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:57,501
Studied his geography
Had it down pat

568
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:00,022
Said I'm gonna prove
that the world ain't flat

569
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:05,187
Because she thought he was right
Queen Isabella one night

570
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:06,860
Gave him three small boats

571
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:09,178
One, two three

572
00:43:09,268 --> 00:43:12,658
Now, uh, the boats were kinda leaky
Started to sail

573
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:15,546
Came a hurricane
A furious gale

574
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:19,742
Waves were a-lashin'
Future looked black

575
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,027
- Sailors started yellin'
- Chris, turn back

576
00:43:25,108 --> 00:43:29,021
<i>On that eventful day
what did Columbus say</i>

577
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:33,902
<i>Why, I said
stick-to-it-ivity</i>

578
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:35,899
<i>If you got that stuff</i>

579
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,060
<i>Called stick-to-it-ivity</i>

580
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:41,821
<i>You're gonna do all right</i>

581
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:44,706
<i>Old man adversity's</i>

582
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,382
<i>Gonna have his bluff called</i>

583
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:50,187
<i>Stick-to-it-ivity</i>

584
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:51,860
<i>Never lost a fight</i>

585
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:54,587
<i>- Yes siree
- Yes siree</i>

586
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:57,740
<i>- Yes siree
- Yes siree</i>

587
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:02,583
<i>You can clear the deck
for opportunity</i>

588
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:06,456
<i>By applyin'
stick-to-it-ivity</i>

589
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:09,426
<i>If ya got that stuff called</i>

590
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:12,102
<i>Stick-to-it-ivity</i>

591
00:44:12,188 --> 00:44:16,227
<i>- You're gonna do all right
- Land ho!
- Land ho!</i>

592
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:18,344
<i>We're gonna do all right</i>

593
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:24,743
Now, don't think Columbus
was the only one...

594
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,342
who did what folks said
couldn't be done.

595
00:44:27,428 --> 00:44:30,022
So when folks say,
'''Taint no use''...

596
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,827
Remember
Robert Bruce

597
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:38,583
Now, Robert was the bravest king
Scotland has ever known.

598
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:41,660
<i>Came the enemy
to threaten his throne</i>

609
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:22,947

Old Jeremiah

He'd eat sassafras
fast as he can

00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:26,504
Oh, another batch
of sassafras, huh?

640
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:28,181
Yes, sir.

641
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,426
- Well, that's 1 8 pounds.
- How much does it come to, Mr Grundy?

642
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:43,945
Two cents a pound
comes to thirty-six cents.

643
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:48,022
- I mean all together.
- Well, this here's June,July...

644
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:51,738
and thirty-six cents
in August is nine, eight--

645
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,899
That's $2.1 4.

646
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:57,220
- Is that all?
- Well, cipher it for yourself.

647
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,539
I mean,
it's not gonna be enough.

648
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:05,022
What you savin' all this money up for,
Jeremiah? Goin' to college?

649
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:07,577
Mr Grundy! Mama wants
a pint of wild honey.

650
00:48:07,669 --> 00:48:10,900
Aunt Margaret's cough's come back
on her, and Mama wants to make
some wild honey cough syrup.

651
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:15,107
I ain't had a drop of wild honey
in this store in I don't know how long.

652
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:17,305
Must be three years or better.

653
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:20,699
Go ask your mama
if tame honey won't do!

654
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:22,859
Now there's an idea
for you,Jeremiah.

655
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:26,498
You wanna get rich quick, go out
and find yourself a wild bee tree.

656
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,580
Pay you ten cents a pound,
cash money.

657
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:31,229
How do you find
a wild bee tree, Mr Grundy?

658
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,268
Hmm? Why, just find a bee
and follow him home.

659
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:42,259
Thanks a lot, Mr Grundy!

660
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:46,181
You don't care how you waste
that boy's time, do ya?

661
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:48,260
What's time to a boy?

662
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:58,187
King it.

663
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,000
Watch him now.
Watch which way he goes.

664
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,274
He's just flyin' around in circles.

665
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,669
Maybe he ain't got no home.

666
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,990
Every bee's got a home.

667
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,039
There he goes. He's flyin'
straight ahead. Come on!

668
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,876
He's headed for the swamp. That's six
of'em that's headed in the same way.

669
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,669
- Well, we can't go in there.
- Why not?

670
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,116
'Cause. Nobody ever goes in there.

671
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,478
It's full of bog holes
and briers and everything.

672
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,677
That's just it. That's where
I'd hide my honey if I was a bee.

673
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,796
- Wouldn't you?
- I guess so, but--

674
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,078
We've looked everywhere else,
haven't we? It's gotta be in there.

675
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,834
Look!

676
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,911
What's that?

677
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,231
Aw, just some old bones.

678
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,438
- Whose bones?
-Just an old cow or somethin'.

679
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,238
What killed it?

680
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,311
Nothin'. It just died.

681
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,838
- How do you know?
- I just know, that's all.

682
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,429
If you're afraid of snakes,
go on home.

683
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,988
- I'm not afraid.
- Then come on!

684
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,035
-Jerry!
- Hey, look out!

685
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,797
See that?
That's a bog hole.

686
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,190
If you fall in that,
you never would get out.

687
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,556
Don't you step anywhere
I don't step.

688
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,596
Don't take such long steps.

689
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,872
What's that?

690
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,879
Aw, just some old dogs
huntin' a rabbit or somethin'.

691
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,272
Maybe it's that pack of wild dogs,
the sheep killers. And maybe they--

692
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,272
They won't bother us.
We ain't no sheep.

693
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,876
Papa said the wolves have all
been killed off around here long ago.

694
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,032
Uncle Hiram said so too.
So did Granny.

695
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,831
There goes a bee.

696
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,552
It's gettin' late. Why don't we
come back tomorrow,Jerry?

697
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,798
Papa said sometimes it took
bee hunters-- grown men even--

698
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,599
two or three years
to find a bee tree.

699
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,513
Hey, there goes another one!

700
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,833
Wasn't nothin'
but an old dragonfly.

701
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,912
Come on. Guess we
might as well go home.

702
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,994
Look!

703
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,230
There's a redbird.

704
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,074
Redbird, redbird...
where, where?

705
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,990
He said, ''Here, here.''

706
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,232
Oh, them crazy old redbirds
don't know nothin' about bees.

707
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,673
There's a martin!
They eat bees.

708
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,352
Come on!

709
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,192
Listen.

710
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,759
- There it is!
- Where?

711
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,956
In that old redwood tree!

712
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,630
I found it! I found it!

713

- Well, I'll be darned.
- Weigh it up, Pete.

728
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,222
What are you gonna do
with all that money?

The only prize he'd win
would be the booby prize.

731
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:54,460
I'm takin' my lamb

- That's Granny, all right.

738
00:56:35,652 --> 00:56:36,926
Whoa.

739
00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:42,042
- Have you seen Tildy?
- What's wrong?

740
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:45,647
I been trampin' them woods for an hour
and callin' till I'm hoarse as a rain crow.

741

I got here?

742
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:49,726
Oh, my land, not now. I'm tryin'
to tell you that Tildy is lost.

743

- What happened?
- But, Granny, look how much--

744
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:55,202
Hush,Jeremiah. She brought a wagonload
of clover up there to feed that fool lamb...

745
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,443
- and when she opened the gate,
it bolted.
- She let Danny get away?

746
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:00,443
The critter hightailed it
for the deep woods...

747
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:03,092
and the poor child run after it
trying to catch it.

00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:06,721
What business she have openin'
that gate? What'd you let her do it for?

749
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:08,689
-Jeremiah!
- Which way did Danny go?

750
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:13,163
Down by Indian Creek. But they ain't
there now. I've searched every inch of it.

751
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:17,165
Come back here,Jeremiah!
Oh, drat that boy.

752
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:19,686
All he cares about
is that fool lamb.

753
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:25,923
Uncle Hiram!

754
00:57:27,932 --> 00:57:29,365
Thank heaven!

755
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:39,165
Oh, goodness gracious, child.
You had me that worried.

756
00:57:39,252 --> 00:57:43,291
Oh, Granny, I looked everywhere
and called and called.

757
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,761
Oh, my, you're soakin' wet.

758
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:47,843
I fell down in the creek too.

759
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:51,925
Well, let's get her home right away
and into some dry things
before she gets a chill.

760
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:55,448
- What about Jeremiah?
-Jeremiah can take care of himself.

761
00:58:45,961 --> 00:58:48,998
Jeremiah!

762
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:57,796
Jeremiah!

763
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,236
Granny!

764
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:04,797
Granny!

765
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:12,513
Oh, Granny! Now I can find him
with the lantern--

766
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:16,389
Land sakes, boy,
you're just soaked to the bone,
and you're shakin' and shiverin'.

767
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:20,030
- Come along!
- I gotta find him! I just got to!

768
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:22,396
- I heard the dogs!
- Now, listen to me!

769
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:25,200
You can't find him at night
and in this storm. Now, come along now.

770
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,590
- But, Granny--
- Now!

771
00:59:31,603 --> 00:59:33,992
You hardly touched
your supper.

772
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:36,278
I thought maybe
you'd get hungry later.

773
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:39,196
Maybe. Said your prayers?

774
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:49,318
Oh, I know.
It's a vexin' thing.

775
00:59:49,403 --> 00:59:53,032
It's a cruel thing,
havin' your lamb run away.

776
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:55,762
Maybe Danny found
a holler log and crawled into it...

777
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,357
where the dogs
couldn't find him.

778
00:59:58,443 --> 01:00:01,958
Maybe he's snuggled up
under the roots of a big old tree.

779
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:06,395
However it is,
it's beyond our power to help.

780
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,917
All you can do is
just hope for the best...

781
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:12,154
but be prepared
for whatever happens.

782
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:15,599
He ain't dead.
He ain't dead!

783
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:19,676
I didn't say he was. I'm only
tryin' to tell you to remember...

784
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:23,472
that the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

785
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:26,521
Well, he can't have him.
He can't take Danny.

786
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:30,118
You're not tellin' the Lord
what he can do or can't do.

787
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:32,194
The Lord'll do the tellin'.

788
01:00:37,243 --> 01:00:40,553
Oh, this is all my fault.

789
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:43,237
I've seen it comin'.
I've seen it comin' all along.

790
01:00:48,283 --> 01:00:51,081
You've turned your heart away
from the things I've taught you...

791
01:00:51,163 --> 01:00:54,155
ever since you were
a little baby.

792
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:58,513
No,Jeremiah,
you can't do this.

793
01:00:58,603 --> 01:01:02,312
It's one thing,
blamin' poor little Tildy
for letting your lamb get away...

794
01:01:02,403 --> 01:01:06,362
when all she was tryin' to do
was to help you feed him.

795
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:08,877
And it's one thing,
blamin' me.

796
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:12,035
But it's another thing when
you start blamin' your maker.

797
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:19,353
Started out by lovin' the lamb,
and that's why I let you keep him.

798
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:22,560
True love ain't a harmful thing.
True love's a good thing.

799
01:01:22,643 --> 01:01:25,760
It's good for the spirit.

800
01:01:25,843 --> 01:01:27,595
But you don't love
that lamb any more.

801
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:30,356
What you love is blue ribbons
and cash awards.

802
01:01:30,443 --> 01:01:34,561
That's all you're thinkin' about--
things that are vain, things of this world--

803
01:01:34,643 --> 01:01:37,680
until you forgot all about
the things of the spirit.

804
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:45,152
And when you can't have your own way,
you start burdenin' the Lord.

805
01:01:47,243 --> 01:01:49,473
You ain't thinkin' of that lamb.

806
01:01:49,563 --> 01:01:51,872
You're just thinkin' about yourself.

807
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:06,558
You know what's right,Jeremiah...

808
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:10,352
but you'll have to find it in your own
heart to do what's right.

809
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,873
Danny!

810
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:35,279
Danny!

811
01:03:58,582 --> 01:04:00,573
No luck.

812
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:05,412
It's like lookin' for
a needle in a haystack.

813
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:08,938
Ain't laid eyes on the boy,
much less the lamb.

814
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:17,495
Well, there's one thing you can
be sure of. The boy ain't lost.

815
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:20,654
There's more ways of bein' lost
than in the woods.

816
01:04:20,742 --> 01:04:23,131
Ah, but he's just
a young 'un, Granny.

817
01:04:23,222 --> 01:04:25,611
Maybe he is gettin' a little big
for his britches, but--

818
01:04:25,702 --> 01:04:29,411
Granny! Granny!
He found him! He found him!

819
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:33,651
Uncle Hiram!
Look! He found him!

820
01:04:33,742 --> 01:04:38,133
Must've been a guardian angel
somewhere in them woods last night.

821
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:44,976
Happened one was more needed
right here in this house last night.

822
01:04:51,062 --> 01:04:55,021
Well, they don't look much the worse
for the wear, either one of'em.

823
01:04:56,502 --> 01:04:57,855
That's good.

824
01:04:59,422 --> 01:05:03,017
Figurin' on takin' 'em
to the county fair?

825
01:05:03,102 --> 01:05:05,013
I reckon it won't make
much difference.

826
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,662
All we have to do is get the foxtails
out of his wool...

827
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:10,415
and he'll be
just as good as ever.

828
01:05:10,502 --> 01:05:13,062
He was way over
on the far side of the swamp...

829
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:17,055
all snuggled up in a holler log,
Granny, just a-waitin' for me.

830
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:21,213
You hungry, boy?
How about some oatmeal mash?

831
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:24,338
Well, come on.

832
01:05:29,582 --> 01:05:33,291
Mama's got my new dress almost finished,
and a ribbon and a hat to match.

833
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:38,016
I'll stop by in the morning
and pick up the tickets.

834
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:41,014
I've already got a crate for the lamb.
That is, if you say so.

835
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:46,537
I mean, if it's
all right with you.

836
01:05:48,742 --> 01:05:50,539
I reckon.

837
01:05:54,622 --> 01:05:58,297
- What's the matter, Tildy?
- We're not going to the fair.

838
01:05:58,382 --> 01:06:00,100
What's that?

839
01:06:00,182 --> 01:06:03,697
H-He said he wasn't
going to the fair.

840
01:06:03,782 --> 01:06:05,579
Why not?

841
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:09,735
H-He wouldn't tell me.
He just said, ''God.''

842
01:06:29,742 --> 01:06:31,892
He's got plenty
of foxtails on him.

843
01:06:31,982 --> 01:06:34,735
Yes'm, but he ain't got
a scratch on him.

844
01:06:36,382 --> 01:06:37,974
Tildy was cryin'.

845
01:06:40,382 --> 01:06:43,772
She can go to the fair,
and you and Uncle Hiram.

846
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:46,217
You don't figure to go?

847
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:49,692
- Changed my mind.
- You did?

848
01:06:49,782 --> 01:06:53,900
Promised God if he let me find him,
I wouldn't take him to the fair.

849
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:56,818
And he did!

850
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:07,301
Well-- Well now...

851
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:10,135
if this ain't a fine how-de-do.

852
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:12,213
It happened that--

853
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:15,055
Well, it happened
that I made a promise too.

854
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:21,539
I-- I promised God that...

855
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:25,012
if he did let you find him,
that we would go to the fair.

856
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:28,492
And since I've known him
longer than you have, I reckon...

857
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:32,018
it'll be all right with him
if I keep my promise.

858
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:44,055
Go get them cardin' combers.
We've gotta take these foxtails outta him.

859
01:07:44,142 --> 01:07:45,700
Yes'm.

860
01:07:50,302 --> 01:07:52,293
Forgive me, Lord.

861
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:56,097
I meant to tell you before.

862
01:07:57,502 --> 01:08:00,494
Had it in the back
of my mind all the time.

863
01:08:06,136 --> 01:08:09,014
<i>Ho-dee-I, ho-dee-ay</i>

864
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:12,008
<i>What a great big wonderful day</i>

865
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:15,213

867
01:08:18,816 --> 01:08:22,411
<i>Will be there at the county fair</i>

868
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:27,446
<i>Ho-dee-ay, ho-dee-I</i>

869
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,687
<i>What a great big beautiful sky</i>

870
01:08:30,776 --> 01:08:33,848
<i>All the clowns like the crowds</i>

871
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:37,053
<i>You can bet will be dressed
in their brightest and best</i>

872
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:38,728
<i>For their stay</i>

873
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:43,413
<i>At the county fair</i>

874
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:46,772
<i>The teenage misters

875
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,495
<i>To the Ferris wheel up above</i>

876
01:08:49,576 --> 01:08:53,171

01:08:53,256 --> 01:08:56,009

880
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:05,773

881
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:09,053

882
01:09:09,136 --> 01:09:12,828
<i>To share at the county fair</i>

883
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:13,704
<i>To share at the county fair</i>

884
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:18,379
Congratulations.

885
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:37,857
The judging for
the champion ram lamb...

886
01:09:37,948 --> 01:09:40,667
of the Pike County
Agricultural Livestock Fair...

887
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:42,784
will now take place
in this arena.

888
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:45,985
- Is that us, Granny?
- I reckon it is.

889
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:50,218
You know somethin', Granny?

890
01:09:50,308 --> 01:09:55,177
I got the same kind of feelin'
I had just before I found the bee tree...

891
01:09:55,268 --> 01:09:58,578
and just before I found Danny
in the holler log.

892
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:02,786
All ram lambs in the
judging ring at once, please.

893
01:10:02,868 --> 01:10:06,383
Where in the name of time
is Hiram with that neat's-foot oil?

894
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,028
- Well, here it is.
- Took you long enough.

895
01:10:09,108 --> 01:10:13,147
- Now it's too late.
- Granny, look what Uncle Hiram won...

896
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:16,504
just by throwing hoops
over walking canes.

897
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,499
I better give you a hand
in there, Granny.

898
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:21,944
Well, there ain't no hoops
or walking canes in here.
Besides, you'd just get in the way.

899
01:10:22,028 --> 01:10:25,816
All ram lambs into the judging
ring at once, please.

900
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:28,900
What do I do, Uncle Hiram?
When I get in the ring, I mean.

901
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:32,025
Well, I'll tell ya. Main thing
that you gotta remember is--

902
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:36,818
Main thing you remember,
Jeremiah, is that only one
of them lambs is gonna win.

903
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:38,864
The rest are gonna lose.

904
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:41,985
But, Granny, he will win.
I just know he will.

905
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:44,423
Hope he does.
But happen he don't...

906
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:48,865
I want you to come out of that ring
like a Kincaid, walkin' proud.

907
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,382

Speak up, sonny.
What's his breedin'?

931
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,790
Danny ain't none of them
fancy breed kind of lambs, mister.

932
01:12:30,873 --> 01:12:33,228
His ma's name was Jezebel.

933
01:12:35,713 --> 01:12:38,705
But I don't know

936

But in a fight, he could whip them
other lambs any old day of the week.

937
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:04,230
- What've you been feedin' him, son?
- Oatmeal mash, sir.

938
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:11,742
Nice strong back.
Good job of blockin'.

939
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,824
Granny did that.

940
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:20,106
Remember the county fair.
Buy your pennant right here.

941
01:14:11,456 --> 01:14:17,213
Your judging committee
has awarded the blue ribbon...

942
01:14:17,296 --> 01:14:19,287
to Mr Marshall.

943
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,327
Congratulations,
Mr Marshall.

944
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:54,095
It's all right, Danny.
It's all right, boy.

945
01:15:05,942 --> 01:15:07,933
Just a moment, son.

946
01:15:12,502 --> 01:15:16,859
That's a fine lamb you have there.
I wanna compliment you on him.

947
01:15:16,942 --> 01:15:19,854
As fine a grade of wool
as I ever come across.

948
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:25,062
The only trouble, it's-- it's black.
There ain't much market for black wool.

949
01:15:25,142 --> 01:15:28,657
Kinda puts your lamb
in a class by himself.

950
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:34,736
I'm not tryin' to be funny, folks.

951
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:38,337
This lamb is in a class by himself.

952
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:40,890
And while he has no pedigree...

953
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:45,772
it just goes to show what
extra special care will do...

954
01:15:45,862 --> 01:15:48,376
in the raising of fine livestock.

955
01:15:49,582 --> 01:15:52,301
It's what you do with
what you've got that counts.

956
01:15:53,502 --> 01:15:58,098
This little lamb is a champion
in every sense of the word.

957
01:15:58,182 --> 01:16:02,539
Therefore, it is the unanimous decision
of your judging committee...

958
01:16:03,502 --> 01:16:07,177
that there be awarded
the breeder a special prize...

959
01:16:07,862 --> 01:16:10,501
which we have not given
in four years--

960
01:16:10,582 --> 01:16:13,972
a special award of merit...

961
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:16,257
to Jeremiah Kincaid.

962
01:16:19,582 --> 01:16:23,495
Congratulations,
Mr Jeremiah Kincaid.

963
01:16:35,902 --> 01:16:39,258
Aw, gee whiz, Danny.

964
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:41,315
Aw, gee whiz.

965
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:49,910
Hey, Pa!
She's a-blowin' for a stop!

966
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:10,864
Folks, you better stand back now
and give us plenty of room.

967
01:17:10,955 --> 01:17:14,834
We got a prize lamb here
that won the special award.

968
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,830
Welcome home,Jeremiah.
Welcome home.

969
01:17:24,915 --> 01:17:27,383
Fulton Corners is proud of ya.

970
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:30,547
Thank you, Mr Grundy.

971
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,387
As I was about to say
on this auspicious occasion...

972
01:17:35,475 --> 01:17:39,184
when it comes to winnin' awards,
there ain't no flies on Fulton Corners.

973
01:17:39,275 --> 01:17:42,426
Yea!

974
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:46,667
I got two cases of soda pop
and six watermelons in my icebox...

975
01:17:46,755 --> 01:17:49,792
and everybody's invited
over to the store, and it's my treat.

976
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,866
Yea!

977
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:57,028
- But what'll I do with Danny?
- Bring him along. It's his party.

978
01:17:57,115 --> 01:18:00,187
Yippee! Hurray!

979
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:07,070
<i>Oh, get outta the way for Jerry's ram</i>

980
01:18:07,155 --> 01:18:08,793
<i>Hi-ditty-lo for Jerry's ram</i>

981
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:12,345
<i>Get outta the way for Jerry's ram
Git, git, git outta the way</i>

982
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:16,144
<i>Oh, git, git, git outta the way
Oh, git, git, git outta the way</i>

983
01:18:16,235 --> 01:18:18,544
<i>Oh, git, git, git outta the way</i>

984
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:43,750
<i>So dear to my heart</i>
