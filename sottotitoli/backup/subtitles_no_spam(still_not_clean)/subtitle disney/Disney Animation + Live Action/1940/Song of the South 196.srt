<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> She has enough responsibility --
I'm not going to saddle her with ours.

85
00:05:56,165 --> 00:06:00,105
<font color="#00ffff">John:</font> But it's only for a short time. She's
be only too glad to take care of Johnny.

86

<font color="#00ffff">John:</font> Oh, Miss Doshy, Sally wants Johnny
to stay here for awhile... with you.

89
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,161
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> What will you do?

90
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,644
<font color="#00ffff">John:</font> Oh, I'm going back.
And I want Sally to go with me.

91

I'm not going back.

92
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:37,036
<font color="#00ffff">John:</font> Then...
I'll have to go without you.

93
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,694
<font color="#00ffff">John:</font> And I'd better hurry,
or I'll miss my train.

00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:51,735
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> a little while
for her to find that out.

848
01:03:36,523 --> 01:03:39,607

849
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:47,001
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> <chuckle> Lawzy, Miss
Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.

850
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:49,102
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> He was jes' trying
to be like Brer Rabbit.

851
01:03:49,102 --> 01:03:51,408
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> I told him a tale 'bout de tar baby

852
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:53,891
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> an' he just got a
li'l bit too bodacious,

853
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:56,431
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> and outreached
hisse'f, dat's all.

854
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:59,588
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Uncle Remus,
i'm trying my best to bring up Johnny

855
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:03,278
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> to be obedient and truthful.
But you and your stories

856
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:05,165
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> are making
that very difficult.

857
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:08,779
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> I think maybe it would be better if
he didn't hear any more for awhile.

858
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:11,057
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no....

859
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:13,117
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> They only confuse him.

860
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:15,967
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Now I know you mean well, Uncle
Remus, but Johnny's too young.

861
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:17,015
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> Miss Sally.....

862
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:20,580
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> I'll have to ask you
not to tell him any more.

863
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,722
<font color="#00ffff">Remus:</font> Yassum, Miss Sally......

864
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,442
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> But what else
could I have done, mama?

865
01:04:37,442 --> 01:04:40,114
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> I can't just overlook it,
he has to learn to mind.

866
01:04:40,786 --> 01:04:43,894
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,

867
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:49,753
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.

868
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:53,251
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Well, he has his
mother....and his grandmother.

869
01:04:54,279 --> 01:04:57,195
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> We're not enough, sally.
The boy must have friends.

870
01:04:57,195 --> 01:05:00,059
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> And if it's not Uncle
Remus, or the Favers children

871
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:03,325
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> then it must be someone else....
someone of his own age.

872
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,963
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> That's just good common sense.

873
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:12,098
<font color="#00ffff">Tempy:</font> What you trackin'
through here for anyway?

874
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:14,941
<font color="#00ffff">Tempy:</font> Ain't I done tol' you 'bout
messin' 'roun' my kitchen?

876
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:24,340
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Yes, mama.

877
01:05:26,557 --> 01:05:29,570
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Do you know what next tuesday is?

878
01:05:29,603 --> 01:05:32,152
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Uh...of course. My birthday.

879
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:36,025
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> That's right, dear.
And what happens then?

880
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,247
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> I get presents.

881
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:40,061
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> And a birthday
party. Would you like that?

882
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,179
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> A party? Sure!

883
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,765
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> With lots of nice
little boys and girls.

884
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,181
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Can i ask Ginny?

885
01:05:47,637 --> 01:05:49,683
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...

886
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:52,196
<font color="#00ffff">Doshy:</font> ...That one more
won't make any difference.

887
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:58,371
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Gee! Thanks!
Will daddy come?

888
01:05:59,069 --> 01:06:09,166
<font color="#00ffff">Sally:</font> Well, dear...uh...I'll
write and ask him.

889
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,338
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Oh boy.

890
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,568
<font color="#00ffff">Johnny:</font> Teenchy! Here Teenchy!

891
01:06:23,216 --> 01:06:27,785

A present for Teenchy!

893
