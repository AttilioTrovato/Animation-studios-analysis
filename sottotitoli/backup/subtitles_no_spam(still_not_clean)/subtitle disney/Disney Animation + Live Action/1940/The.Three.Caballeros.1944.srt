1
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,741
<i>We 're three happy chappies
With snappy</i> serapes

2
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,575
<i>You'll find us beneath
our</i> sombreros

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,922
<i>We 're brave and we 7! stay
so We're bright as a</i> peso

4
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,881
<i>Who says so? We say so
We're three</i> caballeros

5
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:59,679
<i>Oh, through fair
and stormy weather</i>

6
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,765
<i>We're always together</i>

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,896
<i>So let come what may</i>

8
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,855
<i>Like brother to brother
We're all for each other</i>

9
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:15,489
<i>The three</i> caballeros <i>Forever we 7!
stay!</i>

10
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,352
<i>"Felicitaciones</i>, uh,
<i>al Pato</i> Donald..."

11
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,394
Oh! "Felicitations to Donald
Duck on his birthday",

12
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:57,023
"Friday the 13th, from his
friends in Latin America."

13
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,657
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise!

14
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,739
Whoops!

15
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:11,212
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?

16
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,381
My mama told me to take...

17
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,254
this one!

18
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,465
I wonder what's in it.

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,268
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.

20
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,390
Well, well, well.

21
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,902
Well, doggone! A little penguin.

22
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,939
Oh! What a cute little fellow.

23
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,326
Well, what is this? How do you
open this thing, anyway, huh?

24
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,590
On with the show!

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,426
The show must go on!

26
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,229
<i>- Aves Raras.
- A ves Raras?</i>

27
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,653
Sí, señor. <i>That means
strange birds.</i>

28
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,694
Oh, sure, sure. I know, birds!

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,372
<i>Yes,</i> amigo. <i>Your
feathered cousins.</i>

30
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:35,004
<i>You know, Donald, you have more relatives
here than coffee beans in Brazil.</i>

31
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,302
<i>For instance, take the one
who lives way, way down...</i>

32
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,722
<i>Aha!</i>

33
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,257
<i>But suppose we let my friend,
Professor Holloway, tell us about it.</i>

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,346
<i>From the beginning to...</i>

35
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,063
El fin, the <i>end. Yes, thank you.</i>

36
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,649
<i>Professor?</i>

37
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,731
<i>This stow takes us way
down to the south pole.</i>

38
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:05,030
<i>Rather than stand on your heads,
let's turn the theater over.</i>

39
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,032
<i>There, that's better.</i>

40
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,915
<i>Two things you will find
most of down here are ice...</i>

41
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,576
<i>and penguins.</i>

42
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,922
<i>It's amazing that anybody
would want to live here,</i>

43
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,426
<i>but most penguins wouldn't
live anywhere else.</i>

44
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,723
<i>You couldn't find better
weather for fishing...</i>

45
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:33,103
<i>skiing, tobogganing,
or swimming.</i>

46
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,941
<i>And there is nothing the
average penguin likes better</i>

47
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,735
<i>than a day at the beach.</i>

48
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:46,075
<i>Uh, but come on, let's meet Pablo. He
lives down at the end of main street.</i>

49
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,028
<i>Let's go in and see
what's cooking.</i>

50
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,620
<i>Pablo could never remember
having been warm enough.</i>

51
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,664
<i>And so his closest companion was
Smoky Joe, his little stove.</i>

52
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:10,341
<i>Between chills, Pablo
had one burning desire,</i>

53
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,728
<i>to spend the rest of his
life on some tropical shore.</i>

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,893
<i>So, we see him bravely set forth
for the isle of his dreams.</i>

55
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,109
<i>The other penguins turned out
to give him a big send-off.</i>

56
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,909
<i>But when he gets just so
far away from his stove...</i>

57
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,281
<i>see what happens?</i>

58
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,045
<i>Too bad. Perhaps he'll
give up this wild idea.</i>

59
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,086
<i>But no, he's off
to another start.</i>

60
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,257
<i>This time he's
bringing a friend.</i>

61
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,595
<i>Uh-Oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!</i>

62
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,062
<i>Uh-oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

63
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,356
<i>Anyway, it was a hot idea.</i>

64
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,366
<i>Well, maybe he'll be content
to stay at home this time.</i>

65
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,583
<i>But no! There he goes!</i>

66
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,172
<i>Hot-footing it to the
land of the sun.</i>

67
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,595
<i>By now, the farewell committee
has been reduced to two.</i>

68
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,863
<i>Discouraging, isn't it?</i>

69
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,703
<i>Suddenly, Pablo got one of those ideas
that change a person's whole life.</i>

70
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,244
<i>A boat!</i>

71
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,452
<i>But where would he get a boat?</i>

72
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,123
<i>Just watch!</i>

73
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,967
<i>"Where there's a will,
there's a way," they say.</i>

74
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,302
<i>And now, the official launching.</i>

75
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,611
<i>Day after day, the south
wind carried him north.</i>

76
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,613
<i>One day, a blanket
of fog rolled in.</i>

77
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,583
<i>And it was so thick...</i>

78
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,505
<i>Must be near Cape Horn.</i>

79
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,554
<i>As the fog lifted...</i>

80
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,517
<i>he found himself headed straight
through the straits of Magellan,</i>

81
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,558
<i>and northward, along
Chile's rocky coast.</i>

82
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,599
<i>One day, a storm cloud came up.</i>

83
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,607
<i>Just a little bitty old
storm cloud, though.</i>

84
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,319
<i>And just tried awful hard
to have its first storm.</i>

85
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,663
<i>Didn't amount to much, though.</i>

86
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,418
<i>One day on lookout, Pablo
had a bit of a shock.</i>

87
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,837
<i>A waterspout off the port bow!</i>

88
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,551
<i>But it proved to be the
Juan Fernandez islands</i>

89
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,759
<i>where Robinson
Crusoe once lived.</i>

90
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,515
<i>And still does, apparently.</i>

91
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,518
<i>Four bells and all's well.</i>

92
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,561
<i>According to Pablo's chart, he
should be nearing Vina Del Mar.</i>

93
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,273
<i>And strangely enough,
that's just where he is.</i>

94
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,818
<i>He sailed past Lima,
capital of Peru.</i>

95
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:03,332
<i>Hugging the coastline with a tenacity
of purpose seldom found in a penguin.</i>

96
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:08,292
<i>One day, his telescope picked out a
city high up on top of a mountain.</i>

97
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,130
<i>The map said it was Quito.</i>

98
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,087
<i>And it was right smack
on the equator.</i>

99
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,133
<i>It wasn't as easy to cross,</i>

100
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,642
<i>but with a little help
from Neptune, he made it.</i>

101
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,553
<i>80, making a left turn,
he followed the equator,</i>

102
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,768
<i>headed for the
Galapagos islands.</i>

103
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,559
<i>Ah, that good old sun!</i>

104
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,029
<i>Pablo felt that he would
never get enough of it.</i>

105
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,241
<i>Oh, he hadn't counted on this.</i>

106
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,373
<i>Things looked pretty bad.</i>

107
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,124
<i>Help! Man the pumps,
she's sprung a leak!</i>

108
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,213
<i>Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things, get going!</i>

109
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,458
<i>Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!</i>

110
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,586
<i>Unruffle the mizzenmast
and man the poops, and...</i>

111
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:02,266
<i>don't just stand there, get going!
Swab the decks and... Heavens!</i>

112
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,638
<i>Look! What's that? Just
what he's been looking for.</i>

113
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,476
<i>Pablo has finally reached
the isle of his dreams.</i>

114
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:59,485
<i>And so, as the warm, tropical
sun sinks slowly in the west,</i>

115
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,485
<i>we leave little Pablo,
a bird in paradise.</i>

116
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,367
<i>A picture of health in
his new coat of tan.</i>

117
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,624
<i>He should be the happiest
penguin in the world.</i>

118
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:16,878
<i>Only... sometimes he
gets to thinking...</i>

119
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,802
<i>Never satisfied!</i>

120
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,723
<i>Well, that's human nature for
you, even if you're a penguin.</i>

121
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,392
You're absolutely right!

122
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,438
<i>And now, Donald, let's
hop over the Andes.</i>

123
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,645
<i>From these snow-capped peaks to
the depths of the amazon jungle,</i>

124
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,523
<i>one finds many more
strange and exotic birds.</i>

125
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,201
<i>Like the Anambepreto of
Colombia and Venezuela.</i>

126
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,325
<i>He carries his own bagpipes
hidden under his beard.</i>

127
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,079
<i>Then there's his
cousin, the Arapapa.</i>

128
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,208
<i>Pride of Paraguay, whose
perfect appearance</i>

129
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,381
<i>permits his pompous
pride in his pompadour.</i>

130
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,093
<i>And</i> La Tijerita,
<i>the scissors bird.</i>

131
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,301
<i>The Colombian cutter.</i>

132
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,227
<i>Then there's the</i>
Arapacu de Pico Curvo.

133
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,888
<i>He's always sticking
his nose into things.</i>

134
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,731
<i>Did you ever see
such a freak beak?</i>

135
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,128
<i>Huh?</i>

136
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,146
<i>Speaking of beaks, what a time
two toucans have making love.</i>

137
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,028
<i>When they're beak to beak,
they can't get cheek to cheek.</i>

138
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,617
<i>Because when one
toucan turns his head,</i>

139
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,826
<i>only one toucan can.</i>

140
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,455
- Uh-oh. Who's that?
- Oh, <i>a thousand pardons.</i>

141
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,668
<i>Señor Donald, I would
like to have you meet</i>

142
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,509
<i>one of the most eccentric
birds you have ever seen.</i>

143
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,096
<i>His name is the Aracuan. You'll
find him most everywhere.</i>

144
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,888
Yeah, glad to know you.
Heh, pleased to meet ya!

145
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,776
<i>Now he's called the</i> Aracuan <i>because
of the peculiar song he sings.</i>

146
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,857
<i>Which sounds
something like this.</i>

147
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,197
Ahhh!

148
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,275
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup Bup, bup, ba-dia</i>

149
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,905
<i>Ba-da, bup Toot-toot-toot</i>

150
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,911
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup Bup, bup, bup</i>

151
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,030
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup Bup, bup, ba-dia</i>

152
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,782
<i>Ba-da, bup Toot-toot-toot</i>

153
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,122
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup Bup, bup, bup</i>

154
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,083
By the <i>way,</i> amigo,

155
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,498
<i>did you know some birds
are skilled craftsmen?</i>

156
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,295
Uh-uh. Is that so?

157
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,421
<i>Yes, quite a builder is
the little</i> Marrequito.

158
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:35,434
<i>His nest may look haphazard in design,
ah, but every single stick and straw...</i>

159
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,311
<i>is scientifically placed to withstand
the stress and strain of...</i>

160
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>Well, almost anything.</i>

161
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,195
<i>Literally dotted are the shores
of many tropical marshes,</i>

162
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,534
<i>with the brilliant
plumage of the flamingo.</i>

163
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,763
Ha, ha, ha.

164
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,101
<i>And now, Donald, how
would you like to hear</i>

165
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,187
<i>a story about another bird so
amazing you won't believe it?</i>

166
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,477
Oh, sure! You bet!

167
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,106
<i>It's a tale told by an
old</i> gaucho <i>from Uruguay.</i>

168
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,198
<i>Listen...</i>

169
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,609
<i>It was early one
morning in springtime,</i>

170
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,736
<i>just as day was
beginning to break.</i>

171
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,786
<i>As the sun came up over the... Oh,
but I am forgetting my story.</i>

172
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,583
<i>It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake.</i>

173
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,922
<i>From his nest, came the little
Homero to see if the...</i>

174
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,668
<i>Oh, say, do you know why this
bird's called the Homero?</i>

175
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,424
<i>- No?</i>
- Uh-uh. Why?

176
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,515
<i>You see, his nest is
just like the</i> home.

177
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,218
<i>That's the oven where we
bake bread and our...</i>

178
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,179
<i>You know who that is?</i>

179
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,647
<i>That's me when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.</i>

180
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:09,106
<i>And why was I up so early? Because
I was going out hunting all alone.</i>

181
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,409
<i>First, I put on my</i> bombachas
<i>and tied on my</i> chiripá.

182
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,031
<i>Then I slipped
into my new Betas.</i>

183
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,087
<i>And I put my</i> Boleadoras <i>Where I
could reach them in a hurry.</i>

184
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,375
Gauchito! <i>Not forgetting
my hunting knife.</i>

185
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,878
<i>And now I was ready to go. Ah!</i>

186
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,922
<i>Now the best place to
hunt the wild ostrich</i>

187
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,341
<i>is out on the wide-open plains.</i>

188
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,513
<i>On the broad flat land of the...</i>

189
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,143
<i>Flat land? Say, what
am I doing here?</i>

190
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,691
<i>Oh, now I remember!</i>

191
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,437
<i>This day I was hunting for condor
birds high up in the mountains.</i>

192
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,032
<i>While looking for the condors, I
climbed to the top of a rock.</i>

193
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,658
<i>No, come to think of
it, it was a tree.</i>

194
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,449
<i>Let's see, maybe it
was a rock after all.</i>

195
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,823
<i>Although, I could
swear it was a tree.</i>

196
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,496
<i>Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go, let it go.</i>

197
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,537
<i>My sharp eyes soon
discovered the nest of a...</i>

198
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,754
<i>Psst,</i> Gauchito! <i>The nest.</i>
El Nido, El Nido.

199
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,718
<i>I could tell from
the wings he was...</i>

200
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,139
<i>He was at least five
meters from tip to tip.</i>

201
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,514
<i>The biggest condor bird in all of...</i>
caramba!

202
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,263
<i>What's this? I couldn't
believe my eyes!</i>

203
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,316
<i>No, it couldn't be!
But there it was!</i>

204
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,645
<i>I was looking face-to-face
with a flying donkey!</i>

205
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,575
<i>The donkey bird
didn't seem bashful.</i>

206
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,447
<i>He flew right up close to... <i>Quick</i>,
Gauchito, <i>now! Get him, quick!</i>

207
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,375
<i>Ah, got him!</i>

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,839
<i>Now, now. Easy, easy.
Tch, tch, tch.</i>

209
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,009
Oh, oh, oh, ohh!

210
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,490
<i>This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.</i>

211
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,865
<i>So, I made up my mind I'd catch
him if it took me the rest of...</i>

212
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,747
<i>Now I had him! Hold him,</i> Gauchito!
<i>Ride him, cowboy!</i>

213
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,870
<i>He acted just like he was</i> loco.
<i>But I was an expert of course.</i>

214
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,167
<i>He thought he could
throw this Gauchito,</i>

215
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,335
<i>but he soon found out
who was the boss.</i>

216
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,426
<i>Psst, Gauch'fio'?
Who is the boss?</i>

217
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,925
<i>I decided to train him for racing
far out Where nobody could</i> see,

218
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:47,686
<i>'cause I planned to win thousands of
pesos for this little Burrito and me.</i>

219
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,900
<i>I made brilliant plans
for the future.</i>

220
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,772
<i>We 'd live like a couple of kings, and
I'd be the world's richest</i> Gaucho.

221
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,609
<i>With my hands full of
big diamond rings.</i>

222
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,710
Ah, macanudo! <i>Okay.</i>

223
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:18,762
<i>This Burrito was tame as a kitten. He
was learning new tricks every day.</i>

224
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,548
<i>You should see how he
begged for my</i> mate.

225
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,595
<i>He liked it much
better than hay.</i>

226
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,312
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

227
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:40,742
<i>Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be.</i>

228
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,831
<i>And tomorrow was very important
for little Burrito and me.</i>

229
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,796
<i>For this was the day of fiesta.</i>

230
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,760
<i>The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the Zamba and Gate,</i>

231
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,840
<i>and gambled their pesos away.</i>

232
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,845
<i>While the crowd sang and
danced in the plaza,</i>

233
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,934
<i>I just stood in the
shade of a tree,</i>

234
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,896
<i>and watched them toss
coins at the</i> Sapo,

235
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,060
<i>but this game meant
nothing to me.</i>

236
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,561
<i>Some others were rolling the Bochas
and betting on games of this kind.</i>

237
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,528
<i>I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind.</i>

238
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,693
<i>A Caballo!</i>

239
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,453
<i>The race was about to begin, and
the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.</i>

240
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,451
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

241
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,960
<i>The gauchos were howling with laughter
when they saw us come out on the track.</i>

242
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,630
<i>I whispered, "Remember
the wings, Burrito."</i>

243
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,723
<i>Oh, oh, oh, ohh!
Not yet, not yet!</i>

244
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,779
<i>The gauchos and horses
were all on their toes.</i>

245
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,105
<i>Listos! Larguen!</i>

246
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,282
<i>We were off with the
speed of a bullet!</i>

247
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,607
<i>We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gauche was, uh, uh...</i>

248
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,112
<i>In the meanwhile, Burrito and I
were, uh, jockeying for position.</i>

249
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,195
<i>Psst, Gauchito! They went that way.
That way!</i>

250
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,242
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

251
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,704
<i>No wonder they laughed. I
didn't even look like a jockey.</i>

252
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,375
<i>Hey, Gauchito. Come on,
look like a jockey.</i>

253
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,927
<i>Pepito, the pride of Mendoza
was setting a furious pace,</i>

254
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,139
<i>and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you
never have seen such a race.</i>

255
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,104
<i>Now it's Pepito and Fuego,
it's Fuego and Pepito,</i>

256
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,187
<i>and here comes Gordito on the rail!
Do your stuff, kid.</i>

257
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,524
<i>No? Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!</i>

258
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,736
<i>Uh-huh, what did I tell you?</i>

259
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,613
Come <i>on,</i> Gauchito! <i>The
Wings, the wings!</i>

260
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,368
<i>Quickly, I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.</i>

261
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,824
<i>Quickly, I untied the rope.</i>

262
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,708
<i>Huh? The knife, the knife!</i>
Cortalo, cortalo!

263
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,549
<i>And now we go.</i>

264
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,009
<i>You should see little Burrito tearing up
the track so fast, you couldn't see us!</i>

265
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,058
<i>And now, down the home
stretch comes Fuego.</i>

266
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,269
<i>Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato,</i>

267
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,820
<i>and Dorado is right on his tail!</i>

268
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,531
<i>But where is Burrito?</i>

269
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,072
<i>Here comes Burrito!</i>

270
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,620
<i>We passed them like they
were standing still.</i>

271
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,893
<i>And now coming down across
the line of finish, it's...</i>

272
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,908
<i>Burrito, the winner!</i>

273
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,837
<i>Well,</i> amigos, <i>it was all
over, but the shouting.</i>

274
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,960
I <i>thought. Oh-uh.</i>

275
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,217
Caramba! The jig was up.

276
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,348
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

277
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,939
<i>What became of the
flying donkey, you ask?</i>

278
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,070
<i>Neither him nor me was ever
seen again as long as we lived.</i>

279
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,026
Adiós, amigo.

280
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,993
<i>Adiós,</i> so long. Good-bye!

281
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,656
What's going on here?

282
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,246
Presents! Oh boy, let me at 'em!

283
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,719
Say, what's this?

284
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,779
<i>Ah, Pato</i> Donald, <i>Como vai voce!</i>

285
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,872
<i>Como vai essa forca?
Por onde tem andado?</i>

286
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,124
<i>Há quanto tempo que nao o vejo!
¿Que hé de novo?</i>

287
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,545
Or, as you Americans
say, "What's cooking?"

288
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,959
Joe Carioca! Well,
I'll be doggoned!

289
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,132
Imagine meeting me here?
Donald...

290
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,219
- have you ever been to Baía, no?
- No, I haven't.

291
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,888
Ah, Baía.

292
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:22,482
Land of romance, moonlight,
music, beautiful girls.

293
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,141
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup, bup!</i>

294
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,897
<i>Toot-toot-toot</i>

295
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,854
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup, bup, bup</i>

296
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,780
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup, bup.
Ba-da, bup, bup, bup.</i>

297
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,483
<i>Toot-toot-toot</i>

298
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,067
<i>Ba-da, bup, bup,</i> bup,

299
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,987
<i>Uau! Esse aracuan parece
que nunca para quieto.</i>

300
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:41,585
Oh, forgive the interruption, Donald.
This crazy bird is the Aracuan.

301
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,622
He's <i>meio maluco,</i> a
very stupid fellow.

302
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,176
But tell me, Donald, have
you ever been to Baía?

303
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,931
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh, I am so sorry for you.

304
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,554
Ah, Baía.

305
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,937
It is like a song in my heart.

306
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:06,317
A song with love and
beautiful memories.

307
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,062
<i>Que saudades que eu tenho.</i>

308
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,150
<i>Ah, Baía.</i>

309
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,574
<i>I close my eyes and
I can see it now.</i>

310
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,245
<i>I can see the beautiful
twilight in the sky.</i>

311
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,621
<i>I can feel the
breeze from the bay.</i>

312
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,373
<i>And I can hear the music...</i>

313
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,838
<i>the music of Baía.</i>

314
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,641
Oh,

315
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,481
<i>Baía-ia-ia</i>

316
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:52,652
<i>When twilight is deep
in the sky Baía-ia-ia</i>

317
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,360
<i>Someone that I long to see</i>

318
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,825
<i>Keeps haunting my reverie</i>

319
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,288
<i>And so the loneliness
Deep in my heart</i>

320
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:08,334
<i>Calls to you Calls to you</i>

321
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:22,393
<i>I live in the memory
of Many dreams ago</i>

<i>Palabra De honor</i>

Aha! My friends!

<i>Bienvenidos, Cuates.</i>
Welcome to Mexico.

498
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:29,203
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to
see such fine gentlemen in Mexico!

499
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,088

<i>We're brave and we'll stay
so We're bright as a peso</i>

512
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,960
<i>- Who says so?
- We say so!</i>

513
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,213
The <i>three</i> caballeros

514
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,682
<i>Oh</i>

515
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:31,106
<i>We have the stars to guide us</i>

516
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,268
<i>Guitars here beside us</i>

517
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,737
<i>To play as we go</i>

518
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,028
<i>We sing and we samba
We shout</i> Ay Caramba

519
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,490
<i>- What means "Av Caramba“?"

520
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,115
<i>Oh</i>

521
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,159
<i>Through fair or stormy weather</i>

522
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,670
<i>We stand close together</i>

523
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,707
<i>Like books on a shelf</i>

524
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,043
<i>And pals though we may be</i>

525
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,134
<i>When some Latin baby
Says yes, no or maybe</i>

526
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,759
<i>Each man is for himself</i>

527
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:13,015
<i>Ah, Jalisco no te rajes</i>

00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,279
<i>Me sale del alma
Gritar con Calor</i>

529
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,688
Ya, ha, ha!

530
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:25,277
<i>Abrir todo el pecho pa' echar
Este grito que lindo es jalisco</i>

531
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:31,742
<i>Palabra de-e-e-e Honor-r-r-r</i>

532
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,942
Aha!

533
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,950
- What's this?
- What's this?

534
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,449
This is your gift
from Mexico, Donald.

535
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,449
<i>- A piñata.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!</i>

536
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,167
<i>What's a piñata?</i>

537
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:20,833
A <i>piñata</i> is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.

538
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,052
Christmas?

539
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,712
<i>Jingle bells Jingle
bells Jingle all...</i>

540
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,222
No, no, Donald! For
goodness sake!

541
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,007
Not "Jingle Bells"!

542
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,561
In Mexico, they
sing <i>Las Posadas.</i>

543
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,482
<i>This custom takes place</i>

544
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,567
<i>on each of the nine
days before Christmas.</i>

545
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,231
<i>Each evening, the children
gather at the village church</i>

546
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,489
<i>and form a procession,</i>

547
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,614
<i>symbolizing the journey
of Mary and Joseph</i>

548
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,324
<i>from Nazareth to Bethlehem.</i>

549
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,202
<i>The little ones carry images of
the saints from house to house,</i>

550
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,287
<i>singing a plea for
shelter, or</i> Posada.

551
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,839
<i>A reply comes from within.</i>

552
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,131
<i>"No Posada, no shelter."</i>

553
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,221
<i>Looking sad and downhearted,
they try again.</i>

554
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,971
<i>But the reply is still the same.</i>

555
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,136
<i>"No shelter, no</i> Posada."

556
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,105
<i>They repeat the song time after
time, and always they are refused.</i>

557
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:27,198
<i>Until, at last, they reach a friendly
house and the door is opened.</i>

558
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,947
<i>"Come in, come in,
holy pilgrims."</i>

559
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,195
<i>"This humble home is yours."</i>

560
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,036
<i>And now, Mary and Joseph
have found shelter at last.</i>

561
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,501
<i>Then the rejoicing begins.</i>

562
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:44,758
<i>The feasting, the celebrating, and
finally, the biggest surprise of all,</i>

563
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,127
<i>breaking the</i> piñata.

564
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:54,308
And now, for your <i>piñata,</i> Donald.
Here you are. Go to it.

565
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,722
One side, boys, one side.
I'm going to smack it!

566
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,692
Hold it, ho... hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.

567
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,571
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.

568
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,529
Now, now, stand here.

569
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,403
Come here now, hit it hard.

570
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,284
Alright, let's see you smack it.

571
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,136
Wait just a minute.

572
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,393
Uh-oh.

573
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,312
Aha!

574
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,571
You see, Donald?

575
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,989
Didn't I told you it
was full of surprises?

576
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,861
<i>Ahh'. La bandera Mexicana.</i>

577
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,830
Did you know that the history
of Mexico is in her flag?

578
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,337
Oh, yes!

579
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,964
You see, many hundreds of years
ago, the god of the Aztecs

580
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,841
<i>commanded them to
build a big city</i>

581
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,168
<i>where they would find an
eagle destroying a serpent.</i>

582
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,426
<i>But when they find this eagle,
he was sitting on a cactus.</i>

583
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,259
<i>On top of a rock, way out
in the middle of a lake.</i>

584
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,976
Caramba! <i>To build a city here
would be almost</i> impossiblé.

585
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,851
<i>But they built and built
and built some more.</i>

586
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:12,272
<i>Until today, believe it or not,
the lake is full of Mexico City.</i>

587
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,613
<i>Sweet music</i>

588
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,035
<i>Gay serenatas</i>

589
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:27,830
<i>Tropic skies of velvet blue</i>

590
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,918
<i>Magic gardens</i>

591
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:37,714
<i>Perfume the breezes</i>

592
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:44,229
<i>Where true love
Brought me to you</i>

593
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:52,947
<i>Mexico With all your romance</i>

594
00:49:53,199 --> 00:50:00,117
<i>Your song of love Will
live forever after</i>

595
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,449
<i>Mexico</i>

596
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,419
<i>Sweethearts are singing</i>

597
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,544
<i>Lovebirds are winging</i>

598
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:17,713
<i>Through a sky filled
with laughter</i>

599
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,140
<i>Paradise</i>

600
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,720
<i>That's where I found you</i>

601
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,556
<i>Your magic smile</i>

602
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:32,853
<i>Made the blossoms
bloom around you</i>

603
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,981
<i>Mexico</i>

604
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,986
<i>Why do I feel as I do</i>

605
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,999
<i>I simply fell under the spell</i>

606
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,910
<i>Of you</i>

607
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,004
<i>Oba, Oba!</i> Nice! Oh, boy!

608
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,208
Ah, but this is only
the beginning, <i>amigos.</i>

609
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,752
Take a look at this one.

610
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,090
Oh, boy! What a pretty picture!

611
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,555
And now for a nice
trip through Mexico

612
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,184
<i>on the</i> magic <i>sarape.</i>

613
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,151

<i>Mexico</i>

618
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:45,341
<i>Why do I feel as I do</i>

619
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:50,143

a fisherman's paradise.

623
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,401
Yeah, beautiful!

624
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:09,496
Oh, boy! Would I like to come back
sometime and do a little fishing.

625
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,044
Uh-oh!

- What's going on here?
- Shh!

628
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,030
This is my favorite dance.
The <i>Jarabe Pateno.</i>

629
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,487
Doggone it. I can't get it.

630
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,285
No, no, no, no, no, boys!
You are off the beat!

631
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,661
This is the way.

632
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,082
Well, what do you know?

633
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,107
- Bravo, bravo, bravo, bravo!
<i>- Excellente!</i>

<i>Thanks. I had a wonderful time.</i>

Adiós, amigos. <i>So long.</i>

636
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:49,901

Watch your step, Donald.

Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.

651
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,885

- Oh, no, no, no, Donald. Don't do that.
- What'?
