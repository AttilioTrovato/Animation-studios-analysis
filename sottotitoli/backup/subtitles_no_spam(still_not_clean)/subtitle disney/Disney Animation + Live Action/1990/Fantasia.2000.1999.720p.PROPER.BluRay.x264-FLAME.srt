1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,846
It's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,515
on behalf of all the other artists
and musicians

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,891
whose combined talents

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,146
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,399
What you will see
on the screen

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,110
is a picture of the various
abstract images

7
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,404
that might pass through your mind

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,907
if you sat in a concert hall
listening to this music.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,206
Now, there are three kinds of music
on this Fantasia programme.

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,626
First, there's the kind
that tells a definite story.

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,756
Then there's the kind that,
while it has no specific plot,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,426
does paint a series of, more or less,
definite pictures.

13
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,345
Then there's a third kind,

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,265
music that exists
simply for its own sake.

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,352
The number that opens
our Fantasia programme

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,938
is music of this third kind.

17
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,250
You know, what's amazing
is that many of these musicians

18
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,877
are playing for the very first time.

19
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,966
Thanks to Steve Martin's Two-Week
Master Musician Home Study course.

20
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,592
More about that later.

21
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,762
Hello, and welcome to Fantasia 2000.

22
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,598
It's been more than 60 years
since Walt Disney and his artists,

23
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,268
teamed up with maestro
Leopold Stokowski

24
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,771
to create a film they titled
The Concert Feature.

25
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,358
I think we're all glad that
they changed the name to Fantasia.

26
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,987
You know, Fantasia was meant to be
a perpetual work in progress.

27
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,115
Every time you went to see it,
you'd experience some new pieces

28
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,617
along with some
old familiar favourites.

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,037
But that idea fell by the wayside,
until now.

30
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,457
So let me turn things over
to the great Itzhak Perlman,

31
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,169
who, I have just been informed,
plays the violin.

32
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,964
Well, so do I. Big deal.
Could I have my violin, please?

33
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,010
Thank you.
All right, boys, let's...

34
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,262
Sorry. Could I have
another stick thingy, please?

35
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,514
And camera back on me.

36
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,558
Camera back on me.

37
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,269
Am I done?

38
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,648
When you hear a title like
Pines of Rome

39
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,028
you might think of tree-lined streets
and romantic ruins.

40
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,989
But when the Disney animators
heard this music,

41
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,742
they thought of something
completely different.

42
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,994
Here is the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra

43
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,455
conducted by
maestro James Levine,

44
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,709
performing Ottorino Respighi's
Pines of Rome.

45
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,381
Beautiful, Ralph.

46
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,257
Hi.

47
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,803
Next, we're gonna take you
to the streets of New York City

48
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,098
for a piece that's inspired by
a couple of my favourite artists.

49
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,017
First there's the illustrator
Al Hirschfeld,

50
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,478
who's been drawing celebrities
and Broadway stars

51
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,480
for most of the 20th century.

52
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,816
And then there's composer,
songwriter George Gershwin,

53
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,819
who took jazz off the streets,
dressed her up,

54
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,071
and took her to the concert hall.

55
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,574
My friend Ralph Grierson
plays piano on this next number.

56
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,203
And it all starts with a single
slinky note on a clarinet,

57
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,415
and a simple line
on a piece of paper.

58
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rhapsody in Blue.

59
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,217
Hi. You may not know this,
but over the years,

60
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,595
the Disney artists have
cooked up dozens of ideas

61
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,555
for new Fantasia segments.

62
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,224
Some of them made it
to the big screen this time,

63
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,769
but others, lots of others...

64
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,396
How can I put this politely?
Didn't.

65
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,734
For example, the Danish illustrator
Kay Nielsen drew these sketches

66
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,780
for a segment inspired
by Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

67
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,615
Here they are,

68
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,700
and there they go.

69
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,120
Now, Salvador Dali, you know,
the "limp watches" guy,

70
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,790
he got into the act with an idea
that featured baseball

71
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,792
as a metaphor for life.

72
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,795
How come that didn't work?
Makes perfect sense to me.

73
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,632
Let's see. Then we had
a bug ballet and a baby ballet,

74
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,009
and for a time,
they even considered a sequence

75
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,637
inspired by
The Polka and the Fugue,

76
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,307
from Weinberger's
Schwanda the Bagpiper.

77
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,851
But finally, a success.

78
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,604
The Disney artists
wanted to create a short film,

79
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,315
based on Hans Christian Andersen's
wonderful fairy tale

80
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,192
The Steadfast Tin Soldier,

81
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,196
but they could never find
the perfect musical match until now.

82
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,281
Here is Yefim Bronfman,

83
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,326
playing the Shostakovich
Piano Concerto Number 2,

84
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,371
and The Steadfast Tin Soldier.

85
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,873
These drawing boards
have been the birthplace

86
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,294
of some of the most beloved
animal characters of all time.

87
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,797
So it's no surprise that the artists
chose for our next segment

88
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,175
The Carnival of the Animals
by Camille Saint-Saëns.

89
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,637
Here, the sensitive strains
of impressionistic music

90
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,682
combine with the subtle artistry
of the animator,

91
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,560
to finally answer
that age-old question,

92
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,313
"What is man's
relationship to nature?"

93
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,065
Sorry.

94
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,484
That age-old question,

95
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,405
"What would happen if you gave
a yo-yo to a flock of flamingos?"

96
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Who wrote this?

97
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to take a moment, if we may,

98
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,612
to talk about a little something
we like to refer to as magic.

99
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,989
Picture this.
You're at home,

100
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,032
hosting a birthday party
for your daughter,

101
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,034
and you've
just shelled out 50 bucks,

102
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,540
so some pathetic loser can pull
a mangy rabbit out of a flea market hat.

103
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,460
At first,
you might wonder to yourself,

104
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,336
"How did he do that?"

105
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,340
But then you would probably
just dismiss it as some sort of a trick.

106
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,136
And you know something?
You'd be right! It's just a trick.

107
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,432
It's an example of what we
laughingly refer to as stage magic.

108
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:22,437
We're here to tell you that all
stage magic is a fraud, a hoax, a sham.

109
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:26,816
It's all based on deception
and, yep, lying. All of it.

110
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,902
Sleight of hand... Lies.

111
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,237
Transformations... Fraud.

112
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,115
Dismemberment... Rip-off!

113
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,827
Fake! All are illusions.

114
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,872
What we're here to talk about
is real magic.

115
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,125
We're gonna bring on a guy now
who's the real deal, the genuine article.

116
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,920
In fact, he taught us
everything we know.

117
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,088
And he is featured prominently
in the next sequence,

118
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,634
from the original Fantasia,
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

119
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,304
You know, come to think of it,

120
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,349
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,
is a little guy,

121
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,353
who never speaks
and just kind of messes everything up,

122
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,687
like him.

123
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,940
And now...

124
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,026
And now, the...

125
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,029
Hi. Hi, little fella.
I gotta...

126
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,282
And now,
The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

127
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,179
Mr Stokowski.
Mr Stokowski!

128
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,351
Just wanted to offer
my congratulations, sir.

129
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,229
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

130
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:52,274
Aw, gee, thanks.
Well, I gotta run now. So long!

131
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,611
Mr Levine!
Okay, Mr Levine.

132
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,655
Everybody's in place
for the next number.

133
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,490
Thanks, Mickey.

134
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,200
When...

135
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,785
But we can't find Donald.

136
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,413
So you stay here and stall for time.
I'll be right back.

137
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,917
Donald! Oh, Donald!

138
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,712
When we hear Sir Edward Elgar's
Pomp and Circumstance,

139
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,673
we think of a graduation ceremony.

140
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,799
Donald, where are ya?

141
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,803
Actually, Elgar composed it
for many kinds of solemn events.

142
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,096
Donald!

143
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:27,268
This march inspired the Disney artists
to recreate the age-old story...

144
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,229
- Sorry, Daisy.
- ...of Noah's Ark,

145
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,189
with one slight twist.

146
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,899
Donald Duck!

147
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,819
- Who is it?
- Donald, it's me, Mickey.

148
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,195
You're on in 30 seconds. Hurry!

149
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,698
What? You gotta be kidding!
I'm not even dressed...

150
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,076
Okay, Jim, he's on his way.
Go to the intro.

151
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pomp and Circumstance,

152
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,500
starring Donald Duck.

153
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,006
Walt Disney described
the art of animation

154
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,300
as a voyage of discovery

155
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,220
into the realms of colour,
sound and motion.

156
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,099
The music from Igor Stravinsky's
ballet, The Firebird,

157
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,101
inspires such a voyage.

158
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,396
And so we conclude
this version of Fantasia

159
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,650
with a mythical story
of life, death and renewal.

160
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,958
Camera back on me.

161
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,211
Camera back on me, please.
Anyone? Hello?

162
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:31,048
Hello? Could someone give me
a ride home?
