1
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,579
('§ intro.)

2
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,277
A rare month for boys,

3
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:35,874
full of cold winds, long nights,
dark promises.

4
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,716
Days get short.
The shadows lengthen.

5
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,254
The wind warms in such a way,

6
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,556
you want to run forever
through the fields,

7
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,960
because up ahead,

8
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,989
10,000 pumpkins lie waiting to be cut.

9
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:06,711
('horn honks.)

10
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:15,317
It was the October of my 12th year
when the seller of lightning rods

11
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,484
came along the road
toward Green Town, Illinois,

12
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,256
sneaking glances over his shoulder.

13
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,459
Somewhere not far back
was a terrible storm.

14
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,392
Even now,
on those special autumn days,

15
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,563
when the air smells like smoke

16
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,836
and the twilights
are orange and ash gray,

17
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,275
my mind goes back to Green Town,

18
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,643
the place where I grew up.

19
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:42,274
In my memory,
I'm back on Main Street again,

20
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,547
among the neighbors
who gave me my first glimpses

21
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,316
into the fearful needs
of the human heart.

22
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,592
The cigar store
was owned by Mr. Tetley,

23
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,491
a man obsessed with money.

24
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,792
Morning, Mr, Crosetti,

25
00:03:56,864 --> 00:04:00,664
Mr. Crosetti, our barber,
cut my hair a thousand times,

26
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:04,466
always talking about faraway ladies
he would never know.

27
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,399
I remember Ed the barman,

28
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,568
yesterday's football hero,

29
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:13,944
still haunted by 40-yard runs
down the dark fields of his dreams.

30
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:19,116
Our teacher was Miss Foley.

31
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:23,180
We couldn't believe it, but folks said
that once, before we were even born,

32
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:26,318
she had been
the most beautiful woman in town.

33
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:36,426
And of course,
I can still see Jim Nightshade,

34
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:42,340
my best friend,
my blood brother, my shadow.

35
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,617
- Finished?
- Yes, Miss Foley,

36
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,459
- Then you may leave,
- Thank you, Miss Foley,

37
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,829
Quietly,

38
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,959
And let this be a lesson to both of you:

39
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:11,233
I will not have whispering,

40
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,524
- Never,
- Of course I can, I'm older,

41
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:35,221
You 're not older,
We were born on the same night,

42
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:40,256
Yeah, I was born one minute to midnight
and you weren't born till one minute after,

43
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:44,863
- You see?
- I won't always be younger than you,

44
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:51,541
- Hey, Mr, Crosetti,
- Hello, boys,

45
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,173
- Hello, Mr, Tetley,
- ('horn honks.)

46
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,689
Don't be messin' up my work,
Come on, I'll race ya,,,

47
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,126
Hellfire storm's a-comin',
An electric storm,

48
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:11,063
To clean your streets
and wash away your troubles,

49
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:14,067
- So buy one of these lightning rods,,,
- Tie!

50
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,603
Some folks need special protection,

51
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:20,266
I can sniff out
which of your old homes is in danger,

52
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:25,210
Some folks draw lightning to 'em
as a cat sucks in a baby's breath,

53
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,514
But I suppose that this is
really the story of my father,

54
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,047
and that strange, leaf-whispery autumn,

55
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:41,618
when his heart was suddenly
too old and tired

56
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:45,132
and too full of yearning and regrets,

57
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,724
and he didn't know what to do about it.

58
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:52,905
- Hello, son,
- You saw me,

59
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:55,738
Well, what can I find you
that'll keep you awake all night?

60
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,304
Let's see, Travelers to the North Pole?
Wild West. Zane Grey, huh?

61
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:04,647
- I don't think so, Dad,
- Well, I thought all boys liked adventure,

62
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:08,951
- I don't know, Do all fathers?
- ('Jim.) Mine sure does,

63
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:12,254
He's in Africa right now,
The Gold Coast of Africa,

64
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,558
But he's coming back real soon,
and he's bringing me a present,

65
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:22,894
He's bringing me a parrot,
The letter said a green and yellow one,

66
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,033
And a native spear and a war drum
and a necklace made of human teeth,

67
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:29,974
Oh, yes, and a shrunken head,

68
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:32,740
- Have you ever seen a shrunken head?
- Only yours,

69
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:35,749
Shh, boys, Now, young Jim Nightshade,
what can I find you?

70
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:40,720
Something from the Arabian Nights
now, full of magicians and monsters? No?

71
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:44,155
Let's see, Drums of Doom?
The Saga of the Thunder Lizards?

72
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:47,683
No, thanks, Mr, Halloway,
Something about headhunters,

73
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:49,889
They're my father's friends right now,

74
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:54,799
Look, who are you fooling?
Your father doesn't ever write,

75
00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:00,398
- That's better than a father who's afraid,,
- My father's not afraid of anything,

76
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:05,503
He's just a bit old, that's all,
It doesn't mean he's afraid,

77
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,075
- Doesn't it?
- Anyway, my father's here,

78
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:15,350
Yours isn't coming back, is he?
Not ever,

79
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,290
One day, You'll see,

80
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:23,956
- ('§ distant music.)
- Shh, listen, Can you hear?

81
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:27,125
- What is it?
- Listen, Why don't you ever listen?

82
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:30,136
- I am,
- Like music,

83
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:35,305
I don't hear no music,
It must be that old wind again,

84
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,818
('laughing.)

85
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:50,415
- Oh, do you live hereabouts, boys?
- These are our houses,

86
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:53,483
One of which, as I listen to it,

87
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,428
has murmuring timbers,

88
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,955
Can't you hear it? Who tells ya?

89
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:02,298
Tom Fury tells ya,

90
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,831
Your house is in need of protection,

91
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,568
Which house?

92
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:15,340
- This one,
- It's his house,

93
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,044
- Now, your names, gentlemen?
- Will Halloway,

94
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:22,419
- Jim Nightshade,
- Well, Mr, Nightshade, sir,

95
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,449
You just go right in and tell your father

96
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,964
that Mr, Tom Fury of the lightning rods

97
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:33,660
presents his compliments,

98
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:37,568
and your house is in very
urgent need of protection,

99
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:40,869
- All right, I'll tell my father that,
- Jim!

100
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:44,241
You want to say something, Will Halloway?

101
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,780
Will, what kept you so late?

102
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,510
- Your supper's ready,
- Coming, Mom,

103
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:53,076
- Later,
- Yeah,

104
00:09:56,524 --> 00:10:01,791
- Jim? Is that you, Jim?
- Yes, Mom,

105
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:05,263
Darling, can you get yourself
something to eat out of the icebox?

106
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:09,429
There's a ham in there
and some peanut butter,

107
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:12,734
Mother's just all tired out, darling,

108
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:16,038
Jim, what are you doing?
Cat got your tongue?

109
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,945
- Oh, we're buying a lightning rod, Mom,
- Don't make jokes, please,

110
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,912
Well, my father said yes,

111
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,390
Well done,
Now, which one will you have?

112
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,520
This one's got old Chinese hen tracks
on her, A rod invented to catch,,,

113
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:40,363
I'll have this one with the beetles on there,
Like an Egyptian scarab,

114
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:45,337
Good boy, Once the lightning rod
on the pyramids of Egypt,

115
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:49,570
Trained for 3,000 years to pitch the
lightning back to the high heavens,

116
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:51,544
And it's yours for,,,

117
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:54,647
How much you got there, boy?

118
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:00,685
- It's yours,
- Thank you,

119
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:05,156
You're welcome,,,

,,, which surely has to be lucky,

123
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,416
Do you ever play the numbers, Mr,
Halloway?

124
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:38,322
- Me? No, Never take risks,
- Well, you should, sir,

125
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:41,327
One day, I'm gonna win
that §100,000 number,

126
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,330
And it won't be ten-cent cigars
for us then, Mr, Halloway,

127
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,332
lt'll be the big imported Havana Specials,

128
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,335
rolled on the plump, smooth thighs
of Cuban ladies,

129
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,098
Mr, Halloway,

130
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:57,699
- You can't smell it, can you?
- Smell what?

131
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,976
Powder, Lady's powder and perfume,

132
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,943
The sweet smell of rustling petticoats,

133
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,285
Smells to me like
we're going to have visitors,

134
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:14,123
- Elegant visitors, Beautiful ladies,
- You'll have to make do with

135
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:18,256
the ladies you've got here, Mr, Crosetti,
We don't get any visitors in this town,

136
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:22,200
Not in October, Or any other
time of the year, come to that,

137
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,328
('car horn honks.)

138
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:28,466
Do you know what you need,
Mr, Halloway?

139
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,375
A touch of Crosetti's Color Restorer,

140
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,114
Make you feel years younger,

141
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,512
I wish it were that easy,

142
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,852
Oh, Doc, did you see what
Northwestern did last week?

143
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:50,386
Northwestern, 20 seconds to go, they
got the ball, he fades back for a pass,

144
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:54,958
- Touchdown, Wins by two!
- Ed, Doc,

145
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:58,766
Charlie, do you have any idea what
Northwestern's gonna do this week?

146
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,400
Now, you remember your heart,
Just one drink and one cigar,

147
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,637
Come on now, You know what they'll
do? They'll kill 'em,

148
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:08,113
That's what they're gonna do,
Boy, I wish I was out there

149
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:12,380
to run, to throw, tackle,,, touchdowns,
There's nothing like it,

150
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:16,617
- to smell that grass, to run on the field!
- Hey, Ed,

151
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,684
- Boy, ain't you somethin',
- Always was, always was,

00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:25,163
- To your health, Doc,

Jim, why don't you ever answer?

158
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,453
I've got half a mind to throw
this darn thing away,

159
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:52,356
- And get yourself burned?
- Yeah,

160

Prowlin' around town now,

167
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,887
Lookin' for some juicy, tender young
Christian to eat, I don't wonder,

168
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:37,655
You got something there, Dad?

169
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,996
Huh? No,

170
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:54,143
You seem sad tonight,

171
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,774
Oh, it's Will,

172
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,286
He makes me feel so darn old,

173
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:03,346
A man should be able to
play baseball with his son,

174
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:05,892
Baseball is not necessary,

175
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,428
not with a heart like yours,

176
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:11,191
He'll forgive you that, hmm?

177
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:14,257
Hmm, Maybe so,

178
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:20,874
You know,,,

179
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:25,401
I feel restless,

180
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,844
Must be a storm comin',

181
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:28,905
('wind howling.)

182
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,446
('door slams shut)

183
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,784
('whispers.) Dad?

184
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,853
('bell tolls.)

185
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,556
Will!

186
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:30,926
Will, the carnival's come,
The carnival's come!

187
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:41,808
- In the middle of the night?
- Hell, yes, Come on!

188
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:51,348
('train approaches/whistles.)

189
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,532
('howling.)

190
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,473
('thunderclap.)

191
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:50,208
- But how could it,,,
- Come on!

192

('creaks.)

193
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,330
('whispers.) Jim, don't,

194
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,973
('both scream.)

195
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,645
('§ calliope music.)

196
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:23,900
('§ calliope music
continues in the distance.)

197
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:29,231
What is it, son? Can't sleep?

198
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:35,066
Well, me neither,

199
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:38,176
I thought I heard a train,

200
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,476
Couldn't be, though,

201
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:43,482
Not this time of night,

202
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:47,043
No, it couldn't have been,

203
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,850
Couldn't be a carnival, could it?

204
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:52,790
Not in October,

205
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,020
I mean, you never saw
no scraps of paper, did you?

206
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:58,724
Not about any carnival comin',

207
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,790
('clock chimes.)

208
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,796
3:00,

209
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,610
They call it "the soul's midnight,"

210
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:17,941
- Do they? Why?
- I don't know,

211
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:23,388
I guess it's the time
when a lot of people die,

212
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:26,153
Uh, old people,

213
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,524
I only meant old people,

214
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,061
Old people?

215
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:41,607
Will,,,

216
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:44,803
,,, we should have a talk sometime,

217
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:47,472
just you and I,

218
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:51,244
- What about?
- Oh, about when you were small,

219
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:58,915
That,,, picnic that we took
down by Indigo River,

220
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:02,826
- Look son, I know you got a fright then,,,
- I better get back to bed now,

221
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:07,730
Mom wouldn't like us up this late, talking,

222
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:11,633
She'd say we got to think of tomorrow,

223
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:12,797
Yeah, yeah,

224
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:17,008
Guess you're right, son,

225

picking on them already,

a plain, ordinary old carnival,

229

('Jim.) No, it can't be, It can't be ordinary,

230
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:56,510
We couldn't see it last night in the dark,

231
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,684
- It's Ed,
- Hey, Ed,

Your prize, sir, A free pass
to our fabulous Mirror Maze,

Thank you, Come on,

235

('Ed's voice.) I tell ya, I wish I was
out there, to run, to throw, tackle...

236
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:59,672

the smell of that grass, to run on the field.

237
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:11,422
- ('Jim.) Want to go in?
- ('Will) No,

238
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:17,259
- No?
- Those mirrors,,,

- ,,, they're like last night,
- Miss Foley,

240
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,660
Are you all right, Miss Foley?

241
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,862
Here we are, Miss Foley, Are you OK?

242
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:28,135
Jim, Will, My two whisperers,

I'm all right now,
Yes, of course I am, Silly,

244
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,449
I must be tired out, I guess,

245
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:41,579
Why, it's so bright in there,
So beautiful, so strange,,,

246
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:45,091
It must have dazed me,
I don't quite remember,

247
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:50,824
I must get home,
My little nephew's arriving,

248
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,801
- Is she ill?
- I don't know,

249
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,465
Must be a shock, though,
staring in all those mirrors,

250
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,168
especially if you have a face like that,

251
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:08,209
I can see your place of work, my good sir,

252

and a red, white and blue pole turning,

253

Only I think there is something
missing from your life,

without the scent of a lady's skin,

260

They're waiting for you, my good sir,

261
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:52,089
Call them,

That's very considerate of you boys,
I was just a little faint, I guess,

339
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,515
Why don't you step inside?
Come in, Will, come in,

340
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,356
My nephew Robert just arrived,
and I baked a whole batch of cookies,

341
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:59,729
Come in, Robert?

342
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,331
I'd like you to meet
my young nephew, Robert,

343
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,876
('clears throat)

344
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:22,185
- Miss Foley,,,
- Swell, Hi, Glad to meet you,

345
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:26,781
Miss Foley, we came to warn you,

346
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,190
- Warn?
- Yes,

347
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,787
He won't be in school Monday, He's sick,

348
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:34,526
- Oh?
- Yeah, See ya!

349
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:40,762
What you up to, Jim?

350
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,603
You touched his hand,

351
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:44,768
His horrible, devil's hand,
and you touched it,

352
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:48,177
- Oh, shh,
- ('door opens.)

353
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:26,710
Will Halloway,
you wicked, wicked hooligan,

354
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:28,310
- But I didn't,,,
- Little liar,

355
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:30,821
You stay right there,
I'm coming down,

356
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,688
Come back here,
Come back here this minute,

357
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,954
I'm going to call your mother!

358
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:50,100
('screams.)

359
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:57,077
- Dad,
- What's the trouble, boy?

360
00:41:10,863 --> 00:41:12,854
('murmuring.)

361
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:18,999
Mom?

362
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,338
Jim, Oh, honey,
supper's over, It's late,

363
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:28,403
Well, we've already had our supper,

364
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:31,382
But I'll fix you something real nice,

365
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,444
- OK? You hungry?
- No, It's all right, I guess,

366
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,351
Jim?

367
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:49,025
Well, just now,
you seemed kinda glad to see me,

368
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:54,038
- Well, at least you weren't the, uh,,,
- Mmm, I wasn't the devil? Was that it?

369
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:55,539
I guess,

370
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:00,776
Will,,,

371
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,246
,,, about that picnic
down by the Indigo River,,,

372
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,842
- It's getting late,,,
- Now, you sit, son,

373
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:10,753
Sit until this is finished and done with,

374
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:15,192
- What?
- The talk we were tryin' to have last night,

375
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,196
It's one we should've had a long time ago,

376
00:42:18,264 --> 00:42:23,031
About that strong old current that swept
you way out in the middle of the river,

377
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:28,737
And I stood there and watched,,,

378
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:32,402
,,, tied to the riverbank and helpless,

379
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:37,711
'Cause I had a dad who didn't think
it was right to teach boys to swim,

380
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,210
Well,,,

381
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:46,884
,,, there was a man standin',
drinkin' liquor out of a stone bottle

382
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:51,123
on the other side of the river,
and he dove in after you,

383
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:55,496
Dove in without even taking his boots
off and pulled you out of danger,

384
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,964
You must've been all of
four years old at the time,

385
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:04,905
I knew someone caught hold of me,

386
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:10,613
Someone who wasn't me,

387
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:18,048
No one else knew who it was, but I did,

388
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:22,787
It was Harry Nightshade, son,
Your friend Jim's dad,

389
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,388
A couple of years before
he lit off across the seas

390
00:43:26,465 --> 00:43:29,764
and was never seen in this town again,

391
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:33,635
Mr, Nightshade did your father's work,

392
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,538
Can't forgive myself for that,

393
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:42,877
Or him either, I guess,

394
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,945
But I'll tell you somethin', son,

395
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:53,690
When you see the end of things
comin' close and starin' at you,

396
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:56,023
it's not what you've done that you regret,

397
00:43:56,095 --> 00:44:00,657
it's what you didn't do,
And most of all,,,

398
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,133
,,, that afternoon at the river,

399
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:06,035
when there was nothin' I could do, Will,

400
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:15,010
Blame my father if you like, blame me,

401
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:19,176
We gotta stop blaming sometime,

402
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:28,152
I wish you could be happy,

403
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:41,664
Well,,, just tell me I'll live forever,
Then I'll be happy,

404
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:46,500
Dad, don't talk death,
Someone'll hear you and,,,

405
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:51,145
Dad,,,

406
00:44:56,188 --> 00:45:00,181
Guess I kept you up kinda late,

407
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:02,284
Up you go,

408
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:12,664
- Do you want to come up this way?
- Hmm? Uh, I don't think so,

409
00:45:15,274 --> 00:45:19,472
- Because you're welcome,
- Uh, no, I want to finish my cigar,

410
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:26,351
- I don't want to ditch you,
- I gotta lock up, Will,

411
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:44,365
Why do boys always keep
their windows open?

412
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:49,701
Warm blood,

413
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:52,972
Warm blood?

414
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:56,276
That was your father's problem,

415
00:45:56,348 --> 00:45:59,681
What are you doing still awake?

416
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:01,879
Do I look like him?

417
00:46:01,954 --> 00:46:04,445
I mean, do I look like my father?

418
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,459
Too like,

419
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,057
The day you leave home,
my Harry will be dead forever,

420
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,861
Go to sleep now, sweet dreams,

421
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:24,068
- Good night, mom,
- Good night, darling,

422
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:26,134
('clock ticking.)

423
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:41,048
Yes, please!

424
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,135
Please,

425
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:54,262
Please,

426
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,639
Help me!

427
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:39,076
Please, help me!

428
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:43,185
Please, help me!

429
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:47,348
('bell tolling.)

430
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:06,206
Jim, you're ditching me, Jim!

431
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,949
- Where are you goin'?
- Back to the merry-go-round,

432
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:26,760
Oh, no you ain't,
He'll be there, that Mr, Cooger,

433
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:30,962
Making himself so big and tall
and strong that he'll kill us,

434
00:48:32,137 --> 00:48:35,629
Let go, Let go, or so help me,,,
I'll remember this when,,,

435
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,369
- When what?
- When I'm older, darn it, older,

436
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:40,536
When you're older?

437
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:42,603
- I didn't mean,,,
- Oh, yes you did!

438
00:48:42,681 --> 00:48:47,209
If that darn merry-go-round
could make Mr, Cooger younger,,,

439
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:49,516
,,, why, you think you'd be older

440
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:51,886
if you got on it and went
the other way around,

441
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:55,916
Is that what you figured out
in your little mind, Jim Nightshade?

442
00:48:55,994 --> 00:48:59,760
You'd be 2 feet taller, looking down at me,

443
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:03,557
And you'd ditch me,

444
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:06,860
Wait!

445
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:11,239
('thunder)

446
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:19,481
('Mr. Cooger) That's the trouble,
those two boys, Should we,,,

447
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:24,011
('Dark) Just make certain
they don't interfere in our work,

448
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:28,890
Oh, doom, damnation,
death and destruction,

449
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:31,395
Who tells you?
Tom Fury tells you,

450
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:35,661
Tell me when, you old fool,
When is the lightning due?

451
00:49:35,734 --> 00:49:37,895
I am Tom Fury,

452
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,133
Did I take the name?
No, sir, The name took me,,,

453
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:45,438
I must know,
Lightning reveals our dark corners,

454
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,172
Rain washes away our dust,
Tell me when,

455
00:49:49,314 --> 00:49:51,373
What color is lightning?

456
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,782
Where does the thunder go when it dies?

457
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:56,582
- ('Will) Mr, Crosetti,
- ('Jim.) And Mr, Tetley!

458
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:59,021
What country does the rain come from?

459
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:02,026
Who knows? Tom Fury knows,

460
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:06,128
If I show her to you, your bride,,,

461
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:09,832
,,, you will tell me when
the storm is coming,

462
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,029
Most beautiful,

463
00:50:57,215 --> 00:51:02,983
More beautiful than Pocahontas
and Helen of Troy,,,

464
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:05,523
('Dark) You will tell me
when the storm is coming,

465
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:10,493
When comes the storm?

466
00:51:10,562 --> 00:51:13,827
Oh, Tom Fury says the lightning
shall jump the world,

467
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:16,390
and make men hop and skip
like scalded cats,

468
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:21,599
You fool, Lightning shall make you
hop and make you tell!

469
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:26,704
Ohh, Tom told to,,, aah,,,

470
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:29,872
- Tom Fury has a secret!
- When?

471
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:34,681
So does the lightning and the thunder,
Aah!

472
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:36,983
Stop, Stop it!

473
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:42,749
('both scream.)

474
00:52:04,116 --> 00:52:06,550
('Dark) Those boys,,,,

475
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:09,178
They've seen too much,

476
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,881
Hunt them down,,,

477
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,654
,,, and bring them back to me,

478
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:12,311
It's that Jim Nightshade, And take
your hat off, He's a bad influence,

479
00:53:12,384 --> 00:53:14,409
- But mom,,,
- Don't you "but mom" me,

480
00:53:15,053 --> 00:53:17,647
How dare you sneak out this late?

481
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:22,421
I want no excuses,
Now march right upstairs,

482
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:27,189
Best go up, son,

483
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:53,082
You know, I never liked my father either,
a lot of the time,

484
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:59,923
- Was Grandpa a good man?
- Everyone thought so,

485
00:53:59,998 --> 00:54:04,435
- He knew about evil?
- Sure talked a lot about it,

486
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,060
Really knew?

487
00:54:06,137 --> 00:54:10,369
We had devils for breakfast,
lunch, and supper in our house,

488
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:16,439
I believe in devils,

489
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:20,610
But if you're a good person,
they can't hurt you, can they?

490
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:28,786
Am I,,, a good person?

491
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,229
I wouldn't count on your mother's answer
right now, but I think you are,

492
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,101
Yeah,,, Drink your milk, then,

493
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,263
Maybe we'll talk tomorrow,

494
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:46,268
- Dad?
- Hmm?

495
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:50,678
Be careful, Dad,
Something's going on,

496
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:55,482
- Something?
- Just be careful, OK?

497
00:54:58,323 --> 00:55:00,120
OK,

00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:54,408
No, a search,,, for us,

519
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:58,785
We can't go home,
They'd follow us and kill our folks,

- I can't.

- Hey, Charlie,
- Huh, Doc?

531
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:23,459
Charlie, look here, The bar is empty,

532
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:27,300
First time in 20 years, there's nobody
there, Ed must've just taken off,

533
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:30,499
He wouldn't do that, That's not like Ed,

- Now, that's odd,
- It sure is,

538
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,648
Hey Doc, have you seen Will and Ji,,,

539
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:23,884
Excuse me, gentlemen, I am a stranger
in this town, perhaps you could help me,

540
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:27,863
My name is Dark,
I'm looking for two young boys,

541
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:33,768
- Town's full of them,
- Yes, No doubt, sir, No doubt,

542
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:36,807
But these boys in particular,
they're two of a kind,

543
01:03:36,874 --> 01:03:40,833
Much of a height, One towheaded,
the other black as pitch,

544
01:03:40,912 --> 01:03:44,040
You could take them for blood brothers,

545
01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:48,643
- What have they done?
- Done, sir? Why, nothing wrong, surely,

546
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,450
No, they're two lucky lads
who've won prizes at the carnival,

547
01:03:52,523 --> 01:03:56,892
I merely wish to give them the valuable
rewards that they so richly deserve,

548
01:03:58,729 --> 01:04:00,128
Can you help me?

549
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,295
Excuse me, See you, Doc,

550
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:06,828
Charlie,

551
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:19,840
('whispers.) Dad,

552
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:24,711
- Lose something, sir?
- Uh,,,

553
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:28,850
Uh, folks around here all seem
to be taking a holiday, hmm?

554
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:32,987
- Must be the carnival,
- These boys I'm looking for,

555
01:04:33,064 --> 01:04:38,661
- perhaps you know them?
- Won prizes, I think you said,

556
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:42,331
- Lucky fellas, Have a cigar?
- No,

557
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,648
Well now, I wouldn't want a couple of
kids to miss out on their good fortune,

558
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:04,591
Let me see, that one,
Yes, I know him well,

559
01:05:04,662 --> 01:05:07,062
- His name's, uh,,,
- Yes?

560
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:10,567
Uh, Milton Blumquist,

561
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:14,264
And that,,, oh, why, Avery Johnson,

562
01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:19,173
Yeah, Fine boys, fine, Both of 'em
quite a credit to this little town,

563
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:21,473
if you want to know the truth,

564
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:23,740
I do want to know the truth, sir,

565
01:05:23,814 --> 01:05:26,510
And the truth is that you are lying,

566
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:29,246
You see, I already have their names,

567
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,551
I got them from a blind girl,
used to be a teacher hereabouts,

568
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:36,252
A poor creature by the name of Foley,

569
01:05:36,327 --> 01:05:40,457
Will is the fair-haired,
and Jim, the dark,

570
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:45,067
Now tell me, old man,

571
01:05:45,136 --> 01:05:48,799
- what's your name?
- Halloway, sir,

572
01:05:48,873 --> 01:05:53,276
- Charles William Halloway,
- Oh, yes, The town's librarian,

573
01:05:53,344 --> 01:05:58,407
- I have the honor, sir,
- And have had for many years, I believe,

574
01:05:58,482 --> 01:06:02,077
All that time spent living
only through other men's lives,

575
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:08,384
Dreaming only other men's dreams,
What a waste,

576
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:11,326
Sometimes a man can learn more
from other men's dreams

577
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:13,192
than he can from his own,

578
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:18,693
Come visit me, sir, if you would
wish to improve your education,

579
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:22,170
I will, And I may improve yours,

580
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:35,542
('§ funeral dirge.)

581
01:07:20,431 --> 01:07:22,399
Boys, what the hell's goin' on?

582
01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:52,058
Come to the library tonight,

583
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:21,286
('Will) That's why they had the parade,
so they could find us and kill us,

584
01:08:21,358 --> 01:08:27,558
And so, we had to hide,
because, well,,, who'd believe us?

585
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:31,533
- ('Mr. Halloway.) I believe you,
- ('Jim.) You do? But we're not grownups,

586
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:34,867
That's why I believe you,
Now, listen to this,

587
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:39,433
Diary of my father, Charles Herbert
Halloway, minister of this town:

588
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:43,712
"October, 1891,

589
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:48,111
"We have had no good fortune
since there arrived here

590
01:08:48,185 --> 01:08:50,244
"the autumn carnival,

591
01:08:51,789 --> 01:08:55,987
"It seems strange to speak of such
things in these enlightened days,

592
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:01,760
"A poor, lame servant girl went to the
fortuneteller to inquire how she might run,

593
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:04,733
"Her leg mended,,,

594
01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:06,360
",,, and then she ran mad,

595
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:12,567
"It seems they destroy people

596
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,941
"by granting their dearest wishes,

597
01:09:15,012 --> 01:09:17,606
"as has been the way of the devil

598

"since God created the world,

"Old folks of this town

"say they remember
such a carnival of evil

in the days of their youth,"

"they would return, some other autumn,

Each time their visit ended
with a most unusual storm,"

('Mr. Halloway.) Boys, hide, quick,

God is not dead, nor doth he sleep,"

612

"The wrong will fail, the right, prevail,

613
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:59,480
with peace on earth, good will to men,"

614
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,917
It's a thousand years
to Christmas, Mr, Halloway,

615
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:08,425
You're wrong, It's here in this library
tonight, and can't be spoiled,

616
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:12,952
Did Will and Jim bring it with them
on the soles of their shoes?

617
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:15,328
Then we shall have to scrape them,

618
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,862

619
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,496

How would you like to be
king of the carnival, Jim?

622
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:36,613
The ruler of the rides?

623
01:11:39,456 --> 01:11:43,358
How would you like to be grown up, Jim?

624
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:47,227
How would that feel, huh?

625
01:11:47,298 --> 01:11:50,631
Not to be looked down at,

626
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:54,865
Not to be told to run away and play,

627
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:59,773
To be trusted, To be feared,

628
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:04,109
To know what grownups do behind
locked doors when children are asleep,

629
01:12:09,186 --> 01:12:11,177
Come out to me, Jim,

630
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:18,987
I'm the father you've been waiting for,,,

631
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:21,031
,,, my son,

632
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:28,203
I know who you are,

633
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:33,606
You are the autumn people,

634
01:12:33,677 --> 01:12:36,908
Where do you come from? The dust,

635
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,939
- Where do you go to? The grave,
- Yes,

636
01:12:41,018 --> 01:12:43,714
We are the hungry ones,

637
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:47,348
Your torments call us like dogs in the night,

638
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:50,689
And we do feed, and feed well,

639
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:54,060
To stuff yourselves
on other people's nightmares,

640
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:58,500
And butter our plain bread
with delicious pain,

641
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:03,006
So, you do understand a little,

642
01:13:03,073 --> 01:13:05,803
You are known in this town,
My father knew you,

643
01:13:05,876 --> 01:13:09,676
Your father, The preacher?
That half-man?

644
01:13:09,747 --> 01:13:12,875
- He lived on goodness,
- Tasteless fare,

645
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,646
Funerals, bad marriages,

646
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,381
lost loves, lonely beds,

647
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:20,685
That is our diet,

648
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:23,921
We suck that misery and find it sweet,

649
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:27,361
We search for more, always,

650
01:13:27,431 --> 01:13:31,731
We can smell young boys
ulcerating to be men 1000 miles off,

651
01:13:31,802 --> 01:13:34,032
And hear a middle-aged fool like you,

652
01:13:34,104 --> 01:13:37,972
groaning with midnight despairs,
from halfway around the world,

653
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:43,577
Your books cannot hurt me, old man,

654
01:13:45,282 --> 01:13:49,912
Yes, old, Because your heart is old,

655
01:13:50,954 --> 01:13:52,945
Listen to it,

656
01:13:56,093 --> 01:13:59,153
You tell me where the boys are hiding,

657
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:03,029
and I can make you young again,

658
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,763
I could turn your years back for you to,,,

659
01:14:06,837 --> 01:14:08,828
,,, let's say, 30?

660
01:14:11,008 --> 01:14:15,274
Now speak, or you've missed it,

661
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:16,573
Going,,,

662
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:21,641
it's gone,

663
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:24,610
31,

664
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:29,182
32, 32?

665
01:14:29,259 --> 01:14:32,990
Year of a man's prime,
loved by many women,

666
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:34,655
You might still learn to swim,

667
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:38,098
32, going,,, gone,

668
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:44,300
33,,, 34,,, 35,,, 35?

669
01:14:44,374 --> 01:14:46,569
Oh, 35,

670
01:14:46,643 --> 01:14:49,942
Time to father a family, build a fortune,

671
01:14:50,013 --> 01:14:54,416
35,,, a year when you could run up
the stairs without panting for breath,

672
01:14:54,485 --> 01:14:57,784
35,,, gone,

673
01:14:57,855 --> 01:15:01,848
36,,, 37,,,

674
01:15:01,925 --> 01:15:06,259
Where are they? 38,,,

675
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:10,630
Hear your heart, hear my count,

676
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:16,570
39,,, Now, 39, a fine year,

677
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,337
Still young, 39,,, gone,

678
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:26,508
Oh, oh! 40,
40, and hear your old, old heart!

679
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:28,676
Dad, no, Don't listen!

680
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:33,679
And is that the voice

681
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:36,282
of green grass and sunshine?

682
01:15:37,394 --> 01:15:40,886
Sweet Eden's child,
the innocent young Will?

683
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:48,234
42,,, 43,,,

684
01:15:49,907 --> 01:15:53,536
44,,, 45,,, 46,,,

685
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:58,013
47, 48, 49, 50, 52,

686
01:15:58,081 --> 01:16:00,174
Your loss!

687
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:10,086
- You fool,
- Damn you,

688
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:14,358
- A taste of death?
- ('groaning.)

689
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:17,923
So you'll know it when
it comes again, soon,

690
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,643
Jim? Will?

691
01:16:39,923 --> 01:16:41,982
Time to go,

692
01:16:44,661 --> 01:16:47,630
Jim Nightshade,

693
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:52,431
What a good,,,
what a proper name for a carnival,

694
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:56,871
Dark and Nightshade's
Pandemonium Carnival,

695
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:01,108
That's your name, Jim,

696
01:17:01,178 --> 01:17:03,612
Mr, Nightshade,

697
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,643
Will, then,

698
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,778
Will?

699
01:17:10,854 --> 01:17:13,345
Your mother was at the carnival tonight,

700
01:17:13,423 --> 01:17:15,857
She rode the carousel,

701
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:22,057
She went backwards and forwards

702
01:17:22,132 --> 01:17:26,535
until she was quite, quite mad,

703
01:17:29,506 --> 01:17:34,341
You should've heard the one
single sound she made,

704
01:17:41,752 --> 01:17:43,549
Come out now,

705
01:17:45,689 --> 01:17:46,815
Jim?

706
01:17:49,226 --> 01:17:51,217
Jim, you're the clever one,

707
01:17:52,562 --> 01:17:55,554
You tell me where your friend is hiding,

708
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:59,193
and I can guarantee you
a very special reward,

709
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:15,579
Now, where would you be filed, I wonder?

710
01:18:17,454 --> 01:18:22,221
Under "A" for Adventure, or "B" for boys?

711
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,024
"J" for Jim, or "N" for Nightshade?

712
01:18:29,066 --> 01:18:32,763
"H" for Halloway,,,

713
01:18:32,836 --> 01:18:34,827
,,, or "H" for hidden?

714
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:02,793
('both scream.)

715
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:09,527
Well, here's a couple of fine new books,

716
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:12,769
I'll enjoy cutting this one's pages,

717
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:19,377
Mom!

718
01:19:24,888 --> 01:19:27,584
Seems I made a little mistake,

719
01:19:27,657 --> 01:19:30,820
It must've been your mother,
Jim, at the carnival,

720
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:37,924
Poor thing, What a tragedy,

721
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:42,305
Still, you won't be needing her anymore,

722
01:19:42,372 --> 01:19:46,502
Look, You have a fine, new mother now,

723
01:19:57,154 --> 01:19:59,987
Time to quiet these two chatterers,

724
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:04,493
Time to still these two whisperers,

725
01:20:04,561 --> 01:20:07,894
Lose their tongues until
I choose to find them again,

726
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:11,924
Quiet, you two chatterers,

727
01:20:13,203 --> 01:20:16,639
Still, you two whisperers,

728
01:20:19,576 --> 01:20:21,567
('groans.)

729
01:20:29,686 --> 01:20:33,281
And give him a brief taste of death,

730
01:20:33,356 --> 01:20:36,655
so that he may recognize
it when it comes again,

731
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:55,874
('thunder rumbles.)

732
01:20:55,946 --> 01:20:59,848
Old man, hear your heart beating,

733
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,211
Slow, now,

734
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:08,547
Slower,,,

735
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,519
Slower,,,

736
01:21:36,586 --> 01:21:39,487
Slower,,,

737
01:21:39,556 --> 01:21:42,457
,,, slowest,

738
01:21:57,374 --> 01:22:01,105
What times we're
going to have, Jim, you and I,

739
01:22:01,745 --> 01:22:03,872
Dark and Nightshade,

740
01:22:05,215 --> 01:22:07,410
Nightshade and Dark,

741
01:22:08,485 --> 01:22:10,350
And Will,,,

742
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:13,218
,,, we'll ride him backwards, shall we?

743
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,850
Turn him into a little baby,

744
01:22:15,926 --> 01:22:18,656
a plaything for our little friend here,

745
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,389
('laughs.)

746
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:48,222
('thunder rumbles.)

747
01:22:58,368 --> 01:23:01,303
('thunderclap.)

748
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:09,338
('thunderclap.)

749
01:23:18,621 --> 01:23:21,146
Harry, is that you?

750
01:23:21,224 --> 01:23:23,522
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr, Halloway,

751
01:23:23,593 --> 01:23:26,391
I,,, I was expecting somebody else,

752
01:23:26,463 --> 01:23:28,624
See, I have a message, I have a ticket,,,

753
01:23:28,698 --> 01:23:31,189
Whatever the messages, they'll be lies,
Go home,

754
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:34,566
- No, I have to wait here for Harry,,,
- For God's sake, go home,

755
01:23:34,637 --> 01:23:37,765
The man coming for you
isn't your husband,

756
01:23:38,942 --> 01:23:43,003
But,,, they told me,,,

757
01:23:52,722 --> 01:23:55,316
('thunderclap.)

758
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:23,080
('echoing.) Dad!

759
01:24:45,742 --> 01:24:49,644
('Dark) Not dead yet, Mr. Halloway?

760
01:24:49,712 --> 01:24:53,876
Come looking in my mirrors
for another chance?

761
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,282
Shall I help you find it?

762
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:59,219
Would you know it if you saw it?

763
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:03,419
Here the mirror of dreams, of beauty.

764
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:07,930
Can Crosetti tell you of
incredible loves he never lived?

765
01:25:08,531 --> 01:25:10,192
Over here...

766
01:25:10,266 --> 01:25:14,225
...see the mirror of
riches beyond wishing,

767
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:17,034
where Mr. Tetley's buried.

768
01:25:17,107 --> 01:25:19,337
Halloway, look.

769
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,505
Look here for the great and famous.

770
01:25:24,948 --> 01:25:29,510
Ed, the barman hero
of all the football years.

771
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:34,120
All his cheering crowds gone.

772
01:25:38,528 --> 01:25:43,227
Here, the looking glass
of pride and ruined vanity,

773
01:25:43,299 --> 01:25:47,167
where wars of time are fought and lost.

774
01:25:48,171 --> 01:25:51,834
And now this.

775
01:25:51,908 --> 01:25:55,435
This is your glass of darkness,
Mr. Halloway.

776
01:25:56,312 --> 01:25:59,110
Its name, regret.

777
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:02,782
Its sum, despair.

778
01:26:21,804 --> 01:26:25,535
Drink deep its funeral sights and sounds.

779
01:26:27,844 --> 01:26:31,541
Your failure as a father and as a man.

780
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:36,347
Your son hates you.

781
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:41,487
You've lost him. He's mine.

782
01:26:41,558 --> 01:26:44,322
And young Jim Nightshade, too.

783
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:48,760
Drown, Halloway.

784
01:26:50,033 --> 01:26:52,831
Drown in your regrets.

785
01:26:56,573 --> 01:26:59,098
Dad!

786
01:26:59,175 --> 01:27:01,200

on that bright morning,

that he'd made a memory...
