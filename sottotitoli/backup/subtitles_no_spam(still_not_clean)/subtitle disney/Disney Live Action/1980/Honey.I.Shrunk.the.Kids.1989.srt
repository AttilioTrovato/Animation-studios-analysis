1
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,897
Good morning, Quark.

2
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,519
Couldn't believe it.
Lisa told Janet

3
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,318
that Paul asked Barbara to ask me
if I had a date to the dance.

4
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,859
No.
They broke up for religious differences.

5
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,070
She thought she was God and he disagreed.

6
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,453
Yeah, this afternoon around five.

7
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,909
I'm meeting him at the mall.

8
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,620
I don't know.
Maybe. Yeah.

9
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,631
I can't.

10
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,005
I've got to hang around awhile
and keep an eye on Nick.

11
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,136
He likes to take things apart.

12
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,973
Well, that's why I watch it at your house.

13
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,597
Things will cool off after today.

14
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,891
Dad has his big "show and tell" at the lab.

15
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,389
Zap!

16
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,565
- It works! It really works!
- Nick, get real.

17
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,948
The subject... has disappeared.

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,737
No, no, it's not that.

19
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,777
No.

20
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,575
Mom and Dad had an argument last night,

21
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,281
and Mom spent the night at Grandma's.

22
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,325
I think she needed a rest.

23
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,376
Right.
Her and me both.

24
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,957
Yeah, okay.

25
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,255
Okay.
Bye.

26
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,764
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

27
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,302
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

28
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,357
If only Dad could get that machine to work.

29
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,793
Breakfast.

30
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,672
I need a couple of minutes here.

31
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,301
"I'll be down in five minutes."

32
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,804
Typing with his gloves on again.

33
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,093
No, not again!

34
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,842
Who does he think he is, Mister Wizard?

35
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,894
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!

36
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,306
It's construction, honey.

37
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,483
You of all people should understand that.

38
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,568
Yeah, but I want some sleep.

39
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,611
We got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

40
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,899
And I think he should have
some consideration for other people.

41
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,577
Give the guy a break.

42
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,162
I'll give him a break.

43
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,406
I'll break his arm!

44
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,199
Honey!

45
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,711
Szalinski!

46
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,708
- You're much bigger than he is.
- Szalinski!

47
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,218
- Honey, can't we...
- Hold it, Dad.

48
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,091
Don't move.

49
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,593
- Ron, what are you doing?
- Defending the backyard, Dad.

50
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,932
That's my fishing rod!

51
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,884
Dad, no!

52
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,220
Dad!

53
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,939
Am I bleeding?

54
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,854
Honey, it's rubber.

55
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,686
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

56
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,690
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?

57
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,612
Gotta mark those trespassers, Dad.

58
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,235
I'm not a trespasser.
I'm your father!

59
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,786
Better wash it off quick, hon.

60
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,201
- It's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

61
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,786
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

62
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,629
Attila the Hun was 12 once, too, you know.

63
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,918
Come on!

64
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,963
He's sounding.

65
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,669
Weird family.

66
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,817
Dad?

67
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,320
Look, I finished mine.

68
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,990
- Looks just like yours?
- That's great, Nick.

69
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,984
You know, Dad, I was calculating.

70
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,120
If you took all the molecules
in this house...

71
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,504
Listen, Nick, I gotta get this thing
working before I leave.

72
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:28,771
Why don't you help your sister?

73
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,951
Stay back, boy.

74
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
If this thing works,

75
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,088
this'll put us right up there
with the invention of electricity,

76
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,962
the first man in space.

77
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,293
First dog in space.

78
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,803
Come on!
Shrink!

79
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,555
Shrink!

80
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,940
Please, please, shrink.

81
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,488
Shrink!

82
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,086
On the other hand,

83
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,794
we've come up with an interesting way
of making applesauce.

84
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,258
You got it, honey.

85
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,888
- Sure?
- Positive.

86
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,059
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

87
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,149
Everybody in my family's a comedian.

88
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,984
Everybody except you, hon.

89
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,612
Darn right.

90
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,617
Well, look who's decided
to join the land of the living.

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,369
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

92
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,368
Not really, Dad.

93
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,123
Not really?

94
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,167
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

95
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,583
Fishing's your thing, Dad, not mine.

96
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,508
What's the matter with him?

97
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,756
What do you mean "shush"?

98
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,596
I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

99
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,179
Russel, I shouldn't be telling you this,

100
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,137
but he was cut
from the football team yesterday.

101
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,640
- What?
- Honey, please!

102
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,719
What he doesn't need right now
is to hear from you.

103
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:57,518
He needs something.

104
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,892
- When I was his age, I was cap...
- Captain of the team.

105
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,916
And if my father wanted me
to go on a fishing trip,

106
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:03,394
- I would've been...
- Been grateful.

107
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,904
Russ, he is too small for football.

108
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,065
- He is not too small for football!
- Too small!

109
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,367
Honey, when you say things like that,

110
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,762
you make him feel about this big.

111
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:13,710
If he wants to feel big, he should act big.

112
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,249
Elbows up.

113
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,424
What's the matter with you?

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,717
I am on a special diet.

115
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,966
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.

116
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,932
Here, Quark.

117
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,143
Eat it, Dad, before it gets cold.

118
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,818
Did you get the machine to work?

119
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,028
Yeah.

120
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,825
A few more bugs to get out, but...

121
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,781
What about the conference?

122
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,165
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

123
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,211
Dad!
Dad, wait.

124
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,628
Dad!

125
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,002
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

126
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,924
Dad, don't forget my dress
from the cleaners,

127
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
- Nick's allergy pills...
- It's all in my head. Don't worry.

128
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,886
Wish me luck!

129
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,014
I need luck getting out of this door.

130
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,018
House of Insanity.

131
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,558
<i>- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.</i>

132
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,900
Nick, go get Dad.

133
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,899
He's just leaving for the conference.

134
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,276
Dad, it's Mom.

135
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,533
- Where?
- On the phone!

136
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,406
How did everything go this morning?

137
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,404
Boy, did we miss you.

138
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,997
I missed you too, honey.

139
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,950
Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?

140
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,580
I think he's going to.

141
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,379
I'm gonna meet him at the mall later today.

142
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,167
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

143
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,089
<i>- Hiya.
- Hi.</i>

144
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:47,961
Nick!

145
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,962
I called to wish you
the luck at the conference.

146
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,033
Look, Diane,

147
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,659
if things go well this morning,

148
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,643
everything will change around here,
I promise you.

149
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,050
Okay.
I have a house to show,

150
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,853
and then I'll be home this afternoon
and we'll talk.

151
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,929
<i>Good luck today.</i>

152
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,022
Thanks.
Bye, honey.

153
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,188
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later.

154
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,594
Listen, we got to make this place
spick and span. Okay?

155
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,996
Nick, I want you to mow the lawn.
Amy...

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,447
Good luck.

157
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm helping my dad
with this real important new invention.

158
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,131
So, urn...

159
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,259
I'll let you mow half my yard.

160
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,549
No, thanks.

161
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,682
With that?

162
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,012
Yeah!

163
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,269
And... this.

164
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,608
It's a remote control!

165
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,987
Tell you what.

166
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,033
You throw in... a box of cookies,
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

167
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,082
But I have to go and meet Newt right now.

168
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,662
Could I do it later?

169
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,104
I don't think so, because, you know,

170
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:10,926
- My dad's gonna come home and...
- Come on!

171
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,005
Okay.
Don't be too late.

172
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,552
Okay, thanks.

173
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,217
No problem.

174
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,757
See you later!

175
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,641
Nothing like a hard day's work.

176
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,233
French fries,

177
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,570
Tater sticks,

178
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,448
meat loaf,

179
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,530
veal "parmedjian".

180
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,537
Hey, Dad.
Wanna go play some baseball?

181
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,792
Baseball...

182
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,249
No.

183
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,372
I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

184
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,841
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

185
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,437
Hey, Szalinski,

186
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,897
ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

187
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,197
Nope.

188
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,068
Baseball's for mortals.

189
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,653
Maybe you could be the base.

190
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,576
Maybe you could be the mound.

191
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,039
Ronald!

192
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,658
Lug your stuff.

193
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,836
Later, worm.

194
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,761
Russell, give me a hand here.

195
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,934
Russell!
Give me a hand here.

196
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,855
Dad, it's early.

197
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,521
The early worm catches the fish, Russell.

198
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,149
Remember that.

199
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,566
The Forresters are coming by
after lunch, so come on! Quick march!

200
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,976
Weird family.

201
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,297
Russell...

202
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,879
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today, but,

203
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,513
when I was your age,

204
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,720
I was not much bigger than you.

205
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,476
I know, Dad.
You've told me about a million times.

206
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,099
All right, just hear me out.

207
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,148
The point is, coach put me on these babies.

208
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,766
Know what happened?

209
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,187
I put on 20 pounds of pure, unadulterated,

210
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,590
blitz-the-quarterback and
rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

211
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,405
Now, I'll make you a little bet.

212
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,745
If you work out for... three months,

213
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,249
you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster,

214
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,377
and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

215
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,360
Go ahead, go ahead.

216
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,984
Dad, you know the weights aren't my thing.

217
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,282
Fishing isn't your thing.

218
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,241
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

219
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,078
I don't know,

220
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,171
but I'll keep you posted, okay?

221
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,918
Fine, until you do, you're trying these,

222
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,258
and you're coming fishing with the family.
Is that clear?

223
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,553
I can't hear you!

224
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,676
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,102
Better.

226
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,149
Lift with your legs, not with your back.

227
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,541
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

228
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,461
Russell, you're not smoking a cigarette,
are you?

229
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,638
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

230
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,904
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

231
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,793
We've got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?

232
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:28,864
Tubular!

233
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,616
He's only 12 and he's
already thinking about construction.

234
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,664
Why can't Russell be more like that?

235
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,742
Honey, just give him a chance.

236
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,255
Ron Thompson at the plate.

237
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,383
Bottom of the 9th.
Clutch situation.

238
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,013
Here comes the pitch!

239
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,596
He's swinging like a rusty gate!

240
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,262
He pumps once, pumps twice.!

241
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,147
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

242
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,934
Here it comes.
The fastball is bread and butter.

243
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,560
Grand...

244
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,694
slam.

245
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,828
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

246
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,656
- Come on, dope.
- Nobody has to know.

247
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,911
Nobody saw it but you!

248
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,787
Let's negotiate.
I'm your brother, Russ.

249
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,795
You're not supposed
to fink on your own bother!

250
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,042
Turn me in, and I'll tell all what
you spend your allowance on!

251
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,422
Come on, Russ.

252
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,178
Look, either you tell 'em,
or I tell 'em, okay?

253
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,764
Okay, you tell 'em.

254
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,904
Aren't you in the wrong yard?

255
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,659
- Listen, nerd face...
- Tell 'em!

256
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,122
What's going on?

257
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,500
Hi...

258
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,503
I'm Russ Thompson from next door.

259
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,004
My brother has something to tell you.

260
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,672
Or else I can tell her.

261
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:11,927
Okay.

262
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,005
See, I was playing with my ball, right?

263
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,134
Well, actually, it's not my ball exactly.
It's Charlie Sudzen's...

264
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,296
Just tell her what you did.

265
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,895
It never would have happened
if their house wasn't so close.

266
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,482
He hit a baseball
through your attic window.

267
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,478
He what?

268
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,161
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day!

269
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:30,146
We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take it
out of his allowance, all right?

270
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,397
My allowance?
Dream on.

271
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,357
Okay.
We'll just have Dad pay for it?

272
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,403
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Give me my ball back.

273
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,284
Until you pay, no man shall pass.

274
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,331
You've got nothing to say about it,
space boy.

275
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,533
Cool it!

276
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,082
Nick, take him upstairs
and get him his ball.

277
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,630
- And clean up the mess.
- What?

278
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,049
Do it, Nick.
I don't have time to mess around.

279
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,093
Come on.

280
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,054
This is what's wrong
with the American system of justice.

281
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,637
So...

282
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,594
You like to dance?

283
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,145
How do you know?

284
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,682
Well...

285
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,484
- You could see me?
- No!

286
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,277
No...
Yeah, I could...

287
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,692
but I wasn't watching you, I...

288
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,822
Awesome.

289
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,905
So your dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

290
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,549
And given that my machine
can substantially reduce the size

291
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,630
of bulky payloads...

292
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,508
and fuel supplies,

293
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,269
the savings to the space program
would be staggering.

294
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,804
Mr. Szalinski,

295
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,024
are you trying to tell me that
suddenly size is no longer relative?

296
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,059
Well, that's right, Professor Fredrickson,

297
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,021
that all matter is made up
of not only density, but of empty space.

298
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,730
And if we can proportionately reduce

299
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,614
the amount of empty space
in any given object,

300
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:58,484
we can thereby... shrink the object.

301
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,160
Where's your proof?

302
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,657
When Einstein came up with the atomic bomb,

303
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,421
did they ask him to prove that it worked?

304
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,544
You, Mr. Szalinski, are hardly Einstein.

305
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,997
I picked a name.

306
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,295
You have, however,
managed to shrink one thing.

307
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,343
The size of this audience.

308
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,675
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know about you,

309
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,222
but I'm going to lunch.

310
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,981
Wayne?
Wayne!

311
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,028
- Hi, Dr. Brainard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

312
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,985
It will take time
to convince people without proof.

313
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,650
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

314
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,367
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

315
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,289
The extension cord was a bad idea.

316
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,914
What could be taking them so long?

317
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,504
I am not missing the mall today.

318
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,836
Nick!

319
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,462
- Nick.
- Ron?

320
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,718
If you guys are hiding up here,
it's not funny.

321
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,471
Nick, you know what Dad said.

322
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,848
You're not supposed to be playing up here.

323
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,695
Where are we?

324
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,882
My God.
What happened?

325
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,676
- Amy!
- Russ!

326
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,678
Amy!

327
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,298
Nicky.

328
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,553
Ron?

329
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,971
Nick, what happened?

330
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,681
We're all the size of boogers!

331
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,853
Be quiet, Quark!

332
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,989
Nick, what did you do?

333
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,614
- Me? It was his ball.
- Shut up, wimp!

334
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,445
We have to get Dad.
He'll know what to do.

335
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,286
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

336
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,095
Can somebody get that?

337
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,298
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

338
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,480
Amy?
Nick?

339
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,939
Hello?

340
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,653
It's not for you.

341
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,071
What is it, Quark?

342
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,027
Nick!

343
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,910
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?

344
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,246
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

345
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,916
Mr. Szalinski, up here!

346
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,583
Up here, Dad!

347
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,794
Quick, over there by the door, okay?
Get that side!

348
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,296
Is anybody up there?

349
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,469
Nick, get off and give us a hand!

350
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,173
Nick?
Amy?

351
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,683
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

352
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,556
Gross.

353
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,471
Watch out for the crack!

354
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,652
Hurry up.
He's coming!

355
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,962
Right here, Mr. Szalinski.

356
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,668
Dad!
'Dad!

357
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,468
Help, help!

358
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,689
Where's my couch?

359
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,362
- What is he, deaf?
- Don't you get it?

360
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,913
We're too small.
He can't hear us.

361
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,369
Dad!

362
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,878
I don't believe this.

363
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,097
What a day.

364
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,054
This is all your fault.

365
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,357
- Five years of...
- No, Dad, it works!

366
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,355
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No, Mr. Szalinski!

367
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,981
- Dad!
- Don't even work!

368
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,858
No!

369
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,281
Run!

370
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,792
Dad!

371
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,510
Stay there!

372
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,048
There's glass everywhere here now.

373
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,390
No!

374
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,161
Go!

375
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,123
Help!

376
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,005
No!

377
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,414
Not now, Quark.

378
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,042
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash

379
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,377
the same day they get ours?

380
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,087
- Nick!
- Nick?

381
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,797
I'm over here!

382
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,469
Whose arm is this?

383
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,628
I don't know, but I'm not
waiting around to find out.

384
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:41,075
- Move over!
- Watch out!

385
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,944
My God.

386
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,824
Reminds me of the backyard.

387
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,082
Something tells me
we're not going fishing this weekend.

388
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,959
That should make you happy.

389
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,711
Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

390
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,417
Dad can fix us, right Nick?

391
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,636
I think so.

392
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,638
RON; Great.

393
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,652
We just have to get back to the house.

394
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:20,644
I'm never going back to your house!

395
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,435
I'm going home.

396
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,809
Come on, Russ.

397
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,811
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

398
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,646
Can your dad help us?

399
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,232
Russ, we're supposed to go fishing.

400
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,405
Yeah, right.
How're you going, as bait?

401
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,575
What a witch!

402
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,094
Russ, you coming down or what?

403
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,172
Well, we can't stay here.

404
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,433
Well, I think we should stick together.

405
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,930
Well, come on.

406
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,027
Nicky!

407
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,964
I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore, Toto.

408
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,722
I don't think we're
in the food chain anymore, Dorothy.

409
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,597
Come on, Ron.

410
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,353
- We're gonna go with them.
- What?

411
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,402
You let a girl tell you what to do?

412
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,655
Look, Ron.
Down here, you're gonna listen to me.

413
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,108
From now on, you're gonna do what I say!

414
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,030
Run!

415
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,096
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

416
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,556
Knock it off, Ron.

417
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,094
We're now a quarter of an inch tall, and...

418
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,604
64 feet from the house.

419
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,101
That's the equivalent of 3.2 miles.

420
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,607
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

421
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,114
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,

422
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,907
get big, and get to the mall.

423
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,114
Now get moving!

424
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,955
That butterfly had a wingspan of 42 feet!

425
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,501
Nick!

426
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,217
Hi.

427
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,303
Hi.

428
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,159
- Look, Diane...
- Guess what I saw...

429
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,438
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!

430
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,646
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

431
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,981
I only had to show it to them 12 times.

432
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,903
How'd your conference go?

433
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,027
I got a lot of laughs.

434
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,201
- Wayne.
- I failed, Diane. I'm...

435
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,954
I'm just gonna get my old job back,
if I can get my old job back.

436
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,578
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

437
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,167
Different.

438
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,798
Right.

439
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,169
Where are the kids?

440
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,715
I haven't seen them
since I left this morning.

441
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,531
Did you tell them I was coming home?

442
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:49,228
Yeah, that's why they cleaned things up.

443
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,348
I see.

444
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,560
Well, they're probably just at the mall.

445
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,570
Want to hear something strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

446
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,861
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

447
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,960
Hey, Ron. This is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags...

448
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,423
Nick, don't you ever pick up your toys?

449
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,716
What a wimp!

450
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,127
Been looking for that guy.

451
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,425
It's already one o'clock.

452
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,267
So much for the mall.

453
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,262
What if time shrunk, too?
I mean,

454
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,940
what if it's hours to us, but it's
years to the rest of the world?

455
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,852
Okay, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

456
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,734
Impossible.
Time doesn't exist, except as a...

457
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,106
No...

458
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,157
What's a river doing in your yard?

459
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,943
It's not a river, dope.

460
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,575
It could be a stream of dog pee
and it looks like a river to us.

461
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,949
Let's swim it.

462
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,757
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

463
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,592
Hey, if we could get some rope,
we could make a log bridge!

464
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,016
If we had some logs.

465
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,727
Quark!

466
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,183
- Your dog?
- Yeah.

467
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,726
Quark can't hear us.

468
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,107
Yeah, he can.
Dogs have great ears.

469
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,069
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

470
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,445
Whistle.

471
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,582
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

472
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,217
Let's get higher up.

473
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,138
You know how to whistle.

474
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,637
You just put your lips together and blow.

475
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,529
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

476
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,911
Let's climb!

477
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,499
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

478
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,172
Just have Amy call me if you hear from her.
Thanks.

479
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,075
Amy's not at Patty's, and Nick's not
at the Koestlers'.

480
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,799
I'm gonna call Betsy.

481
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,323
Well, they've got to be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

482
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,928
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school!

483
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,521
Nick, be careful!

484
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,812
Yes, Mother.

485
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,780
I'll go up with them.

486
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,128
It's Quark!

487
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,417
No!

488
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,593
What is it, Nick?

489
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,421
It's that stupid cat of theirs!

490
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,881
Our cat is not stupid!

491
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,179
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Ruse's stupid cat...

492
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,851
Hang on, Nick!

493
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,648
I can't!
I'm slipping!

494
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,147
Nicky!

495
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,812
Get out of there!

496
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,022
You're allergic to pollen!

497
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,158
It's too big!

498
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,578
I'm too little to breathe it in!

499
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,673
Diane!

500
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,334
Hi, Mae.

501
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,095
We haven't seen you around much lately.

502
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,829
Well, I've been working a lot.

503
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,845
You haven't seen Ronnie or Russ, have you?

504
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,635
You know something,
I can't find Nick and Amy.

505
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,008
If you see them,
would you send them home right away?

506
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:07,310
Sure.
Same thing if you see mine.

507
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,523
Russell, the Szalinski kids
are missing, too.

508
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,611
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

509
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,556
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

510
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,672
Ronald?

511
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,746
Russell?

512
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,333
Amy?

513
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,961
Nick?

514
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,465
Amy?

515
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,139
- What is it?
- Sounds like Mom.

516
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,513
Sounds more like a swarm of...

517
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,559
Bees!

518
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,948
- Amy, get him off of me!
- Nicky!

519
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,866
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!

520
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,737
Russ!

521
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,195
Nicky!

522
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,871
Nick, give me your hand!

523
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,869
Nick, hold on!

524
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,208
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid dad's fault.

525
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,170
Shut up!
My brother's up there, too.

526
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,346
Help!

527
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,095
Russ, don't let go!

528
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,845
Hold on!

529
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,646
Help!

530
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,165
I'm getting worried.

531
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,042
I'm gonna go to the mall
and look for the kids.

532
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,040
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back.

533
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,750
Okay.

534
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,209
Hey, Szalinski!

535
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,880
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

536
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,552
Yeah? Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

537
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,891
You know, the jungles are
receding everywhere.

538
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,390
Dad!

539
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,570
- Don't!
- Stop! We're on the bee!

540
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,824
Where...
Where's...

541
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,778
- Stop! You'll kill us!
- Don't do it!

542
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,829
Please!

543
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,367
Stop it!

544
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,338
Hold on, Nick!

545
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,458
We're going down!

546
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,970
Wayne...

547
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,803
if the Boorsteins come by,

548
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,638
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

549
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,143
Think you can handle that?

550
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,402
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

551
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,945
Wait a second.

552
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,862
Nick doesn't play baseball.

553
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,411
I just figured it out.

554
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,213
I never woke up this morning.
This is all a bad dream.

555
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,382
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!

556
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,627
When I get up,
Dad and I will be going fishing.

557
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,379
I'm warning you.

558
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,595
Okay, Ron... maybe you're right.

559
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,521
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

560
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,187
But if it is...

561
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,568
would this hurt?

562
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,941
Get up!

563
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,691
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

564
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,448
Yeah?
I hope your face ends up on a milk carton.

565
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,168
My chair.

566
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,253
My couch.

567
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,808
It works.

568
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,649
Nick?
Amy?

569
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,981
Can you hear me?

570
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,325
Nick.

571
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,442
Nick?

572
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,895
Nick!

573
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,826
Nick!

574
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,204
Are you okay?

575
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,911
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

576
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,081
It didn't take too long.

577
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,678
I'm scared, Russ.

578
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,180
We could be anywhere now.

579
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,976
I think we're still in your yard.

580
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,180
How do you know?

581
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,103
Any other yard, the grass would be shorter.

582
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,227
Come on, we gotta find Ron and your sister.

583
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,856
And then if they don't fry him,
he'll go to jail. Your mother, too.

584
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,754
After all, she's the one who paid for it.

585
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:28,338
That makes her an accomplice.
Do you know what it's like in jail?

586
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:30,195
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up!

587
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,528
And then what? And then you'll smack me?
You'll go to jail, too.

588
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,705
I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,

589
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,035
you smacked me around.

590
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,746
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

591
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,609
The whole Szalinski family
is gonna be in jail for life!

592
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,835
Look.
My dad's machine works.

593
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,212
When we get home and he fixes us all,

594
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,090
we're gonna be so rich, you'll regret this.

595
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,425
Amy,
you know I've always liked your family.

596
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,393
I mean, your dad's a real nice guy.

597
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,345
He's not as weird as I thought he was.

598
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,439
I love you and Nick
like my own brother and sister.

599
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,209
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

600
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,206
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

601
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,479
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?

602
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,401
Run, Nick!

603
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,716
Get up!

604
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,977
Get in there!

605
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,605
Get out of there!

606
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,001
Mr. Szalinski, we're the Boorsteins.

607
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,249
Get off the grass!

608
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,498
Get off the grass!

609
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,796
Up there!

610
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,477
Nicky!

611
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,865
- Amy!
- Under that ledge!

612
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,611
It's very delicate, the lawn.

613
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,409
You don't want to over-water, really.

614
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,048
Get her!

615
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,679
Amy?

616
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,860
Get away!

617
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,531
Please don't die.

618
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,965
Amy.

619
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,517
No, Cathy.
I just thought they might have stopped by.

620
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,890
Okay, listen.
If you see 'em, just send 'em home?

621
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,355
Okay.
You have a good weekend.

622
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,607
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

623
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,780
No.

624
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,450
We had to bring the dog.

625
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,131
I don't wanna hear anymore about the cat.

626
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:16,283
It's the Forresters.
What are we gonna tell them?

627
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:19,082
- How about the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

628
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,083
Don!

629
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,215
Hey, what's up?

630
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,258
How about catching some...

631
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,305
Good morning, Russell.

632
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,978
- Hi, Gloria.
- Say good morning, Sushi.

633
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,533
- Don, I...
- Well, the fishing report

634
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:37,525
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust
while the sun still shines?

635
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:39,661
- I called Charlie at Bass Lake.
- I know, but Don...

636
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,325
He says the fish are jumping on the boat.

637
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:42,362
And I brought my new...

638
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,066
Donald, that man over there is flying.

639
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,491
Right, Gloria.

640
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,119
Don, something's come up.
I don't think we're gonna be able

641
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,993
to make it.
Maybe you ought to go on ahead.

642
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,605
What do you mean
you don't think you're gonna

643
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:55,601
be able to make it?
We're caravaning, good buddy!

644
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,503
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!

645
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,422
And besides, if you're not there
by six, you'll lose your deposit.

646
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,590
Confidentially...

647
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,964
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

648
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,759
Plumbing.

649
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,215
Plumbing?

650
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,887
Well, this isn't the big
Russ Thompson I know. I mean,

651
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,856
Plumbing would not stop
the big Russ Thompson I know.

652
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,060
Especially with an $80 deposit on the line!

653
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,941
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

654
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,994
Don?

655
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,171
Let's roll, Gloria.

656
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,180
- Come on, get in.
- What's wrong with...

657
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,466
Come on.

658
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,098
- Did you tell him the truth?
- Honey!

659
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,272
- Did they take it okay?
- Mae.

660
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,780
80 bucks, Mae.
Non-refundable!

661
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,735
Those kids are grounded!

662
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,917
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

663
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,050
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

664
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,845
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

665
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,641
What about you, Amy?
He saved you, too.

666
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,978
Yeah, I know, Nick.

667
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,437
Where'd you learn artificial respiration?

668
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,030
French class, kid.

669
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,908
French class?

670
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,967
How about a truce, okay?

671
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,846
Okay.

672
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,200
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

673
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,577
You mean we're halfway there?

674
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,280
Yeah, I think so.

675
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,698
Let's go!

676
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,797
French class.

677
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,897
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

678
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,980
with chocolate sprinkles
and a banana split.

679
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,359
I could eat a corn dog the size of a truck.

680
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:15,610
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

681
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,496
I've died and gone to heaven.

682
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,407
It's as big as a house!

683
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,167
I saw it first!
It's mine!

684
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,454
I got dibs on the cream filling!

685
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,293
Nick, it's one of your cookies!

686
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,138
They're never gonna believe this at school.

687
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,345
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

688
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,393
"Dear Miss Mason,

689
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,066
Nicky's not absent,
he's pinned to this note."

690
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,693
- Guys, quick, over here!
- What happened?

691
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:58,945
Right there!

692
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,745
Nicky, hurry!

693
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,455
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him!

694
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,706
Quiet.

695
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,583
To him, we're the bugs!

696
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,047
If he finds us, he'll eat us.

697
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,208
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait a minute.

698
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,845
It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it!

699
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,588
It's just one ant!

700
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,639
When was the last time
you saw just one ant?

701
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,558
It's a scout.
The rest will be here any minute.

702
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,805
Wait!

703
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,141
Do you ever see how fast ants go?

704
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,021
We could ride him...

705
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,437
and get back to the house in no time!

706
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,147
Forget it, Nick!

707
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,981
Amy, he could take us all!

708
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,031
Ants can lift 50 times their weight.

709
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,359
Fifty times?

710
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,740
That's like bench pressing a bulldozer!

711
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,034
Yeah, so think of what he could do to us.

712
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,704
Let's go before he brings the rest of them.

713
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,127
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

714
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,416
Russ?

715
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,963
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!

716
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,262
- Come on, you guys!
- Geronimo!

717
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,548
- Get him!
- Around him!

718
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,392
You guys!
Nicky!

719
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,928
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!

720
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,810
Ron, be careful!

721
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,812
Nick, over there!
Over there!

722
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,108
Get behind him!

723
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,317
- Nicky, come back here. Nicky!
- Here, right now!

724
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,068
Look out!

725
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,871
I'm afraid the others will come any second!

726
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,243
Help!

727
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,162
- Nicky!
- Let's go, Nick!

728
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,958
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, wrong end!

729
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,005
You're allergic to ants!
Get away!

730
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,674
You're gonna get stung!

731
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,336
Nicky, stop!
Get away!

732
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,681
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head!

733
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,686
Ron, go for it!

734
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,393
Hey, hello!
Ant!

735
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,400
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

736
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,371
You guys, come on.

737
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,075
Somebody take this cookie!

738
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,870
Nicky, take this thing!

739
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,340
Help!
Nicky!

740
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,302
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant!

741
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,755
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.

742
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,182
- Somebody help me!
- You know...

743
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,102
- your sister's not bad...
- Nicky!

744
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,145
- For a girl.
- Of course.

745
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,788
Quark, sit!

746
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,372
Sit, Quark!
Stop.

747
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,962
Sit!
Sit, boy!

748
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,998
Quark, get away from there.

749
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,382
Quark, come on.

750
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,465
Quark!
Quark!

751
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,637
Get away, boy.
Drop it!

752
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,235
Thank you, officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

753
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,566
Okay, it's 646...

754
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,373
That guy's got serious problems.

755
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,167
<i>Mrs. Thompson.
Hello?</i>

756
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,001
646 Sycamore.
Yes.

757
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,093
Great idea, Russ,

758
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,174
even if the boy genius didn't think of it.

759
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,880
Drawbridge!

760
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,094
At this rate, we'll be home by dinner.

761
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,059
Maybe I can still go out...

762
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,892
with Patty.

763
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:02,526
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

764
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,902
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

765
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,283
We are camping, Ron.
Only better.

766
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,240
This is like a safari.

767
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,702
Hey, yeah.
I never thought of it that way, you know?

768
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,867
Onward!

769
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,135
Amy'?

770
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,520
Nick?

771
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,307
Wayne?

772
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:51,112
Yeah. I would like to report,
two missing children.

773
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,915
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it, why don't you go out...

774
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:55,419
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

775
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,968
This sort of thing happens all the time.
You have a little spat

776
00:58:58,051 --> 00:58:59,891
- ...with the kids...
- We did not have a spat.

777
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,155
You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.

778
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:03,389
Quit!
I thought he was cut!

779
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,508
He was afraid to tell you he quit.

780
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,678
Quit...
What do you mean he was afraid to tell me?

781
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,233
He can tell me anything he wants.
You know me! I always listen!

782
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,392
What's "-" supposed
to mean?

783
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,387
- Russell!
- No. I don't like the way he said it.

784
00:59:15,411 --> 00:59:17,061
You don't need to get upset, Mr. Thomson.

785
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,225
You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways...

786
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:22,151
My kids did not run away.
They're happy kids,

787
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,665
and there's no way you can make
me believe that they ran away!

788
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,002
Here he goes with his writing again.

789
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:29,032
Don't you ever say ever anything?

790
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,780
Russell!

791
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,953
Why do I feel like
I am the one on trial here?

792
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,665
- I can't imagine, clear.
- What do you mean, you can't imagine?

793
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,118
Well, I think we have enough
to get started.

794
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,170
Please, give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

795
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,504
Fine.

796
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,723
Don't they need a warrant or something?

797
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,431
Russell,
there's a few things about yourself

798
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,807
I think you should know.

799
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,639
Well, like what?

800
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,562
Well, I think you need to sit down...

801
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,563
Another missing children report.

802
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,898
644 Sycamore.

803
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,488
That's next door.

804
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,155
I called the police.
What's on your head?

805
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,707
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

806
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,955
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?

807
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,128
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

808
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,956
That is the couch from the attic.

809
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,834
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.

810
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:32,202
I found it on the floor.
It's my thinking couch.

811
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,510
Wayne...

812
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,058
are you trying to tell me...

813
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,810
you did it?

814
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,805
It works?

815
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,690
The machine works?

816
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,981
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah. The kids know.

817
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,153
- That's great.
- It's not that great.

818
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,905
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

819
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,213
- What?
- And the Thompson kids, too.

820
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,155
They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.

821
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,116
- What?
- I threw them out with the trash.

822
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,743
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

823
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,833
Yes?

824
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,002
Did, you report some missing children?

825
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,004
There must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard.

826
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,464
Right, honey?

827
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,971
She's...

828
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,220
Thank you!

829
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,863
How are you doing, boy?
How about a pit stop?

830
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,793
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

831
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,963
Here, you deserve this.

832
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,139
We're not gonna make it before dark.

833
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,971
Yeah, even if we did,

834
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,427
the mall would be closed.

835
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,595
Don't eat so fast.

836
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,060
Hey, that's my hand.

837
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,561
Why don't we let him go?

838
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,925
He's worn out, and his family
might be worried about him.

839
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,654
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

840
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,284
Help me get off the harness.

841
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,580
You can go now.

842
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,799
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

843
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,474
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

844
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,561
You're free.
You get home now.

845
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,226
Shoo!

846
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,185
Looks like you've got a new pet.

847
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,486
Dumb ant doesn't know what's best for him.

848
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,440
Go on!
Go home!

849
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,200
Mom will never let me keep you.

850
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,742
Amy'?

851
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,335
- Nick?
- Nick?

852
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,504
- Are you there, kids?
- Nicky!

853
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,919
Where are you?

854
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,177
- Any luck?
- No.

855
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,861
Nick?

856
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,527
Amy?

857
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,079
Do you see anything yet?

858
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,365
It's too thick.

859
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,122
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass!

860
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:51,919
Keep looking.

861
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,297
- Nick?
- Amy?

862
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,968
What was that?

863
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,554
Watch out!

864
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,769
Come on.

865
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,482
Where did that come from?

866
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,288
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit!

867
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,332
Looks like he started up again.

868
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,048
No, he only smokes when
he's really worried about something.

869
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:45,682
Nicky, be careful!

870
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,932
Hey.
Hey, maybe we can use this.

871
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,579
Cool!
Now, we can see in the dark!

872
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,380
Hey, Antie, look!
Headlights!

873
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,087
I didn't force him to join the team.

874
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,545
I know, but you always
make such a big deal out of sports!

875
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,951
Because sports build character.

876
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:26,727
No, they don't.
They build muscle!

877
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,217
Russell, you've got to understand...

878
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,098
Wayne?

879
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,225
Yeah?

880
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,648
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

881
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,071
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

882
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,240
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

883
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:53,746
I'll handle it, all right?

884
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,751
How did this happen?

885
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,787
Well, the machine analyzes
the molecular structure

886
01:05:57,862 --> 01:06:00,342
of each compound, and then
through laser inversion, it takes...

887
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:03,544
Wait, Wayne, wait. I think
the Thompsons need to see the couch.

888
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,926
This guy is a waste of skin.

889
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,931
- This is a microscope.
- I know.

890
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,062
Look in there.

891
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,432
All right.

892
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,326
You see, that's the couch
that used to be sitting right over here

893
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,528
until the machine shrunk it.

894
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,284
All right, so there's some doll furniture.

895
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,733
Big deal.
They sell that kind of stuff at swap meets!

896
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,444
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

897
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,956
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

898
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,356
- Are you saying that machine blew...
- Blew up my kids?

899
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,493
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

900
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,536
If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be pieces of them everywhere.

901
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,652
Wayne!

902
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,464
Sorry, I...

903
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,381
Look, I'm positive about this, okay?

904
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,095
The machine shrunk our kids.

905
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,013
You're the one who needs a shrink,
Szalinski!

906
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:50,761
- Russell!
- You are a nutcase.

907
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,595
And I'll tell you something.
I have got an air hammer in my attic.

908
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,321
And if you did do something to my kids,

909
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,627
there's gonna be pieces of you
all over the neighborhood!

910
01:06:58,651 --> 01:06:59,743
Come on, honey.

911
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,400
I think that went well.

912
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,202
I think we should have them over
more often.

913
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,947
Yeah, well, it's a priority for me.

914
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,251
Now why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

915
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,999
Find my kids.

916
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,660
I thought you didn't believe him.

917
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,640
Well, I don't.

918
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,810
Electricity's cheap.

919
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,714
Come on!

920
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,881
Look at this!
We don't have to sleep on the ground.

921
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,845
- What is it?
- One of my legos.

922
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,264
Give me a boost!

923
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,103
Hey...

924
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,773
not bad.

925
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,022
Yeah.

926
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,903
I don't even have to brush my teeth!

927
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,656
Quit pushing!

928
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,321
- Move over!
- You move over!

929
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,666
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

930
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,040
Yeah.
I'd rather sleep down here.

931
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:50,798
Night, Antie.

932
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,708
Think they'll be warm enough?

933
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,227
They look fine to me.

934
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,407
You think you'll be warm enough?

935
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,041
Good night, Russ.

936
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,579
Good night, Amy.

937
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,007
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Amy.

938
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,306
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

939
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,158
Are you okay?

940
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:58,744
I'm scared.

941
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,375
Somehow, I feel like this is all our fault.

942
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,244
No, it's my fault.

943
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,585
I start working on something,

944
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,666
and I don't think about anything else.

945
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,420
I should have been
more careful with that thing.

946
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:16,842
I'm sorry.

947
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,182
That's not what I meant.

948
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,262
You know, it's not important...

949
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,765
if I sell another house,

950
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,359
or if you get a grant this year or next.

951
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,940
We've just got to get
this family back together.

952
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,028
I feel the same way.

953
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,548
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

954
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,551
We gotta get up early and come
out here and look for them.

955
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,380
No, I couldn't sleep.

956
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,091
Not with my babies out here all alone.

957
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,936
Don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

958
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,562
They'll be fine.

959
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,191
That's another thing I'm worried about.

960
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,399
Amy in the dark...

961
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,447
with little Russ Thompson.

962
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,278
Get some rest.

963
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,699
They'd better behave themselves.

964
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,089
It's funny.

965
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,550
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

966
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,550
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

967
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,557
Why?
Does he pick on you about your size?

968
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,844
The bigger the guy, the bigger the moon.

969
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,931
It's just the way he thinks.

970
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,065
Russ?

971
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,063
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

972
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,406
Well...

973
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:04,578
I mean...

974
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,452
you talked to me once or twice last year.

975
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,749
I mean, I would've come by.
I wanted to, but...

976
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,567
I guess I always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

977
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,794
I was too popular to notice.

978
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,055
I was stupid.

979
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,617
- Get down! Hurry!
- Nicky, get down!

980
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,915
- Hurry!
- Ron, get down!

981
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,250
Run!

982
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,667
Help!

983
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,635
Russ, help!

984
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,427
- Help him!
- Russ!

985
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,304
Stay here!

986
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,187
No!

987
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,985
Ron, get out!
Quick!

988
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,074
Get away!

989
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,038
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on.

990
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,511
He could get killed!

991
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,005
We got to do something!

992
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,431
- He's just a baby.
- Sit down.

993
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,058
We've got to help him.

994
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,202
Now!

995
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,910
- Antie!
- Get him!

996
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,550
Let him go!

997
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,846
Watch out!

998
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,099
Move back!

999
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,074
Where's Antie?

1000
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,375
Antie!

1001
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,248
There!

1002
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,882
- He looks hurt.
- No!

1003
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,227
You saved my life.

1004
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,939
- No, he's gonna be okay.
- Ron...

1005
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,143
Where are you going?

1006
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,312
Nature calls.

1007
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,368
Boys on the right, girls on the left.

1008
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,663
I must look absolutely gross.

1009
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,648
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

1010
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,605
Okay, guys.
Let's get moving.

1011
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,404
- It can't be much farther.
- Can't we sleep just a little longer?

1012
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,659
Something's very weird here.

1013
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,635
- What is it?
- Earthquake!

1014
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,265
No, worse!
Lawn mower!

1015
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,793
Nicky!

1016
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,361
What is this?

1017
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,489
I don't know, but I hope
whatever lived here has moved out.

1018
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,162
This is the burrow
of a <i>lumbricus terrestris</i>.

1019
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,115
- A what?
- Earthworm.

1020
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,329
They're dormant this time of year.

1021
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,746
Plug that in.

1022
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,670
I'm almost done here.

1023
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,840
Is that a chainsaw?

1024
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,423
No, it's more like our lawn mower thing.

1025
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,102
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!

1026
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,231
Tommy, stop!
Stop!

1027
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,069
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1028
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,992
- Stop! Get over here!
- Don't go on the grass!

1029
01:20:25,016 --> 01:20:26,034
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

1030
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,536
All right, together!
One, two, three...

1031
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,787
Tommy!

1032
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,502
Tommy!

1033
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,666
I think we'll be safe in here.

1034
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,089
Nicky!

1035
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,974
Come on, come on!

1036
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,427
No!

1037
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,688
No!
Help!

1038
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,438
Help!

1039
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,739
- Amy, don't let go!
- Amy!

1040
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,323
Amy!

1041
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,492
Hold on!

1042
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,868
Give me that thing!

1043
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,855
- Nick said I could cut it, I swear...
- When did you see Nick?

1044
01:21:21,879 --> 01:21:24,338
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

1045
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,932
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

1046
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,249
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

1047
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:30,833
Here, why don't you go home?
Go on through the house. It's safer.

1048
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,724
Safer?

1049
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,154
I thought my folks were weird.

1050
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,822
My knee.

1051
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,786
Is everyone okay?

1052
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:54,414
I feel like a banana whip.

1053
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,803
Nick?
Nick, are you all right?

1054
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,139
Nicky?

1055
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,854
Dad?

1056
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,771
Mom!

1057
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,729
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!

1058
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,439
Dad, over here!

1059
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:27,484
Down here, Mr. Szalinski!

1060
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,627
We'll make it, Nick.

1061
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:46,424
They're never gonna find us.

1062
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:49,052
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us!

1063
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,304
Don't panic, Ron.
We'll find a way, okay?

1064
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,306
I'm not panicked.
Who's panicked?

1065
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,853
Nobody's panicked!

1066
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:58,815
Quark!

1067
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,276
Come on, everybody, grab on!

1068
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:05,148
Go inside, Quark.
Find Dad!

1069
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,508
Nicky!

1070
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,598
Quark, what's gotten into you?

1071
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:34,976
Dad!

1072
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,146
I think he just misses the kids.

1073
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,644
Dad, stop!

1074
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:41,899
No!

1075
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,776
Dad!

1076
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,095
I'll tell you.
At their size...

1077
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,617
- Mr. Szalinski!
- ...that backyard is like ten miles.

1078
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:52,653
Giant blades of grass,

1079
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,408
huge insects.

1080
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,990
It's a jungle out there.

1081
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,041
They're gonna head right for the house.

1082
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,338
Yeah, you're probably right.

1083
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,040
No!

1084
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,138
- Look down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!

1085
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,760
No, Dad!

1086
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,014
Help!

1087
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:20,018
- Dad, don't!
- Don't!

1088
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,311
Just gotta keep our eyes open.

1089
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:25,235
Help!
Don't eat me!

1090
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,196
My God.
Look at this.

1091
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,655
I'm down here, Dad!
Dad!

1092
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:39,408
- It's Nick!
- Nicky! Hi, baby!

1093
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,993
He's pointing at something.

1094
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,580
Look, it's the rest of them.

1095
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,293
I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.

1096
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,635
Hang on, kids!

1097
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,261
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

1098
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,802
Well, you better get it, Szalinski.

1099
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,762
Russ, you're not helping.

1100
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,474
- So, I'm not helping.
- Russell, you got to understand.

1101
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,060
Baseball!

1102
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,020
Nick's trying to say something.

1103
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,064
I can't make it out.

1104
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,910
The baseball, Dad!

1105
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,367
What are you saying, Nick?

1106
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,035
Swinging?

1107
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,004
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

1108
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,502
Wait!
...flapping!

1109
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,254
Pitching.

1110
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,468
- Throwing.
- You're out! You're out!

1111
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,129
Baseball!

1112
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,513
- Yes!
- Right!

1113
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,178
- The baseball!
- The ball!

1114
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:38,641
Baseball?

1115
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,594
Good, honey.

1116
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,850
Holy smokes.
It's the laser!

1117
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,937
I got it.
The ball came through the window,

1118
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,734
and activated the machine,

1119
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,237
and got in the path of the laser.

1120
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,280
Why didn't I think of this before?

1121
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,578
I could take a wild guess.

1122
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,214
It's creating too much heat
That's way everything was blowing up!

1123
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:03,576
- Thanks, Nick!
- All right, Nicky!

1124
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,694
Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine...

1125
01:26:05,718 --> 01:26:07,967
Hold it, Szalinski.
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.

1126
01:26:08,046 --> 01:26:10,926
And you're not trying it on my kids
until you try is on something living!

1127
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,544
You know something?
Maybe I should do it on myself.

1128
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,901
I'll show you how to work the machine.
It's not that hard.

1129
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,263
No, no!

1130
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,437
- Do it on me.
- Are you sure, honey?

1131
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,314
How'd those get there?

1132
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:47,415
Okay, Szalinski,

1133
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,125
shoot!

1134
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,756
No reason this shouldn't work now.

1135
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,144
Stand back!

1136
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:12,361
- Honey, you're so brave.
- Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

1137
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:29,120
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

1138
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,177
So...

1139
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,347
if this works,

1140
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,070
do you want to go to the dance on Friday?

1141
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:52,730
Can you dance?

1142
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,780
- Not really.
- I'd love to.

1143
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,341
- Russ, Ron!
- Dad!

1144
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,720
I knew my boys wouldn't run away.

1145
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,352
- Are you and Dad okay?
- Yeah.

1146
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,304
- All the way across the yard...
- We're great.

1147
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:30,521
- For miles!
- Really?

1148
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:31,957
Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

1149
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:34,188
Don't worry, honey, I'll get 'em out.

1150
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,769
He saved me from a giant scorpion.

1151
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,896
I was stuck with Amy for a while.
She's all right.

1152
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,298
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

1153
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,447
You were right.
You were brilliant!

1154
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:46,030
I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.

1155
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,331
- I know, Ronnie. I know.
- Dad?

1156
01:28:49,075 --> 01:28:50,715
If you really want me back on the team...

1157
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:52,992
I don't care about the team.
I care about you!

1158
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,039
I'm proud of you.

1159
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:57,916
I need to take a shower!

1160
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,335
Szalinski.

1161
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,016
Let's eat!

1162
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:11,563
- Honey, make a toast.
- Good idea.

1163
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:12,935
- Great.
- I love toasts.

1164
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,891
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis,

1165
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,655
- and many more dinners together.
- Cheers.

1166
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:17,607
Though I think

1167
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,406
we're gonna be having leftovers
for a while.

1168
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,906
Wonder what's for dinner.
Right, Russ?

1169
01:29:22,192 --> 01:29:23,752
Well, I guess I gotta carve this thing?

1170
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,406
Hey, want to use my chainsaw?

1171
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,078
Who wants bread?

1172
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,175
Hey, wait!

1173
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,006
I get it!

1174
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,593
French class!
