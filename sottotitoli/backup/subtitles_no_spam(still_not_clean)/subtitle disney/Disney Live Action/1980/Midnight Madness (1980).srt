FLYNCH:
"The sea is reversed."

390
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,994
Well, OK, that could be
the ocean or the beach.

391
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,660
But it says the sea is reversed.

392
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,194
Maybe that means we should
go away from the beach.

"The sea is reversed"...

396
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,975
means to take the words
"the sea" and reverse them.

397
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,177
That way you get...

398
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,685
"Sea the!"

399
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,881

the second part of the clue?

400
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,359

is mixed up and blind."

-Mr. Chairman...

"S.S. Itari
is mixed up and blind."

407
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,433
What does he mean by blind?

408
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,911
Well, that's the simple part.

409
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,413
Blind means to...

410
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,041
To take out its eyes.
"I's!" You get it?

411
