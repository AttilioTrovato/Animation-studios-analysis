1
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,490
<i>(man) I just jumped at
the opportunity to go,</i>

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,930
<i>without even thinking about it, really,</i>

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>because it opened the way to an old
and very naive childhood fantasy of mine.</i>

4
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,490
<i>To go off into the wilderness</i>

5
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,130
<i>and test myself against
all the dangerous things lurking there.</i>

6
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,740
<i>And to find that basic animal I secretly
hoped was hidden somewhere in myself.</i>

7
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,840
<i>I imagined that at that point
I'd become a new man,</i>

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,450
<i>with a strength and courage
that I'd never known before.</i>

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,690
<i>As I traveled north,
it was on about the third day</i>

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,390
<i>that the reality of what I was about to try
to do began to seep into my bones</i>

11
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,130
<i>and gather in a knot
in the pit of my stomach.</i>

12
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,970
<i>Then I finally reached
the end of the line, Nootsack.</i>

13
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,750
<i>The sheer bulk of the supplies
the department sent along set me back,</i>

14
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,010
<i>as I had to get not only myself
but all this stuff</i>

15
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,950
<i>another 300 miles into the wilderness.</i>

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,090
So, you think north of here?

17
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,900
<i>The place is crawling with 'em,</i>

18
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,660
<i>But you wouldn't wanna go up there, son,</i>

19
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>Got nothing to eat up there now,</i>

20
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,680
<i>There's nothing but ice
and snow and trees and,,,</i>

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>You would be
the only fresh meat around there,</i>

22
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,340
<i>They'll come after you, son,</i>

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,860
<i>Just for the ugly fun of tearing you apart,</i>

24
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,630
<i>I'd heard some of the tales
about the Arctic,</i>

25
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>The mad trappers, Diamond Tooth Gertie,
the ice-worm cocktail and all that,</i>

26
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,970
<i>so I was prepared
for things to be a little weird.</i>

27
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,510
<i>You found the bayonets,
I knew you would,</i>

28
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,570
<i>- Charlie,
- (# bassoon playing)</i>

29
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,980
<i>That's much better, much better, Francis,
Keep practicing,</i>

30
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,320
<i>The only plane in Nootsack
belonged to a part-time bush pilot,</i>

31
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,420
<i>gambler and real-estate tycoon
named Rosie Little.</i>

32
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,260
<i>While negotiating our deal, he introduced
me to this drink that he'd invented.</i>

33
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,560
<i>Known locally as Moose Juice,</i>

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,010
<i>it consisted of equal parts
Moose Brand beer and ethyl alcohol.</i>

35
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,310
<i>Before I knew it,
my old fear of flying evaporated,</i>

36
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,750
<i>and I spent all the money I had left
on 24 cases of beer.</i>

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,430
<i>T oo much weight, Tyler,</i>

38
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,290
Hang on!

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,890
<i>Whoa,,, Nelly!</i>

40
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,400
<i>Come on, Something else out of there now,
The big, heavy ones, Tyler,</i>

41
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,690
<i>I really had no way of knowing
exactly what of the department's gear</i>

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,740
<i>we donated to the people of Nootsack.</i>

43
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>That big wooden box there,
Get rid of it, Go on, You don't need that,</i>

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,660
<i>But by our third attempt at takeoff,
it was a lot of what I might really need.</i>

45
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,220
<i>I tried not to think about it.
In fact, I tried not to think at all.</i>

46
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,940
<i>This one is it, I can feel it,</i>

47
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,940
<i>With my eyes still shut,
I realized that I was still alive.</i>

48
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,750
<i>But this was only the beginning.</i>

49
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,070
<i>It's funny how I keep thinking back
to that going-away party.</i>

50
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,100
<i>All the toasts by Dr Spivey
and Dr Showwalter,</i>

51
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,240
<i>and everybody singing
old Johnny Horton songs.</i>

52
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,590
<i>And the cake with all the coconut frosting,
with the plastic snowshoes on top.</i>

53
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,770
<i>But, then, why me?</i>

54
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,930
<i>Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.</i>

55
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,010
<i>Maybe my name just somehow
got onto the wrong page.</i>

56
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
<i>It might have been a typo, or maybe
somebody spilled a cup of coffee,</i>

57
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,610
<i>shuffled a couple of pages,
and there I was.</i>

58
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,920
<i>I can 't go on with this. This is suicide.</i>

59
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,500
<i>But I can 't turn around now.
I'd be a laughing stock.</i>

60
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,510
<i>Still, I wouldn 't last six hours down there,
let alone six months.</i>

61
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,240
<i>Uh ,,,</i>

62
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,420
<i>How do you,,,?</i>

63
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,180
<i>Don't worry about a thing,</i>

64
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,860
<i>I feel my way through these mountains
blindfolded all the time,</i>

65
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,350
<i>Tell me, Tyler,,,</i>

66
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,290
what's in the Valley of the Blackstone?

67
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,980
What is it? Manganese?

68
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,620
<i>Can't be oil,</i>

69
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,920
Is it gold?

70
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,990
<i>It's kind of hard to say,</i>

71
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,540
<i>You're a smart man, Tyler,
Keep your own counsel,</i>

72
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,510
We're all of us prospectors
up here, eh, Tyler?

73
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,250
Scratching for that one crack in the ground

74
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,580
<i>so we'll never have to scratch again,</i>

75
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,150
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler,</i>

76
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,720
<i>The gold's not in the ground,</i>

77
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,730
<i>The gold's not anywhere up here,</i>

78
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,560
<i>The real gold is south of 60,</i>

79
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,870
<i>Sittin' in living rooms,
stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death,</i>

80
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,470
Bored to death, Tyler!

81
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,540
<i>(clunking)</i>

82
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,910
Ah.

83
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,420
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

84
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,720
<i>- (screeching)
- What was that?</i>

85
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,650
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

86
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,290
Oh, Lord!

87
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,930
Darn!

88
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,440
<i>- What's wrong?
- Take the stick,</i>

89
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,550
Arrrrgh!

90
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,810
What's wrong?

91
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,100
<i>Boredom, Tyler,</i>

92
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,630
<i>Boredom, that's what's wrong,</i>

93
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,690
And how do you beat boredom, Tyler?

94
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,100
Adventure.

95
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,500
Adventure, Tyler.

96
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,340
Where are you going? Rosie!

97
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,570
<i>Rosie, what are you doing?
I can't fly this thing, What do I do?</i>

98
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,780
<i>Catch the updraft there, Tyler, That's it,</i>

99
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,190
<i>Right in the middle, Good,</i>

100
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,860
<i>- Oh!
- Ah!</i>

101
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,900
Tyler, easy, easy, easy!

102
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,810
<i>- Back the other way! Turn it the other way!
- What?</i>

103
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,670
<i>Tyler, back, Tyler! Tyler!</i>

104
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,300
Easy! Tyler!

105
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,710
<i>The other way, That's it,</i>

106
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,940
<i>That's it, Good, Tyler,</i>

107
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,820
<i>That's it, You learn fast,</i>

108
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,350
<i>(engine starts)</i>

109
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,770
<i>(Rosie) Whoo!</i>

110
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,320
<i>Rosie, it's freezing,</i>

111
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,560
<i>Keep moving, Tyler, Gotta keep moving,</i>

112
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,570
<i>(smashing)</i>

113
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>- You'll be fine,
- Gotta take it easy with some of this stuff,</i>

114
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
<i>Oh, uh,,,</i>

115
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,040
Mind your toes!

116
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,290
<i>Speed, Speed is of the essence, Tyler,</i>

117
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,320
<i>Especially when you don't know
how much fuel you got,</i>

118
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,950
<i>(smashing)</i>

119
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,430
<i>You got any last messages for the world,
Tyler, you better let me have 'em now,</i>

120
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,100
<i>That's sneaky, Tyler, Very sneaky,</i>

121
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,510
<i>Wait, Rosie! Rosie!</i>

122
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,910
<i>- Rosie,
- What?</i>

123
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,130
Hey?

124
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,990
Remember my position, will you?

125
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,630
<i>Sure, I'll stop by
for a drink sometime, huh?</i>

126
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,580
Rosie! Rosie!

127
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,010
What?

128
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,710
<i>- What is my position?
- It beats the hell out of me, Tyler,</i>

129
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,150
<i>I just hope I can find my way home,</i>

130
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,490
<i>Good luck, Tyler,</i>

131
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,190
<i>Yeah,</i>

132
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,480
<i>Well, interesting.</i>

133
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,060
<i>Now, what are the possibilities here?</i>

134
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,190
<i>The possibilities...</i>

135
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,200
<i>are many.</i>

136
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,680
<i>Gotta stay rational, be objective and. . .</i>

137
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>plan out all the proper procedures
before doing anything else.</i>

138
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Make a list of priorities, remembering,
of course, to take into account variables,</i>

139
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:15,000
<i>and the fact that, inevitably,
some problems could arise that. . .</i>

140
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,440
<i>. . . inevitably, some problems could arise
that are completely unexpected.</i>

141
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,350
<i>Get a grip on yourself.</i>

142
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,770
<i>Section 3C of my instructions
reads as follows:</i>

143

<i>''You will proceed immediately, by means
of canoe and utilizing local waterways,</i>

144

<i>(lively accordion music)</i>

<i>At daylight I'll try to get off the ice.</i>

<i>Excuse me, You sort of,,,</i>

177
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,050
Could you give me a hand
with some of this equipment, I wonder?

178

Ya!

<i>The man has disappeared, although

<i>I've decided to stay here
until I get my bearings</i>

187

<i>Temperatures soaring

<i>For the first time in three days
I emerge from my sleeping bag</i>

192
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,660
<i>and begin trying to do my job.</i>

193
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,650
<i>So far I've collected
the following specimens:</i>

194
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>five baby mice, one millipede</i>

195
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,320
<i>and something that looks
suspiciously like fleas.</i>

196
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,060
<i>My instructions are to track down
a specimen of Canis lupus,</i>

197
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,330
<i>dispatch it with a rifle
and examine the contents of its stomach.</i>

<i>April 1 6.</i>

203
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,650
<i>Warm days bring
a kind of peace and stillness.</i>

204
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,710
<i>If there are any remaining fears,</i>

205
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,790
<i>they stem only from the recognition
of my own staggering insignificance.</i>

206
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,640
<i>(distant howling)</i>

207
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,450
<i>(howling continues)</i>

208

<i>May 3. In pursuit of phantoms.</i>

209

<i>I hear them every night, have seen
their tracks and collected their scat.</i>

210
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,900
<i>So they must be real.</i>

211
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,350

<i>Canis lupus arcticus.</i>

<i>The largest and rarest of the wolf species.</i>

215
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,520
<i>And its den.</i>

216
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,600
<i>The rules of the game are to choose
an observation post downwind,</i>

217
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,870
<i>out of the animal's field of vision,</i>

218
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,910
<i>gain your position and maintain it
without ever revealing your presence.</i>

219
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,460
<i>Outmaneuvered on all counts,
I opt to change the rules.</i>

220

<i>(pans clanking)</i>

<i>Reasoning that we're suspicious

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,070
<i>I decide to reveal
as much as possible about myself,</i>

<i>(wolf grunts)</i>

225
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,550
<i>I haven't seen the wolf in two days.</i>

226
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:08,220
<i>I know I was violating the distance
principle, moving so far into his territory.</i>

227
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,780
<i>But since he hadn't seemed afraid of me,
I hoped that I could. . .</i>

<i>I didn't take it personally.</i>

233
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,030
<i>This was a matter of principle,
a territorial dispute.</i>

234
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,800
<i>And he had fired the first shot.</i>

235
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,140
# What never?
No, never

236
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,580

<i>27 cups of tea later, I completed
a two-acre circle around my tent,</i>

252

<i>including a 100-yard section
of the wolf's path.</i>

253
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,400
<i>What had taken me six hours
and 27 cups of tea,</i>

254
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,060
<i>he accomplished in just a few minutes.</i>

255
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,230
<i>At each of the places that I'd marked,
he made his mark on the opposite side,</i>

256
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,170
<i>indicating that my boundary
was acceptable to him.</i>

257
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,310
<i>And thus he granted me the space
for Lupus Base One.</i>

258
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,120
<i>I'm supposed to watch his behavior,</i>

259
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,130
<i>but all he does is stay
in front of his den and watch mine.</i>

260
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,790
<i>I can't remember ever being the object
of so much constant attention.</i>

261
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,080
<i>I now arise at 1 0: 00 in the evening,</i>

262
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,210
<i>as everything becomes more active
during the long polar twilight.</i>

263
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,750
<i>In my notebook,
the wolf has become George.</i>

264
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,710
<i>The two are identical in color,</i>

265
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,240
<i>with the same contrasting
shoulder marking and long-legged gait.</i>

266
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,320
<i>But I've detected a difference,
and I've named her Angeline.</i>

267
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,610
<i>As George has become a family of five,</i>

268
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,980
<i>the reason for his long staring match
with me has lost its mystery.</i>

269
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,800
<i>It's well-known that wolves mate for life,
but knowing that has hardly prepared me</i>

270
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,800
<i>for their constant and varied
displays of affection.</i>

271
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,600
<i>Every evening George goes off
on his nightly rounds.</i>

272
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,740
<i>What he does on these excursions
remains a mystery to me.</i>

273
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,540
<i>Angeline always remains
behind with the cubs,</i>

274
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,110

279
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,910
<i>It's perplexing.</i>

280
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,680
<i>The overall reason behind the study
is that the government wants final proof</i>

281
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:03,380
<i>that wolves are responsible
for the disastrous decline in caribou.</i>

282
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:10,800
<i>So far I haven 't seen a single caribou,
or observed the wolves eating anything.</i>

283
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,490
<i>My own food supplies
are nearing exhaustion,</i>

284
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,230
<i>and the local environment
offers scant pickings.</i>

285
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,040
<i>Yet the wolves seem perfectly healthy.</i>

286
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,270
<i>I've done numerous scatological studies</i>

287
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,040
<i>and only turned up a smattering
of small mammal bones.</i>

288
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,780
<i>The whole question of sustenance
around Lupus Base One</i>

289
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,680

<i>(scuttling)</i>

294
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,690
<i>Angeline has given me the first clue.</i>

295
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,890
<i>In less than an hour
she's caught and consumed 23 mice.</i>

296
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,450
<i>My rough calculation:
one mouse every ten square feet.</i>

297
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,560
<i>Over 40,000 square feet in an acre.</i>

298
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,730
<i>That's 4,000 mice per acre.</i>

299
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,410
<i>The idea that a large animal
could live entirely on mice</i>

300
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,180
<i>will be greeted with skepticism,</i>

301
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,520

<i>I expected one of the pack battles
I'd read so much about.</i>

315
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,040
<i>It was Angie who was
right in the middle of things,</i>

316
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:35,600
<i>asserting her position
as the dominant female.</i>

317
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,280
<i>The challenges and assertions
were mostly symbolic.</i>

318
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,340
<i>There was no real fighting.</i>

319
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,180
<i>But Angeline got her point across.</i>

320
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,820
<i>George was never challenged.</i>

321
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,590
<i>He just stood there
with his air of masterful certainty,</i>

322
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,290
<i>the alpha wolf of the pack.</i>

323
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,160
<i>Usually, only the dominant pair
mate and have offspring,</i>

324
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,290
<i>going to seek their own privacy
for that purpose.</i>

325
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:01,600
<i>Apparently, the time had arrived
to rejoin the pack.</i>

326
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:34,300
<i>There's a young brown wolf who seems
to be a particular favorite of the cubs.</i>

327
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:34,980
<i>I've named him Uncle Albert.</i>
