1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,180
Hey, what's this,
one of Bluto's tricks?

2
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm in the wrong movie.

3
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,220
Sweet Sweethaven

4
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,100
God must love us

5
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,900
We the people

6
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
Love Sweethaven

7
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,260
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

8
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,060
Flags are wavin'

9
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,580
We're people from the sea

10
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Safe from democracy

11
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,380
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,060
Put here for you and me

13
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,300
Sweethaven

14
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,340
Sweet Sweethaven

15
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,980
God must love us

16
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,420
We the people

17
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,460
Of Sweethaven

18
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
God must have landed here

19
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,220
Why else
would he strand us here?

20
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Where the air
is nice and clear

21
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,500
Sweethaven
even sounds so near

22
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,580
To Heaven

23
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,740
God will always bless
Sweethaven

24
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,140
God will always
bless Sweethaven

25
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,660
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

26
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,900
You just dock?

27
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,100
- I have.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,940
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.

29
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,380
What for?

30
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,180
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,220
It ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,060
It's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.

33
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,180
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,220
This your goods?

35
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,460
- They is.
- Yeah?

36
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,940
You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,060
You call this a town?

38
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,260
Yeah.

39
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,460
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,220
there's 17 cents
new-in-town tax.

41
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,900
Then there's 45 cents
rowboat-under-the-wharf tax,

42
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,740
and one dollar
leaving-your-junk-

43
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,220
lying-around-the-wharf tax.

44
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,260
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore

45
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,540
$1.87.

46
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,740
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,580
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,380
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,260
Oh, forget it.
I see what you're up to here.

50
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,380
Here we go.

51
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,060
Exact change, please.

52
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,220
I'm an exact-change taxman.

53
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,220
Here's a red cent.

55
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,820
Here's a franc.

56
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,060
A peso.

57
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,460
Here's a guilder.

58
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,060
Oh, sorry I'm taking

59
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,660
your time.

60
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,820
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,460
There's one quarter.

62
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,580
Curiosity tax.

63
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey, I paid me tax.

64
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,180
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,820
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,460
Mmm, I gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,020
"Have you paid your tax?"

68
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,740
I got it, I got it.

69
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,260
No, I-I got it.

70
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,140
I got it, I got it.

71
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,260
Don't worry, I got it.

72
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Holy cow.

73
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,460
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,860
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,700
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,820
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,980
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,180
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,060
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.

81
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,340
Can I...?

82
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,740
Blow me down!

83
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,460
That's it, that...!

84
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,060
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,980
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.

86
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,540
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,220
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...

88
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,340
It's no bother, but...

90
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,860
Look over there...
stranger's coming.

91
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,180
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,700
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,340
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,220
Wherever I go...

95
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,460
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,580
it does it for me.

97
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,900
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.

98
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,540
Hmm, I don't believe that.

99
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,740
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,660
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...

101
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,140
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...

102
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,860
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,460
It's a lovely place

104
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,140
Think I'd like to stay, but...

105
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,580
Stranger in town.

106
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,780
Blow me down.

107
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,580
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,620
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...

109
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,900
Blow me down...
local glum club.

110
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,580
It's friendly here...

111
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,700
A little scary, too.

112
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,180
I think I'll spend a year,

113
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,500
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,060
I yam what I yam,
wherever I go

116
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,860
I came from the sea...

117
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,540
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,180
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?

119
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,740
Oh...

120
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,860
Good day... Good day.

121
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,980
I hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,540
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,020
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,740
No, no.

125
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,260
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,620
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,500
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,660
I am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,140
I need me vitamins.

131
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,540
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,620
Take spinach!

133
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,180
If I wants spinach,
I'll axk you for spinach.

134
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,620
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,860
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,180
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,220
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,340
And the spinach?

139
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,380
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,940
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?

141
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,980
Dollar fifty.

142
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,700
You buy what I don't feel
like selling,

143
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,740
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,820
All right, here you go.

145
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,420
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,060
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,740
I pays what I feels like paying.

148
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,980
You're not up to no good,
are you?

149
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,860
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.

150
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,860
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,020
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Lots of people here

153
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,980
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,900
Unlike the clothes I wear

155
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,100
I haven't...

156
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,620
Careful, there.

157
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,660
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?

159
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,100
Blow me down

160
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,460
Blow me down...

161
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,210
Ow!

162
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,980
Hey, come ba... hey, hey... ah!

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,940
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,260
or the man
with the party favor?

165
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,020
You got a room for renk?

166
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,260
What for what?

167
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,660
Renk, renk... your sign says you
got a room for renk.

168
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,060
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,100
My mind was
a million miles away.

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,780
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.

171
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,260
"Mud."

172
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,540
"Oyls." That explains it.

173
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,100
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Scums... I'll find you.

175
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,940
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,780
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.

177
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,940
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,410
Oh!

179
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.

180
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?

181
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,660
I won't be engaged
in this hat.

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,980
I heard that.

183
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,620
Don't think
I didn't hear that.

184
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,980
Oh...

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,500
She owes me an apology.

186
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh... ugly.

187
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,900
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,300
What do you think?

189
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,580
I think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,380
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,940
I think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,300
Oh...

193
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness

194
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,260
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?

195
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,060
If we find that out,
we find out everything.

196
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,580
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,700
Oh...

198
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
I can't get engaged.

199
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,020
You'll have to tell
Bluto; I can't.

200
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,820
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,940
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,460
It's not my fault
that it's so ugly.

203
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
What are you doing

204
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,260
listening in on
a private conversation

205
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,420
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,380
I have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.

207
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,820
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?

208
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,980
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,220
...Mr. Eye

210
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,380
the spare room?

211
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,540
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,740
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,700
Thanks.

215
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,220
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,260
Show me a room.

217
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,500
Show me some courtesy

218
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
might be nice.

219
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,020
I don't see why
I have to do anything

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,500
on the day
before my engagement party

221
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,020
when nothing's ready,
especially me.

222
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,300
And what kind of name is that,
anyway... Popeye?

223
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
Pretty strange.

224
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,420
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,620
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.

226
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,020
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,140
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.

228
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,620
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,980
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,820
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,980
What?

232
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,820
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?

233
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
What'd you say?

234
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,860
Sure is nice weather
you have here.

235
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,300
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,660
So what?

237
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,500
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,700
So, you're short.

240
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,860
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?

241
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,980
Can I see me room now?

242
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,900
Ooh, as if I cared.

243
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,740
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Oh!

246
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,380
Oh, oh...

247
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,540
Nice-looking room.

248
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,060
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,

249
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,620
but this'll do for me.

250
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Careful how you treat
that bed.

251
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,700
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,980
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,980
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,380
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.

257
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,580
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,300
Is that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.

259
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,780
I still respect you.

260
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Ooh!

261
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,300
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,340
Hmph!

263
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,500
Thanks for your help.

264
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,940
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.

266
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,700
We don't have a cat.

267
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,020
Eau de toilette.

268
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,820
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
Yeah.

270
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,380
How do you like that?

271
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,220
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.

272
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,500
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,780
I knew it, I knew it, see...

274
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,100
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,740
I could've made
a fortune on Billings

276
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,140
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.

277
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,180
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.

278
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,900
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,700
Me, I'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,740
He's my son.

281
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,540
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,100
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,300
I didn't mean you.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,020
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.

285
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,540
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.

286
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,940
If ever I could
put in a good word...

287
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
"Shut up" is the word.

288
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,460
"Pass" is another word
that Wimpy...

289
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,580
You don't pass.

290
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,300
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,220
It says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.

292
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,740
Don't look as good as I smell,
but too late now.

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,100
Got to go.

294
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,780
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met... uh, Pop?

295
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,260
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,420
We're all one big
happy family here.

298
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
- Hmph!
- Although not really.

299
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

300
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,740
Me, I'm family.

301
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,860
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,780
You owe me an apology.

303
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,260
Well, I can't find anything.

304
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,820
What are you
looking for, Olive?

305
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,380
- A glass.
- Oh, uh, here's a glass.

306
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,060
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,580
I want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

308
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,620
They're all broken.

309
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,780
I could've made a fortune

310
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,940
- in fish futures...
- Fish?

311
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,820
But I'd have to dip
into capital.

312
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,260
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

314
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,260
A wine glass

315
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,100
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

316
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh, not a thing...
I don't want a thing.

317
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,940
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
I want a fork.

319
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,060
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,780
If it was a knife,
it would cut you.

321
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,060
- And a knife.
- Will you sit down?

322
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,780
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?

323
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,340
You owe me an apology.

324
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,060
Passing fish, please.

325
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,580
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,500
I would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

327
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,580
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,620
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,820
Wish I had a plate though.

330
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,620
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

331
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,980
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; I'm not a child.

332
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,260
I'll say you're not a child.

333
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,020
- Who says I'm not a child?
- You said you're not a child

334
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,100
and I agreed with you,
that's who.

335
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,140
Who asked you
to agree with me?

336
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,700
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

337
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,260
- if I want to.
- I can.

338
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,500
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,980
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,460
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,980
What?

342
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,140
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,260
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,660
Well, I don't know.

345
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

346
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,700
Or is it job?

347
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,460
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

348
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,020
And he needs
a lot of patience.

349
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,140
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

350
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
while he's away.

351
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,620
And the Commodore's
always away.

352
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,460
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.

353
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,660
- Have you, Cole?
- What?

354
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,940
I'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

355
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,780
I'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

356
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,860
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

357
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,020
because I'm no pushover.

358
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,900
You owe your sister
an apology.

359
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,420
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,740
Finishing touch here.

361
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,620
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,660
Here, take mine.

363
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Not since I was child

364
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,420
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

365
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,980
You owe me an apology.

366
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,460
You don't like our knives.

367
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,900
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

368
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,380
Ooh, I hate this table,
it's ugly.

369
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm the only one
with nerve enough

370
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,980
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,060
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover

372
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,060
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
- Am I right, Pop?
- Right.

374
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
I'm right, right?

375
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
- You're right.
- Right.

376
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,260
Nothing left?

377
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,100
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

379
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,060
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.

380
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,020
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!

381
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,500
That's why I always
have to break off

382
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,820
our engagement...
to stop you all

383
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,380
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,

384
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,140
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!

385
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Hmph.

386
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
Mmm.

387
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,780
You make me sick.

388
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,220
Never good to be too full,
I guess.

389
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,100
It's 9:00!

390
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,060
Curfew!

391
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,100
Lights... out!

392
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,140
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,970
Oh!

394
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,820
Poppa.

395
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,580
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,260
are going to be together again,
huh?

397
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,780
Yeah.

398
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,100
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,140
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.

400
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
Yeah? Yeah.

401
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,220
Stay alive.

402
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,740
That's all I'm axskin you.

403
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,220
Good night, Poppa.

404
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,860
Aw...

405
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,860
There.

406
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,940
Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.

407
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,540
Sweep, sweep...

408
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,580
Hey-up!

409
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,740
Ah... whoop!

410
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,140
Eee-oh!

411
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,180
Everything
is food, food, food

412
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,660
Everything is food to go

413
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,780
Everything is food
for thought

414
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,980
Everything you knead
is dough

415
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,180
It is food

416
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,700
Everything is food

417
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,420
Everything is meat, meat, meat

418
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,980
Careful what you put
on your feet

419
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,820
Once it lived on an ani-mule

420
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,260
Now it walks along with you

421
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,980
It could be food

422
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,820
Everything is food

423
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,700
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
for a hamburger today

424
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,340
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today

425
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,220
Everything is
chow, chow, chow

426
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,460
Everything is food to go now

427
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,220
Everything is
fast-food chains

428
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,060
From your lemon
to your sugarcane

429
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,580
It is food

430
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,020
Everything is food

431
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,900
Did you order a hamburger?

432
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,300
Yeah, I ordered a hamburger.

433
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,780
That's what I got,
a hamburger.

434
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
No, I beg to disagree.

435
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,020
Rough House,
a genuine hamburger

436
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
for the gentleman.

437
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
- I'm buying.
- Hey, thanks.

438
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,580
Who's paying?

439
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,420
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,060
I'd refuse to pay
if I were you.

442
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,420
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,780
Rough House!

444
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,820
Food, food, food

445
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,260
Everything is food

446
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,900
One hamburger-chiseler's tax.

447
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,500
I would gladly
pay you Tuesday

448
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,540
- What kind mooch is this?
- For a hamburger today

449
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,940
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today

450
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,460
Everything is upside-down

451
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,460
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,580
Did you pay for this

453
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
In American?

454
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,660
They can't trick us
with no hot dog

455
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,620
Everything is food,
food, food

456
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,060
Everything is food.

457
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,540
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

458
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,620
Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
I really need someone
to kind of talk to,

460
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,300
'cause I thought everybody
in this town might be deef.

461
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
You know, jusk why
I'm here is...

464
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,180
I'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
Yeah, oh...

466
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,940
I've searched
the seven seas for him,

467
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,740
and I haven't found him yet.

468
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,980
I was only two years old,
me own pap left me.

469
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,740
I was just a mere infink.

470
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,140
Me own pap...

471
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,580
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,860
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,020
I'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,060
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.

475
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,220
I never thought
I'd forgive me paps,

476
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,740
but about seven years ago,

477
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,380
I ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.

478
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,140
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,900
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,500
It breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,700
and I'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days

482
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,980
without food or waters.

483
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,700
But after all
this time on this raft,

484
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,780
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,620
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.

486
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,820
And it says,
"Your pap is still alive."

487
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,780
Excuse me.

488
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,300
So, when I was finally rescued,

489
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,860
I figured out that I got
to forgive me paps, you know?

490
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,940
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm only afeared
that he might be dead,

492
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,780
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink

493
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,140
I turned out to be.

494
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,420
You sure got a nice-looking
face there,

495
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,380
One-Eye.

496
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,540
One-Eye?

497
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I've seen better arms
on a baboon.

498
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,300
You're a slimy...

499
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,860
Yeah, you want to know
why you're so "lonescome,"

500
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,380
go take a look at that mirror.

501
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,500
You know, if there's
one thing I ain't got,

502
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,060
it's a sense ka humor.

503
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,580
Where did you get that,
uh, pronunskiation?

504
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,140
Yeah? Got an olive
caught in your throat?

505
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,620
Well, yeah, well,
I'll get back to you.

506
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,980
Pappy.

507
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,140
His Dada.

508
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,740
No. I want my Dada.

509
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,060
Hey, if I were your daddy,

510
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,220
I'd ship out, too.

511
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,780
Yeah. You're too dumb-looking

512
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,900
to leave on a doorstep.

513
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,940
Hey, runt...

514
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,020
I'll bet your pappy...

515
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,700
is as ugly as you are.

516
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,900
Another thing I got...

517
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,940
is a sensk of humiligration.

518
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,380
Now, uh, maybe you swabs can,
uh, pool your intelligence

519
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,500
and sees that I'm asking you
for an apologiky.

520
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,900
Hey, Butch,

521
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,180

522
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,700

523
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,420
With pleasure, Spike.

524
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,500
The little one-eyed rat
wants an apology.

525
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,820
Well, I would like
to offer my most sincere

526
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
and hum-felt apologies.

527
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,260
You got it.

528
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,780
That's so low...
picking on innocents.

529
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,860
You apologize?

530
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,740
Do you apologize?

531
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,940
I-I apologize.

532
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,140
Rosie, get my hat.

533
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,500
I think
it's time we leave. I...

534
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,620
back to the dairy...

535
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,380
- Apologize.
- For what?

536
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,500
All these innocents.

537
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,540
This is a smorgasbord
of violence.

538
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,940
Well, that's everybody.

539
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
Everybody's apologized.

540
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,260
Yeah, everybody's really sorry.

541
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,460
Oh, everybody's really,

Now it's your turn

544
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,980

545
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,020
Oh, yeah.

546
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,580
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but enough is enough.

547
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Hey.

548
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,140
Come on.

549
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,180
Come on.

550
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,220
Hey, hey, hey!

551
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,460
Hey, hey, hey.

552
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,900
Sorry.

553
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,780
Thanks.

554
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Anybody else want
to apologygy?

555
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,260
All in a day's fun, ain't it?

556
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,780
I dare you.

557
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Nobody home?

558
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,540
There you go.

559
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,260
Sorry about that.

560
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,500
No. Keep the change.

561
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,980
Remember, my dear,

562
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,780
tonight it's my turn
to be tall.

563
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,820
Oh.

564
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,180
Very nice party.

565
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,620
I can't help but feel sad,
though.

566
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,780
Chico?

567
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,380
This is a sad day for me.

568
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,180
Chico, hand these things out.

569
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,580
It's one of the saddest days
of my life.

570
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,740
Flowers.

571
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,980
I forgot the flowers.

572
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,940
Yup.

573
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,100
Oh, disillusionkand.

574
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,140
Oh, look at that.

575
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,460
Oh, me dress blues.

576
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,780
This is Castor's
favorite color.

577
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,820
Oh, you and Castor.

578
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,140
Oh, phooey.

579
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,500
Oh, hello there, Cousin.

580
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,340
We're just waiting
for Captain Bluto.

581
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Oh, I can't tell you
how happy this makes me

582
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,660
to attend Miss Oyl's parties.

583
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,860
Uh, nice-looking furs there.

584
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Hmm?

585
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,580
Oh.

586
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,940
Boy, uh, I don't know
when I've had this much fun

587
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,980
and still been conskious.

588
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,740
Well... I better be on me way.

589
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,220
Oh, reservoir.

590
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,100
Not really as nice as ours.

591
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,020
But he's so big.

592
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,140
I really...

593
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,460
Typical smutty sailor comment.

594
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,500
Sailor...

595
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,340
Oh, I don't want
to go to no party.

596
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Well, that's good,
'cause you ain't invited.

597
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,700
Who says I ain't invited?

598
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,060
I says.
Who are you?

599
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,180
You know who I am.
I'm you.

600
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,100
Don't drain your sense
of dignity... is that it?

601
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Nah.

602
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
Ugly.

603
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,260
Bluto's ugly all right.

604
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,620
Bluto's distinguished.

605
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,940
He's distinguished, all right.

606
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,300
Distinguishingly ugly.

607
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,780
Bluto's special.

608
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,420
Oh, he's special, all right.

609
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,780
Especially ugly.

610
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,180
He's tall

611
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,860
Good-looking

612
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,100
And he's large

613
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,740
He's large

614
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Large

615
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Tall

616
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,620
Large...

617
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,460
Good morning, Captain Bluto.

618
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,740
I... I mean...

619
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,980
Good evening, Captain Bluto.

620
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,460
I mean...

621
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,500
And he's mine

622
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,580
Not a mandolin

623
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,300
Oh, no

624
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,980
He's an accordion

625
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,620
I have to squeeze him
each night to keep him warm

626
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Warm

627
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,220
Oh, boy

628
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,740
He's virile

629
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,460
And he's strong

630
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,180
- Strong
- Strong

631
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,300
- Strong

632
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,460
He's strong

633
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,340
Strong...

634
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,780
Uh...

635
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,980
Sounds like Fluto.

636
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,180
Bluto.

637
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,460
Bluto.

638
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,260
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.

640
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
A lovely present for you

641
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,700
down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.

642
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,460
I would have brought it,
but it was too late.

643
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,660
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.

645
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,340
Mother!

646
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,620
He's got money and respect

647
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,980
That's true

648
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,860
He's better than the rest

649
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,580
That's true

650
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,100
He may not be the best

651
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,540
But he's large

652
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,900
And he's mine...

653
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,140
She can have him.

654
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah.

655
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,940
She loves me.

656
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,980
Of course she does.

657
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,820
She don't love me.

658
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,980
Oh, no.

659
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,100
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,710
Large

661
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,140
Large

662
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,900
Large

663
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Large

664
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Mine

665
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,940
Mine

666
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,540
Mine

667
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
Mine...

668
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,700
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,700
Oh.

670
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,540
She will.

671
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,700
She won't.

672
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,540
It may seem funny,
but it's not

673
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,300
Oh, no

674
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,860
I'm thankful

675
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,940
For what I've got

676
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,180
Me, too

677
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,130
It may not be a lot

678
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,940
But he's large.

679
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,100
She will.

680
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,860
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,660
She...

682
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,700
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.

683
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,140
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Olive's what?

685
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,660
Olive's...

686
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,500
...getting ready.

687
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Good.

688
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,660
Now, where were we?

689
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,020
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...

690
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,540
She will!

691
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,460
Oh, my word!

692
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,940
Son-in-law.

693
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,420
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,660
Olive!

696
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,500
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,140
No place to go.

698
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,180
Can't go to no party
without an invite.

699
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,220
Whoo!

700
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,500
- Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
- Whoo! Ooh.

701
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,820
- Miss Oyl.
- Oh...

702
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,060
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,900
Yeah, I almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.

704
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,500
- Sorry I did that to you.
- What right do you have

705
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,340
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night

706
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,660
and scare the wits
out of a person?

707
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,500
I wasn't.
I was just, uh, kind of, uh...

708
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,340
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?

710
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,180
- Oh, that's a dumb question.
- Yeah.

711
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,500
Where do you think I'm headed
right this minute?

712
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,180
mmm, that way, I think.

714
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
Out of town.

715
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,780
- I am not headed out of town.
- Oh.

716
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,980
Don't you see which
direction I'm facing?

717
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,740
- You're going, now you're...
- Oh, ooh, whoa.

718
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,820
- Now you're facing east.
- Oh.

719
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,980
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,180
- Place your bets.
- Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,340
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?

722
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,740
- Ooh, oh, no.
- I didn't touch ya.

723
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,860
I didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,060
Thank you.

725
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,540
- Oh, you do.
- Oh.

726
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,300
Oh.

727
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,300
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,340
Oh.

729
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,300
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,820
I want to go...

731
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,580
Oh...

732
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,060
Oh, oh...

733
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,980
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,180
Oh!

735
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,300
Oh, oh...

736
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
Oh...

737
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,460
That way.

738
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,500
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,820
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
What?

741
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,100
Oh.

742
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,620
Didn't recognize you
from the back.

744
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,500
It won't happen again.

745
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,740
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?

746
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,100
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,220
But... I'll let you off
this time

748
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,140
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,660
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,180
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl

751
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,500
means I don't have
to pay no...

752
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,860
...taxes?

753
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,540
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,620
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,

755
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,980
while you're waiting.

756
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,500
Where's Olive?

757
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,900
Olive?

758
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,140
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,900
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.

760
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.

761
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,860
If I'm wrong, why
am I in the right?

762
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,740
You think it's because
I'm engaged to Bluto

763
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,500
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore

764
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,620
so we get special favors.

765
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,740
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,340
Olive!

767
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,900
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,100
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.

769
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,980
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.

770
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,300
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,460
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family

772
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,020
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,900
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?

774
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,820
Well, I'm-I'm looking
for me pap.

775
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,980
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

776
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,100
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?

777
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,300
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,820
I don't really know.

779
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,500
I... I got this sense

780
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,260
that he's here though,
you know?

781
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,340
Oh, well, all right,
I'll wait. Hmm.

782
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,860
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.

783
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,020
Half of them I hate.

784
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,860
One thing I remember
about me pap

785
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,380
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.

786
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,100
But he'd never be there
when I come down, you know.

787
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,380
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Mmm.

788
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,300
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?

789
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,540
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,340
I remember that time
he gave me

791
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,860
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,060
Eep!

793
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,380
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,540
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,540
real, real, real hard
and I'd lose me formula.

796
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,060
And then he'd say, "One
day, you'll be a sailor."

797
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,780
That... that's what
I am today.

798
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,700
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.

799
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,580
Most of the time
he'd miss, though

800
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,020
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.

801
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,820
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,180
Well, I'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.

803
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,980
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,340
I was philoscofying.

805
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,660
Mm-hmm.

806
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,700
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...

807
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,660
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,340
Wait a while...

809
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,980
What are you doing
with that basket?

810
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,700
Well, I-I'm carrying it.

811
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
It's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,860
It is not my basket.

813
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,380
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket

814
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,780
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,660
My basket was clean
and beautiful

816
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,100
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,820
- Rattlesnake!
- Miss Oyl, we should at least

818
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,220
have dinner first,
or something.

819
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,260
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

820
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,700
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

821
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,460
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?

822
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,060
Where is it?

823
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,220
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!

824
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,380
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,

825
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,540
I've handled vermins before.

826
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,500
I'll rattle that snakes
so it's a pair of shoes.

827
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,540
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

828
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,940
I'll rattle that...

829
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,300
- I'll rattle him upside-down.
- Rattlesnake!

830
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,780
I'll take his little mariachis.

831
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,900
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

832
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,060
Uh, no, I'll get to him.

833
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
Hey, hey, hey!

834
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,020
Oh!

835
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,540
Aw...
Oh...

836
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,340
Oh...

837
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Blow me down.

838
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,580
Oh.

839
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,180
Here you go.

840
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,340
Oh.

841
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,980
Here's your snake.

842
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,020
There you go.

843
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,340
What have you got here?

844
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,460
"To the one-eyed sailor."

845
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,220
Oh, that must be me.

846
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,340
Wait a minute.

847
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,660
Hold on there.

848
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,340
Watch out, I don't
want to hurt you.

849
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,500
Hi.

850
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,700
I'll read this.

851
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,140
I'll bring it right back
to you.

852
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,340
There we go.

853
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,500
Oh, I ain't that ugly.

854
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,340
It's all right.

855
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,020
Oh, it's okay.

856
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,860
I am, I am, I am.

857
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
I'm all right.

858
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,380
Hey...

859
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,380
It's okay.

860
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,700
Hey, hey, hey.

861
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,180
Hey, we're
together in this.

862
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
- Mmm, mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

863
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,700
All right. "I must
trust someone..."

864
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,380
Mmm... bah-bah-bah.

865
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,540
You're a baby.
It's says here.

866
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,620
Right there, right.

867
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,380
"I must trust someone
with me baby

868
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,620
"until I frees meself

869
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,500

financhkal obligations."

870
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,260
Yeah. "Which will
take 25 years or so

871
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,940
"at which time I
shall reclaims him.

872
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,300
"In the meantime,

00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,740
"love him as only
a mudder could.

874
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,020
Signed, a mudder."

875
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,020
Ho, ho, ho.

876
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,140
You want the note?

877
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,660
Okay, take it back.

878
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,820
How are ya?

879
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,180
I loves you more

880
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,260
Olive...!

881
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
Olive...!

882
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,140
It's Olive's fault, oh, oh.

00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,540
Oh, oh!

891
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,620

He do, he do

900
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm so mean I had a dream

901
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,060
Of beatin' myself up

902
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,220
I broke my nose

903
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,340
I broke my hand

904
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,060
I wrestled myself
to the ground

905
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,180
And then I choked myself
to death

906
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,420
And broke the choke
and woke up

907
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,380

00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,100

He's mean, he's mean

910
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,700
If you know what I mean

911
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,180
You'll know what I mean

912
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,740

1019
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,540
- Papa.
- Oh, yeah?

1020
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,340
He wants me,
he wants me there.

1021
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,380
You must have an IQ about
half a million, don't ya?

1022
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,660
Oh, yeah, coochie-coo.

1023

None of that baby talk

1024
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,020
Me son's gonna be a man

1025
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,380
Ain't that right?

1026
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,780
Oh, come to Papa,

1027
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,780
You're my little Swee'pea,
you're my little Swee'pea.

1028
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,180
- Swee'pea?
- Mm-hmm.

1029
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,380
- You're bats.
- Oh, yeah?

1030
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,980
I found him in Sweethaven.
That is why he's me Swee'pea.

1031
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,220
I am calling him Swee'pea,
and that is his name.

1032
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,220
Ain't that the truth?

1033
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,220
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1034
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,820
Well, Swee'pea is
about the worst name

1035
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,900
I ever heard on a baby.

1036
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,020
Well, what do you want me
to call him? Baby Oyl?

1037
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,260
Excuse me.

1038
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,540
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

1039
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,300
A bit of boxing tonight.

1040
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,140
What could happen to me?

1041
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,300
Well, I could get killed.

1042
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,820
It'd be worth getting killed
to help Mom and Pop.

1043
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,780
What if I won?

1044
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,060
I'm fast, I'm foxy.

1045
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,580
He could have a heart attack.

1046
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,820
Sweet Sweethaven

1047
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,860
God must love us...

1048
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,820
Ooh, and I disapprove of you

1049
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,060
taking me to a fight

1050
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,380
and my parents to a fight

1051
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,700
and my baby to a fight.

1052
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,940
Ah, Sweethaven...

1053
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,340
Fights is fun.

1054
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,420
Oh, fights are not fun.

1055
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,900
Know the words
for this song, Cole?

1056
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,420
Of course I know the words.

1057
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,180
It's our national anthem,
isn't it?

1058
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,380
Pardon us...

1059
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,220
Ah-ah-ah.
That'll be 62 cents...

1060
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,540
going-to-an-illegal-
sporting-event tax.

1061
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,020
If it's illegal,
how come it's going on?

1062
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,900
Ladies and gentlemen!

1063
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,340
Citizens of Sweethaven...

1064
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,420
Popcorn!

1065
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,900
Be careful...

1066
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,860
Ooh, watch that step.

1067
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,140
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,140
They're having a lover's quarrel
in front of us.

1069
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,140
That unworthiest
of worthies...

1070
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,540
the pejorator of...

1071
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,980
Fight stuff.

1072
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,980
Fight stuff!

1073
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,300
Now, look at that.
Isn't that...?

1074
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,380
Wait a minute.

1075
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,700
Yeah... right there,
right there is Castor.

1076
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
Castor!

1077
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,820
Oh, my son! Castor!

1078
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,740
Make a man outta yourself.

1079
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,500
Mom, Pop, I'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Whoops.

1081
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,740
Don't go!

1082
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,780
Oh, it's my baby.

1083
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,900
Get out...
Get my baby outta there!

1084
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,220
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,300
He's gotta dance
with those feet.

1086
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,820
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,140
Olive,
do something about this.

1088
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,140
What are you, a nut?

1089
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,260
What good are you, Olive?

1090
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,260
You get in there and get your
brother out of this!

1091
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,580
I can't stand
much more of this.

1092
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,420
Where are my pills?

1093
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,500
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,420
Mr. Geezil,
get him outta there, Geezil!

1095
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,340
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,540
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,460
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,180
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,580
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,060
Did you see what he was doing?!

1101
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,740
- You didn't see?!
- Good luck to you.

1102
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
I hate you to pieces!

1103
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,020
All right, come over here.

1104
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,940
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,660
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,500
You'll be leading
with the left hand.

1107
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Castor! Castor,
get outta there!

1108
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,980
Go for him, right away, son.

1109
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,460
Come on, Castor.

1110
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,220
Give him Oyl, Castor!

1111
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,540
Give him Oyl!

1112
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,100
Come on, hit him,
hit him, hit him...!

1113
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,420
Hang him!

1114
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,740
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,260
Come on, knock him.

1116
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,730
Oh!

1117
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,380
...three, four, five, six...

1118
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,420
Get up!

1119
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,420
Your name's Castor,
not Custer.

1120
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,940
Come on, sting that whale!

1121
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,780
Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,140
He's not a person!

1123
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,300
Hi. I'm, uh... Cas...

1124
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,940
That's it!
Come on, that's it.

1125
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,900
Kick him!

1126
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,700
Didn't you see that?

1127
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,100
Hey, ya bum!

00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,380
He's not a person!

1130
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,700
One, two, three...

1131
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh, hello. Very good.

00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,180

- No, no, no!

1137
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,930
No!

1138
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,780
Oh. Popeye!

1139
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,660
Watch out now, Mr. Oxmeat!

1140
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,020
You, you, you!

1141
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,260
You're gonna be
kissing canvas real soon.

1142
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,580
Oh! Oh!

1143
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,620
Poor little fatherless baby.

1144
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,900
Oh, you'll be murdered.

1145
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,980
All right, gentlemen,
you both know the rules.

1146
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,660
This is to be a fight
to the finish.

1147
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,100
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1148
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,100
What are you afraid of?

1149
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,460
I got a magnet in
there or something?

1150
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,220
Come on!

1151
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,740
You scums.
I know who you...

1152
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
That was dirty.

1153
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,260

All right, here we go.

1157
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,380

1160
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,860
Give him a karate chop!

1161
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,420
Very good.

1162
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Fist... that's fighting.

1163
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,660
You can take him!

1164
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,740
Don't you dare!

1165
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,100
- Hey, your mudder's here?
- So what?

1166
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,140
- You bet I'm his mother.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

1167
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,180
I'm a mudder meself.

1168
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,780
That's his mudder;
I can't bust him...

1169
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,820
You see?

1170
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,180
You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

1171
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,380
Not be doing that.

1172
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,620
That kid...

Dancing, dancing.
Dancing legs.

1177
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,220
Be careful.

1178
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,980
Come on, sailor, fight!

1179
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Oh, yeah. Watch it!

1180
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,700
To the left. To the right.
Look out.

1181
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,380
Easy! Easy!
Watch what you're doing.

1182
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,420
Popeye!

1183
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,540
Oh, be careful.

1184
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,620
Be careful.

1185
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,260
There.

1186
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,180

00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,660
Watch it! Watch it!
She's got a bucket!

1191
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,580
Oh, Mommy! I'm sorry.

1192
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,420
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where do I send the flowers?

1193
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,820
That's it. Come on!

Timber.
