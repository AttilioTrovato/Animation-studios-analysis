be exactly right for you.

That's what she said about all the
wrong ones she showed us yesterday!

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Isn't it rather isolated?

5
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,804
Well, secluded, I'd say.

6
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,207
- Are you sure it wasn't $1,000 a week?
- Quite sure.

7
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,687
- Furnished?
- Indeed.

8
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,804
- What's the catch?
- Catch, Mr Curtis?

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,049
A bargain like that wouldn't
stay on the market.

10
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,527
Maybe there's a ghost.

11
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,567
What self-respecting English
house would be without one?

12
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,403
Nonsense. The fact is Mrs Aylwood,
the owner, is a bit eccentric.

13
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,729
She has no family left and
she needs the income,

14
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,087
but she is quite sentimental about the
house and picky about who lives in it.

15
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,329
Look around. I'll nip to
the cottage for the keys.

16
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,126
- Is someone living there?
- Mrs Aylwood.

17
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,089
I expect that's why she wants to make sure
the tenants are the right sort of people.

18
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,288
If we live here, I'm gonna climb this
and go exploring in those woods.

19
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,611
Leave a trail of pebbles so I can grab
you before the wicked witch eats you up.

20
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,203
If she lives in a gingerbread
house, I'll eat it up. I'm starved!

21
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,242
- What is it?
- Ah, Mrs Aylwood.

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,082
- I've brought a lovely family to...
- You were told to notify me first.

23
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,127
- I tried to reach you by telephone.
- I haven't left the house all day.

24
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,364
Mrs Curtis writes charming
children's books,

25
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,724
and Mrs Curtis is quite well-known
in American musical circles.

26
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,290

to conduct one of his own operas.

27
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,131
Mrs Aylwood, are you all right?

28
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,607

29
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,521

like this any more.

30
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,087
What we need is a little light.

31
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,404
There's a large dining room and the
kitchen has full butler's pantry.

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,003
The living room is just beyond
the music room. This way.

33
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,360
That's a bit more
cheery, isn't it?

34

talk about the details of the lease.

That is, if you've decided
to let us live here.

Boy, Mrs Aylwood sure is creepy.

72

Comforting to know we're

- Me?

No, dear, not you.

76
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,405
She had a daughter,
about your age.

77
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,763
- Had?
- Lost, many years ago.

78

- Perhaps you reminded Mrs Aylwood of her.
- Lost how?

79

I really don't know all the
details, just that she disappeared.

80

were rather tragic.

87
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,528
Mom, I couldn't see myself in
it. My reflection wasn't in it.

somebody else in it.

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,163
- I asked you not to come into the woods!
- I had to. Nerak ran off.

172
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,887
If I hadn't come after her,
she would have gotten lost.

Yes, it is.

- That's a happy song.
- What?

178
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,088
The song you were just humming.

179
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,688
I wasn't humming anything.

180
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,488
Come here, Nerak.

181
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,763
- Did you see that?
- See what?

- Stop!
- Get out of my way!

190
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,609
She had to. She had to push you down
to get you loose from the branch.

191
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,768

you for saving me.

What kind of name
is that? Nerak?

198
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,326
Ellie just made that up. It's the
name Karen spelled backwards.

What is it? What's wrong?

200
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,127
That was my daughter's
name. Karen.

Was anything wrong
with Karen's eyes?

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,168
Why do you ask?

206
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,366
The night she disappeared...
was she blindfolded?

207
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,889
How do you know about
the blindfold?

208
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,607
You asked me once
if I sensed things.

209
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,089
Well, I have. And Ellie's
been hearing things.

210
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,568
It's like someone
is watching us.

211
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,765
- And the day we moved in, I saw something.
- What?

212
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,561
An image in a mirror.

213
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,007
A girl... about my age...
with long blonde hair.

214
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,807
And she was blindfolded.

215
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,122
- You saw her?
- I'm not sure.

216
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,202
Could you... Could you
tell me what happened?

217
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,288
How she disappeared?

218
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,765
My husband was
killed in the war.

219
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,210
And Karen was everything to me.

220
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,166
She was soon to be 17,

221
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,687
and I stayed up late...
finishing her present.

222
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,001
Karen wasn't in her room.

223
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,851
She was always so considerate,

224
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,931
I couldn't believe she'd
gone off without telling me.

225
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,002
Then I remembered there was an eclipse. She
might have gone to watch it at the pond.

226
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,168
Karen?

227
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,647

They searched the ruins... but
there was no sign of Karen.

No sign at all.

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,528

what happened to her?

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,491
Why was she blindfolded?

240
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,083
They said it was pan of a game.

241
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,122
They used to meet in the chapel.

242
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,128
Sometimes there seems to
be something out there.

243
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,126
Sometimes... I hear someone
whispering in the wind.

244
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,046
Mrs Aylwood, what do you
think happened to Karen?

245
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,041
I think she's still out there.

246
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,723
- What nonsense.
- I told you there was a ghost.

247
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,561
As long as it keeps out of the
house, I can live with it.

248
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,243
For heaven's sake! I knew Mrs Aylwood
was strange, but this is ridiculous.

249
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,809
I did see something in the mist at
the pond. That's why I fell in.

250
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,924
We'll always be grateful
to her for saving you,

251
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,887
but I won't have her filling your head
with these far-fetched fantasies.

252
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,604
Excuse me.

253
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,361
- I'll catch you later. I want to watch Mike.
- OK.

254
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,289
She seems less moody today.

255
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,441
This is what she needs. It'll do her
good. Knight on shining motorcycle.

256
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,770
- How many sandwiches do we have?
- Four for me and one for you!

Grab a sandwich before
your sister eats them all.

Ellie, let's get closer.

262
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,041
Well, be careful now.

263
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,247
- There he is!
- There's Mike!

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,164
Wow! Did you see that?

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,405
- What did you want?
- I didn't want you. Nerak did.

270
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,721
- It's lucky you moved off that rock.
- It wasn't luck.

271
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,447
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing. Forget it.

272
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,010
- It's just been a crazy kind of week all round.
- Do you want to talk about it?

273
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,290
Mrs Aylwood told me that Karen, her
daughter, disappeared years ago,

274
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,882
when she was about my age,
and was never seen again.

275
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,645
If Karen was murdered, that would explain
her haunting the woods, wouldn't it?

276
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,845
Mrs Aylwood said there were three
kids with Karen that night.

277
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,682
One was John Keller, and there
was a Tom something. Collier?

278
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,568
Tom Colley. He lives in the woods
in the old lodge. Kind of a hermit.

279
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,005
And there was a girl.
Mary... Mary Pierce.

280
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,731
- Mary Pierce?
- Yeah.

281
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,288
That was my mother's name
before she married Dad.

282
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,646
It was a long time ago.
It's best forgotten.

283
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,482
- How come you never told me?
- It happened years before you were born.

284
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,130
I remember your dad saying it's important
to live in the present and leave the past.

285
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,767
There's something about those
woods that bothers you.

286
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,488
You never go near them, not even to
take the short cut to the village.

287
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,924
Across that rickety old
bridge? I should say not.

288
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,886
Mum, what do you think really
happened to Karen Aylwood?

289
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,284
I think she ran away from home.

290
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,849
I don't know why she did, but it's
the only logical explanation.

291
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,321
What were the four of you doing?

292
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,523
We were just just larking about.

293
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,968
It was John Keller's idea.

294
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,291
It was... just a game.

295
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,726
Then there was a...
sudden summer storm.

296
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,924
Lightning struck the belfry.

297
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,044
The whole thing was aflame.

298
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,931
We ran out.

299
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,203
At least... three of us did.

300
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,250
I've never been back
to that place again.

301
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,446
Look what Daddy made me to
watch the eclipse on Saturday.

302
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,123
- I can show you how to make one.
- Not now. Mike's taking us riding.

303
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,482
I'll get ready.

304
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,361
- Mom said she'd only be a minute.
- That means ten.

305
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,403
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- So do I.

306
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,924
But if I don't, singers, dancers
and musicians will be unemployed.

307
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,647
- Jan, I'll be back in time for supper.
- OK.

308
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,845
- See if you can find some peanut butter.
- Crunchy or smooth?

309
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,202
- Smooth!
- Crunchy!

310
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,085
OK, I'll handle it.
Have a good ride.

311
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

312
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,248
- Bye!
- Bye!

313
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,047
Good riding, Ellie. Ride ahead and
make sure the path's clear of Indians.

314
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,007
It gets me out of the way so you two
can be alone, doesn't it? See you.

315
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,091
Come on. Come on,
Snowball. Let's go.

316
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,087
I tried to talk to
Mum about Karen.

317
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,728
She was very evasive. She really
didn't want to talk about it at all.

318
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,367
Come on, you guys. Hurry up!

319
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,688
Let go back through the woods.

320
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,571
- No, Mike, I don't think we should.
- Oh, come on!

321

331
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,048
Anybody there?

332
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,247
Hey, is anyone in there?

333
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,410
Mike!

334
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,606
Are you OK?

335
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,122
- That man!
- It was Tom Colley. He didn't hurt you?

336
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,690
I saw Karen's face again!
In the chapel. In a coffin!

337
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,961
It's only a reflection.

338
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,006
It couldn't have been my reflection.
I wasn't standing here.

339
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,524
I was back there. It
was Karen, her image.

340
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,088
She was lying in that
coffin as if she were dead.

341
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,561
I think I was sent
here for a reason.

342
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,084
You were on a runaway horse. He
could have bolted in any direction.

343
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,046
He bolted because something
in the woods spooked him.

344
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,208
Don't build it up into a...

345
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,086
Mike!

346
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,571
What made the windows break?

347
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,129
The wind. It just came
blasting through the chapel.

348
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,687
But there wasn't
any wind outside.

349
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,486
Overlapping circles.
What does it mean?

350
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,849
- Can't we go now, Jan?
- Sure we can, Ellie. Come on, Jan.

351
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,888
Mike. There was a shadow of a triangle
on this coffin when I came in.

352
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,971
The same triangle that's on
the window in my bedroom.

353
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,404
These circles, they
must mean something.

354
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,288
There was a circle on the
water at the pond, too.

355
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,608
It was strange.

356
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,648
I've seen her, Mr Keller. As
God's my witness, I've seen her.

357
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,803
- She was in the chapel, she was.
- You're drunk.

358
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,401
Not then, I wasn't.

359
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,409
She was there, I tell you.

360
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,970
She come in and went right to
the coffin and looked inside.

361
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,528
- That's impossible.
- Listen!

362
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,608
It's thundering.

363
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,650
There was thunder and lightning
that other night. The night we...

364
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,367
Now, I've told you never
to talk about that night!

365
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,010
All that time gone by, and her looking
like it was yesterday it happened.

366
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,846
- How could that be?
- Get hold of yourself, man!

367
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,602
It's been nearly 30 years.

368
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,331
Now, none of us could look
the same, could we, eh?

369
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,371
There.

370
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,561
(CRASH OF THUNDER)

371
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,081
What was it I seen, then?

372
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,047
Has she come back from the grave to
haunt us for what we done, Mr Keller?

373
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,041
Is it the ghost of Karen I seen?

374
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,209
(SCREAM)

375
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,768
Works every time!

376
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,689
(LAUGHTER)

377
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,248
We should bring Ellie. It
might curb her appetite.

378
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,564
- What took you so long?
- I saw her again.

379
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,809
- What are you talking about?
- In the mirrors.

380
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,847
She was reaching out, begging me,
pleading with me to help her.

381
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,766
- She's trapped and needs my help.
- Oh, come on, Jan!

382
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,766
- It means something, Mike.
- You're not making sense.

383
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,440
There's something
I've got to do.

384
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,089
Maybe she wants me to find out
what really happened that night.

385
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,650
- How?
- I don't know, but I've got to find out.

386
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,570
Stay!

387
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,846
Didn't you see the signs?
This is private property!

388
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,443
Mr Keller, I had to see you.
It's about Karen Aylwood.

389
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,926
- What about Karen Aylwood?
- She needs help.

390
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,805
- How would you know that?
- I've seen her.

391
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,889
- Where?
- In mirrors.

392
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,163
Mirrors. You see
yourself as Karen?

393
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,204
No! It was her image!

394
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,923
Why was she blindfolded in the chapel?
I've gotta know what happened that night!

395
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,921
Why do you? You're a stranger
here. It's none of your business.

396
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,242
Don't you see? She needs my help.
She's trapped somewhere...

397
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,731
That's enough. I've better things to do
than listen to hysterical fantasies.

398
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,561
What happened to Karen was a
tragedy that touched us all,

399
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,366
changed us all, but
it's best forgotten!

400
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,042
- Have you ever forgotten?
- Get out of here!

401
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,722
- Mr Keller, please.
- I said, clear out.

402
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,610
Tom Colley?

403
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,851
Tom Colley?

404
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,202
Please, don't be angry. I
didn't mean to come inside.

405
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,051
I called but nobody answered!

406
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,522
- You ain't no ghost.
- I'm the girl you saw in the chapel.

407
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,483
You ain't Karen come
back to haunt us.

408
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,088
Why would she do that?

409
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,843
Can't talk about that. Mr
Keller, he said not to.

410
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,085
Nasty poacher hurt its paw,
but old Tom'll make it right.

411
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,808
Like he did for you, eh?

412
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,247
Nearly right now, ain't you?

413
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,405
Not like them poor
little ones there.

414
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,049
When I finds 'em like
that, dead, I buries 'em.

415
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,290
Tom, was Karen dead
when you found her?

416
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,448
Never found Karen.
Looked and looked.

417
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,966
Here. Hold.

418
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,691
It won't hurt you none. They
know when you try to help.

419
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,322
- Karen needs your help, Tom.
- Needs me?

420
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,688
Yes, she needs you.

421
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,121
But Karen's gone.

422
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:47,643
- Tom, if you knew Karen was trapped...
- Awful things, traps. They hurt

423
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,325
- You'd set her free, wouldn't you?
- If I could find her.

424
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,005
You don't have to, Tom. All you have to do
is tell me what happened in the chapel.

425
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,007
Why did you blindfold her?

426
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,570
What was it you did? You and
Mary Pierce and John Keller?

427
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,009
Mr Keller said mustn't
talk about that.

428
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,847
- Mary Pierce said you were playing a game.
- She said?

429
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,850
Yes, Tom. What kind of game?

430
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,770
Ring Round the Roses, it was.

431
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,841
Never meant to harm Karen.

432
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,966
Loved Karen. Wouldn't
ever hurt her.

433
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,928
There was three of us.

434
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,287
Me and Mary made our way to the
secret meeting place, the old chapel.

435
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,767
We had blindfolded Karen.

436
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,524
That was what John Keller had told us
to do. She was the new one, you see.

437
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,405
John Keller was
already in there.

438
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,363
You have been brought to this place to prove
yourself worthy of our secret society.

439
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,849
We number only three. We alone
have passed this test of courage.

440
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,566
Many have tried and failed.

441
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,727
Once we link hands, you
must not show fear,

442
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,280
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

443
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,884
We shall hold hands around you and you must
not break the circle of our friendship.

444
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,483
Whatever happens, whatever we say
or do, you must abide by our code.

445
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,401
Banish all thoughts from your
mind. Do you understand?

446
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,568
Let us join hands...

447
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,281
and concentrate.

448
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,842
Mary Pierce, Tom Colley
and I, John Keller,

449
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,887
we are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

450
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,563
We ask the question, is
this person worthy...

00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,002
She wasn't there any more.

When the bell come down,
she was gone already.

454
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,849
- Are you sure?
- I told 'em what I seen.

455
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,364
"Where could she have gone?" they
says. There was no other way out.

456
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,487
And they looked and looked...
and never found nothing.

458
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,887
Nice to me, she was.

459
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,368
So nice.

460
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,761
She was my friend.

Where'd you hear that song?

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,527
From Jan. She was humming it at the
pond the day she fell in the water.

00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,563
Come in, child. There's something I want
to show you. I think you'll like it.

466
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,810
- My mother said I was never to bother you.
- It's no bother.

467
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,210
Come on. I was just about
to have some tea and cakes.

OK!

469
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,722
This belonged to my daughter.

470
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,243
I gave it to her on her fifth
birthday. She loved it.

471
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,570
She played it at night
before she went to sleep.

472
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,243
It's the same tune you
heard at the pond.

Listen.

hear... other things.

to... do things?

I was just dreaming.

00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,768
Not when you named Nerak.

478
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,122
She named herself.

479
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,402
Listen, child.
Listen to the music.

480
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,364
See if you can hear
that voice again.

00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,325
- Mrs Aylwood.
- Hi, Jan.

Look at the music
box. Isn't it pretty?

483
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,929
In a minute, Ellie. I've something to tell
Mrs Aylwood. I just came from Tom Colley's.

484
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,522
He said it was some kind
of initiation ceremony.

485
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,645
He said there was a flash of
light, just like you saw,

486
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,128
but when the bell crashed,
Karen was already gone.

There was no other way out.

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,328
That's what Tom Colley said. The bell
crashed. Karen was already gone.

How can we help Karen?

493
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,491
Door. Must open door.

- What door? Where?
- Chapel.

- Tell me what to do, Karen, please!

It's all right, baby. Everything
is gonna be all right now.

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,801
I'm taking you out of here. I'm taking
both of you away from here tonight.

(JAN) No! You can't.
Not now, Mom!

509
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,801
It's not Karen outside there. Don't
you understand? It's someone else!

510
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,607
You get your things ready.
We're leaving here right now.

- The battery's shorting.

Sorry she made you angry.

You're not Karen. I know that.

I don't know who you are, but, please,
leave my little sister alone.

- Mom, I can't. I can't stop!

There's something I've got to do, or
Ellie and I'll go on being haunted!

tell me what it wants!

Not Karen!

531
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,728
We've got to hurry!

532
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,088
Nearly too late.

533
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,967
- Hardly ever happens.
- What hardly ever happens?

534
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,044
Ellie, you said it hardly ever
happens. What does it mean?

535
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,770
I don't know, Jan.

536
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,928

01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,646
Good, you're up. Mom said not to wake
you. Seen my thing to watch the eclipse?

542
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,569
No.

543
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,483
Dad says you can't look straight at
the sun or it'll ruin your eyes.

544
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,765
- I hope he gets here in time to see it.
- Daddy's coming?

545
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,409
Mom called him. Help me look,
Jan. It's nearly too late.

Oh, here it is!

548
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,326
That's funny. I looked
in there before.

549
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,527
We can all take turns using
it. It hardly ever happens.

<i>Hardly ever happens.</i>

551
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,366
- What hardly ever happens?
- I just told you. The eclipse.

01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,963
There are lots of moon eclipses,
but a sun eclipse is special.

going back to sleep.

<i>- Hello?
- You gotta do something for me!</i>

561
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,004
- Jan, what's wrong?
- I think I know what those circles meant.

562
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,161
- The overlapping ones meant an eclipse.
- There's an eclipse today.

563
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,842
And the circle at the pond
meant a circle of people.

564
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,409
I can't explain it all, but I have
to get Keller, Tom and your mom

565
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,251
to the chapel now
before the eclipse.

566
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,526
I need your help. Tell her anything.
Say it's a matter of life or death.

567
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,731
Jan?

568
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,602
Where are you going?

569
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,886
I'm going to the chapel with John
Keller, Tom Colley and Mary Fleming.

570
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,085
I want them to repeat the ceremony
they held, linking hands,

571
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,762
like in a seance when
people make objects move.

572
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,807
- I think that's what happened to Karen...
- No! You mustn't do that!

573
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,847
Whatever happened to my
Karen could happen to you.

574
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,287
Mrs Aylwood, I have to do it.

575
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,530
Whatever is haunting Ellie and
me will never leave us alone.

576
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,448
God be with you, child.

577
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,207
- Karen Aylwood's dead!
- How do you know that?

578
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,007
She never would have put her
mother through suffering!

579
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,329
Part of the suffering
is not knowing.

580
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,171
Maybe we can find
out what happened,

581
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,764
how she disappeared before the bell
fell, or how she died, if she died.

582
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,726
I told you before, it's
none of your business.

583
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,969
Mr Keller, it was
your idea, wasn't it?

584
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,601
The secret society? The
initiation ceremony?

585
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,802
Don't you wanna know the truth?

586
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,367
Who do you think you are to disrupt
lives and reopen old wounds?

587
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,961
They never really
healed, did they?

588
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,960
Isn't that why you lock yourself
away in that dreary house,

589
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,288
a prisoner of your own guilt?

590
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,529
Mr Keller, I don't
have much time.

591
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,961
But you owe it to Karen

592
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,007
and you owe it to yourself to
try to help make this happen.

593
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,444
- They should have been here by now.
- They won't come. Not back to this place.

We can't waste it arguing.

It may not work, Mrs
Fleming, but we must try!

603
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,562
We have to repeat the ceremony.

No. No!

605
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,970
Whatever happened 30 years
ago was during an eclipse.

606
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,404
The same thing's happening now,
so maybe we can bring her back.

Nerak.

614
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,166
Don't do it. When Karen did it, something
went wrong. She was never seen again.

615
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,125
The circle won't be
broken this time.

616
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,807
No, no, no! We ran away once before
and we've regretted it ever since.

- We must not run out again!
- The blindfold.

618
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,764
Mr Keller, I have to know exactly
what you said and did that night.

619
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,091
- I told Karen...
- To me, Mr Keller. I'm Karen now.

620
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,490
- Say it to me!
- Very well.

621
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,048
Once we link hands, you
must not show fear,

622
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:31,804
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

623

We shall hold hands and you must not
break our circle of friendship.

624

- If anything happens to Jan, I'll break it.
- Don't interfere! Move away!

We are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

transferred our positions.</i>

- It's almost time. Hurry.</i>

Go on with the ceremony, Mr Keller!
We've gotta beat the eclipse.

Come on!

01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:06,600
We shall hold hands around you. You must
not break our circle of friendship.

Don't break the circle!

- Hurry.
- But where is Karen?

<i>Karen was in the way.</i>

653
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,601
<i>Mistake. Transferred by mistake.</i>

654
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,486
<i>In error we exchanged places.</i>

655
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,490
<i>Karen's still in my dimension.</i>

01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,206
<i>Trapped and suspended.</i>

657
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,768
<i>Must reverse the process.</i>

658
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,724
<i>Concentrate.</i>

659
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,248
<i>Exchange persons
again. Transfer back.</i>

660
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,490
<i>Now. Later too late.</i>

661
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,725
<i>Now.</i>

662
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,321
<i>Now. Now.</i>

663
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,282
- It's taking me!
- Jan, you have to get out of that!

664
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,369
I can't!

665
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,449
Jan, move! Move!

666
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,244
Break the ring! Break it!
