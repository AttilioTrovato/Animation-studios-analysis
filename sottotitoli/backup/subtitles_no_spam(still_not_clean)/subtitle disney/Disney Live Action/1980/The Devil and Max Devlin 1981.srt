1
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,181
There he is.

2
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:05,490
Make a nice, neat line,

3
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:08,493
and I'll be with you
in a minute.

4
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,132
You've got to do something.

5
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:46,293
Okay, you can come in now.

6
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,529
<i>One at a time, pleas.</i>

7
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:54,432
Make a nice line, orderly,
and be kind. Be nice.

8
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,233
What about my paint job?

9
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:59,369
Mr. Billings, you're talking
about a major improvement.

10
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,370
It would be up to the owner.

11
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,505
Oh, it's always
up to the owner.

12
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:04,206
I have cockroaches.

13
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,758
<i>No, you don'.</i>

14
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,309
In New York,
they have cockroaches.

15
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,611
Here we have palmettos,
and they're harmless.

16
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:14,115
My little granddaughter,
very placid, very quiet,

17
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:18,119
never talks above a whisper,
tiptoes when she walks.

18
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,788
<i>Adorable, no?</i> No.

19
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,891
Look, just for two days while
her mother goes to visit her...

20
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,193
<i>Mrs. Davi, rules are rule.</i>

21
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:29,462
And at grand manor,
the rules are no children,

22
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:32,565
no pets, and no unnecessary
repairs or expenses.

23
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:35,401
I'm not asking
for unnecessary repairs.

24
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,169
It's an emergency. <i>What can
I tell you, Mrs. Davis?</i>

25
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,904
No children means no children.

26
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:41,539
If I've heard it once,
I've heard it a million times.

27
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,374
The owner has said they're
very cute when they're little,

28
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,375
but when they grow up...

29
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:47,911
that saying is for kittens!

30
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,412
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

31
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,614
After all we've meant
to each other,

32
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,248
you would actually evict me

33
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,483
for keeping a parakeet
in my room?

34
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,918
Sweetheart, if I let you
keep a parakeet,

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
I'd have to let everybody else
keep a parakeet,

36
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,489
and this is not
a bird sanctuary.

37
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:04,324
It's an apartment house.

38
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,192
Honey, he's only
following rules.

39
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:08,260
If you want to blame someone,

40
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,294
<i>blame the rotten owne.</i>

41
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:10,495
<i>He is the rotten owner.</i>

42
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,863
Well, that's all
for now, folks.

43
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,397
I have an important
appointment outside.

44
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,449
Excuse me.

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,500
<i>Mr. Garrone, is that you?</i>
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

46
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,302
Mr. Garrone!

47
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:22,238
<i>It's been two months,</i>
<i>and I want my rent</i>

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,907
or I'm gonna take your
apartment, Mr. Garrone!

49
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,441
I want it back!
I want my rent, Mr. Garrone!

50
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:28,509
<i>Your rent is due.</i>

51
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,810
I'm gonna have to take steps!

52
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,512
Mister, would you cross me?

53
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,647
Out of my way, old LA... aah!

You're making
a terrible mistake.

78

I'm aware of that.

88
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:40,866

What's level four?

110
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:46,021
It's horrible. Horrible.

114
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:58,099
Well, let's say that we
conditionally restore you

115
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,166
to life on earth,

116
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:04,070
say for a period of,
mmm, two months.

117
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:09,508
In that time, if you
could find three souls

118
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:15,112
to take your place,
you sign them.

119
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:19,116
Then, if you don't, hmm...

120
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:20,417
Let me see.

121
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,118
There's Joe basuti.

122
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,185
He's our slum landlord.

123
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,987
And there's a doctor I know

124
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,122
who's deeply
into medicaid fraud.

125
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:33,827
And oh, yeah,
a hit man I know in venice.

126
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,461
No good.

127
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:38,163
No, no, no,
it's not venice, Italy.

128
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:43,001
It's venice,
right here in California.

129
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:44,902
No good.

130
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:50,006
Sooner or later, we'll get
those people anyway.

131
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,142
What did he say?

132
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:57,179
It's no good.

00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,054
what we're looking for

136
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,523

138
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,062
Oh.

139
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:21,099
I don't think I know
too many people like that.

140
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,201
Actually,
I don't think I know any.

141
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,635
Where do I find them?

142
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:27,170
They're all over,
unfortunately.

143
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,005
To facilitate matters,

144
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,240
let's start with your area.

145
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:35,043
Unsullied innocence.

146
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:40,180
<i>Get the.</i>

147
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:49,054
You want me to corrupt
the souls of little kids?

148
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,627
See, I've never
been much on kids.

149
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,663
But that's not a nice thing.

150
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:02,733
Neither is level four.

151
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,936
Where do I sign?

152
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,252

153
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:27,622
Y-y-you just got killed

154
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,091

<i>D'you live around here?</i>

158

I mean... I mean,
you look very familiar.

159
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,421
My God.

160
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:06,422
What'll it be?

161
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:08,290
Just give me a second.

162
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,426
Wait a minute.

163
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:15,029
I said,
"just give me a second."

164
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,164
Wait a minute.

165
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,698
This is crazy.

166
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,266
I don't know you.

167
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,301

168
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:25,137
It was no dream, Max.

169
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,072

170
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,907
How do you know my name?

171
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,741
I know
everything about you, Max.

172
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:33,678
Well, you wanna order or not?

173
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,281
Uh, I'll have
another black coffee.

174
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,750
Hey, wait a minute.
What about my friend here?

175
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,285

176
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,186
<i>Yeah, yeah. My friend.</i>

177
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:49,190
Okay, two coffees.
One for your friend.

178
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,392
He can't see me, Max.

179
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,227
What are you talking about?

180
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,761
Only you can see me.

181
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:57,130
<i>You crazy.</i>

182
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:58,431
You crazy, you know that?

183
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,434
You must have just escaped
from the funny house.

184
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,371
Two coffees.
One for your friend.

185
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:06,373
<i>Hey, do you know this gu?</i>

186
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,373
Yeah, yeah. I seen him around.

187
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,191
That's what I thought.

188
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,008
All right, now, look, you make
sure to pick up the tab.

189
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,311
You see,
I don't trust your friend.

190
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:15,346
He's putting you on.
He can't see me.

191
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,048
You're crazy! You're crazy!

192
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,916
You know... hey, Mac!

193
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,417
Mac, he tells me
you can't see him.

194
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,187
Look, buddy, why don't you take
your friend and leave.

195
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,289
I don't want to have
to call the cops.

196
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,323
<i>Cops?</i>

197
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:31,292
He's gonna call the cops now.

198
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,160
Everybody's crazy around here.

199
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:35,262
I'm getting out of here.

200
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:38,031
Hey, hey, hey,
that's $1.05 for three coffees.

201
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,032
Don't worry. I'm paying.

202
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,100
All right. Let's have it.

203
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,413
<i>Okay, budd.</i>

204
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:57,148
<i>Let's have I.</i>

205
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,257
Listen. A weird thing...

206
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,758
a weird thing just happened.

207
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,527
There's this mirror
behind the cashier.

208
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,262
You're one of us now.

209
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:16,365
Inhabitants of hell cast
no reflection.

210
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:24,070
You remember this.

211
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,371
Oh, my God.

212
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,405
I wish you wouldn't say that.

213
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,141
I'm sorry. Yeah.

214
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,175
It's true.

215
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,543
I can't believe it.

216
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,045
I can't believe it. Why me?

217
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,246
I'm young.

218
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,448
I wasn't any worse
than the next guy.

219
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,951
I mean,
I wasn't all bad, was I?

220
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,419
It's not fair.

221
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,554
Where were you
when I needed you?

222
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,522
Yeah, well,
you can't blame him.

223
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,223
I mean, you did it
all yourself.

224
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:51,226
Now is there someplace
less public we could...

225
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,429
we have things to discuss
because time's wasting.

226
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:00,434
All right, now, you... you okay?

227
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,436
Now, look, let's synchronize
our watches.

228
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:05,172
What time do you have?

229
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,207
Who cares? I'm dead.

230
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,142
No, cheer up now.
You have midnight,

231
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,010
may 15th.

232
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:15,280
I want signed contracts
of the three kids.

233
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,015
Okay.

234
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,950
For starters, who are they?

235
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:22,386
What are their names?
How am I gonna meet 'em?

236
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:25,222
Concentrate.

237
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:26,957
Concentrate?

238
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,991
Concentrate.

239
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,360
Like the girl.
She's your target.

240
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:31,961
Concentrate.

241
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,063
Like that?

242
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,031
Yeah.

243
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,533
Yeah? Yes.

244
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,304
This is phenomenal.

245
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:48,141
Wow. It's like I got esp
or something.

246
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:49,543
I got her. I got her.
I can see her.

247
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,977
It's a little hazy...

248
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,411
Well, what do you want
for the first time out?

249
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,012
Why, this is amazing.

250
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:55,480
Hey, how can I be there?
How do you do that?

251
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:58,282
Same technique.

252
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:01,951
You concentrate harder.

253
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:08,423
<i>Literally think yourself there.</i>

254
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,992
I hate the way I look.

255
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,226
No, no, you look great.

256
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,127
I look terrible.
No, you should see the back.

257
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,929
<i>I look terrible.</i>

258
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,964
I can't get the back.
I can't see anything.

259
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,231
<i>Stella, you're gonna e</i>
<i>terrific tonigh.</i>

260
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,232
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

261
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,233
Oh, my God.

262
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,468
What are you doing in here?

263
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,569
It's quite all right. I-I'm...

264
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:29,172
I'm very... I'm not really here.

265
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,473
Excuse me.

266
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:33,174
Oh, well, come...
come in... it's...

267
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:38,011
Kinky.

268
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,012
Oh, yeah, boy.

269
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:39,514
Barney!

270
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,918
In the ladies' room.
For God's s...

271
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,019
please.

272
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,121
In the ladies' room.

273
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:51,490
Next time,
you look before you...

274
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,491
leap. Right.

275
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,326
Next time, I look
before I leap.

276
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,945
Now... oh!

277
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,563
Now, from now on, this,
in order to concentrate...

278
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:00,965
but I thought...

279
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,334
it's not necessary.

280
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,436
Okay?

281
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,572
One of the most valuable
of your newly-acquired gifts

282
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:12,008
is to confer magic properties,

283
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,175
you see.

284
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:14,409
Now to do that,
all you have to do

285
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:17,445
is command your target
to perform.

286
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:19,079
Perform what?

287
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,380
Whatever.

288
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,949
Oh. Yeah.

289
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,417
<i>The air conditioner's</i>
<i>one the Fritz again,</i>

290
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:25,985
and it's hotter than hell
up here.

291
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,020
Ha!

292
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,421
He doesn't know how hot it is.

293
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,939
Max, you better get
my screen fixed,

294
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,456
those palmettos are coming
in the windows.

295
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,809
They're all over the place.

296
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,160
<i>Max, Max, I don't have</i>
<i>hot or cold water.</i>

297
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,729
<i>I'm over here.</i>

298
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,296
<i>Please be an angel and fix it.</i>

299
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,431
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>
<i>I can't wash...</i>

300
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,302
magic property lasts
only so long

301
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:51,105
as you and the target
are within sight of each other.

302
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,407
What happens to the kids
after they sign?

303
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,743
Nothing.

304
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:58,078
We don't get them till
the natural ends of their lives.

305
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,419
Hey, isn't that the head
a & off

306
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,021
<i>of blizzard records?</i>

307
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,255
<i>Ah, man.</i>

308
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,423
What I wouldn't give
not to mess up now.

309
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,491
You won't. You won't.
What do you know?

310
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,192
Hey, that's the guy
from the John.

311
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:19,426
Hey, don't come near me, pal.

312
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:21,327
You lay a hand on me,
and I'll scream.

313
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,029
Oh, I'm genuinely sorry about
what happened in the bathroom.

314
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,263
It was an honest mistake.

315
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:27,999
I just walked
through the wrong door.

316
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,367
He doesn't seem
like a pervert, Heidi.

317
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,035
Thank you very much. I'm not.

318
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,569
But I am very good luck.

319
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:39,008
And I guarantee,
you will not fail tonight.

320
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,252
You're gonna do all right.
Now go get 'em, Stella.

321
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,555
All right, now, to sing
her own material,

322
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:00,257
this is her first time now,
folks,

323
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,027
so let's have a warm welcome
for miss Stella summers.

324
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,196
Come on.

325
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,070
Hi.

326
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:20,507
In, um, in topanga canyon,
uh, where I come from,

327
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,243
the living... the living's
real easy

328
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,044
'cause everybody's folks

329
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,212
<i>kinda let them do</i>
<i>their own thing,</i>

330
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:29,747
<i>which is why I'm glad</i>
<i>I come from there.</i>

331
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,119
Um, so what I'd like to do
right now

332
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:40,790
is sing to you a tune that I...
I wrote this tune.

333
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,392
And I'd like to dedicate it

334
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,260
to all the kids
around the country

335
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:49,130
who don't have it so good.

336
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:52,133
Whoo!

337
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:58,471
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶

338
00:18:58,473 --> 00:18:59,738

¶ When I know it means ¶

341
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,146
<i>¶ There's no you ¶</i>

342
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,517
¶ I've never loved ¶

343
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,387
<i>¶ and been so sure of it ¶</i>

344
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,006
what happened?

345
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,624
¶ Now I guess we both have
to choose ¶

346
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:29,231
¶ oh, you say friends,
and I say that's not enough ¶

347
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,899
¶ give it up ¶

348
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:36,337

349
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:38,272
¶ for you to touch ¶

350
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:41,208

¶ here all alone ¶

355
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:08,866
¶ yes, I'm all grown-up now ¶

356

¶ wish I didn't have to be
so strong ¶

357

365
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:48,532

Yeah!

380
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,461
Whoo!

381
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:10,634
Stella summers.

382
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:14,304
Just stick with me, kid.

383
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,371
Excuse me. Yeah?

384
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,372
Jerry nadler, a & r,

385
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:17,657
blizzard records.

386
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:18,941
Listen, sweetheart,
that was sheer dynamite.

387
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:20,842
You got anything on tape? No.

388
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,343
All right, listen,
what I want you to do is come

389
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:24,445
into the place, any time
that's convenient for you

390
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:26,313
we'll lay something down, okay?

391
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,447
Yeah. How about next week?

392
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:28,514
Yeah. Oh!

393
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,648
Can he come? Can he come?

394
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,049
Why, what is he?
Your manager or what?

395
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:34,518
She needs me.
Come on. They want you!

396
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,454
Who are you?

397
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,390
I'm her, uh, groupie.

398
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,825
Great.

399
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,526
Great.

400
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:01,642
Nelson, darling,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

401
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,043
What's keeping you up so late?

402
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:05,412
Uh, the<i> ucla law review.</i>

403
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:06,613
It's fascinating.

404
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,581
Oh. That's nice, dear.

405
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,049
Well, good night.

406
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:11,350
Good night.

407
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:34,472
Come on. Forget about him.

408
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:35,639
Ah, come on.

409
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:40,843
Just one quick lesson.

410
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,044
Just forget it, nerd.

411
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,529
Why?

412
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,013
Because nerds don't do
dangerous stuff.

413
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,481
Suppose you fell off the bike?

414
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:48,082
Your daddy'd sue us.

415
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,516
I'll sign a waiver.

416
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:51,551
<i>Forget it.</i>

417
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:04,862
Oh!

418
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,664
Uh, do you take beginners?

419
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,033
Depends on how badly
you wanna learn.

420
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:11,634
What? What?

421
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:15,870
I said, it depends
on how badly you wanna learn.

422
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,438
Oh, a lot.

423
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,173
Because I wouldn't want
to divulge

424
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,408
my expertise to just anyone.

425
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,076
You've got to want it so bad,

426
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,878
I mean, so bad that you'd sell
your soul for it.

427
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,846
Well, I'm your man.

428
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,881
I mean, you know,
it's such a wild coincidence

429
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,616
you just coming along
like that.

430
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,049
Hop in.

431
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:37,453
Max devlin.

432
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:38,821
Nelson nordlinger.
How do you do?

433
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,906
Nice meeting you, Nelson.

434
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:42,990
<i>Oh, in school,</i>
<i>they just call me nerd.</i>

435
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:47,862
<i>Insensitive bums.</i>

436
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:49,830
<i>Aren't you gonna show me how</i>
<i>first?</i>

437
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:51,531
<i>Nah, learning by doing...</i>
<i>that's my motto.</i>

438
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,199
Come on.
Get on, and take her away.

439
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,071
Well, Mr. Devlin,
you know, the worst thing

440
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:02,541
about being the nerd
is just that you begin

441
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,784
to believe the litany of
disaster you were brought up on.

442
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,479
To put it bluntly,
I'm scared to get on this thing.

443
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,680
Of course you are.

444
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,181
I can understand that.

445
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,117
But Sonny boy, I'm not
your run-of-the-mill trainer.

446
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,519
I have wrought miracles
in my day.

447
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,053
You ever heard
of Roger decoster?

448
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:20,655
You taught Roger decoster?

449
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,440
By the time I'm finished
with you,

450
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:24,224
you're gonna make Roger decoster
look like molasses.

451
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:26,126
You're gonna be the motocross
champ of the world.

452
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:27,661
Now come on.

453
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,195
Miracle Max says
step on the starter.

454
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,569
Miracle Max says you're gonna
ride all over this hill,

455
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,505
and what's more,
you're gonna like it.

456
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,106
Try.

457
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,546
Just thought I'd remind you

458
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,515
that the magic property lasts
only as long

459
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:30,886
as you and the subject are
within sight of each other.

460
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:38,927
Hey, come back!

461
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:51,871
You all right?

462
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:53,906
Yeah.

463
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:55,940
You did pretty good,
considering the hunk of junk

464
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:56,942
you was riding on.

465
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:59,678
Well, that's not my hunk
of junk.

466
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,112
It belongs to my trainer.

467
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,246
<i>It does?</i>

468
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:03,914
What kind of trainer's
learning you

469
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,116
on a rattly trap
ol' thing like that?

470
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:07,917
<i>Oh, well, so long</i>
<i>as it runs, I guess.</i>

471
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,184
Hey, I'll tell you what,
you come on out

472
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:10,618
,

473
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,119
I'd be glad to race
against you proper.

474
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,553
Big Billy hunniker's
the moniker.

475
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,688
Nerve nordlinger.

476
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,923
Nerve with a "v."

477
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,925
Be seeing you now.

478
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:29,666
You stupid, dumb idiot!

479
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:32,001
It's a miracle
you weren't killed.

480
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,869
Look,
when I said over the hill,

481
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,337
I didn't mean
literally over the hill.

482
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,339
<i>Now let me tell you something.</i>

483
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:38,940
How you choose to endanger
your life

484
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:40,942
in your spare time
is beyond my control.

485
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:43,044
But when you're riding
this bike,

486
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:44,345
<i>I never want you</i>
<i>out of my sight.</i>

487
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:46,613
<i>Ever! Is that clear?</i>

488
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:49,983
Now let's cruise,
easy and nice, back to the car.

489
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,284
Yeah.

490
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,653
Okay.

491
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:11,602
Four.

492
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:13,136
Next. I'll take one.

493
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,071
Sorry.

494
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:16,939
No children under 12
are permitted without an adult.

495
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,206
He's with me.

496
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,340
I'm his Uncle Max.

497
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:21,241
Make that two, please?

498
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,042
Yeah. Two.

499
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:24,943
Thank you very much.

500
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:26,010
Next.

501
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:31,248
By the way,
whose the Uncle Max am I?

502
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,249
Toby's.

503
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,850
Toby who?

504
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:37,253
Toby hart, and thanks a lot
for helping me.

505
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,954
My pleasure.

506
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,954
Well, I'll see ya, Uncle Max.

507
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:16,021
Thanks again.

508
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,339
What do you mean,
you'll see me?

509
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,656
I thought you were having
such a great time?

510
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:21,225
Uh, I am,
but I ran out of money, so.

511
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,126
What are you worried about?
I got plenty of money.

512
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,428
The next one's on me.

513
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,062
Really? Sure.

514
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,530
I figure we spend
some time together,

515
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,248
get to know one another.

516
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:30,965
I'll find out
the kind of things you like,

517
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:32,434
you'll find out
the kind of things I like.

518
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:34,969
For instance, Toby,
if you could have anything

519
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:37,237
in the whole world,
what would it be?

520
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,938
To do the octopus again.

521
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,506
Well, that's not exactly
what I had in mind.

522
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:42,407
Don't you like the octopus?

523
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:44,976
Better than life itself,
but what I thought was

524
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:47,011
that if you and me
got our heads together...

525
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:07,428
Okay, so you don't want

526
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,296
to be the best pitcher
in your class.

527
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:13,033
And you don't want to be
the strongest kid in the world.

528
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:15,035
And you don't want to be
the lead soprano

529
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:17,070
in the vienna boys' choir.

530
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:19,205
Then what do you want to be?

531
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,073
Hey, I got it, I got it.

532
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,008
I got it. Invisible!

533
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,043
If you were invisible,
you could come here all the time

534
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,244
and ride the rides for free.

535
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:28,246
Wouldn't that be great?

536
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:31,482
Wait.
But wouldn't that be cheating?

537
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:33,550
Yeah. You're right.

538
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:36,952
You wouldn't want to cheat.

539
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:39,454
<i>Well, Toby, old pal, old sport,</i>

540
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:43,324
<i>isn't there something</i>
<i>you want that's so big</i>

541
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:46,060
and so terrific
and so important

542
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:49,430
that you'd... well, you'd
practically sell your soul for?

543
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:52,065
Hmm.

544
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,033
Well, there is one thing.

545
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:56,368
What? To have you for my father.

546
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,138
Well, what's the matter
with your own father?

547
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,973
Dead.

548
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,141
Oh.

549
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:06,143
Say, if you were my father,

550
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,577
I can go to the carnival
for free

551
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,145
any time I want anyways.

552
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,798
'Cause you'd bring me.

553
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,450
It's only a couple blocks
from the house.

554
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,084
I live right over here.
Come on.

555
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:18,453
Oh. Okay.

556
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:19,520
<i>I mean, how do you know</i>

557
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:21,355
your mother would want
to marry me?

558
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,023
She will.

559
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:25,258
Why wouldn't she?

560
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,162
Are those all
your little brothers and sisters

561
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:32,030

564
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,167
Ah.

565
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:39,002
Oh, and that's mom over there.

566
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:42,338
<i>She's a neat lady</i>
<i>most of the time.</i>

567
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
There.

568
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:46,408
Okay.

569
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:54,315
Hi, mom.

570
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:56,050
Toby.

571
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:58,585

<i>Penny har. Tad.</i>

573
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:03,322
How come you're so late
and you're so dirty?

574
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,460
And I asked you
not to waste your money

575
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:09,461
in that place again.

576
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,029
Uncle Max paid.

577
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,330
Uncle Max.

578
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,565
He's okay.
I found out all about him.

579
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,167
He's in real estate,
38 years old,

580
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,302
not married,
and loves little kids.

581
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,171
Oh, I'll bet.

582
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,039
Listen, Toby,
I am not getting married again

583
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,073
for a good long time.

584
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,274
If ever.

585
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,942
So stop matchmaking.

586
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,244
One of these days, you're gonna
drag home a murderer.

587
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:30,545
This is probably the day.

588
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:33,147
Oh, mom, he's nice.

589
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:34,214
Look at him.

590
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:37,417

Yeah? Let's try it again, okay?

601
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:56,430
Okay, yeah.
I'll do good this time.

602
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,031
Roll music.

603
00:32:58,033 --> 00:32:59,132
Roll playback.

604
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,933

<i>I'm blowing it.</i>
Take five, Stella.

611
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,088
We'll come back to it
in a minute.

612
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,589
Cut it.

<i>I'm kati.</i>

<i>Stella?</i>

<i>You've got to use your hand...</i>

622
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,805
Toby, watch that man.

623
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,372
I don't want him left alone
with those kids for two seconds.

624
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,741
He looks thoroughly unreliable.

625
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:53,309
Hello?

626
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,194
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:02,150
Come out, come out,

00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:03,201
<i>Max!</i>

631
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:04,251
<i>Okay, good. Thanks.</i>

632
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:05,804
Buh-bye.

633
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:07,355
Mom. I told you not to
leave him alone with them.

634
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:08,556
I didn't.

635
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,057
He left them alone.

636
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,225
Just what I thought.
Thoroughly unreliable.

637
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:14,126

- Yes, you can.
<i>- Stop the music.</i>

643
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:33,742
Where'd he come from?

644
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:36,311
I don't know.

645
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:37,545
Listen, Max, we've done it

646
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>42 times alread.</i>

647
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:42,416
Yeah, but you didn't do it
42 times with me here, okay.

648
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,050
Stella. Yeah?

649
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,584
Let's give 'em a perfect take,
okay?

650
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:47,586
Okay. All right. Okay,
guys, start the music.

651
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,754
Start the music.

652
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,756
Roll playback.

653
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,791
Take 43.

Stella, look.

675
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,115
Number 28.

676
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,251
It's climbing.

677
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:15,823
Hello?

678
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,357
Hello, Toby.

679
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,192
This is your Uncle Max.

680
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,426
Oh, hi.

681
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,227
Can I talk
to your mother, please?

682
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:24,829
Uh, just a sec, all right?

683
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:25,830
It's for you, mom.

684
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,097
It's Uncle Max.

685
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:29,132
Uncle Max?

686
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:31,785
I don't believe it.

687
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:34,437
Tell him that I'm...
tell him that I'm not here.

688
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,540
She says to say she's not here.

689
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,408
Huh... well, you tell her
it's somebody else.

690
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,442
I have to talk to her.

691
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:43,210
He says to say
he's someone else.

692
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:48,781
Excuse me, guys.

693
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,853
Hello. Uncle Max?

694
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,421
Uh, I don't know who you are

695
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,006
or what you want,

696
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:00,590
but I want you to leave
me and my son alone, please.

697
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:03,225
Mrs. Hart, don't hang up
on me, please,

698
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,292
until you hear me out, okay?

699
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:07,428
You may think
this sounds insane,

700
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,329
but I've fallen deeply
in love...

701
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,800
You know what you are?

702
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,868
You are the only 11-year-old
procurer in the business.

703
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,169
What's a...?

704
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:19,905
Forget it.

705
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,589
Great party, Jerry.

706
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,892
Great.

707
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,411
<i>My sources tell me</i>
<i>that the record deal.</i>

713

So, uh, where's
your girlfriend, Heidi?

714
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:28,332
Parents wouldn't let her come.

715
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:29,666
They're such a pain.

716
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:32,368
Well, your parents
are okay, aren't they?

717
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,403
They're alive. <i>Sure.</i>

718
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,538
In topanga canyon, though,
it's different, you know.

719
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,373
The parents don't care
where you go

720
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,675
or who you go with
or what kind of music you play.

721
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:43,077
You know.
I mean, maxy, I am really lucky.

722
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,646
I mean, there are some parents,
they are so strict.

723
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:48,982
They don't allow anything
but classical around the house.

724
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,883
And they don't even own a TV.

725
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:07,332
Having a swell time, aren't we?

726
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:10,435
Yeah, this is great.
I hope this lasts forever.

727
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:12,870
I bet you'd be willing
to sell your soul for that.

728
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:14,605
Ha! If I had a soul to sell.

729
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,840
Would you care to put that
on paper?

730
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,541
'Cause I'm the guy
who can arrange it.

731
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:21,076
Remember me. Miracle Max.

732
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:23,578
<i>Right now, I'd sell my soul</i>
<i>for a cheeseburger.</i>

733
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,680
Well, that too can be arranged.

734
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:27,081
Just put your little
John hancock right there

735
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,849
and we'll fill the details in
later.

736
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,616
Max, you know, you're really
off the wall tonight.

737
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,684
Here, hold this.

738
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:33,552
I want to talk to Jerry.

739
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,523
Oh, eat first
and corrupt later.

740
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:39,957
That's what I always say.

741
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,130
How much later
are you planning to wait?

742
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,499
It's already April 10th.

743
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:52,434
Well, look at her.

744
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:55,403
She's as good as in the bag.

745
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,905
As good as is not good enough.

746
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,106
Now what about the others?

747
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,041
Oh, don't worry.

748
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,009
I'm working on it.

749
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,451
Nakaguchi's been running
very well here.

750
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,618
Certainly competitive
here on the cross

751
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,053
of a warm afternoon.

752
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:19,089
We have a little boy with
a red shirt and green pants.

753
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:21,658
He's here
in the announcer stand.

754
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,459
His parents are lost.

755
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,494
A little boy
with a red shirt...

756
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:26,495
What category?

757
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:29,397
Expert.

758
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,531
I'm not so sure about that.

759
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:31,865
I'm sure.

760
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:38,137
If you're in the first race, you
should be at the starting line.

761
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,972
Get your bikes
to the starting line, please.

762
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,440
Hey, man.

763
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:42,541
Hey, I don't want you
to get excited now.

764
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,675
I'm not excited.

765
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,576
Oh, oh, my God.
Don't turn around.

766
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:46,944
<i>There are two nakaguchi scouts</i>
<i>sitting</i>

767
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:47,945
right there in the bleachers.

768
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,579
Well shut my mouth.

769
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,646
Don't turn around.

770
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,014
Look, I know
why they're here too.

771
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,048
They're looking
for factory riders,

772
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,316
and if you go out there
and win,

773
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:55,583
they're gonna make you one,
I just know it.

774
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:56,850
Honey, they will. They will.

775
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,519
I want you to go out
and do your best, Billy, okay?

776
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,553
Laverne, honey, don't I always?

777
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:01,021
Yeah.

778
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:03,490
Now if you are
at the first moto...

779
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,900
How about
a few last minute pointers?

780
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,635
What for?
You've been over this track

781
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:17,503
a million times
in the last few weeks.

782
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:19,171
Yeah, but never in a race.

783
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:20,639
It's very simple.

784
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,441
You start,
you ride like a bat out of hell,

785
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:24,542
and you win.

786
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:26,977
Have you ever seen
one of our bats?

787
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:29,980
Uh, scratch that.

788
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:33,683
You start, and you win.

789
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:36,017
Okay, I'll be waiting
over there.

790
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:42,223
...Starting line.

791
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,625
Start looking 'em over.

792
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,993
30 seconds.

793
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:49,563
Field is on the starting line.

794
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:52,566
They're all lined up.

795
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:54,134
About to start.

796
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,241
Starter has his hand
in the air.

797
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:05,043
And there they go!

798
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:11,181
...good start going
into the first turn.

799
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,016
And over the hill, number 19

800
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:16,652
making a big move.

801
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:19,688
Typical ride there
by Ralph hanson.

802
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,058
And big Billy hunniker.

803
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,592
And number one and 19,

804
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:26,860
they are going
handlebar to handlebar.

805
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:29,162
What a race.

806
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:32,031
And 19 has taken the lead.

807
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,966
Hunniker is running second.

808
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,167
Big Billy with number one,

809
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,203
was a national champion
on his plate.

810
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:41,005
He's having problems
catching the newcomer.

811
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:42,139
There's a medal back there.

812
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:45,275
God, that number 19.
He's out of sight.

813
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,944
No, he isn't.
He's right over there.

814
00:42:47,946 --> 00:42:49,512
Here they come.

815
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:52,098
Who is he anyway?

816
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,649
I don't know, but big Billy's
gonna take him in the final.

817
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:55,050
How do you know he's gonna?

818
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,102
'Cause he happens to be

819
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:59,153
the best amateur rider
in the country, dummy.

820
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:05,192
Here they come around.
19's still in the lead.

821
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:06,259
Coming down
towards the checkered flag.

822
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:09,962
And number 19 wins it.

823
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:11,897
Nerd. Nerd won it.

824
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:15,033
Number 19. Nordlinger.

825
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,142
Wow, you were wonderful.

826
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,143
Hey, does everybody here
know my good buddy,

827
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:28,144
big Billy hunniker?

828
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:31,013
<i>And Mrs. Big Billy hunniker.</i>

829
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:32,214
Well, they do now.

830
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:33,215
Nice form, boy. Wow.

831
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:35,584
You were great.

832
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:37,152
Beats the hell out of me
how you done it, though.

833
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:39,087
Yeah, come on, nerd. Tell us.

834
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:40,254
<i>How'd you do it?</i>

835
00:43:40,256 --> 00:43:41,555
<i>How did you do it?</i>

836
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:43,990
Tell me.

837
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:46,559
Well, I-I just...

838
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:48,127
don't go away.
I'll be right back, okay?

839
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:50,696
Wonderful.

840
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,331
Max?

841
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,966
Listen, kid.

842
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,600
This is the first
of a lot of wins for you,

843
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:57,968
so a word of advice.

844
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,235
When someone asks you
how you did it,

845
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:02,671
just say,
"that's my little secret."

846
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,207
Okay.

847
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,943
But how... how did I do it?

848
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,044
That's my little secret.

849
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:12,279
Just don't ever do it
without me.

850
00:44:47,249 --> 00:44:49,249
Hi.

851
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:51,084
It's only dear old dads.

852
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,151
You wish.

853
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:53,652
Well, it's not my wish.

854
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:55,153
It's your wish.

855
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:56,921
But since your very wish
is my command,

856
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:59,890
I'm gonna give it one more try.

857
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:02,125
Toby, you think your mother's
gonna be home tonight,

858
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:03,126
by any chance?

859
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,894
Yeah, but not to you, I bet.

860
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:07,363
Why?
Well, it's very discouraging.

861
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:10,966
Now she'll probably end up
marrying boring Larry binder.

862
00:45:10,968 --> 00:45:13,068
What's a boring Larry binder?

863
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,036
Um, my mom's tennis teacher.

864
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:17,204
You mean
I'm not the only contender?

865
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:20,941
Gee, if it's just any old father
you'd sell your soul for...

866
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,042
Well, it isn't.

867
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:23,276
Your my first choice.

868
00:45:23,278 --> 00:45:25,211
That's a relief.

869
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:27,145
Toby, do you think
you could keep your mother

870
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:29,248
really busy
for the rest of the day?

871
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,249
Why?

872
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:32,317
Just trust me, okay?

873
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,152
Okay? Okay. Okay.

874
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:37,688
Weird about two things.

875
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,089
The way they come and go.

876
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,190
Oh, it's weird, all right.

877
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,392
Three hours and $25 later.

878
00:45:42,394 --> 00:45:44,210
Sorry.

879
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:46,027
It just suddenly got better
again.

880
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,218
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong house.

881
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,320
I didn't authorize any of this.

882
00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:15,356
Penny hart, 1723 Tobias street?

883
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:16,957
I hope you're not mad at me.

884
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:18,158
I don't understand.

885
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,094
Well, I wanted to do something
really nice

886
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:22,862
so you wouldn't think
I was such a terrible guy.

887
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:26,165
Well, you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

888
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,866
I can't accept this.

889
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,335
Oh, please. The kids'll
really enjoy the equipment.

890
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:33,304
And it's gonna make me feel
very warm inside.

891
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:35,172
<i>Look, mom,</i>

892
00:46:35,174 --> 00:46:37,373
grass, so we don't have
to sit in the dirt anymore.

893
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:42,077
I'm really very touched.

894
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,046
Of course, I've completely
depleted my savings account,

895
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:48,349
but Toby and tremaine and
consuela are wonderful people.

896
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:52,419
<i>And oh, what the heck.</i>

897
00:46:54,489 --> 00:47:00,358
So between managing
the nordlinger boy and Stella,

898
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,960
I'm perpetually on the run,
as you can imagine.

899
00:47:02,962 --> 00:47:04,861
I don't have to imagine.

900
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,195
I can tell by looking at you.

901
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:08,130
Don't you ever look
in the mirror when you shave?

902
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:10,298
Not if I can help it.

903
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:13,968
Take tonight.

904
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,403
Tonight's a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.

905
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,505
Stand free. Who needs it?

906
00:47:18,507 --> 00:47:20,406
<i>Believe me, penn.</i>

907
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:22,408
<i>My life isn't my ow.</i>

908
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,176
And on top of everything else

909
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,244
is my real estate
responsibilities,

910
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,212
which are considerable.

911
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:30,948
Some landlords will allow
a place to go to hell

912
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,216
in a trash can, but not me.

913
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:36,352
Constant repairs,
constant maintenance,

914
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,220
constant outlays
of time and money.

915
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,456
I'll bet.

916
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,191
And then there's
the little old ladies

917
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,226
who insist on keeping
their pets

918
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,994
and the young, married couples

919
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,295
who insist on keeping
their kids.

920
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,297
Not that I've got anything
against kids.

921
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,166
But some landlords feel
it's rough enough

922
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:54,034
taking care of a place
these days

923
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:57,103
without them thumping
and bumping around,

924
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,338
and playing handball
on your walls at all hours,

925
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,008
and putting their mangy little
hands on your fresh paint.

926
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,111
Plus, the whining
and the wailing all night.

927
00:48:06,113 --> 00:48:07,479
And at the crack of dawn
in the morning

928
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:10,015
before you've had your coffee,

929
00:48:10,016 --> 00:48:12,550
they'll ring your bell with the
most insipid, stupid questions

930
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,518
that you never have
an answer to.

931
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,152
<i>It could drive you nuts.</i>

932
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:18,320
Is that how you really feel
about kids?

933
00:48:18,322 --> 00:48:21,388
Well, sometimes.

934
00:48:23,592 --> 00:48:25,358
Me too.

935
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,193
Sometimes.

936
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:51,633
Everybody in the granite lounge
at 10:45 am sharp,

937
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:52,800
and that means sharp.

938
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,201
We've got a heavy body count.

939
00:50:54,203 --> 00:50:55,652
And, Stella, I still don't know

940
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,102
if the number one groupie
is coming or not.

941
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,270
Her parents won't let her.

942
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,471
What do you need her for?

943
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,472
Companionship.

944
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,806
Don't worry about it,
sweetheart.

945
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,240
I'll find somebody for you.
Keep you company.

946
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:04,374
Somebody you can rap with. Dig?

947
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:06,075
Wait a second.
Max is coming, right?

948
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:07,577
Right.

949
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:09,078
<i>Aha. Speak of the devil.</i>

950
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,081
Greg weems, I want you to meet
Max devlin.

951
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,615
The svengali manager.

952
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,216
Now him you gotta take
very good care of

953
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:17,218
because this dippy chick
doesn't sing a note

954
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,619
unless he's practically
in her pocket.

955
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,120
Hey-hey, right on, eh?

956
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,121
<i>Stella, you're on.</i>

957
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,355
Come here.

958
00:51:22,357 --> 00:51:24,623
Listen to me, carefully. Yeah.

959
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,491
I'm going out front
to watch you from there.

960
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:29,227
With that crowd,
timing is everything.

961
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:31,229
So don't start to sing

962
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:33,097
until I give you the cue
from the audience.

963
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:34,098
Is that clear?

964
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,232
Okay. It's clear.

965
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:37,434
Great.

966
00:51:37,436 --> 00:51:39,369
Wish me luck.

967
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:49,411
<i>Okay, here's what you've been</i>
<i>waiting for.</i>

968
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:52,313
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Stella summers.</i>

969
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:11,631
Come on, Stella!

970
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:21,606
Okay, Stella!

971
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:23,507
Knock 'em in the aisles!

972
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:36,484
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶

973
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:40,287
¶ saying what I need ¶

974
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:42,589
¶ when I know that it means ¶

975
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:46,459
¶ there's no you ¶

976
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:51,163
¶ I've never loved ¶

977
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:54,633
¶ and been so sure of it ¶

978
00:52:54,635 --> 00:53:00,337
¶ now I know we both have
to choose ¶

979
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:06,575
¶ oh, you say friends,
and I say that's not enough ¶

980
00:53:06,577 --> 00:53:09,144
¶ give it up ¶

981
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:14,915
¶ oh, I say love is,
but it is just too much ¶

982
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,216
¶ for you to touch ¶

983
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:20,152
¶ oh-ohh ¶

984
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:26,391
bye. Bye.

985
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:28,459
Max.

986
00:53:32,898 --> 00:53:34,564
Thank you.

987
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:57,384
What's wrong, pal?
No good without your coach, huh?

988
00:53:57,386 --> 00:53:58,918
Can't start it. Want some help?

989
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:04,589
<i>What's the proble? Huh, bu?</i>

990
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,824
<i>Come o. Kick it over, pa.</i>

991
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:10,293
Start it up.
Come on. Get it started.

992
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:11,627
<i>Wel.</i>

993
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:30,809
Come on!

994
00:54:31,845 --> 00:54:33,277
We gotta take you.

995
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:33,630
¶ Oh, you say friends,
and I say that's not enough ¶

996
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:35,565
¶ give it up ¶

997
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:39,468
¶ oh, I say love is
but it's not enough ¶

998
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,936
<i>Max!</i>

999
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,270
<i>Max!</i>

1000
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,404
<i>¶ For you to touch ¶</i>

1001
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:46,907
<i>¶ oh-ohh ¶</i>

1002
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,609
hey, you, get your hands
off that rope.

1003
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:52,011
¶ Any fool could see ¶

1004
00:55:52,013 --> 00:55:53,812
what did you do that for?

1005
00:55:53,814 --> 00:55:54,896
What are you, crazy?

1006
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:55,979
I-I was just trying
to save your life.

1007
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:56,981
Save my life?

1008
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:58,349
<i>What, by killing me?</i>

1009
00:55:58,351 --> 00:55:59,383
You're crazy.

1010
00:55:59,385 --> 00:56:01,351
Oh, now I'm sorry,
Jerry, really.

1011
00:56:01,353 --> 00:56:02,618
Just don't... don't touch me.

1012
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,521
You, it's all your fault.

1013
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:09,323
<i>Gosh, Jerry, I'm all wound u.</i>
<i>I'm sorr.</i>

1014
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,642
Tense.

1015
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:13,960
I gotta go and relax
in the men's room.

1016
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:19,364
Barney, Barney,
you son of a... where are you?

1017
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:20,398
There you are, you obnoxious...

1018
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,434
oh, I'm... oh, sorry.

1019
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:24,902
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1020
00:56:24,904 --> 00:56:27,404
We're all show business here,
you know.

1021
00:56:27,406 --> 00:56:28,471
That's right.

1022
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:40,013
You harboring
some kind of death wish, Max?

1023
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:41,414
No, but you are.

1024
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,848
You're lucky you're dead, man,

1025
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:43,982
or so help me,

1026
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,049
<i>you would be.</i>

1027
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:47,029
You're getting angry, Max.

1028
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,008
<i>You're darn right I am.</i>

1029
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:50,987
Don't you ever, ever try
a stunt like that on me again.

1030
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,889
Just trying
to get your attention.

1031
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,024
Well, next time, try tapping me
on the shoulder.

1032
00:56:55,026 --> 00:56:58,494
What about my contracts?

1033
00:56:58,496 --> 00:57:00,796
So that's what this is
all about.

1034
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:03,899
Yes. My associates
are getting a little itchy.

1035
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:05,567
<i>I don't care.</i>

1036
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:08,836
I got until midnight, may 15th.

1037
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:10,354
That's our deal.

1038
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:11,871
I'm telling you,
I'm trying to get these people

1039
00:57:11,874 --> 00:57:12,873
so hooked on me,
they'll sign anything.

1040
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:15,109
That takes time.

1041
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,344
Now if I go too fast, I'm liable
to blow the whole deal.

1042
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:20,613
I like your style, Max.

1043
00:57:20,615 --> 00:57:24,016
You're a devious fellow.

1044
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:33,791
Who's that?

1045
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:35,959
<i>Oh, hi, maxy. Come in.</i>

1046
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:41,396
What's that? Let me see.

1047
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:46,300
"Gentlemen, I hereby
engage you to be

1048
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:48,568
"my sole personal manager
for an indefinite period..."

1049
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,802
And stuff and stuff...

1050
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:51,470
Hey, what is this?

1051
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:53,605
<i>Well, now that you'e</i>
<i>such a big hi,</i>

1052
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,506
I thought
that it would be a good idea

1053
00:57:55,508 --> 00:57:57,908
for us to enter into
a business-like arrangement.

1054
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,075
That's all.

1055
00:57:59,077 --> 00:58:00,576
Well, we have a business-like
arrangement.

1056
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:02,144
I mean, you get 20%
of everything I make.

1057
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,513
Isn't that business-like?

1058
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,881
But we don't have anything
officially on paper.

1059
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,583
Eh, it doesn't matter.
You get the bread anyhow.

1060
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,218
What difference does it make?

1061
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,955
Stella, suppose I decided
not to show up some time

1062
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,657
and without my miracle,
you couldn't sing.

1063
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,625
Well, I don't know.

1064
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:20,593
Then you get 20% of nothing.

1065
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:22,928
I mean, why would you do
a dumb thing like that?

1066
00:58:37,977 --> 00:58:39,876
Listen, how'd you find us?

1067
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:41,544
There must be
a hundred million people here.

1068
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,112
Well, I told you this morning.

1069
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:45,114
Intuition.

1070
00:58:45,116 --> 00:58:46,915
Yeah, well, I wish
your intuition told you

1071
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:48,516
to bring your swimming trunks.

1072
00:58:48,518 --> 00:58:49,884
We coulda gone in.

1073
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:51,886
Well, I'm still glad
you came anyways.

1074
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:52,920
I missed ya.

1075
00:58:52,922 --> 00:58:54,121
Well, it's the first day off

1076
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:55,922
we've had in quite some time.

1077
00:58:55,924 --> 00:58:58,057
Yeah, well,
my mom missed you too.

1078
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:59,558
Yeah?

1079
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,293
So you still want me
to be your dad, huh?

1080
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,228
Yeah. Don't you wanna be?

1081
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,030
Well, of course I do,
Toby, you know that.

1082
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:09,066
But a guy like me's gotta think
pretty carefully

1083
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:10,567
before he gives up his freedom

1084
00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:13,102
and takes on the responsibility
of a family.

1085
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,087
So on and so forth.

1086
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,071
I mean, it's, like, you're gonna
get me for a father,

1087
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:18,973
but what am I gonna get
from you?

1088
00:59:18,975 --> 00:59:20,107
I don't know. What do you want?

1089
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:21,575
Well, what do you got?

1090
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:25,545
Um, some baseball cards,
a cassette deck...

1091
00:59:25,547 --> 00:59:26,879
it doesn't work too good,
but...

1092
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:28,247
Never mind, keep going.

1093
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:29,614
I think we can come
to an agreement here.

1094
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,316
Okay, let me think.

1095
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,085
Uh, I got a<i> guinness book</i>
<i>of world records.</i>

1096
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:35,286
Wow, that's great.

1097
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,889
Um, let me see,
a rock collection...

1098
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:40,123
I always wanted one of those.

1099
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:44,326
Um, a real pair of handcuffs
with the key...

1100
00:59:44,328 --> 00:59:45,894
Oh, a key.

1101
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:48,897
Um, let me think,
I got some more stuff.

1102
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:50,932
Yeah.
A rubber-coated hard ball...

1103
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:54,302
Oh, wow. Um, one more. Wait.

1104
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:57,605
Oh, yeah,
and two packs of red hots.

1105
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:59,607
You know, those are
those little cinnamon candies.

1106
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:00,608
Oh, yummy, yeah, yeah.

1107
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,843
That's enough, enough.

1108
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:03,077
Okay, now listen,
how does this sound?

1109
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:05,079
"I, the undersigned..."

1110
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,998
that's you.

1111
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,916
"Agree to surrender
my card collection,

1112
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:12,718
"my cassette deck, my soul,

1113
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,686
"my guinness book

1114
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:16,888
"two packages of red hots,

1115
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,123
in return for which..."

1116
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,691
I'll marry your mom,

1117
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:22,259
and I'll be your dad, okay?

1118
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:23,627
Here, now sign here.
Right there.

1119
01:00:23,629 --> 01:00:24,961
Tricky.

1120
01:00:24,963 --> 01:00:28,364
Thanks.

1121
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:31,200
You didn't put your part yet.

1122
01:00:31,202 --> 01:00:34,136
No flies on him either.

1123
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:37,005
"Marry mom..."

1124
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:38,306
Now will you sign?

1125
01:00:38,308 --> 01:00:42,376
Sure.
As soon as you marry my mother.

1126
01:00:42,378 --> 01:00:47,613
He has potential.

1127
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:50,916
Six weeks ago,
you were nowhere on this planet.

1128
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:51,983
And now look at you.

1129
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,384
King of the castle
among your peers

1130
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:55,185
and peerless
among your competitors.

1131
01:00:55,187 --> 01:00:56,886
Thanks to me.

1132
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:58,153
Thanks to you is right, Max.

1133
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,355
No, no, don't get me wrong now.

1134
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:00,888
I'm not looking
for your thanks.

1135
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,123
Thanks aren't important.
It's your loyalty.

1136
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,991
Your loyalty is
what's important.

1137
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:06,192
You have that.

1138
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:07,393
Yeah, well, you say that now,

1139
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:09,661
but you'll forgive a touch
of the cynic.

1140
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:12,130
I've seen it happen
time and again.

1141
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,932
An older guy like me
gives his all

1142
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:16,366
to a young punk like you.

1143
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,134
Good faith on both sides,
you understand.

1144
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:20,102
And when the kid makes it
to the top,

1145
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:22,404
well, because there was nothing
legally binding

1146
01:01:22,406 --> 01:01:23,972
<i>between 'em...</i>

1147
01:01:23,974 --> 01:01:26,374
Max, you got something
for me to sign,

1148
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:27,975
I'll be more than happy
to sign it.

1149
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:29,409
Now, Max, now.

1150
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:30,410
Get lost.

1151
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:32,178
Hmm?

1152
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,947
I was just saying how easy
it would be to get lost

1153
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:36,214
in a big crowd like this.

1154
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:38,216
Here. It's a standard
trainer-rider agreement.

1155
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:39,250
Sign right here.

1156
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:49,659
Max, sole is spelled s-o-l-e,
not s-o-u-l.

1157
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:57,299
Well, Max,
you just blew it again.

1158
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:09,444
<i>Okay, hold onto this!</i>

1159
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,060
Is that how you really feel
about children?

1160
01:02:27,062 --> 01:02:28,961
Ah, well, you know, sometimes.

1161
01:02:28,963 --> 01:02:29,963
<i>Yeah, I know. Sometimes.</i>

1162
01:02:29,964 --> 01:02:31,129
Hold on.

1163
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:34,232
Max, everybody's having
a wonderful time.

1164
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:37,235
Yeah, well, that makes me
feel really happy.

1165
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:40,171
You could stay
as long as you want to.

1166
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,739
Where are you going?

1167
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,306
They extended the concert tour
for another day

1168
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:45,409
so I gotta leave now.

1169
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:47,878
But Toby will be crushed.

1170
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,145
And what about dinner?

1171
01:02:49,147 --> 01:02:50,980
I don't know why
I put up with you.

1172
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:52,948
Since I'm such a good kisser.

1173
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,316
That so, huh?

1174
01:02:56,186 --> 01:02:59,887
Where is he going?

1175
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:01,421
Bad news. He has to leave.

1176
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:03,890
But... but now?

1177
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:04,991
He promised to take me
to the carnival

1178
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:07,226
right after swimming.

1179
01:03:07,228 --> 01:03:09,127
I know. I know.

1180
01:03:09,129 --> 01:03:10,128
<i>He promised!</i>

1181
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:12,396
Now you see him, now you don't.

1182
01:03:12,398 --> 01:03:15,231
What good of a person is that?

1183
01:03:32,248 --> 01:03:35,349
That's that.

1184
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:38,452
19 cities in 21 days
and a knockout every time.

1185
01:03:38,454 --> 01:03:40,454
You're wonderful.

1186
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:49,928
"Every night
I make love to 25,000 people.

1187
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,230
And then I go home alone."

1188
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:57,401
Janis joplin, 1970.

1189
01:03:57,403 --> 01:03:58,402
Stella summers,

1190
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:01,004
<i>1981.</i>

1191
01:04:01,006 --> 01:04:05,474
Hey, maxy,
would you do me a favor?

1192
01:04:05,476 --> 01:04:07,209
Lend me a dime?

1193
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,178
And I'm gonna be alone, okay?

1194
01:04:28,029 --> 01:04:29,928
Operator?

1195
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,398
This is collect
to anybody who'll answer.

1196
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,199
I'm Stephanie pepper.

1197
01:04:38,904 --> 01:04:39,903
The number you have reached

1198
01:04:39,905 --> 01:04:41,137
is not in service at this time.

1199
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,572
Ah, where are you?

1200
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:44,006
Please make sure
you have dialed correctly.

1201
01:04:44,008 --> 01:04:46,141
This is a recording.

1202
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:53,113
<i>Stephanie pepper?</i>

1203
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,286
What's the matter?

1204
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,388
Homesick for topanga canyon?

1205
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,890
No.

1206
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:08,426
Borough park, Brooklyn.

1207
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:15,998
Nice middle class family
in New York.

1208
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:20,135
And nothing
but classical music at home

1209
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:21,536
and no TV.

1210
01:05:21,538 --> 01:05:24,071
Right.

1211
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:30,109
Plus, every time I said
I wanna become a star,

1212
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,377
they'd say that's no kind
of life for anybody to lead.

1213
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:35,980
My parents are so square.

1214
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,515
They were right about that,
you know.

1215
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,120
<i>I-I don't know.</i>

1216
01:05:44,122 --> 01:05:46,122
<i>I guess they didn't want</i>
<i>to see me get hurt.</i>

1217
01:05:46,124 --> 01:05:47,189
Yeah.

1218
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:50,825
I mean,
they probably didn't think

1219
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:52,392
I was good enough to make it,
you know.

1220
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:58,065
But I always had
this funny feeling...

1221
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:01,267
That I was.

1222
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:04,136
That I could.

1223
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:05,437
And I did.

1224
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,439
Not without me.

1225
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:10,442
I know, maxy, I know.

1226
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,277
And I'm really grateful
to you, I am.

1227
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:17,181
Now's the time, Max.

1228
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:19,249
I'm not so sure
I did you any favors.

1229
01:06:32,995 --> 01:06:34,928
Look, Uncle Max!

1230
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,229
Uncle Max!

1231
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:37,997
Hi! Hi.

1232
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:39,999
Listen, I've got to see Toby.
Hi, children.

1233
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,517
No!

1234
01:06:41,518 --> 01:06:43,034
<i>Oh, yeah, you're going to play.</i>

1235
01:06:43,037 --> 01:06:44,336
<i>Go and play rhythm, rhythm.</i>

1236
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:47,438
Or play hide and seek,
and wolf will be it.

1237
01:06:49,141 --> 01:06:50,473
Come on.

1238
01:06:50,475 --> 01:06:52,208
Okay, Marie.

1239
01:06:54,412 --> 01:06:56,111
I got here as soon as possible.

1240
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,378
Yeah? What for?

1241
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,080
Well, I'm ready
to propose to your mother.

1242
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,081
Where is she?

1243
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,415
Inside, but don't bother.

1244
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,216
The deal's off.

1245
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:04,317
Come here.

1246
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,552
Look, you can keep
the rock collection

1247
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:08,020
and the handcuffs.

1248
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,321
And forget about the red hots.

1249
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:11,523
I never really cared
for them anyway.

1250
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:13,424
That part of the deal
isn't what bothers me.

1251
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:14,625
Well, what part does?

1252
01:07:14,627 --> 01:07:17,527
The you part.
I think I'd rather have binder.

1253
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:19,228
You're not so reliable.

1254
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,630
Well, you're a fine one
to talk, Toby.

1255
01:07:21,632 --> 01:07:23,498
<i>If you don't want e</i>
<i>for a fathe,</i>

1256
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,433
then how am I gonna marry
your mother?

1257
01:07:25,435 --> 01:07:28,269
Which is something
I really want to do.

1258
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:29,570
Very simple.

1259
01:07:29,572 --> 01:07:32,239
Just ask me.

1260
01:07:32,241 --> 01:07:35,242
I think it's my decision,
not his, isn't it?

1261
01:07:35,244 --> 01:07:36,476
Don't you want a father

1262
01:07:36,478 --> 01:07:38,344
who's gonna make your mother
very happy?

1263
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,511
Binder's better.

1264
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,346
You can count on him.

1265
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,815
Toby, binder is boring.

1266
01:07:43,817 --> 01:07:46,384
Binder took me
to the carnival Sunday.

1267
01:07:46,386 --> 01:07:48,252
Yeah, and how was it?

1268
01:07:48,254 --> 01:07:51,221
Boring.

1269
01:07:51,223 --> 01:07:52,355
Toby, when your mother and I
are married,

1270
01:07:52,357 --> 01:07:54,323
you'll be able
to count on me too.

1271
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:56,091
I promise.

1272
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:59,094
Okay, but since you don't like
the red hots,

1273
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:01,229
well, I guess
I'll keep 'em anyway.

1274
01:08:01,231 --> 01:08:02,430
That's fair.

1275
01:08:08,804 --> 01:08:10,403
Mind if I join you?

1276
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:12,438
What are you doing here?

1277
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,540
I've never been to the grammys.

1278
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:18,143
Be my guest.

1279
01:08:18,145 --> 01:08:19,577
Goody for me.

1280
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:20,811
Goody for you too.

1281
01:08:20,813 --> 01:08:23,146
Congratulations
on your engagement.

1282
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:24,147
<i>When's the happy day?</i>

1283
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:25,832
Saturday.

1284
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,516
Sandwiched in between
the first and second motos.

1285
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,619
And after that,
Stella's concert

1286
01:08:29,621 --> 01:08:31,087
at the music center.

1287
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:33,789
Well, it's gonna be very busy.

1288
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:36,324
The 15th?

1289
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:38,292
You're cutting it
a little close, aren't you?

1290
01:08:38,294 --> 01:08:39,793
I had no choice in the matter.

1291
01:08:39,795 --> 01:08:41,227
It was her decision.

1292
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:44,096
Well, at least
you'll have saved yourself.

1293
01:08:44,098 --> 01:08:45,230
Yeah.

1294
01:08:45,232 --> 01:08:47,799
You don't look too happy
about it.

1295
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:49,801
Nobody said I had to enjoy it.

1296
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:52,303
Beats level four.

1297
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,372
But your hair looks nice.

1298
01:08:55,374 --> 01:08:58,407
Thank you.

1299
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:43,901
Jerry!

1300
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:45,518
Get me away from them!
Get me away from them!

1301
01:09:45,521 --> 01:09:47,153
I want them away from me!

1302
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:55,827
And the winner is...

1303
01:09:57,931 --> 01:09:59,897
<i>Any fool could see,</i>
Stella summers.

1304
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,782
Thank you.

1305
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,850
Winning this grammy
is a great honor.

1306
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:27,286
And to those who are not up here
with me now

1307
01:10:27,288 --> 01:10:28,287
to share it with me,

1308
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:31,523
Max devlin, my manager,

1309
01:10:31,525 --> 01:10:34,392
<i>Jerry nadler of blizzard,</i>

1310
01:10:34,394 --> 01:10:37,628
I have only this to say.

1311
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:41,298
It was a long, hard pull, man.

1312
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,433
And I've got nobody
to thank but myself.

1313
01:10:55,312 --> 01:10:58,446
My God, she's a monster.

1314
01:10:58,448 --> 01:11:00,848
She's fabulous, sweetheart.

1315
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:02,549
It's just the way we like 'em.

1316
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:05,485
One down, two to go.

1317
01:11:26,307 --> 01:11:28,240
Come on. Fast, fast.

1318
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,375
This is a specialty precaution
indemnification thing

1319
01:11:30,377 --> 01:11:32,343
in case of an accident,
duh-duh-duh-duh...

1320
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:34,478
I, the undersigned,
declare that my trainer,

1321
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,012
Max devlin,
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...

1322
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:37,980
Will take sole responsibility
for me.

1323
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:39,665
Uh, here, now you sign it.

1324
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:41,349
Isn't it a little late
in the game for this, Max?

1325
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:42,551
Well, better late than never.

1326
01:11:42,553 --> 01:11:46,321
<i>Come on. Sign it.</i>

1327
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,423
Max, your spelling
is atrocious.

1328
01:11:49,425 --> 01:11:51,358
I told you, "sole" is s-o-l-e.

1329
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,460
Sign it now.
I'll correct it later.

1330
01:11:53,462 --> 01:11:57,030
Yeah. All right.

1331
01:11:57,032 --> 01:12:00,967
Ladders coming
into the positions now

1332
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:03,869
for the feature event
of the afternoon.

1333
01:12:05,806 --> 01:12:08,540
Fans waiting to see
if nerve nordlinger can keep

1334
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:10,959
his streak intact.

1335
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,377
Most of the fans are here
to watch the rematch

1336
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,012
between nordlinger
and hunniker.

1337
01:12:23,388 --> 01:12:26,355
And there they go. They're off.

1338
01:12:26,357 --> 01:12:27,889
Feature race of the afternoon.

1339
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:31,025
And immediately, number one,
big Billy hunniker,

1340
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:33,360
along with nerve nordlinger,

1341
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:36,029
and number nine Tracy also
in there.

1342
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:41,033
A three-way race for the lead.

1343
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:44,803
Just make it fast and safe.

1344
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:46,070
Why bother with safe?

1345
01:12:46,072 --> 01:12:47,938
You already have him
down on paper.

1346
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,407
'Cause I don't want him
to kill himself.

1347
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:53,576
And they're coming
down that hill in good shape.

1348
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,581
Looks like somebody there had
a primary chain lock up on him.

1349
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,583
Here comes hunniker
on the inside.

1350
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,884
Oh, it's hunniker.

1351
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:05,553
Two down and one to go.

1352
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:07,354
I didn't think
it was gonna be like that.

1353
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:08,955
What did you expect?

1354
01:13:08,957 --> 01:13:11,324
I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.

1355
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:10,046
<i>Beloved family and friends,</i>

By the power vested in me

1374
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,184
by the laws of the state
of California,

1375
01:14:59,186 --> 01:15:01,486
I now pronounce you

Hello!

1378
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:22,205
Well, son, did you forget
about your agreement

1379
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:24,507
with dear, old dad?

1380
01:15:26,444 --> 01:15:29,478
But I get to keep
the red hots, okay?

1381
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,581
Well... Okay.

1382
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,526
Mom, I gotta talk
to you for a second.

1383
01:15:47,528 --> 01:15:48,560
Sure, what?

1384
01:15:48,562 --> 01:15:50,828
Over here.

1385
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,463
Excuse me.

1386
01:15:58,002 --> 01:16:00,135
Toby, what is so important

1387
01:16:00,137 --> 01:16:01,636
that you had to drag me
away from everybody?

1388
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:03,604
It's something about Max.

1389
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:05,038
I don't know what it is,

1390
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,573
but I just don't seem
to like him anymore.

1391
01:16:07,575 --> 01:16:09,074
You're just jealous.

1392
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:11,944
It's natural, of course.

1393
01:16:11,945 --> 01:16:14,813
No, it's something really weird
and bad about Max.

1394
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:16,648
In fact, I hate Max!

1395
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:18,549
Shh.

1396
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:20,517
You should have thought
of that before.

1397
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:22,252
Now shape up. Go play.

1398
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:25,655
Some swell marriage
we're gonna have

1399
01:16:25,657 --> 01:16:26,856
if he hates me.

1400
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:29,058
He'll be impossible
to live with.

1401
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,126
You don't have
to worry about that.

1402
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:34,595
Slightest hint
to agent hargraves,

1403
01:16:34,597 --> 01:16:36,530
and it's all over.

1404
01:16:36,532 --> 01:16:38,798
Wanna synchronize your watch?

1405
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,200
They all signed.

1406
01:16:41,202 --> 01:16:42,968
I'm free.

1407
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,237
Aren't I?

1408
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,239
Yes, you are.

1409
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:51,041
But by midnight,
they belong to me.

1410
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:52,942
Not until the natural end
of their lives,

1411
01:16:52,944 --> 01:16:53,943
that's what you said.

1412
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:57,046
Point of fact... I lied.

1413
01:16:57,048 --> 01:16:59,214
<i>I need them now.</i>

1414
01:16:59,216 --> 01:17:02,150
Oh, no, Barney. Please.

1415
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:04,585
I couldn't have done it
if I'd known that.

1416
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:07,187
He's a great kid.
They're all great kids.

1417
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,690
But that kid...
kill him, and you kill her!

1418
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:14,393
Unfortunately, her soul
does not belong to me.

1419
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:17,195
You win some, you lose some.

1420
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:20,264
But then again, you have

1421
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:24,401
<i>your precious life.</i>

1422
01:17:29,641 --> 01:17:30,740
Okay, Barney.

1423
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:39,114
I know you're here.

1424
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:43,418
Let me see your rotten,
lying, deceitful face now

1425
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:46,087
when I burn your contracts.

1426
01:17:46,089 --> 01:17:47,354
<i>Burn those contracts,</i>

1427
01:17:47,356 --> 01:17:53,659
and eternal damnation is yours.

1428
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:58,263
<i>You'll know the unmitigating</i>
<i>pain and horror</i>

1429
01:17:58,265 --> 01:18:02,233
of limbs being torn
from their sockets...

1430
01:18:02,235 --> 01:18:06,203
your limbs, your sockets!

1431
01:18:06,205 --> 01:18:11,907
You'll feel pain
you never imagined in life.

1432
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:14,209
Yours. Forever.

1433
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:18,012
<i>Flesh you'll smell burning.</i>

1434
01:18:18,014 --> 01:18:21,248
Your flesh rotting.

1435
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,149
Forever.

1436
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:25,151
You'll never get these kids.

1437
01:18:25,153 --> 01:18:27,353
Never.

1438
01:18:27,355 --> 01:18:30,422
<i>Max.</i>

1439
01:18:35,061 --> 01:18:37,361
Max.

1440
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:39,096
Max?

1441
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:43,199
Are you all right?

1442
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:46,135
I have to go now.

1443
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:49,204
Max, it's our wedding day.

1444
01:18:53,476 --> 01:18:56,076
There are people who need me.

1445
01:18:57,446 --> 01:19:00,947
I promise to come back
as soon as I can.

1446
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,219
<i>Max.</i>

1447
01:19:24,336 --> 01:19:26,369
Well, anyways, to answer
your question,

1448
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:29,038
big Billy hunniker is not only
a sweetheart of a guy,

1449
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,507
he's also one of the truly great
mx racers of all time.

1450
01:19:36,113 --> 01:19:38,413
But can he beat you out in the
second moto here today, nerve?

1451
01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:40,248
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1452
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,050
Especially if my trainer
doesn't show up.

1453
01:19:55,964 --> 01:19:58,030
So the winner
of the 1980 nationals

1454
01:19:58,032 --> 01:19:59,531
here in anaheim
is big Billy hunniker.

1455
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:03,201
<i>As of yet, no word from medics</i>
<i>as to the severity</i>

1456
01:20:03,203 --> 01:20:06,037
of injuries sustained
to nerve nordlinger.

1457
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:08,539
<i>Max!</i>

1458
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,007
Oh, Max, what'd you miss!

1459
01:20:10,009 --> 01:20:11,508
How'd it happen?

1460
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,142
<i>I tripped.</i> On your bike?

1461
01:20:13,144 --> 01:20:15,477
No, I tripped before the moto
even began.

1462
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:17,111
Over... over her.

1463
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:20,347
<i>She didn't see me coming,</i>
<i>though, I mean...</i>

1464
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:25,184
She... I tripped over her
and fell.

1465
01:20:25,186 --> 01:20:27,486
Who are you?

1466
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:33,024
We have them here too,
you know.

1467
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:35,092
We?

1468
01:20:37,262 --> 01:20:40,096
Where do you come from?

1469
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:43,264
You're not going
to take him away now,

1470
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:45,032
are you, your holiness?

1471
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:48,402
Oh, no, he's much too young
to die.

1472
01:20:56,078 --> 01:20:58,078
So am I.

1473
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,984
I hope you're not mad at me

1474
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,386
for quitting the racing scene
like that.

1475
01:21:07,388 --> 01:21:09,187
I mean, after all you've done
for me.

1476
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:10,454
Oh, don't be silly.

1477
01:21:10,456 --> 01:21:12,422
I was thinking
of moving on anyway.

1478
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:14,957
I'm gonna see you
again, aren't I?

1479
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:18,427
I don't think so.

1480
01:21:18,429 --> 01:21:21,163
I'm gonna be going
a long ways away.

1481
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:24,232
Well, hey, maybe I can see you
wherever you're going.

1482
01:21:24,234 --> 01:21:25,834
No way.

1483
01:21:25,835 --> 01:21:27,515
I don't ever wanna see you
where I'm going.

1484
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:33,940
I mean... that everybody has
their own thing

1485
01:21:33,942 --> 01:21:36,142
to do in life, right?

1486
01:21:39,113 --> 01:21:40,412
Well, now, I gotta go to places

1487
01:21:40,414 --> 01:21:44,015
that are really horrible.

1488
01:21:44,017 --> 01:21:47,284
Places that nice young man
like yourself

1489
01:21:47,286 --> 01:21:48,918
should never have to see.

1490
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,419
Okay?

1491
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:53,422
Well, am I at least gonna see
you at the concert tonight?

1492
01:21:53,424 --> 01:21:55,223
No, I don't think so.

1493
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:58,059
I'm gonna be giving up
all my management contracts,

1494
01:21:58,061 --> 01:21:59,527
even Stella's.

1495
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:02,429
I'll see you around then.

1496
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:05,098
Oh, yeah, I'll see you around.

1497
01:22:10,271 --> 01:22:11,336
Maxy!

1498
01:22:11,338 --> 01:22:13,905
Ah, thank you for my parents.

1499
01:22:13,907 --> 01:22:15,273
Thank you. Oh, it's...

1500
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:18,009
listen, Stella, you know
how you seem to be cooling it

1501
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:19,510
on the performing thing
and all?

1502
01:22:19,512 --> 01:22:21,278
Well, I think now
is the perfect time to quit.

1503
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,079
Now?

1504
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:25,247
With my parents out front,
before the concert?

1505
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:27,415
Absolutely. All the more reason.
Max.

1506
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:29,150
You know how you always wondered
how come you could sing

1507
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:30,335
when I was out there

1508
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:31,519
<i>and not otherwise,</i>
<i>and I kept telling you</i>

1509
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:34,088
<i>that I could work miracles,</i>
<i>and you believed me?</i>

1510
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,355
Well, I lied.

1511
01:22:35,357 --> 01:22:37,457
I can't make miracles, Stella.

1512
01:22:37,459 --> 01:22:39,425
And even if I could before,
I can't anymore.

1513
01:22:39,427 --> 01:22:40,926
You're gonna go out there
and die.

1514
01:22:40,928 --> 01:22:42,560
<i>You're gonna fall flat</i>
<i>on your face.</i>

1515
01:22:42,562 --> 01:22:43,561
I am not.

1516
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:45,095
I am not.

1517
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:46,529
Stella,
I'm gonna prove it to you.

1518
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:48,314
I'm gonna walk
around this corner,

1519
01:22:48,315 --> 01:22:50,098
and you try to sing,
and you won't be able to.

1520
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:52,334
Now I'm walking
around the corner, Stella.

1521
01:22:52,336 --> 01:22:53,902
Max.

1522
01:22:53,904 --> 01:22:55,203
Max!

1523
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,990
Come on.

1524
01:22:58,991 --> 01:23:00,541
Jerry and other others,
they always said to me,

1525
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:03,911
said miracles is another word
for confidence.

1526
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:05,178
I don't know why you want
to take my confidence

1527
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,246
away from me now.

1528
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:10,916
<i>You always been so good</i>
<i>to me, Max.</i>

1529
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:14,185
And if ever there was a time
I wanted to be good...

1530
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,056
I don't believe you.

1531
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,158
I'm not gonna let you
do this to me.

1532
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,460
Bye, Stella.

1533
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,028
Have a happy...

1534
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:26,713
Max.

1535
01:23:26,714 --> 01:23:28,834
You know, if I'm gonna fall
on my face, you can watch.

1536
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:33,335
Bye, Stella.

1537
01:23:34,538 --> 01:23:37,138
Bye.

1538
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,074
Max?

1539
01:23:40,076 --> 01:23:42,409
I'm gonna miss you.

1540
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:08,366
Oh, hi. You're back.

1541
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:11,102
Yeah.

1542
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:13,204
Not for long, I'm afraid.

1543
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:15,439
What do you mean?

1544
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:19,342
Uh, look...

1545
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:24,446
At 12:00
I gotta be somewhere else.

1546
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,381
So I guess
I oughta take off now.

1547
01:24:26,383 --> 01:24:29,016
But you'll be back.

1548
01:24:29,018 --> 01:24:30,083
You always come back.

1549
01:24:32,253 --> 01:24:34,052
Not this time, sport.

1550
01:24:35,221 --> 01:24:41,157
Where I'm going is too far away
to come back from.

1551
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:45,261
Uh, I just wanted
to say good-bye.

1552
01:24:45,263 --> 01:24:47,329
You promised.

1553
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:51,532
What's the matter?
Don't I rate a good-bye?

1554
01:24:53,736 --> 01:24:56,136
You know, it really stinks.

1555
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:59,539
Every father I get always goes
away and never comes back.

1556
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:03,209
Are you gonna die on me too?

1557
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:07,446
And what about mom?

1558
01:25:07,448 --> 01:25:09,714
Well, what's she gonna do?

1559
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:12,783
Look, Toby,
your mother's a great lady...

1560
01:25:12,785 --> 01:25:17,787
she'll get along just fine
without me.

1561
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:20,321
No, I won't.

1562
01:25:23,025 --> 01:25:25,125
Toby.

1563
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:31,330
I love you, Max.

1564
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:37,168
How could you possibly love me?

1565
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:40,037
I'm not lovable.

1566
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:43,140
I'm not even nice.

1567
01:25:43,142 --> 01:25:45,275
I'm irresponsible, unreliable,

1568
01:25:45,277 --> 01:25:47,744
you've said so yourself
a million times.

1569
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:51,814
Look, even if we try,
I'll still probably leave you

1570
01:25:51,816 --> 01:25:54,383
without any warning.

1571
01:25:54,385 --> 01:25:56,485
I'm a rotten person.

1572
01:25:56,487 --> 01:26:00,422
The only trouble with you,
Max, is you have no self image.

1573
01:26:00,424 --> 01:26:02,323
You noticed?

1574
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,362
Oh, my God.

1575
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:12,833
I don't believe it.

1576
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:16,570
What is it, Max? What's wrong?

1577
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:18,305
It's me.

1578
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:20,373
I don't believe it.

1579
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:22,575
It's me in the mirror.

1580
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:25,344
I-I don't believe it.

1581
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,646
I won.

1582
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:30,949
I won.

1583
01:26:30,951 --> 01:26:32,450
I won.

1584
01:26:32,452 --> 01:26:33,584
Won what?

1585
01:26:33,586 --> 01:26:36,820
I beat that lousy,
rotten, slimy,

1586
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:37,954
no-good son of a... beat who?

1587
01:26:37,956 --> 01:26:40,356
Barney! I beat Barney!

1588
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:41,890
He had my soul.

1589
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:43,925
Are you all right, Max?

1590
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,961
All right?

1591
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:50,397
I've never been more all right
in my life.

1592
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:51,631
Hello.

1593
01:26:51,633 --> 01:26:54,867
That's the most amazing sight
I've ever seen.

1594
01:26:54,869 --> 01:26:56,268
You're talking crazy, Max.

1595
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,902
Don't... I know it's crazy.

1596
01:26:57,904 --> 01:26:59,637
I know... I know...
I know it sounds crazy,

1597
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:01,905
I know that, but it's so basic.

1598
01:27:01,907 --> 01:27:02,906
It's just so simple.

1599
01:27:02,908 --> 01:27:04,374
It's like it's good and bad.

1600
01:27:04,376 --> 01:27:06,609
And heaven and hell
and God and the devil.

1601
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:09,345
<i>Penny, look, all my life,</i>

1602
01:27:09,347 --> 01:27:10,546
<i>I made wrong choices.</i>

1603
01:27:10,548 --> 01:27:12,247
<i>I made wrong choices!</i>

1604
01:27:12,249 --> 01:27:15,450
But this time I made
the right choice,

1605
01:27:15,452 --> 01:27:16,984
and the devil lost my soul.

1606
01:27:16,986 --> 01:27:18,652
He lost me.

1607
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:21,221
I'm gonna call the doctor.

1608
01:27:21,223 --> 01:27:24,357
No, no, no, please, please,
penny, you have to trust me.

1609
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:25,892
Please, trust me.

1610
01:27:25,893 --> 01:27:27,426
I swear,
I'll explain everything to you.

1611
01:27:27,428 --> 01:27:30,829
But you have to trust me now
because I love you.

1612
01:27:30,831 --> 01:27:33,298
More than life itself.

1613
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,501
And you're not leaving, right?

1614
01:27:36,503 --> 01:27:39,470
I'll never leave you.

1615
01:27:39,472 --> 01:27:42,573
Where's Toby?

1616
01:27:42,575 --> 01:27:43,840
Toby!

1617
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,441
To... come on,
we gotta go to a concert.

1618
01:27:45,443 --> 01:27:47,643
A concert?

1619
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:18,537
Thank you.

1620
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:23,275
Of all the audiences
that I've ever sung for,

1621
01:28:23,277 --> 01:28:25,644
I know you're gonna be
the best.

1622
01:28:25,646 --> 01:28:27,846
Thank you.

1623
01:28:29,349 --> 01:28:31,282
But you're also gonna be
the last.

1624
01:28:32,918 --> 01:28:35,051
Just for a while.
Just for a while.

1625
01:28:36,988 --> 01:28:40,356
You see, a year is a...

1626
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:43,559
A long time
to be away from your family.

1627
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:46,862
And your home.

1628
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:52,066
And no matter how square
you always thought they were,

1629
01:28:52,068 --> 01:28:54,001
really do get to missing them.

1630
01:28:54,003 --> 01:28:56,436
Really get to missing school.

1631
01:28:59,374 --> 01:29:03,442
But now I'm going
to miss all of you.

1632
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:08,813
But most of all,
I'm gonna miss a man

1633
01:29:08,815 --> 01:29:10,881
who...

1634
01:29:12,551 --> 01:29:15,317
It's, you know, it's that thing
that everybody always says.

1635
01:29:17,054 --> 01:29:20,321
Except I really do mean it.

1636
01:29:22,058 --> 01:29:25,826
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

1637
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:38,537
¶ So here I am ¶

1638
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:42,474
¶ alone again ¶

1639
01:29:42,476 --> 01:29:47,945
¶ not all like I thought
that I would be ¶

1640
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:54,050
¶ yes, I lost my way ¶

1641
01:29:54,052 --> 01:30:01,857
¶ seems like yesterday ¶

1642
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:06,628
¶ somebody promised me
the sunshine ¶

1643
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:13,101
<i>¶ somebody promised me</i>
<i>the moon ¶</i>

1644
01:30:13,103 --> 01:30:19,974
¶ somebody told me
there'd be roses and rainbows ¶

1645
01:30:19,976 --> 01:30:25,579
¶ I only hope
they'll get here soon ¶

1646
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:32,051
¶ seems I've been waiting here
forever ¶

1647
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:37,656
¶ thinking that love would come
for free ¶

1648
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:44,062
¶ someone's still waiting
for those roses and rainbows ¶

1649
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:50,067
¶ I hope that someone
won't be me ¶

1650
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:51,568
you see, maxy.

1651
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:01,945
¶ So let go now,
you're on your own ¶

1652
01:31:01,947 --> 01:31:07,049
¶<i> it's okay to be lonely</i>
<i>now and then ¶</i>

1653
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:12,187
¶ open up your eyes ¶

1654
01:31:12,189 --> 01:31:18,525
¶ you are much too wise ¶

1655
01:31:18,527 --> 01:31:22,562
¶ if someone promises
you sunshine ¶

1656
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:28,200
¶ you better know
there'll still be rain ¶

1657
01:31:28,202 --> 01:31:33,672
¶ if someone says they'll bring
you roses and rainbows ¶

1658
01:31:33,674 --> 01:31:39,143
¶ you better take
a look again ¶

1659
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:44,548
¶ you better find out
who you are, girl ¶

1660
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:49,185
¶ before you run
to someone else ¶

1661
01:31:49,187 --> 01:31:54,656
¶ instead of waiting
for those roses and rainbows ¶

1662
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:59,894
¶ you better give them
to yourself ¶

1663

1668
01:32:25,651 --> 01:32:30,954

01:32:30,956 --> 01:32:36,492
¶ and all my days are filled
with roses and rainbows ¶

1670
01:32:36,494 --> 01:32:41,930

1672
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:01,612
