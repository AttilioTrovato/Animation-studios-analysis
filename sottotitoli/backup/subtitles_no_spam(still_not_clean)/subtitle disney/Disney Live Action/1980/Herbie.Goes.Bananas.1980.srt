1
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,621
- Hey, Pete, are you sure
this is the place?

2
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,996
You saw the letter.
This is the place.

3
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:16,266
Don't you think it's a little
funny, I mean, your uncle
giving you this race car?

4
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:18,500
- Sentimental reasons.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:21,270
Would a cracked block
be a sentimental reason?

6
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,080
All we got to lay out is the storage fee.
You got the money.

7
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,008
I got the money.

8
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:29,612
All finished!

9
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:32,248
- Shine?
- No, thanks.

10
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:36,659
You are personally connected
to a Puerto Vallartan.
Show you plenty good time!

11
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,892
- What do you think, Pete?
- It's not in the budget.
No, thanks, son.

12
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:43,232
Where do you want to go?
Paco'll show you. Free on the house!

13
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:50,736
- "Taller mecanico avenida. '"
- Cardenas.!

14
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:54,304
No problem.
I show you exactly.

15
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,149
I like Americans.
Americans very smart people.

16
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,680
Someday, I go to America.

17
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,418
When you do, you look
up Pete Staniczek here.

18
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:05,964
He'll put you up, show you
the best ice cream parlors.

19
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,259
That sounds good!

20
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,663
You see down there?
That's Avenue Cárdenas.

21
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:12,999
Turn left, that way.
Go two blocks, you'll find Mecanico.

22
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,025
Thanks.

23
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,939
De nada. Anytime! Welcome
to Puerto Vallarta.

24
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:20,467
- Gracias.
- See you later, alligator.

25
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,814
Cute kid, d'ya know
what I mean?

26
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:30,084
- Well mannered, polite,
didn't have his hand out.

27
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:32,921
An endangered species.

28
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:52,678
- That light area, right around 400.
- I can see it.

29
00:03:55,786 --> 00:04:00,622
- And you say this is Inca.
- You're the expert, you tell me.

30
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:03,320
Did anyone else spot this?

31
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,955
They were looking for oil.

32
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:08,090
And where is this?

33
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:16,633
In the jungles.
South America.

34
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,477
Mr. Shepard, there's nothing
to be gained by our playing games.

35
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:24,644
This could very well be
an undiscovered Inca city.

36
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,713
And you know what that means:
Pre-Columbian artifacts.

37
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:34,388
- And gold, Mr. Prindle.
- And what do you want?

38
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:37,832
Cash.
And plenty of it.

39
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:41,359
'Cause they're gonna throw
the key away if they find us
stealing that stuff.

40
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:45,068
Yeah, it's a national
treasure, or something.

41
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:50,012
- Is there another print of this?
- That's it.

42
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,610
Gentlemen,
we're in business.

43
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,452
There's gotta
be some mistake.

44
00:04:57,524 --> 00:04:59,856
Ah, no, senores.
No, senores.

45
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:03,760
This is not a mistake.
This is senor Douglas' car.

46
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:08,291
And you're telling me that this thing
won the Monte Carlo Grand Prix?

47
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,134
That is what senor Douglas
told me.

48
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,640
He say he'd have won
the Baja race too...

49
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:18,170
but his girlfriend...
did not make the curve.

50
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:23,948
Herbie, he see it, he stop.
He no finish the race.

51
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:27,513
Senor Douglas say,
"it's here."

52
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,023
Let's turn it over.

53
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,362
La llave, senor.

54
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:47,906
- Okay, so it runs.
- Let's take it.
It's transportation home.

55
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:59,019
- Senor.
- Si, senor?

56
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:03,360
Mind if we take it
around the block first?

57
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,867
Okay, senor.

58
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:27,854
Cute kid, huh?
Doesn't have his hand out.

59
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,725
He doesn't have his hand out
because it's in your pocket.

60
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:33,426
You check that side.

61
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,795
See if you can
find us a taxi.

62
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:45,104
- I'll get you a taxi, senor!
- Get lost, kid. Taxi!

63
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:49,345
All right, 1200,
the National Hotel Bar.

64
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,115
I'll be there.

65
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,282
- Carry your bags, senor?
- Move along, sonny.

66
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,792
- No trouble. I carry your bags cheap!
- Put the bags down.

67
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,820
- I said, put the bags down!
- Hey, kid!

68
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:04,197
- Come on, get away from me, will ya?
- Taxi.!

69
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:09,334
Very sorry, senores.
Please, you forgive me!

70
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,664
He said he liked Americans
and put his arms around us.

71
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,228
Then took us to the cleaners.
Never mind reenacting the crime.

72
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:40,334
Just look for the little...
There!

73
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:47,847
See that grubby little foot
out behind that box?

74
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,834
A cold beer says it's
attached to Paco the dip.

75
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:51,821
Shh. Shh.

76
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,703
Come back here,
you little bandit!

77
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:11,211
- We need that worse than you do.!
- Don't scare him.! Talk to him nicely.!

78
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:24,218
Ooh!

79
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,286
Yee! Ah!

80
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,597
Buenos dias.!

81
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:37,403
Oh!

82
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:42,305
I'm sorry, lady.
We're looking for a little kid.

83
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:45,681
Did you see a little kid?
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:48,187
Me too, lady.

85
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,665
You look that way.

86
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,483
- What took you so long?
- It's not easy in this town.

87
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:19,114
Mr. Prindle, if you want
to get in touch with me before,
you can use this number.

88
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,718
- My wallet's gone.
- Maybe you left it up in the room.

89
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,156
It was that kid.
That crummy little kid!

90
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,916
Buenos dias.!

91
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:05,609
I don't know.
He must've skipped town.

92
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,442
No, he didn't.
This time we sack him.

93
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:11,108
You take him low,
I'll take him high.

94
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,444
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Is that yours?

95
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:38,106
- No!
- Is it ours?

96
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,208
- Si.!
- Grab loose of that.

97
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,881
- Nah, looks like that's all he got.
- I'll take over, dipstick.

98
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,222
I oughta tan your bottom!

99
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,570
Oh, I got another one

100
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:04,708
Look, there he is!

101
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:08,215
Hold it, kid!

102
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:11,013
- Wait a minute!
- Hold it, kid!

103
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:14,317
- Wait!
- Why? What we want's in that mailbox.

104
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,053
Let's get the kid first,
just in case. Come on!

105
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,200
Somebody, stop that boy!

106
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:35,007
Stop that kid, someone.!
Hey, you, grab him.! Anybody.!

107
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,019
He's over here,
come on!

108
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:10,184
Look up there!
Over here too!

109
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:50,996
- Busca alla arriba.
- Si.

110
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:12,350
Well, like you said,
transportation.

111
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:15,260
Let's close the deal
and get out of here.

112
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,572
There he is!
In the car!

113
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:47,393
What, are you planning to sleep
over at the local jail, lead foot?

114
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,460
I'm not doin' anything!

115
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:55,475
- Maybe this bug did win the Grand Prix!
- We got ourselves a race car.

116
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:00,243
- This your wallet?
- Yes, Officer, thank you very much.

117
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,645
- Is something missing, senor?
- No, everything's fine.

118
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,690
It's all here.

119
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,489
We will continue looking
for the car and the boy, of course.

120
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:15,328
Thank you, Officer.
We'll catch up with you.

121
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,970
Film's gone.

122
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,033
Why would a kid take it?

123
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,906
I don't know, we gotta
get it back, though.

124
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,967
I'll never get
another one.

125
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,749
Steady, boys! That's the car that's
going to win the Grand Primeo at Brazil!

126
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:38,758
- Something's weird about that car, D.J.
- I know!

127
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:42,660
It's dynamite and it'll blow the doors
off anything in the race.

128
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,140
Attention, please. Sun Princess
will be embarking in 20 minutes.

129
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:04,283
We blew it.

130
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,950
The car's on the ship;
the boy's on the ship.

131
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:09,823
- That thing's going to Rio.
- Its first stop is Panama.

132
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:13,457
When it gets there,
we'll be waiting for it.

133
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:24,105
The booty was taken aboard
the man-o'-war and
the enemy vessel scuttled.

134
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,204
The women were then
turned over to the crew...

135
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:31,242
the select ones going
to the officers, naturally.

136
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,758
The wenches were escorted
below and, believe

137
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,383
me, there was no poetry
or "by your leave'"...

138
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:41,897
or "how lovely you look, madam. '"
One got to the matter at hand
in short order.

139
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:46,096
Each captive seaman
was given 100 lashes with the cat...

140
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,571
- spread-eagled on the rigging.
- My dear Captain Blythe.

141
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,271
They didn't last long
in those latitudes, I can tell you.

142
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,752
In no time at all, they were bloated
carrion for the birds of prey.

143
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,984
Yah!

144
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,221
Oh, do have some
of the green turtle soup, Mrs. Purkiss.

145
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,694
It's the chef's specialty.

146
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:18,599
Well, they'd no sooner
broken out the grog...

147
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,689
then the entire Spanish
armada was closing on them.

148
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:21,939
Everything looks so tempting.

149
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:24,446
Yes.
Doesn't it?

150
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:28,712
They were met with stiff resistance
as they clambered aboard.

151
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:32,620
- It was parry and thrust,
thrust and parry.

152
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:41,662
- Uh, permit me.
- Thank you.

153
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:46,837
- Anyone else?
- Oh. No, thanks.

154
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:53,039
Where was I?
Well, the deck was awash with blood!

155
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,742
What are you gonna have?

156
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,253
I think I'll have
that captain...

157
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,881
on a bed of roses.

158
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,291
Blast of grape
might sweep the deck clean.

159
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:09,821
- Aunt Louise, you're incorrigible.
- I know!

160
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:14,860
I've never regretted
a moment of it.

161
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,742
Right this way,
gentlemen.

162
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,685
My goodness,
what a pleasant surprise.

163
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,747
Two handsome young gentlemen as our
dining companions. I'm Louise Trends.

164
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:34,259
- DavyJohns.
- Pete Staniczek.

165
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:37,194
Pete, this is
my niece Melissa.

166
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:40,166
Well, sit down,
sit down.

167
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:43,533
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.

168
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:46,438
- You gentlemen going to Rio?
- Not exactly, ma'am.

169
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:49,033
Oh, I was telling Melissa...

170
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,444
Rio is a city
of romance.

171
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:56,747
You really, to get the most out of it,
have to share it with someone.

172
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,882
- Wasn't I, Melissa?
- Aunt Louise.

173
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,394
Well, personally, I won't have much time
for that sort of thing.

174
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:09,127
I'll be utilizing every moment
I have copying down material
for my doctorate.

175
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,192
You're gonna be a doctor?

176
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:15,434
Yes, of Latin American
cultures.

177
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,444
Celery?
Cool it with the doctor bit.

178
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:22,442
Well, so what does take
you gentlemen to Rio?

179
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:27,318
Actually, we're headed further
south. We're entering a car
in the Brazil Grand Primeo.

180
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:31,188
Pete here handles the wheel.
The rest is my lookout.

181
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:34,457
- You're a race driver.
- Yeah.

182
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,328
Oh, isn't that fascinating!

183
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,666
- Oh, I love race cars,
don't you, Melissa?
- Not really.

184
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:50,670
Well... hungry?

185
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:00,787
Ah!
Ahh.

186
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,159
Ah! Here we go.

187
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:22,281
Buon appetito, eh?

188
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,987
Ah!

189
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:49,072
But I checked the pressure
five minutes ago. Everything is fine.!

190
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:54,315
Number one, okay.!
Yes, I know how Capt. Blythe is...

191
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:59,155
but I tell you, the dial is right
on the nose. I see it for myself.

192
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:29,283
Who take-a my chicken?

193
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:51,082
Aha! So you think you can steal
Armando's dinner and get away with it?

194
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:53,384
We're gonna see about that.
Oh, yes.

195
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:57,415
Okay. Open up.
Open up, little car.

196
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,487
No car's gonna eat my dinner.
Open up. I tell you!

197
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:04,261
Open up!

198
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:18,576
Aha! Heh-heh-heh!
Open up.

199
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,587
Open up.

200
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,423
You can't drive
that car down here.

201
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:42,335
This is the number one hold.
Some of your cargo, it's-a broke loose!

202
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:47,646
Send your officer watch down here fast,
no, but I mean real fast! Si.

203
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,996
- Hey, what's going on?
- That car has no driver!

204
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:01,124
Better notify
Captain Blythe!

205
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,144
Shh.! All right, men.
Spread out and be careful.

206
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,925
Psst!

207
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,609
Now.!

208
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:49,220
And I am to believe
that this... car...

209
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:52,452
ate your chicken dinner?

210
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:56,588
Eh, and then he spit out the bones!

211
00:23:56,664 --> 00:24:01,693
- Who is this?
- Wiper, third class,
Armando Moccia, sir.

212
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,570
Do you know the penalty
for drinking on duty...

213
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,667
wiper, third class?

214
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:11,236
Armando not touch one drop. No, please!

215
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:14,751
The car ate my apple.
I know because I hear with my own ears!

216
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,310
Eh! Muncha-muncha-munch!

217
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:20,186
Muncha-muncha-munch, eh?

218
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:25,195
- Do you know what I'm going
to do with your ears?

219
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,663
- Uh, where is the car now?
- Went for a drive after dinner.

220
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:36,539
Oh. And was it smoking a cigar
and drinking a brandy?

221
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:42,315
The perpetrator of this little jest
will receive 50 lashes...

222
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:45,978
- before ship's company
and set adrift in a...

223
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:56,288
Perhaps you'll be good enough
to tell me about your grandson
Snooky another time.

224
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:08,910
Wiper, third class, Armando Moccia?

225
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:11,541
Aye-aye, sir.

226
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:32,068
Ah!

227
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,911
Okay, men, secure it.
Get the blocks and make it good.

228
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:42,213
Capitane.
Muncha-muncha-muncha! Si.!

229
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:45,444
See? Hah!

230
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:06,468
Now.

231
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:10,142
- How did you want to handle that?
- You mean pay for it?

232
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:15,815
Or did you plan to, uh,
reassemble the stemware yourself?

233
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:19,327
It's not our responsibility.

234
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:23,832
I'm your captain, judge and jury.
I'll decide what's your responsibility!

235
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,460
Captain!

236
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:35,571
The, uh, the cargo manifest
states unequivocally...

237
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:39,947
that you, Peter Staniczek,
are the sole owner of the car.

238
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:44,319
You are the consignor
and the consignee.

239
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,790
Your car did damage, ergo...

240
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,454
- Yeah, but Pete wasn't driving...
- Stow it!

241
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:55,829
I, uh, I have been advised
by our public relations department...

242
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:59,703
to waive all charges
of kidnapping...

243
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:03,609
and smuggling illegal aliens
into a foreign country.

244
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,273
- Where is that kid, anyway?
- In the storeroom...

245
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,976
where he'll remain until
the ship reaches Panama...

246
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:11,612
at which time he will be turned
over to the port authorities...

247
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:14,987
and returned
to his native country.

248
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:18,392
In the meantime,
your automobile will be impounded...

249
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:21,454
until your obligations
are met.

250
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:26,464
Captain.

251
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,342
Uh, gentlemen...

252
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:34,539
I do hope you've been
enjoying the cruise so far.

253
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:38,244
Remember, we have
a shuffleboard tournament
on main deck at four bells...

254
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:41,754
and, uh, disco lessons
in the lounge at six bells.

255
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,894
Thanks, anyway.

256
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,661
We can write the captain an
I.O.U. And pay him out of our
winning at the Grand Primeo.

257
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,173
There's no way we can raise
that kind of money.

258
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:01,267
Maybe we should chalk it up
to experience and work our way home.

259
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:05,247
- Maybe Aunt Louise will bail us.
- You are a dreamer, D.J.

260
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:10,914
Wait a minute.
She likes cars and she's trying
to get her niece hooked up.

261
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,789
Yeah?

262
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,455
- No!
- Wait a minute.

263
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,432
All you gotta do is keep the doc
enthralled with tales of derring-do...

264
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:25,233
while I initiate Aunt Louise
into the delights of Formula One racing.

265
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:30,142
- I don't like it.
- Come on, man! Nothing good comes easy.

266
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:33,978
Lots of charm,
lots of charm.

267
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:48,464
You may not believe this,
this is an exact replica,
down to the last button...

268
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:52,765
of the uniform worn by Lord Nelson
when he defeated the Spanish armada.

269
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:56,204
- Seems like it belongs
on me, doesn't it?
- I love a uniform.

270
00:28:56,274 --> 00:29:00,575
It gives a man a certain...

271
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:04,174
- At ease, madam!
- Captain!

272
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:08,119
Excuse me, I must circulate
among the cargo... uh, passengers.

273
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:14,188
Anyway, like I was saying,
it's the thrill of a lifetime...

274
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:18,996
when you see that car that
belongs to you streak across
that finish line a winner.

275
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:24,870
Not only that, you're part
of the technological advancement
of the automotive world.

276
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:27,671
- Oh, really.
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:30,976
I wonder...
where the kids are.

278
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:33,312
Now isn't that...

279
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:37,047
In my heart and my hand

280
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,886
I've never seen

281
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:45,090
- They seem to be enjoying themselves.
- Yeah, they're hitting it off.

282
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:50,033
Pete's a great guy.
He's what I call a beautiful person.

283
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:53,766
With your head up in a cloud

284
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:56,139
Where you belong

285
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,581
Please look at me

286
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,576
lf I stay around

287
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:10,819
Maybe something good
will happen

288
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,295
Like you'll
look into my eyes

289
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:16,730
And realize

290
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,565
My kind of racin'.

291
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,606
Oh, pardon me.
That's the third time I've done that.

292
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:25,871
Who's counting?
I'm having a great time.

293
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:30,608
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

294
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:34,309
And so

295
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:38,950
Usually when we race,
a good time means towing
the crew across Texas...

296
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:42,621
in the middle of August,
looking for a Denny's...

297
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:46,292
then bedding down
in some fleabag motel.

298
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:49,929
Now here I am...

299
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:54,272
soft lights, sweet music...

300
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:56,402
pretty girl.

301
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,246
Uh, Mr. Staniczek, you don't
really have to say those things.

302
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:04,549
Oh, I know that. It's just that you're
different than other girls I've known.

303
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:11,127
- I can well imagine.
- No, no, it's a compliment.

304
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:15,292
For one thing, you don't giggle
when there's nothing funny.

305
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:19,464
And you listen when I talk.
A man looks a long way
for a girl like that.

306
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:22,440
And, uh...

307
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:32,150
And maybe then

308
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,656
- Our fingers touch
- You are pretty, Melissa.

309
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:40,219
And you'll thrill me
oh, so much

310
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:43,788
A lovely dream

311
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:47,735
That's meant to be

312
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:53,210
lf you would give

313
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,644
One look

314
00:31:55,714 --> 00:32:00,448
At me

315
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,855
Ah, this is it.

316
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,423
I just want to thank you
for this evening.

317
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:18,063
- L-I really enjoyed myself.
- Me too.

318
00:32:21,143 --> 00:32:24,044
Well, good night.

319
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:26,548
Melissa?

320
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,471
- This is the pits.
- Did something go wrong?

321
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:56,038
We went wrong
when we got into this.

322
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:59,109
I don't like playing games
with people.

323
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,122
Come on, just a couple more days.
I already got the money.

324
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,455
Aunt Louise gave me a check.
We got the car out of hock.

325
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,622
And get this, kiddo.
She's gonna sponsor us all the way.

326
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:13,567
We name it, she buys it.!
All you gotta do is keep making
like Burt Reynolds.

327
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:17,164
- So, that's the deal.
- Well, I sorta read it
between the lines.

328
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,699
Anyway, the important thing
is we're back in the running.

329
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:25,147
Ahh! Nothing's gonna
stop us now.

330
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,150
Hi!

331
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:13,695
- That captain sure was mad, wasn't he?
- Honk!

332
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:16,468
- What is he gonna do with you?
- Honk-honk-honk.

333
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:22,106
They will send me back where I live...
with the orphans.

334
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:26,882
But it's okay.
They put me back, I run away again.

335
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,548
- Can we be friends?
- Honk.

336
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:31,888
- What's your name?
- Honk-honk.

337
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,396
- Que?
- Honk-honk.

338
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:41,634
- I just call you "Ocho," okay?
- Honk-honk.

339
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,343
Atta boy, Ocho!

340
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,245
Thanks, Ocho.
I'll pay you back.

341
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:51,249
But you better go back where you were,
so you won't get in trouble.

342
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:03,388
Oh-oh!

343
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,007
There it goes!
Don't let it get out of this hold, men!

344
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:33,863
Check over
by the elevator, men.!

345
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:50,811
In those days,
a captain was a captain.

346
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:56,086
And a ship was a ship,
not a floating carnival.

347
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,993
And the only women aboard
were dragged there by
the scruff of their neck!

348
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:03,090
Whoo, gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

349
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:06,159
The captain is having
a little jest with you ladies.

350
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:09,502
I'm only telling it
like it was.

351
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,008
Or should be.

352
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:15,343
Yes, when you talked about
liberation in those days...

353
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:17,848
you were talking
about battles...

354
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:21,479
nations, empires.

355
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,664
Oh! Oh!

356
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:34,099
Oh, Captain.
Oh, my word.!

357
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,330
Sorry!

358
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:47,608
But, Captain, how can a car
release a boy with a key? Explain that!

359
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:51,314
I can't explain that
any more than I can explain
the Bermuda Triangle, madam.

360
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:52,609
Nor do I intend to try.

361
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:55,086
Captain, I am the sponsor
of that little car.

362
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,357
It's going to win
the Brazil Grand Primeo.

363
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,992
If you can bring that off,
I will not only part the Red Sea...

364
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,127
I will tint it magenta.

365
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:08,162
Oh, oh, Captain.
I appeal to you as a woman...

366
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:10,972
a desperate, helpless...

367
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:14,275
single woman.

368
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:15,754
Spare that car.

369
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:20,015
Lorelei and her sirens could
not make me veer one degree!

370
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:24,549
- My course is set!
- Oh!

371
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,268
Ship's company!
Stand to to witness punishment!

372
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:35,669
Sir, the passengers
might not understand.

373
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,699
I am simply abiding
by the traditions of the sea...

374
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:42,212
Chief Steward.

375
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:47,682
By the powers vested in me
as the captain of this ship...

376
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:50,484
I hereby deem this vehicle
a menace...

377
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:55,017
to life and limb and the very
safety of the vessel itself.

378
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:58,258
I herewith commit it
to the sea...

379
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:01,199
a fate well-deserved.

380
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:04,466
Doff hats!

381
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:10,936
Seamen... do your duty.

382
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:24,687
- You too?
- Oh, bag and baggage.

383
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:28,064
Anyone remotely associated with
that little car is being put ashore.

384
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,866
If it hadn't been for that steward,
we'd have been keelhauled.

385
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:35,171
- Sorry it turned out like this.
- If I decided to get out
of needlepoint...

386
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:38,213
and into racing,
it was my choice.

387
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:44,553
- Actually, there's more
to it than that.
- Steady, steady.

388
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:49,684
We needed backing, so D.J.
Pitched you on the car while... l...

389
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:53,218
Pitched my niece
on the fantail.

390
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:57,496
I've got too much mileage
on me not to recognize...

391
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,560
an operation
when I see one.

392
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:02,163
You mean you knew that?

393
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:08,273
Well, I was hoping that...

394
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:11,716
something might happen
between you and Melissa.

395
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:15,846
She's really
a wonderful girl.

396
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:17,280
She's terrific but...

397
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:20,088
A little klutzy for
someone like yourself.

398
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,823
Not everybody's
made for each other.

399
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,095
I really like her and I
don't want her to get hurt.

400
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:29,433
I plan to tell her but maybe
you can smooth things over.

401
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:32,168
- Here's your bag, miss.
- Thank you.

402
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:35,507
Melissa, there you are!
I was just looking...

403
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,949
- You meet such
interesting types on ships.
- Melissa!

404
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:44,121
Sorry, boys.

405
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:49,721
Come on, pal.

406
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:56,930
How do you say
in Panamanian...

407
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,734
we need a job?

408
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,971
Excuse me. I don't know
where you're taking this boy,
but I have prior claim on him.

409
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:07,140
- Are you from Juvenile Authority?
- Yes, I am.

410
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:09,775
- No, he's not!
- Aah!
- Aah!

411
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:11,649
We'll handle this!

412
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:18,859
- Grab that kid!
- Stop that kid!
He's wanted by the police!

413
00:42:28,573 --> 00:42:32,135
We gotta get that kid!

414
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,406
We'll get him.

415
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:55,125
Tom, you better come
take a look at this.

416
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,957
What the devil is that?

417
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,481
I don't know. Supposed
to be the Major Maroux.

418
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:40,679
Ocho?

419
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:57,063
Ocho!

420
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,747
I'm coming, Ocho,
I'm coming!

421
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:20,358
- Ayudame, andale.!
- Vamonos.!

422
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,874
What is the matter,
muchacho?

423
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,943
- It's an old wreck.
- But he was my good friend.

424
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:10,185
Your friend is good for nothing
but junk.

425
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:18,963
Hey, even junk...

426
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,470
worth something.

427
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:55,342
Bye, Ocho.

428
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,715
Vaya con Dios.

429
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:20,406
Ocho!

430
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:25,402
Come on, Ocho,
you can do it. Try, try!

431
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:35,678
Please, Ocho, come on!

432
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:41,156
Don't give up now,
please, please.!

433
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,757
Try, try!

434
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,466
I help you!

435
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,729
It's those men.
Come on, you gotta start!

436
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:18,135
You're whippin'
a dead horse, muchacho.

437
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:22,432
We gotta get outta here!

438
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,139
This is our car now!
Go play someplace else.

439
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:32,651
Sal de ahi, muchacho.
Ay.!

440
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:44,630
You feeling better, Ocho.

441
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,286
A friend

442
00:48:09,831 --> 00:48:13,096
It takes one to be one

443
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:16,605
Takes some time 'til
the light starts shinin'

444
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:19,505
On a friendship

445
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:22,511
A friend

446
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:26,413
Step up if you need one

447
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:28,475
Stick out your hand

448
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:32,751
They should understand
it's a friendship

449
00:48:32,824 --> 00:48:35,919
A buenos dias
Come on, try

450
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:39,521
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye

451
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:43,262
That's what friends are for
and remember this, charro

452
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:47,432
They'll stick with you
today and tomorrow

453
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:51,773
Amigo

454
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:56,446
It's nice if you've got one

455
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,112
But it's nicer
if you're not one to stop

456
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,782
From lookin'for more

457
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:06,056
The world is full of people
who need you so much

458
00:49:06,128 --> 00:49:09,530
A million hearts there
to touch

459
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,625
And I bet you a banana

460
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:15,799
Manana you'll have
a new friend

461
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:21,536
And I bet you a banana

462
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:25,209
Manana you'll have
a new friend

463
00:49:29,256 --> 00:49:31,247
A friend

464
00:49:31,324 --> 00:49:33,815
It's nice when you see one

465
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:38,161
But it's nicer
when you be one

466
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:10,131
You look good, Ocho,
like a real taxi.

467
00:50:10,202 --> 00:50:13,069
Now we're gonna make
lots of money.

468
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:16,701
Then Paco will never have to
take nothin'from nobody again.

469
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:22,043
Just relax, sonny.

470
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,818
- Now, where is it?
- Where's what?

471
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:34,124
There was some film in the wallet
you took from us in Puerto Vallarta.

472
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:36,791
When we got it back,
it was missing.

473
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:40,666
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it got mixed-up.

474
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,868
- What do you mean, "mixed-up"?
- With the other man's wallet.

475
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:46,842
He's lying.

476
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,473
Maybe, maybe not.

477
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:54,645
Now you listen to me.
I want that film back.

478
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,555
I don't care how you do it,
just get it back!

479
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:00,649
Because if you don't...

480
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:10,965
he's gonna cut this car of yours
up into tiny, little pieces.

481
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,339
You understand, kid, huh?
Little strips to hang on
your Christmas tree?

482
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,073
Comprende?

483
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:20,547
Si.

484
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:27,319
You know, Pete,
I was just thinking.

485
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:30,759
Do you realize that that car
could've put us in the big time?

486
00:51:30,828 --> 00:51:34,559
We could've been
international celebrities.

487
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:36,032
You know what I mean?

488
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:39,070
Endorsements,
groupies chasin' after us.

489
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:43,007
It's that kid.
Murphy's Law took over from
the time we ran into that brat.

490
00:51:43,076 --> 00:51:45,772
Hi, guys.

491
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:49,178
Speaking of
four-foot crime waves.

492
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,056
I come to say, I sorry
if I make trouble for you.

493
00:51:56,124 --> 00:51:58,285
Yeah, well, fine.
See you around.

494
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:03,424
Paco go. I just want you
not be mad at me.

495
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:14,735
Now don't start that.
Nobody's mad.

496
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:17,611
It's water over the dam.

497
00:52:21,786 --> 00:52:25,746
I'm sorry.
Please, you forgive me?

498
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,133
Fine, kid,
no hard feelings.

499
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:37,899
Forget it.

500
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,105
Straight back there,
through that hallway and to the right.

501
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:47,808
Gracias.!

502
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:52,150
Gloriosky! Just makes you
feel good all over.

503
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:00,186
He did it again.

504
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:13,173
Come back here,
you little bandit!

505
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:16,978
Hey, that's our car.!

506
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:20,679
- How can that be our car?
- I don't know. Let's get him!

507
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:23,952
We better get outta here,
or those guys are gonna get you back!

508
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:34,164
Shepard's ready.
He's got the plane.

509
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:37,570
Good.
Here comes the boy.

510
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:48,574
Why, that little,
double-crossing... Come on!

511
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:55,049
Taxi!

512
00:53:57,463 --> 00:53:59,055
Taxi!

513
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:02,067
Taxi.!
Taxi.!

514
00:54:04,638 --> 00:54:07,106
Let me get in here.

515
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:09,836
It's a little tight.
Pardon moi, senor.

516
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,454
- Pier 6, the Sun Princess.
- Pier 5, the Windsong, please.

517
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,551
- You!
- You!

518
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,096
- I'm terribly sorry,
- I'm terribly excited...

519
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,148
but it's imperative I return
to my ship immediately.

520
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,031
I'd be so pleased...

521
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,695
- You can have the cab after that!
- Thank you.

522
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,238
- The Sun Princess.
- The Windsong, please.

523
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:38,242
We're in real
trouble now, Ocho.

524
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:42,076
And full steam ahead.!

525
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,487
Where in blazes
are you going, driver?

526
00:54:49,556 --> 00:54:51,457
No comprendo, senor.

527
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:54,790
You people comprendo enough
when you want to!

528
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,887
Wait a minute.

529
00:54:58,634 --> 00:55:01,899
It's that same kid!

530
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,600
And here's the biggie:
I think it's the same car.

531
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:09,839
It's a ghost.
Let me outta here!

532
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:13,479
Let me outta here, or
it's the yardarm for you!

533
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:15,351
Can't stop now, senor.

534
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:24,928
- Look!
- Oh! Uh...

535
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:28,364
- Melissa! Melissa!
- Help, help!

536
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:31,461
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!

537
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:34,006
Help, Melissa.!

538
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:36,042
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!

539
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:38,544
The kid,
he robbed us again!

540
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:41,514
- He shanghaied them.
- Shanghai?

541
00:55:46,855 --> 00:55:50,791
Senor, stop!
Could you please stop?

542
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:55,360
Por favor, alto.!

543
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,237
Por favor, alto.
Please stop.

544
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:11,004
Por favor, senor.!
Muchas gracias.

545
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,144
- How much?
- How far you want to go?

546
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,348
No, how much
for the whole bus?

547
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:19,187
Huh?

548
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:21,887
Is $340 enough?

549
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:27,934
Lady,
you got yourself a bus!

550
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:30,027
Next bus, please.

551
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:33,166
Todos para fuera.
Acabo de vender el bus.!

552
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:44,213
Now, listen to me, son.

553
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,257
If you don't release me
this instant...

554
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:51,193
I'll have you tied to a cannon
to be discharged at sunset.!

555
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:53,254
I can't stop.

556
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:56,392
Two men said that they would
cut up Ocho in little pieces...

557
00:56:56,468 --> 00:56:59,131
and two other men
are very mad at me.

558
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:04,736
Is that banging noise new?

559
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,610
Just louder.
It might throw a rod.

560
00:57:07,681 --> 00:57:11,583
- Uh, is that serious?
- Not if it happens in front of a hotel.

561
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:19,985
Are we still in Panama?

562
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,021
- Panama's long gone, capitan.
- What? Let me out of here.!

563
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:29,263
Can't, capitan.
There's some men after me!

564
00:57:31,341 --> 00:57:34,277
No, Ocho,
not in there!

565
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:45,154
- Olé!
- What was that?

566
00:57:45,224 --> 00:57:47,318
We're at the bullfights,
capitan.

567
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:51,520
Oh, this is exciting.

568
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:55,831
- I think it will be, senora.
- What did he mean by that?

569
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:58,804
God bless you.

570
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,610
Turn in there!

571
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,894
- This can't be right.
- Back up!

572
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:30,632
Oh!

573
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,305
We're goin'in.!

574
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:52,858
- What are we gonna do?
- Just ignore him.

575
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:01,710
Saquen esos carros
de la plaza.!

576
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:08,082
Vamonos, hombre.!
Pero saquense de aqui. Estan locos.

577
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:10,383
Pero orale,
afuera, hombre.!

578
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:21,960
Come on,
get it off the car!

579
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:45,059
Come on!

580
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,743
Oh... Oooh!

581
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:11,417
Alto, ya parenle,
basta, ya basta.!

582
01:00:11,492 --> 01:00:13,926
Please get us
out of here, kid.

583
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:17,022
I'm not asking for myself,
but I'm very worried about this lady.

584
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,533
- How thoughtful!
- Just shut up!

585
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:23,936
- Pasen por esa puerta, rapido.!
- Si, senor policia.

586
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:27,842
That first gangway.! Move it.!

587
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:29,936
Aaah!

588
01:00:30,014 --> 01:00:32,312
Get goin Ocho.!

589
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,716
Aaah!

590
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:37,778
Ay, que viene el toro.!

591
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:43,828
- We're stopped. Where's the bull?
- There he is.

592
01:00:43,896 --> 01:00:46,831
What a magnificent animal.

593
01:00:46,899 --> 01:00:50,233
- I think you can see him
better from here.
- Aaah!

594
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:53,403
Aaah!

595
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:57,467
Hey, Ocho, we gonna let him
get away with that?

596
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:00,708
Yes, you are!
Let's get out of here!

597
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:15,156
Scat, scat, scat.!

598
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:19,532
Ocho, he's gonna kill ya!
You just can't stand here doin' nothin'!

599
01:01:19,603 --> 01:01:24,337
You gotta fight!
Take a good look at him!

600
01:01:25,944 --> 01:01:28,880
He's a killer.!

601
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:35,612
- He is going to fight.
- That-a-boy, Ocho!

602
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:41,423
I can't believe this.

603
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:44,863
Thirty years at sea,
and I'm going to die in a bullring.

604
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:52,033
Hey, toro, toro.!

605
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,704
Toro.! Hey, toro.!
Toro, toro.!

606
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:59,306
- No toros! Shhh!
- Toro.!

607
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,477
Toro, toro.!
Andale, toro, aqui.!

608
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,912
Hey, toro.!

609
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,095
Good, Ocho!

610
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:13,961
That-a-boy, Ocho!
Stay with him!

611
01:02:14,032 --> 01:02:15,625
Ole, Ocho.!

612
01:02:47,771 --> 01:02:51,503
Atta boy, Ocho!
You take him now!

613
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:56,344
Look, son, I want you to know
that I think of you as my son.

614
01:02:56,415 --> 01:03:00,215
If you get us out of here, I'll make you
first mate of the Sun Princess.

615
01:03:00,286 --> 01:03:02,721
You and your little car
can stay in a nice suite...

616
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:05,019
and eat at my table
every night.

617
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:09,290
The big boat will take you
anywhere you want to go, okay?

618
01:03:09,363 --> 01:03:12,161
Don't worry, capitan,
we got him now!

619
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:21,308
Over here, toro.!
Over here!

620
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:23,971
Ole.!

621
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:28,143
Hey, toro, toro.!
That-a-boy, Ocho!

622
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:31,518
He's getting
awfully close, Ocho.!

623
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:35,885
- Aaah!
- I'm going to be sick.

624
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:38,327
They got voodoo down here,
you know that?

625
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:16,633
Ole! Ole!

626
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:24,406
He's had enough. Let's go.

627
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:42,926
Come on.

628
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:57,585
They want us to take a bow,
all of us!

629
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:03,326
Oh, wait.
Come out.

630
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:05,847
Nothing in this world will
induce me to go out there.

631
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,091
They'll be disappointed.

632
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,429
Don't pull on me!
Don't do that!

633
01:05:13,672 --> 01:05:16,163
Mmm! Ahhh!

634
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,645
You too, capitan.
Take a bow!

635
01:05:57,156 --> 01:05:59,056
Oof!

636
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:05,390
What's wrong, Ocho?

637
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,262
Oh!

638
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:18,776
Wait a minute!

639
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:24,912
- I told you.
- Let's get Shepard and the plane!

640
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:27,513
Captain, the boy!

641
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:32,789
That boy's in trouble!
Help him! Help!

642
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:49,241
- Can't we go any faster?
- We could, but we'd have to walk.

643
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:51,750
The fact that we're
moving at all violates...

644
01:06:51,819 --> 01:06:54,941
every principle of the
internal combustion engine.

645
01:06:54,954 --> 01:06:56,313
Hey, wait a minute.

646
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,825
It's Aunt Louise.

647
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:02,192
And Captain Blythe?

648
01:07:02,263 --> 01:07:05,461
Aunt Louise,
are you all right?

649
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:08,025
Ecstatic.
Well!

650
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:12,337
We just fought a bull,
and brought it to a standstill.

651
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:15,469
Looks like you lost, Captain.

652
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:17,980
Reverse your course.

653
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:21,780
We have to find that boy.
There's some men after him.

654
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,387
What if he
doubled-back on us?

655
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:33,523
We'd have seen him.
There's only one road around here.

656
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,034
Just keep looking
for that crazy car.

657
01:07:42,776 --> 01:07:46,474
He doesn't understand "bracket."

658
01:07:46,548 --> 01:07:48,982
All right, then,
get some wire.

659
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,542
- Wire, wire.
- Wire?

660
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:54,146
- Wire, uh, wire.
- Wire.

661
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:56,214
Sounds like "fire."

662
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:59,729
Ah, si.!
Fuego, si.

663
01:07:59,796 --> 01:08:03,232
- He's gonna get some.
- Thank you.

664
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,930
- Uh...
- Fuego.

665
01:08:07,005 --> 01:08:10,168
Um, senor, no.
Mm-mm.

666
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:13,507
- The Sun Princess.
- Como se llama?

667
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:16,673
Tell the mate I've been
stranded in Timbio.

668
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:18,945
No puedo.
No le entiendo.

669
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:23,012
- The Sun Princess! It's a ship!
- Sheep.

670
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:27,527
- Now... No, not a sheep. It's a ship.
- Princesa es sheep.

671
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:31,053
Not sheep. That's "baa-baa"!
This is "toot-toot"!

672
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:34,227
- No comprendo, no.
- What do you mean, "no comprende"?

673
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:37,101
In St. Augustine,
not far from here...

674
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:40,040
they have monolithic
statues that are...

675
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:42,543
Well, they go back
to 500 B. C...

676
01:08:42,612 --> 01:08:45,582
but nobody knows who made them
or where they came from.

677
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:48,345
I wish I could help you.

678
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:54,785
I'm sure you'd find a cold
six-pack much more exciting.

679
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:01,427
Oh, now, have I hit on something
that you hold dear and sacred?

680
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,594
Look, I led you on.
I apologized.

681
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,662
Oh, please, don't.

682
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,937
Well, I'll just have an
electrocardiogram when I get home.

683
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:12,445
But I can assure you,
there's been no damage.

684
01:09:12,513 --> 01:09:15,141
We're wasting
valuable time bickering.

685
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:18,276
Who knows what's
happened to that boy by now?

686
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:21,790
I'll just see what's
holding up the captain.

687
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,323
Why are you all
staring at me?

688
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,829
It's a conspiracy!
What?

689
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,263
Si, sesenta centavos.

690
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,632
Siesta centavos.

691
01:09:32,703 --> 01:09:34,967
Don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

692
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,099
- Siesta centavos.
- Sesenta centavos, senor.

693
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,043
- Three minutes more
cost you more money.!
- Siesta centavos.

694
01:09:42,748 --> 01:09:44,340
Oh, here.

695
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:47,284
Yes, we're getting it for you.
I beg you, don't hang up.

696
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:49,344
Yes, I'll be
right with you.

697
01:09:49,422 --> 01:09:52,790
I love your country.
It's very colorful.

698
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,296
Your children have
such expressive faces.

699
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,661
Look alive with
that change, woman!

700
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:01,497
Please don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

701
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:07,367
Are you still there?
Hello?

702
01:10:07,443 --> 01:10:09,911
Hello?

703
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:12,004
Hello!

704
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,344
She's gone.

705
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,854
It took me two hours
just to get the operator...

706
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:21,323
and she's gone,
just like that.

707
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:24,555
- Oh.
- Hello?

708
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:28,088
Oh, yes, de nada.

709
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:30,397
How will I explain this
to the company?

710
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:32,937
You just tell Aunt Louise
all about it.

711
01:10:33,006 --> 01:10:35,668
- They'll take away my command.
- Yes, oh.

712
01:10:35,742 --> 01:10:39,542
- They'll take away my sheep.
- Oh, your sheep.

713
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,718
I think we lost 'em,
but one thing I still can't figure out

714
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:53,785
Why would those men want
a picture like this, Ocho?

715
01:10:56,532 --> 01:10:59,399
It's kinda lonely
around here, huh, Ocho?

716
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:01,461
Honk-honk.

717
01:11:01,538 --> 01:11:03,870
When we're safe
from those men...

718
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:07,505
we'll go back where there's
lots of people, huh, Ocho?

719
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:08,709
Honk!

720
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,975
We've got him.!

721
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:13,279
Why don't we
force him off the road?

722
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,219
Because we just might
come off second best.

723
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:18,950
Well, what's a bug
and a kid gonna do?

724
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,483
Something quite unexpected,
I assure you.

725
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:24,723
We'll wait 'til it stops.

726
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:35,270
Will it make
Chiclayo?

727
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:37,778
Not a prayer.

728
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:40,338
- How long do you give it?
- About a minute.

729
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:44,683
We should alert the captain.
He'd want to know about this.

730
01:11:44,754 --> 01:11:48,953
He'll be alerted,
any second now.

731
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:03,801
Sound general quarters!

732
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:07,813
- Captain!
- It's every man for himself!

733
01:12:07,881 --> 01:12:10,509
Have you put out
distress signals?

734
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:13,986
Oh, we will.
Five of them.

735
01:12:23,032 --> 01:12:26,229
Maybe we can go to Santiago
and work there, Ocho.

736
01:12:26,302 --> 01:12:28,965
Those men'll
never find us there.

737
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:31,872
Don't worry, Ocho.
I'll take care of ya.

738
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:35,879
Oye, nino. El senor
en la cantina necesita un taxi.

739
01:12:35,947 --> 01:12:39,075
- Andale, pronto. Apurate.
- Si.!

740
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,247
Wake up, Ocho!
A man in the cantina needs a taxi.

741
01:12:43,322 --> 01:12:46,189
We can siesta later.

742
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:10,680
- Someone want a taxi?
- Just the driver.

743
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:19,795
Ow! Let go!

744
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,798
Let me go.!

745
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:26,928
No! Let me go!

746
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:34,574
Aaah!

747
01:13:34,648 --> 01:13:36,639
Ocho!

748
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:43,813
Ocho!

749
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,150
Ocho!

750
01:13:53,535 --> 01:13:55,561
Let me go.!
Help.!

751
01:14:00,743 --> 01:14:03,076
Ocho!

752
01:14:21,334 --> 01:14:23,269
Bye-bye.

753
01:14:23,337 --> 01:14:25,805
How's it going?

754
01:14:25,872 --> 01:14:28,306
I'm telling them not to hold
the ship at Port au Spain...

755
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:31,607
but go directly to Tobago,
where I'll join them there.

756
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,739
I hate to think of what's happened
to that ship in my absence.

757
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:38,947
Get this off immediately.
It goes to the Communication
Center of the Sun Princess.

758
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,649
Are you certain that
the pigeon understands that?

759
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:45,456
Si, senor capitan.

760
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:48,053
He certainly knows
his pigeons.

761
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:51,067
There's an airport in Chiclayo,
about 12 miles further on.

762
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:54,195
But there's no transportation
from here to Chiclayo.

763
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:00,310
It's the same car.!

764
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:02,905
I was so worried.
Thank heavens.!

765
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:09,147
It's the same car,
but where's the boy?

766
01:15:09,223 --> 01:15:11,885
I think he wants to tell us something.

767
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:15,258
It's a car, woman,
not Lassie.

768
01:15:15,329 --> 01:15:18,561
- Where is Paco?
- Honk-honk-honk.

769
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:21,067
I know something terrible's
happened to him. Come on.

770
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:23,162
Get in, everybody.
Get in!

771
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:26,333
I am not getting into
that sardine can again!

772
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:30,710
- It's a 12-mile walk to Chiclayo,
so make up your mind.
- And hurry!

773
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,409
- Get in here!
- Ow!

774
01:15:33,483 --> 01:15:36,544
Oh! Aaah!

775
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:41,914
What about that down there?

776
01:15:41,993 --> 01:15:44,360
Yeah,
that could be it.

777
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,831
Gentlemen,
we're right on the money.!

778
01:16:00,915 --> 01:16:04,408
Together now, pull.!

779
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:17,327
What do you think?

780
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:20,427
Gold.!
Probably pure gold.!

781
01:16:22,974 --> 01:16:26,000
More than that,
it has tremendous archaeological value.

782
01:16:26,077 --> 01:16:28,637
- Do you think there's more?
- Plenty.

783
01:16:28,713 --> 01:16:30,944
What do we do with it?

784
01:16:31,016 --> 01:16:33,007
I say we get this
outta here now...

785
01:16:33,085 --> 01:16:37,352
then come back with tools
and do it up right, okay?

786
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:39,449
You got it.

787
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:47,299
- What about me?
- Get outta here!

788
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:50,031
Aaah!

789
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,767
I don't like leavin'
that kid back there.

790
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,469
Don't worry about him.
He's not goin'anywhere.

791
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,905
Does anyone know
where we are?

792
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:02,417
The car does.
I'm sure of it.

793
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:06,115
Well, ask it, will you?
I would, but we're not
on speaking terms.

794
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,557
This is ridiculous.
Somebody ought to do something.

795
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:13,621
- We'd better just sit tight.
- Easy for you.

796
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:58,108
Aaah!

797
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,903
Ocho!

798
01:18:33,257 --> 01:18:36,317
Paco, what are you doing here
in the middle of the jungle?

799
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:40,194
- We were worried sick about you.
- Those men, they were stealing gold.

800
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:42,290
Big gold, like this.!

801
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:46,464
- Where'd they get gold?
- Right there. It looks like Inca ruins.

802
01:18:46,538 --> 01:18:50,873
Si. It's Inca. They will
fly away the gold and they
will melt it. I hear them.

803
01:18:50,944 --> 01:18:54,505
I'll see that the matter
is brought to the attention
of the proper authorities...

804
01:18:54,581 --> 01:18:56,606
when we put in at Rio.

805
01:18:56,683 --> 01:18:59,847
That might be too late.
Go, Ocho.!

806
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:07,821
What's that?

807
01:19:07,896 --> 01:19:12,163
Come on, give us a hand!
Let's keep movin'!

808
01:19:14,203 --> 01:19:17,970
Oh, no.!
It's that car.!

809
01:19:19,877 --> 01:19:21,504
It ate it.!
It ate the gold.!

810
01:19:21,578 --> 01:19:25,572
How'd it get out here?

811
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:33,389
- There goes a million bucks.
- No way.

812
01:19:48,209 --> 01:19:52,044
Seven hundred miles on
a banana boat with wheels.

813
01:19:52,114 --> 01:19:54,514
I'll be laughed off
the Caribbean.

814
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,574
It worked, didn't it?

815
01:19:56,652 --> 01:19:59,144
Those men in the airplane,
they couldn't find us.

816
01:19:59,222 --> 01:20:01,884
It was a good idea, Paco.
How much farther?

817
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:03,983
We're practically there.

818
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:07,189
Okay, get ready
to peel off.

819
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:09,824
Hmm, sorry.

820
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:21,404
We're looking for
Dr. De Moraes'offce.

821
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:24,245
He's upstairs,
in the main building.

822
01:20:24,317 --> 01:20:27,082
I'll call the police.

823
01:20:27,154 --> 01:20:28,883
Hello.

824
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:31,117
You go on.
I'll wait here.

825
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:32,887
Aaah!

826
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:36,556
May I use your phone?
It's very important. Oh, thank you.

827
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,896
Hey!

828
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:43,268
Are you going towards the sea?
It's vitally important
I return to my ship!

829
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,365
Wait, wait!

830
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:50,570
Dr. De Moraes?

831
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,980
Yes?

832
01:20:53,051 --> 01:20:55,451
Oh, Dr. De Moraes...

833
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,617
you have no idea what
we've gone through to get this to you.

834
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,220
And what we've gone through
to get it from you.

835
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:06,731
When we couldn't
find you on the highway...

836
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,963
we decided that you'd either gone
to the nearest police station...

837
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:14,497
or to the world's foremost
authority on Inca civilization.

838
01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:17,373
I guessed right.

839
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:21,874
Nice, ripe bananas.
They're good for brains.

840
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:25,386
Get 'em while they last.
Very cheap.

841
01:21:25,454 --> 01:21:29,221
Nice, ripe bananas.
Let's make a deal on a peel.

842
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:31,726
Let's do
this thing together.

843
01:21:31,794 --> 01:21:34,286
We don't want this
to get away from us.

844
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:43,501
Ocho, listen. Sounds like
the airplane those men had!

845
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:45,566
Let's go see!

846
01:21:55,122 --> 01:21:57,522
They can't do anything.
Come on.

847
01:21:57,591 --> 01:22:01,084
Ocho, what are we gonna do?
They're taking the gold!

848
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,666
Atta boy, Ocho!

849
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:12,941
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

850
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:15,204
Sorry, boss.!

851
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,182
Get this thing off of me!

852
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:22,549
Hit 'em again,
Ocho!

853
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,248
You idiot!

854
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:29,453
- Hey, come on! Hurry up!
- Get this thing off of me!

855
01:22:34,467 --> 01:22:37,197
Give me that thing!

856
01:22:39,338 --> 01:22:42,797
I can't get a grip on it.!

857
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:45,970
Let's do this
scientifically.

858
01:22:46,046 --> 01:22:48,572
Pull! Push!

859
01:22:52,387 --> 01:22:55,050
Cut it out, will ya?

860
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,326
Get off of my foot!

861
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:07,060
Help me get it
to the plane.

862
01:23:08,873 --> 01:23:11,501
I can't see!

863
01:23:11,576 --> 01:23:13,807
Whoa!

864
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,619
Hurry up, pilot!

865
01:23:20,687 --> 01:23:23,679
Ready... fire.!

866
01:23:30,364 --> 01:23:33,425
Say what you want
about voodoo...

867
01:23:33,501 --> 01:23:36,265
but where I come from,
cars don't throw bananas.

868
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:39,068
Just get it
in the plane!

869
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:54,353
Ocho, they're getting away.
Hurry!

870
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:11,205
Come on, let's get
this thing outta here!

871
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:16,148
With this extra weight, I'm gonna need
the whole field to take off!

872
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,243
Well, hurry up!
Here it comes again!

873
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:30,932
You think he's gonna
try and hijack us?

874
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,662
Anything's possible with that thing.

875
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:36,906
Get 'em, Ocho!
Stay with 'em!

876
01:24:41,046 --> 01:24:44,538
- I wonder what it's gonna do now.
- I don't know.

877
01:24:44,616 --> 01:24:46,379
Well, take off!

878
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:48,943
- Come on, take off!
- I'm trying!

879
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:54,352
- Right on our tail.
- I think he's tryin' to chew it off.

880
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:56,896
Do we need one?

881
01:24:58,999 --> 01:25:01,127
Now, Ocho, get him!

882
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:09,010
Don't let go!
That-a-boy!

883
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:13,578
Shake 'em, Ocho!
Shake 'em, man.

884
01:25:20,623 --> 01:25:24,720
I can't take off with all that
weight in the tail. Go get it!

885
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:30,465
- Catch it when I raise the tail.
- Gotcha.!

886
01:25:32,404 --> 01:25:34,031
Aaah!

887
01:25:36,476 --> 01:25:38,569
Go for it, Ocho, now!

888
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,611
Hang on!

889
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:47,786
Shake it off!

890
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:56,820
Come on, Ocho, you can't give up now!
They're getting away!

891
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:16,048
He's going to ram us.!

892
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:19,682
- Aaah!
- Do something!

893
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:26,690
- Why are we going in circles?
- Because he broke my tail, that's why!

894
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:38,437
Now get in front of'em!
Make 'em stop!

895
01:26:38,513 --> 01:26:40,310
Get this thing
off the ground!

896
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:50,055
We're gonna hit him!
Pull up!

897
01:26:50,127 --> 01:26:52,789
She's stalling.!

898
01:27:05,544 --> 01:27:08,445
They're still going, Ocho!

899
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:16,285
- What's the matter?
- The throttle jammed open!

900
01:27:18,559 --> 01:27:20,493
My wings!

901
01:27:22,164 --> 01:27:24,894
You hurt, Ocho?

902
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:26,958
You don't sound so good.

903
01:27:27,035 --> 01:27:30,301
Don't quit now.
You can do it!

904
01:27:30,373 --> 01:27:33,809
- Can you step it up?
- I'm hurrying.

905
01:27:33,877 --> 01:27:38,247
- Move your feet forward.
- I got it, I got it.

906
01:27:38,315 --> 01:27:40,408
Uh, uh...

907
01:27:40,484 --> 01:27:42,783
Policia.!

908
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:45,982
I'm so glad you're here.
I was the one who called you.

909
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,458
Stay with 'em!
Go, go!

910
01:27:55,836 --> 01:27:58,464
Can't you make this thing
go any faster?

911
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,940
The oil pressure's down.
I don't want to ruin my plane.

912
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:13,181
They got the gold!

913
01:28:18,295 --> 01:28:20,695
Stop! You'll never get away!

914
01:28:20,764 --> 01:28:23,199
We're right behind you!

915
01:28:31,143 --> 01:28:34,374
Okay, Ocho, you got 'em now!
Give it to 'em!

916
01:28:35,547 --> 01:28:37,743
Whoa!

917
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:51,864
- You did it!
- Paco, Paco.

918
01:28:51,933 --> 01:28:55,164
That's him!
Paco, are you all right?

919
01:28:55,236 --> 01:28:58,832
Ocho and me, we okay.
You ought to see those other guys.

920
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:04,837
No se muevan.

921
01:29:04,915 --> 01:29:07,008
Quedense ahi.

922
01:29:07,084 --> 01:29:09,211
Todos ustedes,
salganse de ahi.

923
01:29:09,286 --> 01:29:12,518
Salganse de ahi, les digo.
Yno se muevan.

924
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:47,753
Gorgeous!
Just magnificent.

925
01:29:49,732 --> 01:29:53,191
I've always felt, Captain,
that you have a...

926
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:57,833
deep appreciation for beauty.

927
01:29:57,909 --> 01:30:01,242
I've never seen
anything like it.

928
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:06,747
Any man of the sea who wouldn't
want her rolling under him...

929
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,049
is ready for dry dock!

930
01:30:11,858 --> 01:30:13,883
Wow!

931
01:30:20,468 --> 01:30:22,231
Magnificent!

932
01:30:38,756 --> 01:30:42,317
I'm not admitting the kid's
a better driver than I am...

933
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:46,296
but he sure can get more
out of that car than I can.

934
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:49,231
- And they're really...
- Simpatico.

935
01:30:49,301 --> 01:30:51,862
Yeah, simpatico.

936
01:31:00,214 --> 01:31:01,806
Well?

937
01:31:04,986 --> 01:31:09,013
If I had billowed out
like a schooner under full sail...

938
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:11,184
I might have...

939
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:14,559
shivered his timbers.

940
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:18,397
- I hope we win this one.
- Don't you worry, Aunt Louise.

941
01:31:18,468 --> 01:31:21,699
This is the car that's gonna win
the Grand Primeo of Brazil.

942
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:23,763
That's right.

943
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,674
Drivers,
start your engines!

944
01:31:28,813 --> 01:31:32,011
Paco,
muy bueno.!

945
01:31:40,093 --> 01:31:42,186
Looking good, Ocho!

946
01:31:42,262 --> 01:31:45,096
Why do you keep
calling this car "Ocho"?

947
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,828
"Ocho" means eight.
Can't you read the numbers?

948
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:52,465
Sure I can read the numbers.
Five and three are eight.
Anyone knows that.

949
01:31:55,343 --> 01:32:00,111
Let's have a toast.
To victory in Rio.

950
01:32:00,183 --> 01:32:02,879
Victory in Rio.!

951
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:05,285
A friend

952
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:08,788
It takes one to be one

953
01:32:08,826 --> 01:32:11,955
Takes some time 'til
the light starts shinin'

954
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:15,022
On a friendship

955
01:32:15,099 --> 01:32:18,433
A friend

956
01:32:18,504 --> 01:32:22,065
Step up if you need one

957
01:32:22,141 --> 01:32:24,132
Stick out your hand

958
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:28,307
They should understand
it's a friendship

959
01:32:28,381 --> 01:32:31,578
A buenos dias
Come on, try

960
01:32:31,652 --> 01:32:35,144
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye

961
01:32:35,223 --> 01:32:38,887
That's what friends are for
and remember this, charro

962
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:42,488
They'll stick with you
today and tomorrow

963
01:32:45,335 --> 01:32:47,565
Amigo

964
01:32:48,805 --> 01:32:51,832
It's nice if you got one

965
01:32:51,909 --> 01:32:54,673
But it's nicer
if you're not one to stop

966
01:32:54,745 --> 01:32:57,111
From lookin'for more

967
01:32:57,181 --> 01:33:01,642
The world is full of people
who need you so much

968
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,178
A million hearts there
to touch

969
01:33:05,257 --> 01:33:07,488
And I bet you a banana

970
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,188
Manana you'll have
a new friend

971
01:33:10,263 --> 01:33:13,597
F-R-E-N-D
Friend
