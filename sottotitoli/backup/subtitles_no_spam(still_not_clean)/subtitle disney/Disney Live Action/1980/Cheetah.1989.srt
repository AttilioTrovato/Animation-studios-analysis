1
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,666
This is it, suse.

2
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,234
We're in Kenya.

3
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,336
It's the cradle of mankind.
The source of the nile.

4
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,105
Ted, I think you've seen
too many pbs specials.

5
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,807
Hey, do you think there
are any lions

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,242
around here or anything?

7
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,178
Lions?
Ted, Nairobi's a big city.

8
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,945
Come on.

9
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,481
Well, they've got
to have a zoo, right?

10
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,816
This is not gonna be like
Tarzan, you know?

11
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,451
No swinging from the vines.

12
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,986
Hey, I know that.

13
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,654
Why do you always treat me
like a total idiot?

14
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,791
I'm your older sister, Ted.
It's expected of me.

15
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,493
- How are you?
- Susan, honey, hi.

16
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,595
- It's good to see you.
- You've lost weight.

17
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,996
What have you got in here?

18
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,098
You must start eating
like a normal human being.

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,433
How was it with grandma?

20
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,202
Were you terribly lonely,
guys?

21
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,670
It was only a month, mom.
It was no big deal.

22
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,871
But we missed you,
of course.

23
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,106
Well, let's get going.

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,674
We got a long,
long drive ahead.

25
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,832
Well, this is the great
rift valley.

26
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,835
And down there
is my tracking station.

27
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,671
How do you concentrate
on work, dad?

28
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,039
Are you kidding?

29
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,175
Not even Africa distracts
your father.

30
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,379
This is great.

31
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,813
I can't wait to get out
in the bush

32
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,382
and explore around here.

33
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,083
No.

34
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,353
We don't want you straying too
far from the house, Ted.

35
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,687
Aww, mom!

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,857
Well, you know there
are wild animals out there.

37
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,025
Wild animals in Africa?

38
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,196
You got to be putting me on,
right?

39
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,849
This is mwangi.

40
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,852
Gonna help us with some Swahili
while we're here, okay?

41
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,053
Here we are, kids.

42
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,090
Your home for
the next six months.

43
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,367
Huh... Very primitive.

44
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,736
Oh, you think you want
to rough it?

45
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,305
In a few days, believe me,

46
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,206
you'll be grateful
for the creature comforts.

47
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,442
I'd be grateful if I could see
some more creatures.

48
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,779
So what's our first African
meal gonna be, huh?

49
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,047
Rhino ribs?

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
Wildebeest surprise?

51
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,983
Guys.

52
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,421
Here it is.

53
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,488
Lamb chops.

54
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,256
And mashed potatoes.
Your favorite.

55
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:26,767
You know,
when I close my eyes,

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,937
I think I'm still in Pasadena.

57
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,274
The same thing happens
when mine are open.

58
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,413
They do mean well,
you know, Ted.

59
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,081
Of course.

60
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,083
They're just sparing us
culture shock.

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,787
Yeah and who knows
what else?

62
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,857
It's still Africa out there.

63
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,627
All the modern conveniences
in the world can't change that.

64
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,664
It's still gonna be
an adventure.

65
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,199
Good night, Ted.

66
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,813
Ted, you think you could maybe
do that somewhere else, please?

67
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,015
Listen, kiddo.

68
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,450
This is the prison
exercise yard.

69
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,818
If you don't want
to exercise,

70
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,819
you can go back
to your cell.

71
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,688
Cell?
Prison?

72
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,989
It's not that bad.

73
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,391
Oh, it isn't?
No.

74
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,393
I can do my homework
in L.A.,

75
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,995
but one thing I can't do
is see Kenya.

76
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,831
Now that we're here, we're not
even allowed to explore it.

77
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,500
Don't you want to explore?

78
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,702
Don't you wonder
what's out there?

79
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,737
Yes, I do, Ted.

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,005
But you know mom.

81
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,673
She's a worrier.

82
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,843
At least she's letting us
go on that safari in August.

83
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,212
Yeah, safe and controlled.

84
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,380
Ted, you can
understand that--

85
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,648
susie, susie, come here.

86
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,850
Take a look at this.
Come here.

87
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:54,087
What?

88
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,355
Come here.

89
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,225
Right there by the water.

90
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,761
Those herdsmen,
are they Maasai?

91
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,195
One way to find out.

92
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,230
I'm going for a closer look.

93
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,233
Well, Ted, mom said--

94
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,897
- Wait.
- What?

95
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,067
Is he coming towards us?

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,269
What, the little guy?
Yeah, come on.

97
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,775
Back here. Come back here.

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,654
Oh!
Ah, whoa!

99
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,889
Ah!

100
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,657
Jambo.

101
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,392
Hi.

102
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,263
Uh, I'm Ted and this
is my sister, Susan.

103
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,665
I'm morogo.

104
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,933
You not English?

105
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,401
No.

106
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,669
No, we're American.

107
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,605
We live around here.

108
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,273
How about you?

109
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,609
Well, I guess
we're neighbors then.

110
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,677
Good.
Come see the neighborhood.

111
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,813
- That'd be great.
- Really?

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,952
Whoa, morogo!
Check out those zebras.

113
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,286
No.

114
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,257
No, morogo.

115
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,692
They look pretty much
like zebra to me.

116
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,827
Ted.

117
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,294
They're gorgeous.

118
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,131
Sometimes food tastes best
in mouth of friends.

119
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,799
What does that mean?

120
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,501
It means, uh...

121
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,970
It means I'm happy like
"pumdamlia."

122
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,004
Ah!

123
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,085
This is my home.

124
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,320
You want come see it?

125
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,489
Um, what time's mom
get off work?

126
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,491
Well, the clinic closes
at 5:00.

127
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,727
We have to be back before
our mother.

128
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,495
Are you gonna
be free tomorrow?

129
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,563
Can we see you again?

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,265
Meet at the same place

131
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,267
when the sun is up there.

132
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,802
Noon. Noon?

133
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,938
Excellent.

134
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,474
Kwaheri.

135
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,711
Kwaheri.

136
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,782
Clinic.
It's just wonderful.

137
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,018
So what'd you kids do today?

138
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,921
Um... Homework.

139
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,757
You? Homework?

140
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,659
Um, well,
i shot some hoops

141
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,494
and, um, listened
to some music.

142
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,362
I did my calculus.

143
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,064
Finished Silas marner
finally.

144
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,481
You do better next time.

145
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,883
Wait a minute.

146
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,651
You just won?

147
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,853
I thought I was doing
all right.

148
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,055
Trouble does not
ring a bell.

149
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,491
You know a lot of those
sayings, don't you?

150
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,829
None of 'em make any sense.

151
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,716
Okay, morogo,
coast is clear.

152
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,933
Okay, keep away from 'em,
morogo.

153
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,502
Okay, just keep
getting the dots.

154
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,104
That's good.
Come on.

155
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,372
You almost got it. Come on.

156
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,373
You can do it.
Keep going.

157
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,041
Oh, no.

158
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,409
Hello?

159
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,012
Anybody home?

160
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,747
Mom, what are you
doing here?

161
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,548
I happen to live here. Now--

162
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,217
but it's only 4:00.

163
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,119
We're doing inventory,
so we closed the clinic early.

164
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,521
Mom, say hello to morogo.

165
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,723
Jambo. Samahani.

166
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,758
And how'd you all meet,

167
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,894
hanging out at the galleria?

168
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,930
But morogo has lived here
all his life,

169
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,532
so he can certainly
keep us out of danger.

170
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,735
That is the reason
for the rule, isn't it?

171
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,772
The way I see it,
if morogo shows us around,

172
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,473
we won't be in any danger.

173
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:24,044
Makes good sense, dad.

174
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,114
You really know which buttons
to push with me, don't you?

175
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:50,003
Oh, well.
We'll just get it later.

176
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,271
Morogo.

177
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,940
Morogo, we can always
get another soccer ball.

178
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,942
Morogo, it's not
that important.

179
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,814
Morogo?

180
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,182
What does he think
he's doing?

181
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,674
That was great, morogo.

182
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,550
Ted, don't you dare.

183
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,185
I don't expect you
to understand,

184
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,521
but sometimes a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

185
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,223
What a load of macho baloney.

186
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,525
Ted, get back here.

187
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,994
Shh.

188
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,263
Morogo!

189
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,387
Oh.

190
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,389
Oh!

191
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,792
"What a man's got to do,"
huh, Ted?

192
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,227
Come on.
Let's go.

193
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,898
You said something
to it, right, a spell?

194
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,401
No, I did not speak
to rhino.

195
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,702
A charm, then?

196
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,903
Some special tribal magic?

197
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,372
Yes.

198
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,708
Special magic is to go where
rhino cannot smell.

199
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,410
You mean you were downwind?

200
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,711
Well, couldn't it see you?

201
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,913
Rhino sees with his nose.

202
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,815
Well, that was your problem,
Ted.

203
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,584
You should have taken
a shower first.

204
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,707
There's something down there.

205
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,379
I think that's a baby cat.

206
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,014
But where's its mother?

207
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,482
Well, let's go
check it out.

208
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,983
No.

209
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,952
If mother come back,
very bad for us.

210
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,487
And if the mother
doesn't come back,

211
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,789
what happens to the baby?

212
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,667
Ted, it's over here.

213
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,469
Oh, yeah.
Whoa.

214
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,738
Oh, she is adorable.

215
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,241
Look at her.

216
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,512
She's so cute.

217
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,348
What are we gonna call her?

218
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,684
How about fido?

219
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,986
That is so typical.

220
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,390
Hey, what are these?

221
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh.

222
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,027
Ted?

223
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,266
I found the mother.

224
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,434
She is dead.

225
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,868
- Dead?
- Yes.

226
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,238
Skinned by a poacher.

227
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,374
You better go before
the hyenas come.

228
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,842
Right.

229
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,244
A poacher.

230
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,114
Then this may be a clue.
Check this out.

231
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,016
These weird tire tracks
and they don't go anywhere.

232
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,718
Not tire tracks.

233
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,019
Show marks.

234
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,156
Shoes made from old tire.

235
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,229
The mother's dead,
isn't she?

236
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,097
Yeah.

237
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,032
We're taking her home.
What?

238
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,768
Taking this little
duma home? Why?

239
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,205
Because if we don't take this
duma home, she's a goner.

240
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,808
I know you guys want
to keep her

241
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,445
and I'm sure you'd do a good job
taking care of her.

242
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,946
But we will.

243
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,914
We will and it'll
teach us responsibility.

244
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,250
Right, dad?

245
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,751
Ted, what happens
when it's time

246
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,952
for us to go back home?

247
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,587
Have you two thought
about that?

248
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,256
You do realize we can't bring
a cheetah back to L.A.

249
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,458
Unless you want a cheetah
more than a mother.

250
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,926
Mom, if we don't keep her,
she's gonna die.

251
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,095
This house is not
a game preserve.

252
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,598
You know, you never let us
have a pet back home either.

253
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,567
Now don't you try that
sentimental stuff

254
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,602
on me, young man.
It won't work.

255
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,305
I don't know.
It's worked before.

256
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,811
I can't believe you kids
talked us into keeping her.

257
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,113
Come on, admit it,
mom.

258
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,115
Duma is one cute little cat.

259
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,118
She's not going to be
so little six months from now.

260
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,000
Ted, kick.
Okay.

261
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,703
What's duma doing?
Duma, what are you doing?

262
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,871
Duma!

263
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,034
Park at an angle, dad.

264
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,370
You guys can get duma okay?

265
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,306
Yeah.

266
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,047
Morning, Mr. Patel.

267
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,383
Morning, professor.

268
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,084
Morning, Mrs. Johnson.
Morning.

269
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,186
Good morning.
Morning, morning.

270
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,088
I don't suppose
that fabric we ordered

271
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,590
has come in yet?

272
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,625
Perhaps it will come
in the afternoon delivery.

273
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,893
Yes.

274
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:31,030
Duma.

275
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,099
Well, Mr. Patel,
looks like we just

276
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,567
bought ourselves some cookies.

277
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,870
An unusual snack
for a most unusual pet

278
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,439
and a most beautiful one.

279
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,442
Do you have any laundry
detergent today, Mr. Patel?

280
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,476
Yes, sir.

281
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,111
50 shillings.

282
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,246
There was plenty last week.

283
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,116
Oh, look.
Your cheetah, she's escaped.

284
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,451
She's gone.

285
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,251
Uh-oh.

286
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,720
Red alert. Red alert.

287
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,655
Ted, skip the theatrics.

288
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,726
Come here.

289
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,462
A trained cheetah?

290
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,896
Marvelous.

291
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,265
You call and she comes.

292
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,935
Yeah, that's
our good little girl.

293
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,236
All right.

294
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,304
There it goes. It's up.

295
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,939
Ooh, no, wait.
Morogo, no.

296
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,741
Come back over here.

297
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,777
Okay, look, you have
to stay on this side, all right?

298
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,612
And why don't you
serve it over to Ted?

299
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,420
David, there you are.

300
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,955
You look fabulous.
Hi, Jean.

301
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,156
Mmm.

302
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,424
I'm afraid Ted's grades

303
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,992
are as sloppy as his room.

304
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,429
Yeah, we don't want them
to get too far behind.

305
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,465
So the kids will go home
early for the start of school?

306
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,799
Right.

307
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,300
I've got these last six weeks
to finish up,

308
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,769
and then the station's
all yours.

309
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,437
You're really gonna
love it here, Dave.

310
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,972
We all have.

311
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,775
But I'm sure the kids are ready
to get back to the states.

312
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,343
But we just got here!

313
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,112
Ted, you've been here
almost six months.

314
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,982
I know, but it doesn't
feel like it.

315
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,150
Time has a way
of tricking you.

316
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,786
Even more so as you get older.

317
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,488
Well, can't we extend
our stay a little bit?

318
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,490
Uh-uh.
School starts in a few weeks.

319
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,358
Everything's arranged.

320
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,060
That means we're gonna have
to say goodbye to morogo...

321
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,529
Probably for good.

322
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,031
Yeah, and duma.

323
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,500
That's right, sweetie.

324
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,468
It's time to find out
what to do with duma.

325
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,037
What's best for her.

326
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,908
Now, duma, you know you're not
supposed to be back there.

327
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,342
Silly cat.

328
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,677
What's best for her
is to release her

329
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:25,978
back into the wild.

330
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,514
That's exactly
what we figured.

331
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,348
But it's good to hear it
from a game warden.

332
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,017
I recommend cheetah valley.

333
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,351
The ecology's perfect there.

334
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,653
It'll be easy for her
to find a mate.

335
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,221
Cheetah valley?

336
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,723
See, dad, this isn't
gonna be that hard.

337
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,324
Ted, it's not gonna
be that simple either.

338
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,026
When one domesticates
these cats,

339
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,528
their hunting skills
are stunted.

340
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,663
You mean she may not know
how to be a cheetah?

341
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,331
Precisely.

342
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,866
And unless she learns,
she'll be in serious danger.

343
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,935
She trusts people,
but people won't trust her.

344
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,203
If she should wander
into a house, for example--

345
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,239
excuse my intrusion,
please.

346
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,374
Distinguished professor
and family

347
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,510
have been most generous.

348
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:02,348
Perhaps I may reciprocate by
relieving them of this animal.

349
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,016
Thank you.
No.

350
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,556
If I offer £50 Sterling
as additional inducement?

351
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,558
Come on, Larry.
Let's go back to our place.

352
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,692
Good idea.

353
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,193
I'll pick up a rope kit
and we'll

354
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,328
put duma through her paces.

355
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:22,401
Why is fate dangling
such hopes

356
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,804
and then snatching them away?

357
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,073
That cat could make me rich.

358
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,208
Rich, patel?
How so?

359
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,277
I have an uncle in India.

360
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,580
He's racing cheetah
against greyhounds.

361
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,082
It is bringing him a fortune.

362
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,584
A cheetah racing
against greyhounds?

363
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:41,287
Yes, and this cheetah,
she's already tamed.

364
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,290
Most difficult part of training
is accomplished.

365
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:48,160
I could begin negotiations
with racetrack today,

366
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,631
if only I possess cat.

367
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,307
She'll smell the gazelle right
through the sack.

368
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,075
Rather interesting test
of instinct, really.

369
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,813
She knows it's food,
but will she chase it?

370
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,347
Okay.
Ready, Earl?

371
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,849
All set.
We'll see how it goes, Larry.

372
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,519
Okay.

373
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,621
When you get up to speed,
I'll let her out.

374
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,356
Okay.

375
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,965
Chase the bag, duma.

376
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,199
Yeah, you can do it.

377
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,334
Come on, girl. Faster.

378
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,102
Come on, girl.
You can do it.

379
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,138
Come on.

380
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:36,809
Oh, duma.

381
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,477
Way to go, killer.

382
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,714
Looks like you kids have
your work cut out for you.

383
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,550
How's she ever gonna
learn how to hunt

384
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,519
if all she wants to do
is go for a Sunday drive?

385
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,669
Well, mom was saving this
roast for a special occasion.

386
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,236
Here we go.
All right.

387
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,471
Come on.
All right, we got it.

388
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,239
Come on, guys.
Chase it, girl.

389
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,808
Come on, duma.

390
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,312
There you go. Come on.

391
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,647
Get it away from her, Ted.

392
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,915
Come on, girl.
Come on.

393
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,383
Now duma is getting me too.

394
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,685
Throw it up.
Go and get it.

395
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,521
Throw it up.

396
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,923
Come on. Chase, chase.

397
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,892
There you go, duma.

398
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,704
Oh, wow!

399
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,706
She caught it.

400
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,375
Okay, here we go.

401
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,944
All right,
we got some gazelle.

402
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,545
A whole herd of the suckers.

403
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,781
Do you think she's
gonna know what to do?

404
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,282
Well, we have a saying.

405
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,218
When rain falls
on a leopard,

406
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,420
spots do not wash away.

407
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,789
But, morogo,
duma's a cheetah.

408
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:59,558
It's also sunny,
but that's not the point.

409
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:03,095
Okay, enough
with the sayings.

410
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:06,365
Come on. Come on.

411
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,967
Okay.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,402
Why don't you go grab yourself
a gazelle burger

413
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:16,008
and we'll go find
some ringside seats.

414
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,560
I see her.

415
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,428
Where?

416
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:41,500
Oh, there she is.

417
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,969
I can't believe it.

418
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:47,573
Duma's going for it
on her very first try.

419
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,308
Oh, whoa,
look at that, guys!

420
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,444
Go, duma!

421
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,347
She's nearly got it.
She pounces!

422
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's not pretty,

423
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,517
but that's nature
in the raw--

424
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,486
ah! What the--

425
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,858
that was not our duma.

426
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,762
Ted.

427
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:14,133
What are you laughing at?

428
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,539
Duma?

429
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,080
Duma!

430
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,999
She's always come back before.

431
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,168
That's a good sign.

432
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,338
Tonight, she's exploring
and even hunting.

433
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,573
Isn't that what you've been
training her for?

434
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,810
Yeah, but, um, what if
something happened to her?

435
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,179
I mean, she could be hurt
or something.

436
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,014
You know what I think's
really worrying you?

437
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,384
That she might leave before
you can say goodbye.

438
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,021
Well, we've raised her since
she was a baby, mom.

439
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:13,025
It would be awful
if she just left.

440
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,594
When you love something,
loss can be

441
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,431
a part of the bargain, Ted.

442
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,900
Come on.

443
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,869
Let's go inside.

444
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,580
Susie, she's back.

445
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,817
I wonder if she caught anything
for dinner last night.

446
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,262
I'm glad you're back,
sweetie.

447
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,599
But I wish you'd learn
to hunt for yourself.

448
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,813
As I was saying, abdallah,
every schoolchild knows

449
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,614
the cheetah is the world's
fastest runner.

450
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,616
But not so many
people know

451
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,952
that cheetah has no endurance.

452
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,553
She tires quickly.

453
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,089
So we are planning
to make the race too long

454
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,491
for cheetah and
then bet against her.

455
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:20,759
Yes, quite neat, really.

456
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,162
Nobody will ever guess
that the owners

457
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,931
are betting against
their own cheetah.

458
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,498
When she runs out of steam,

459
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,068
it's the owners
who collect the money.

460
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,237
In addition to your share
of the purse, abdallah,

461
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,975
as a bonus, after the race
you can keep her.

462
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,409
Good.

463
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,012
That skin will
bring me much money.

464
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,948
No long faces now.

465
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,350
You're saying goodbye to a
wonderful time in your lives,

466
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,186
but there's lots of excitement
to look forward to.

467
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,522
Oh, more exciting than going
exploring with morogo?

468
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,324
Or having a cheetah
for a pet?

469
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,527
No, Ted, there are different
kinds of excitement.

470
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,296
How about a toast
to everything

471
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,131
you've had a chance
to experience this year

472
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,968
and to David's family
who are next in line.

473
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,002
Hear, hear.

474
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,136
And to morogo.

475
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,604
Couldn't be here
because he had

476
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,373
a previous engagement
with some goats.

477
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,480
All right, patel,
where's this cheetah of yours?

478
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,814
You said it would be here.

479
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,484
I said I thought
it would be here.

480
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,152
The cat is tame.

481
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,354
It is ordinarily sleeping
in the yard.

482
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,456
Oh, not tonight.

483
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,691
The boy.

484
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,493
The boy calls the cat
with a whistle.

485
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,828
If one of us could get
that whistle--

486
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,834
so beautiful.
Superior cake.

487
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,504
Oh, thank you.
16 degrees above the equator.

488
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,705
Very good.

489
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,673
Mom, that was very symbolic,
i think.

490
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,043
Cutting us right out,
aren't you?

491
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,546
How about we all go
in the living room?

492
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:25,851
Good idea.

493
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,020
Listen, honey, this is
a pretty special occasion.

494
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,956
You think the kids are
old enough to try champagne?

495
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,723
I most certainly do not.

496
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,859
What about the grown-ups?

497
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,062
Ted, how about
a little more music, huh?

498
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,231
Sure. I haven't packed
all my records yet.

499
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,433
If you don't mind something
a little more African, dad.

500
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,235
It is our last night.

501
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,440
Well, you've got
to take your kids on safari

502
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,608
like we did, David.

503
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,476
Ted and Susan just loved it.

504
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,015
What's the matter, Ted?

505
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,583
I thought I heard something.

506
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,652
Must have been my imagination.

507
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,686
She is ours.

508
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,191
Duma!

509
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,864
Duma!

510
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,036
I don't like the looks
of this.

511
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,704
Well, let's not lose
our heads.

512
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,573
She stayed out a couple
of nights ago.

513
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,175
Yeah, but she was back
by morning.

514
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,343
Well, maybe she's
making progress.

515
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,545
Maybe.

516
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,115
Except my whistle's missing.

517
00:33:56,468 --> 00:34:01,006
This is for you.

518
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,542
When the river divides,

519
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,213
its waters are not so sweet.

520
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,881
I knew you'd have a saying
for today, morogo.

521
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:14,253
This one even you know
what it means.

522
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:19,291
And this means
though we are far apart,

523
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,528
our spirits share
the same earth

524
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,064
and the same sky.

525
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:30,169
We're never gonna
forget you, morogo.

526
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,243
The way duma left
was too sudden.

527
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,310
I know it.

528
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,045
Ted, you're looking
for a human end

529
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,647
to the relationship.

530
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,082
Now that's just not
a reasonable expectation.

531
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,318
Duma loved us,
but as a cheetah.

532
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:49,588
She depended on us and then left
home when the time was right.

533
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,089
Exactly.

534
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,925
You two did what
you had to do.

535
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,127
Come on now.

536
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,430
You should be proud
of yourselves.

537
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,232
If we take this road,

538
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,134
we should be at my camp
by nightfall.

539
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,769
It's not a bad road.

540
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,437
There's a little stretch here
with a few potholes.

541
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,938
Mr. Patel?

542
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,940
Oh, good morning, professor.
Good morning.

543
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,242
Could we get some petrol,
please?

544
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,977
Certainly, professor.
Certainly.

545
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,612
Petrol.
Petrol for you.

546
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,783
Kids, get yourselves whatever
you want for the plane.

547
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,986
The young missus finding it
a sad day

548
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,656
leaving this splendid country,
losing her pet?

549
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,757
What did you say?

550
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,793
I recall you intended

551
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,161
to release her
in cheetah valley.

552
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,662
Therefore I'm assuming--

553
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,964
but you said "lose."

554
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,767
Perhaps I did not choose
the most precise word,

555
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,004
but does it not do justice
to how the miss feels?

556
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,226
The tread marks
were the same!

557
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,561
It's the guy who killed
duma's mother.

558
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,163
And what about that
"losing your pet" business?

559
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,832
Oh, Ted,
Mr. Patel is a foreigner.

560
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,334
He made a slip of the tongue.

561
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,135
He's got a better vocabulary
than we do.

562
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,037
Besides, what makes him
think Susan

563
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,672
was crying because of duma?

564
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,341
Patel knows that duma's
one of the family.

565
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,542
Right!

566
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,909
When he tried to buy her

567
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:18,977
and that demonstrates
motivation.

568
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,746
Ted, now let this thing go.

569
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,181
You're trying to build a case
that just isn't there.

570
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,750
And it doesn't take
a Freud to figure out

571
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,185
that you're looking for
a reason to stay in Kenya.

572
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,855
Now let's just try
and be mature about this.

573
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,425
Ah, Ted.

574
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:35,093
We'll be joining you
in a month.

575
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,428
I know you guys will be fine.

576
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,597
Grandma will be waiting
at the airport.

577
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,866
You'll be okay.

578
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,368
Dad!

579
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,936
Will the two of you try
and cheer up, please?

580
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,239
I'll bet you anything duma
will be waiting there for us

581
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,040
as soon as your mom
and I get home.

582
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,409
Yeah, we'll take charge
of releasing her.

583
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,210
I know it's not
what you hoped for,

584
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,413
but at least we'll have done
right by her, huh?

585
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,548
Smile and a kiss?

586
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,949
Come here, honey.

587
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,718
I love you, honey.
I love you, daddy.

588
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,253
I'm right, you know?

589
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,255
You heard dad, Ted.
Let it go.

590
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,123
Just listen to the facts.

591
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,893
One, we know patel wanted duma.

592
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,928
Two, she suddenly disappears.

593
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,897
Three, patel mentions
that she's lost

594
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,432
when there's no way he could
have known about that!

595
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,733
Shh!

596
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,402
Four, the guy
at patel's store

597
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,270
was wearing shoes
with the same tread

598
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,272
as what we found when duma's
mother was killed.

599
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,408
Five, did you see the look
on the shoe guy's face

600
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,276
when patel made the slip
about losing our pet?

601
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,912
- No, I didn't.
- Trust me.

602
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,046
Where was I?

603
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,115
Six, my missing whistle.

604
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,550
Ted, the way you pack,

605
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,084
it's a miracle
you can find anything.

606
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,152
No, I put it
in my desk drawer.

607
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,421
How can you be so sure?

608
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,755
Darn it, Susan.

609
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,457
I made a point of putting it
there last night.

610
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,060
I planned to give it to morogo
as a goodbye present.

611
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,595
Really?

612
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,263
Yes!

613
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,233
Okay, I believe you.

614
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,468
What?

615
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,836
Patel took duma.

616
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,070
What can we do about it?

617
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,439
May I have your tickets,
please?

618
00:37:55,106 --> 00:38:00,145
Um... Well, actually,
me and my sister--

619
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,113
"my sister and I."

620
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,582
We're a little confused.

621
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,752
Um, this is the flight
to Beijing, isn't it?

622
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,286
That was great, Ted.

623
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,622
These tickets cost dad
a lot of money.

624
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,023
Refundable.

625
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,525
What about our luggage?

626
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,026
On the plane.

627
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,294
When we get to L.A.,
our underwear

628
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,629
will be there to greet us.

629
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,130
What about grandma?

630
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,667
Isn't she supposed
to meet us at lax?

631
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:29,608
Well, I think that was a
wonderful experience for them.

632
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,277
I just wish they hadn't taken
duma's leaving so hard.

633
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,280
Now, honey, it's all part
of growing up.

634
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,282
Oh, Earl,
i think I see them!

635
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,884
- Where?
- Isn't that Susan waving?

636
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,118
- Oh, yeah.
- See right there?

637
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,453
- See? Bye!
- Bye!

638
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,589
- Bye!
- Bye, kids!

639
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,530
- "Dear mom--"
- no, skip "dear."

640
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,331
Deal with telegrams
is keep 'em short.

641
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,467
Seems awfully chilly.

642
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,468
All right.

643
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:58,404
"Plans changed.
Kids arrived later."

644
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:01,473
No, dad would say,
"kids departure delayed."

645
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,341
Oh, okay.
"Kids departure delayed."

646
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,377
That's better. "Delayed.

647
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,546
- Will advise."
- Nice touch.

648
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,714
Thanks.

649
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,181
"Advise."

650
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,183
That's it. "Love, dad."

651
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,519
Sheer genius, Ted.

652
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:16,021
He writes to his mother
and signs it "dad"?

653
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,056
Force of habit.
Sign it "Earl."

654
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,726
Done.

655
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,271
Wow, how much have you got?

656
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,340
About 50 shillings.

657
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,710
It's not gonna
get us very far.

658
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,546
We're loaded
with traveler's checks.

659
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:47,085
Amazing our mom trusts us
to let us buy

660
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,054
our own back-to-school
clothes.

661
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,423
Ted, I hope we haven't
done all this

662
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:53,792
for some stupid
wild goose chase.

663
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,393
Don't worry.

664
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,095
As soon as we find duma,
it'll all be worth it.

665
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,298
Besides, what's the worst thing
that mom and dad can do to us?

666
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,601
Put us up for adoption.

667
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,266
Well, never thought
I'd see this place again.

668
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,671
Good afternoon.

669
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,272
How may I help?

670
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,609
Is Mr. Patel here?

671
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,010
Uh, no.

672
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,578
My cousin left abruptly.

673
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:49,080
I bet. Fact number seven.

674
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,448
We need to speak
to Mr. Patel.

675
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,150
Can you tell us how
to reach him, please?

676
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,952
Regretfully not.

677
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,622
He's on retreat and does not
wish to be disturbed.

678
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,456
Well, it's kind of important.

679
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,293
You see, we, um--

680
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,663
we have some money
for Mr. Patel.

681
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:07,432
Our parents asked us
to deliver it.

682
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,301
Uh, you may entrust it
to my care.

683
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,203
I am happy to send it
to him.

684
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:15,340
Well, thank you,
but we need to sign them

685
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,976
and give them to him personally.

686
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:21,847
This is indeed a conundrum.

687
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,482
I'm sure he'd want you
to tell us,

688
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,685
especially since
we're leaving Africa.

689
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:31,489
There won't be another chance
to give him his money.

690
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:35,727
He is in a camp near
thomson's falls.

691
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:40,866
I am to write to him
care of general delivery...

692
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:41,933
Jamhuri.

693
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,003
Jamhuri?

694
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,838
Jamhuri.

695
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,875
Thank you.

696
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,145
Not bad.

697
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,681
I sweated it out of him.

698
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,817
How much progress
have we really made here?

699
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,720
Do you have any idea how
to get to the jamhuri?

700
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,722
Look, if we're out
on the road hitching,

701
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,057
you just know mom and dad are
gonna be the first to stop.

702
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,859
This is indeed a conundrum.

703
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,530
We need some help, suse.

704
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,865
Sure.

705
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,281
Well, cheetah...

706
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:33,251
You've got some more work
to do today.

707
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,887
Are you going to be
a naughty girl?

708
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,646
All right, he's in there.

709
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,814
The only problem is so
is everybody else.

710
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,249
Does it matter?

711
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,751
You bet it does.

712
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,754
Look, this is strictly
a need-to-know operation.

713
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,762
Hey, the beeper,
African style.

714
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,387
Morogo.
Psst!

715
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,459
Over there. Come on.

716
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,038
Jamhuri?

717
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,372
I know where it is.

718
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,674
Maybe a two-day walk.

719
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,375
But you could do it?
You know how?

720
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,610
No way, José.

721
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,312
Morogo, to save duma's life?

722
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:08,546
My father would
be most angry

723
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,981
with such mzungu foolishness.

724
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,316
I cannot go.

725
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,650
Look, our parents
are gonna

726
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,386
be really mad at us,
but we can handle that.

727
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,487
Can you tell us
how to do it?

728
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,656
Whoa, whoa, Ted, Ted.

729
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,325
You are not
seriously suggesting

730
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,293
that we go ahead on our own,
are you?

731
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,729
If it's the only way, yes.

732
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,832
Okay, you remember
the blue dukkha?

733
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,335
Okay, go to the blue dukkha,
follow the sun.

734
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,370
You see a big pile of rocks

735
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,239
just at the top
of devil's gate.

736
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,674
Devil's gate.
Devil's gate?

737
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:43,581
Ted, this is nuts.

738
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,351
This is absolutely
looney tunes.

739
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,219
Look,
we are two kids from L.A.

740
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,687
About to spend
two days walking

741
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,422
through
the uncharted wilderness

742
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:56,161
where animals eat kids
from L.A.

743
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,029
Your heart is
in the right place and all,

744
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,165
but we are not going
to survive.

745
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,768
That's not gonna help duma
or us.

746
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,669
- I think if we just--
- look!

747
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,705
Suse, that's that big pile
of rocks

748
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,574
that morogo was
telling us about.

749
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,442
This is devil's gate.

750
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,711
We're doing okay.

751
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,462
Duma.

752
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,265
Duma.

753
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:35,700
The first lesson
she must learn

754
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,403
is that there is no escape.

755
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,806
Then we will train her
to race.

756
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,474
But we need to know
exactly how far

757
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:44,742
she can run before tiring.

758
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:48,613
Yes, yes.
We have an odometer.

759
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,782
She may resist.

760
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,583
She must learn
that she's powerless

761
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:54,385
and we are powerful.

762
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,788
Let's begin now.

763
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,671
Well, you didn't get
very far.

764
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,874
You're a lazy pussycat.

765
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,044
We've only been
at this for three hours

766
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,146
and it's gonna be dark soon.

767
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,384
Yeah, and sunset is feeding
time in Africa.

768
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,818
Okay.

769
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,687
Okay, we need a place
to crash for the night.

770
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,523
Now what would morogo do
in a situation like this?

771
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,692
Morogo had the good sense
not to get in

772
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,862
a situation like this.

773
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,878
Think the kids are okay?

774
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:29,414
They were so upset
about leaving.

775
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,648
Oh, sure.

776
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,983
Seeing old friends again.

777
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,351
Getting ready for school.

778
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,719
They're having a great time.

779
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,527
Ted!

780
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,563
Ted, this is totally insane.

781
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,698
We are entirely
without resources.

782
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,200
We don't know what
we're doing.

783
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:50,668
Now wait a minute.

784
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,669
Do you have any idea
what we're gonna

785
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,004
eat or drink today?

786
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,839
Well, I thought about that.

787
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,374
Do you really think that
morogo's instructions

788
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,943
are gonna get us to jamhuri?

789
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,045
Now that you mention it,
they were a little vague.

790
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,846
If one of us gets bitten
by a snake,

791
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,848
do you know lethal
from non-lethal?

792
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,750
No, not exactly.

793
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:07,385
Look, I don't like it either,

794
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,388
but it's time to admit we
are out of our depth here.

795
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,558
I think we should go back and
tell mom and dad everything.

796
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:14,759
Absolutely not.

797
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,061
It's not going
to be pleasant,

798
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:17,762
but it beats dying
of exposure

799
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,064
or getting eaten by something.

800
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,565
Right, right.
You're absolutely right.

801
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:21,933
Thank you.

802
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,268
The only problem
is there's something

803
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,036
moving around down there.

804
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:36,948
Morogo!

805
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:38,749
- Jambo, dudes.
- Morogo!

806
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,618
Oh, morogo,
you don't know how glad

807
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,886
we are to see you,
little buddy.

808
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,554
I worried about my friends.

809
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,125
Maybe you need some help,
so I brought everything we need.

810
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,263
You all right?

811
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:54,232
Yeah.

812
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,167
Here.

813
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,506
Weren't your mom and dad
upset about you coming?

814
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,773
They don't know yet.

815
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:04,409
We're in the same boat.

816
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,011
Boat? No.

817
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:09,480
Now got much walking to do.

818
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,016
Walking.
Boat.

819
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,818
I knew that.
Yet to say "boat--"

820
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:18,990
I'm so thirsty.

821
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,258
Do you think we can drink that?

822
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,027
I don't think you'd want to.

823
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,629
How'd you manage to find us
way out here, morogo?

824
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:29,134
Every animal in the bush
knows where you are.

825
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,830
I don't suppose we're getting
close to jamhuri?

826
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,532
Good joke, Susan.

827
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:04,001
Now we begin.

828
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:05,303
Begin?

829
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,837
Oh, this is awful.

830
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:08,673
Lighten up, Susan.

831
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,708
You went on a safari
with your parents.

832
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,410
What's the big deal this time?

833
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,046
Because on that safari,
we slept in tents.

834
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,749
We had bug spray, lanterns,
a Coleman stove.

835
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,220
We had stuff to eat.

836
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,823
And our guide didn't make us
climb any mountains either.

837
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,093
My mom likes thing safe
and controlled.

838
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,095
I'm beginning to realize
that she has a point.

839
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,530
But you call that a safari?

840
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,566
Sounds like you took
your whole house with you.

841
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,771
Exactly.

842
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,039
Aah!

843
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,842
Come on, Susan.

844
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,078
No time for sightseeing.

845
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,929
She cannot eat through
the cage, abdallah.

846
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,797
That's the point.

847
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:10,735
If she's angry
and she's hungry,

848
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,070
then she chases
the rabbit better.

849
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,072
Like some food, cat?

850
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,141
Too bad.

851
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,908
You've got to earn it.

852
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,121
A root.

853
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,264
Now it's your turn.

854
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,637
Does it taste
as bad as it smells?

855
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:47,905
It's wet.

856
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,776
That's all I care about.

857
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,679
Oh, excuse me.

858
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,514
Come.
Many hours to go.

859
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:57,982
Couldn't we just rest
a little while longer?

860
00:51:58,015 --> 00:51:59,116
My feet are killing me.

861
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,486
No.
Think of poor duma.

862
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:34,619
Come here, cat.

863
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,188
Come on, duma.
Back in the box.

864
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,134
Now we cross for jamhuri.

865
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,238
Morogo, those hippos,
are they dangerous?

866
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,172
Only when they are hungry.

867
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,475
Yeah, but what
do they eat, morogo?

868
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,477
Whatever they find
in the river.

869
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,017
I just hope they're
vegetarians.

870
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,033
All right, come on.

871
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:25,069
Come on, guys.
Keep moving.

872
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,227
Smooth moves, mzungus.

873
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,742
Guys, look,
i got to stop.

874
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:08,479
I'm hungry, I'm soaked,
and I'm dead on my feet,

875
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:11,215
which happen to feel
like lead weights.

876
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,751
Well, I'm beyond hungry.
I'm starving.

877
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,120
Good.
Starving is good.

878
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:19,324
Now we can make a fire
and talk about food.

879
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,930
You sorry we're doing this?

880
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,498
No.

881
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:30,267
Just not sure
we're right to do it.

882
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,140
So what do you got
for us, huh?

883
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,609
Roots and berries?

884
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,445
No. Termites.

885
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,112
Termites?

886
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:44,081
You expect us to eat termites?

887
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,116
I think we can count
two no votes on that

888
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,685
they give strength.

889
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:49,119
I don't care.

890
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:52,523
Termites are insects.

891
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,525
Eww.
Eww.

892
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,793
How can you do that?

893
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,528
Mzungu eat fish.

894
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:00,998
Put fish in mouth,
can put anything in mouth.

895
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,304
They're really not too bad?

896
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,138
Mmm.

897
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:10,408
Very not too bad.

898
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:20,150
Suse, they're not
even dead yet.

899
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:22,219
Duma's depending on us.

900
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:26,991
We need the protein.

901
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,894
How are they really?

902
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,829
Remember that time
grandma made us

903
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,398
steak and kidney pie?

904
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,735
This is worse.

905
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:57,655
You know, Dave,
if we adjust the telemetry

906
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,590
of the whole burg,
we'd probably get that downlink

907
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:01,692
on that one
eccentric transponder.

908
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,061
Sounds like the same scenario
we had in Australia last year.

909
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,197
Yeah.

910
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:10,034
- Uh, Earl?
- Uh-huh?

911
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,402
We seem to have a visitor.

912
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:13,070
Oh?

913
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,407
He's got a spear, Earl.

914
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:17,842
Oh.

915
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,510
Jambo.

916
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:22,046
Earl Johnson.

917
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,048
Yes, I know.

918
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,617
What can I do for you?

919
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:30,888
No. It's what we can do
for each other, Earl Johnson.

920
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:33,891
I know your wife must
have made a mistake.

921
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:38,228
I put the kids on the plane
myself and I saw it take off.

922
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,631
Mom. Hi, it's Earl.

923
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:43,601
Yes, mom, I know
it's a good connection.

924
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:47,404
Mom, this is gonna sound
like a silly question, but--

925
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,107
telegram?

926
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,611
What telegram?

927
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,420
Wow.

928
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:05,322
This is not good.

929
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,625
Wind brings our smell
to elephant.

930
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,627
That big one
is magnificent.

931
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,261
He's also angry.

932
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,396
Angry at us?

933
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,831
You want to ask him?

934
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,065
I do not.

935
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,672
Uh, guys,
he's coming towards us.

936
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:25,142
Um, hey, what's our best move?

937
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,545
Morogo!

938
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,115
What's he gonna do
if he catches us?

939
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,985
Go this way.
Come on, Ted.

940
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,487
Come on!

941
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,454
Ted!

942
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,289
Faster! It's coming!

943
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:43,794
I'm coming!

944
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,029
Which way should we go?

945
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,430
- Turn this way.
- Oh!

946
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,699
Whoa, morogo.
Watch your spear.

947
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:50,801
Look out!

948
00:57:57,675 --> 00:58:01,045
I think he really liked
you guys.

949
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:03,848
That was stupendous!

950
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:12,690
I don't know
where patel is

951
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,560
and that guy in there wouldn't
give me the time of day.

952
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,869
Hello, again.

953
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,403
I've brought my friend.

954
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:30,207
We're both very eager
to locate Mr. Patel.

955
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,876
Very eager.

956
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,043
Isn't that so, kipoin?

957
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:35,379
Ha!

958
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,983
Jamhuri.

959
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,217
Excuse me?

960
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,152
Jamhuri. Jamhuri.

961
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,688
And now please
to leave store.

962
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:44,855
I am closing.

963
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,356
I want to lock the door.

964
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,392
I am closing
until further notice.

965
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,894
Please leave.

966
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:03,874
Morogo, I'm almost
afraid to ask, but--

967
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,743
yes, Susan. Jamhuri.

968
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,377
We made it?

969
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:09,246
We really made it?

970
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,516
All right!

971
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,384
That's it?
That's jamhuri?

972
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:16,220
That's not even worth putting
on a map.

973
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:24,428
We have come to jamhuri,
but where is duma?

974
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:26,563
Well, that guy
in the store that patel

975
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,733
was staying near...
Thomson's falls.

976
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,767
That's right.

977
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,401
Do you have any idea
where that is?

978
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,437
Hakuna matata.
No problem.

979
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,219
Right. Yes.

980
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,789
So you'll call us as soon
as you get any information?

981
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:56,260
Okay, the police
are on the case.

982
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,461
And so are we, Earl.

983
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:59,263
They're our kids.

984
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,264
I'm not gonna sit
around here

985
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:01,966
hoping someone else finds them.

986
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,901
Now there's only
one road to jamhuri.

987
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,004
I suppose we could probably
overtake them on the way.

988
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,572
We go now.

989
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,309
Looks like both our wives
are insisting, kipoin.

990
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:34,298
Not exactly guarded
like fort Knox.

991
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:38,468
If poachers live here,
we must be very careful.

992
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:41,305
We open the gate,
we make big noise.

993
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,508
Wait, morogo,
what are you talking about?

994
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,984
What do you know?

995
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,953
Homemade security system.

996
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,022
Come on.

997
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:11,535
There he is.

998
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,337
Look, abdallah,
it holds up.

999
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,140
It's all ready.
You see that?

1000
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,008
That's patel.

1001
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,910
I was right.

1002
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,378
Come on.

1003
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,517
All right, how many
of the enemy can there be?

1004
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,720
Patel and the shoe guy,
right?

1005
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,588
That's two of them
and there's three of us.

1006
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,190
What are you thinking,
Ted?

1007
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,524
We're gonna go in there
and take them out?

1008
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,360
Let's wait for night,

1009
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:39,363
then we'll go in
and look for duma.

1010
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,790
What if that truck
comes back?

1011
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,392
Susan, I'll stay here and
watch for the bad guys.

1012
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,060
You go in and look for duma.

1013
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:11,561
Okay, but be careful.

1014
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:12,997
You too.

1015
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,340
"Pete patel presents
the ultimate race.

1016
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:59,009
Cheetah versus greyhound."

1017
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,610
What a creep!

1018
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,612
This is why patel wanted duma.

1019
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,482
That's her.

1020
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,651
That's duma.

1021
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,626
Oh!

1022
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,963
Sweetheart.

1023
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,630
Oh.

1024
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:22,032
What have they done to you?

1025
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:24,601
Hey.

1026
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,603
How we gonna
get her out of here?

1027
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,605
It's a combination lock.

1028
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,940
We'll have to break
the lock somehow.

1029
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,976
I'll go get something.

1030
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,610
Duma, hi.

1031
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,171
Find something, suse?

1032
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,512
Oh, the thought of our kids
out here alone at night.

1033
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:09,846
Honey, they're to alone.

1034
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,181
Morogo is with them.

1035
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,583
But our son has
never been out

1036
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,552
at night like this before.

1037
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:31,068
Well, what do we do now?

1038
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:39,043
The authorities
have long wanted me.

1039
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:41,845
These children know too much.

1040
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,514
If i-- if I'm understanding
you correctly,

1041
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,950
I cannot countenance this.

1042
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:47,918
There's no time
to argue about it now.

1043
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,619
Let's wait till
after the race.

1044
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,621
What do we do
with them meanwhile?

1045
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54,724
A cage, of course.

1046
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:56,593
Yes. Good.

1047
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,096
Then we leave
for Nairobi immediately.

1048
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,603
Let's get a move on,
abdallah.

1049
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,938
I must get my tools.

1050
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,253
Bit of bad luck,
those children turning up.

1051
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,122
Yes, for them.

1052
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,119
Ha!
Good work, mzungus.

1053
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:56,286
Morogo!

1054
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,787
We need some help, morogo.

1055
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,256
Do you know what
a wire cutter is?

1056
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,625
No, wait. Here.

1057
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:06,130
38 right, 24 left, 30 right.

1058
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,697
Huh?

1059
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:09,133
When they opened the cage,

1060
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,834
all I did was pay attention.

1061
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:14,804
We've got to find
a way to get to Nairobi now.

1062
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,606
Jamhuri must have
a police station.

1063
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,042
Why don't go file a report?

1064
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:20,177
No, because by the time
it takes the police

1065
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,612
to get out to that guy's camp
and confirm our story,

1066
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,648
file forms in triplicate,
duma's gonna become

1067
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,150
a wall hanging
just like her mother.

1068
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,385
Ted's right.
We go to Nairobi right away.

1069
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,654
Fine, but how are we
supposed to get there?

1070
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,022
Well, we can hitchhike.

1071
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,658
I know it may take a while,
but--

1072
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:41,498
Two Americans and one tribal boy
near jamhuri.

1073
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,333
We told your father
it wouldn't take long.

1074
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,803
You can contact them
at the police station.

1075
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,905
Want anything?

1076
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,175
Yeah.
I need a bathroom.

1077
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,478
Ah, the police station
is only 20 minutes away.

1078
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,813
I can't wait that long.

1079
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,715
Oh, me either.

1080
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:14,131
I'll be waiting.

1081
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,421
This truck better
be going to Nairobi.

1082
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,357
Duma's race starts soon.

1083
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,576
I'm really very sorry.

1084
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,145
But now at least we know
they are all right.

1085
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:36,613
Yeah, but where were
they headed?

1086
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:37,947
What are they up to?

1087
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:40,484
I think I know.
Take a look at this.

1088
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,287
A cheetah race?
Against greyhounds.

1089
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,455
But this race starts
in two hours.

1090
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:47,691
I don't think you
can make it in time.

1091
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:49,959
But perhaps we can
radio ahead,

1092
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,661
set up a roadblock--

1093
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:53,297
you do whatever
you have to do.

1094
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,798
We're going to Nairobi downs.

1095
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,166
- Come on.
- But--

1096
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:01,104
and your parents and
the police are on your tail?

1097
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,872
Look, I know it sounds
incredible, mister,

1098
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,040
but it's true.

1099
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,141
The police had us in custody

1100
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,211
just a couple of minutes ago.

1101
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:10,447
Oh, in a sense, I'm
harboring fugitives right now.

1102
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,015
Isn't that right?

1103
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:14,551
Not to fret.

1104
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,654
Got into some scrapes myself
as a lad.

1105
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,790
And keeping your cheetah out
of a poacher's hands

1106
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,158
is a worthy cause.

1107
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:24,361
I'll get you to Nairobi downs!

1108
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,505
This Sunday will be ladies'
day at Nairobi downs.

1109
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,863
Thanks.

1110
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:00,864
Sorry to drop you here.

1111
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,532
Good luck with your cheetah!

1112
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:15,211
Where we gonna
get a taxi?

1113
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:17,046
I think this goes through
the market street.

1114
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,415
We can probably
get a cab there.

1115
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:21,418
Okay.

1116
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:33,963
You've broken all
of my Spears.

1117
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,565
You are going to pay for all--

1118
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,467
thank you. Sorry.

1119
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:39,569
Come--

1120
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:45,942
Stop him!

1121
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,511
Stop him! Stop him!

1122
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,985
Back in here.

1123
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:57,821
Hey, stop him!

1124
01:10:57,854 --> 01:10:59,589
Stop that young man!

1125
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:03,126
Hey, stop him! Hey!

1126
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:06,363
Stop him! Stop him!

1127
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,619
Morogo, over here!
Morogo!

1128
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,355
We're over here!
Morogo!

1129
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:34,257
Over here!
Morogo, it's okay.

1130
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,259
Downwind of the cars.

1131
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,961
Morogo, are you all right?

1132
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,463
Okay, come on.

1133
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:41,398
Wait.

1134
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,305
Eric's boy is sixth,

1135
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,274
sunny James loaf behind
in seventh place,

1136
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,477
Malakai bringing up the rear.

1137
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,945
No problem with this animal,
gentleman.

1138
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,982
As you can see,
she's quite tame.

1139
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:01,485
She has no taste
for greyhound fricassee.

1140
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,821
Win, lose, or draw,
it's all harmless fun.

1141
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:09,459
There's a taxi.

1142
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:11,395
Come on.

1143
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,201
Nairobi downs, please.

1144
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:21,004
Oh, you're going
to the cheetah race.

1145
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
before our fourth race,

1146
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,145
we would like to offer
for your entertainment,

1147
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,580
a special event.

1148
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,349
A race between
the fastest dogs in Kenya

1149
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:36,319
and the fastest animal
on the planet.

1150
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,855
This is an exhibition only,
ladies and gentlemen.

1151
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:40,690
No betting permitted.

1152
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,225
Seven to one.

1153
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,434
Getting much action,
old boy?

1154
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,502
Everybody thinks
the cheetah will win.

1155
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,238
When I remind them
there is

1156
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,907
no official betting,
they all offered

1157
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:00,109
to wager privately.

1158
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:02,746
They eat out of my hands.

1159
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:09,553
We are rich, Nigel.
We are rich.

1160
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,421
Good show.

1161
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:13,890
The results of the third race
are now official.

1162
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:19,362
The stewards have disqualified

1163
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:23,800
Nairobi downs racing association
wishes to thank

1164
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,069
patel enterprises for putting
on this exhibition.

1165
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,303
Is this seat taken,
old boy?

1166
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,239
Not a better picture.

1167
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,449
The officials have signaled
that the greyhounds

1168
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,218
and cheetah are
in their chutes.

1169
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,387
We're about to begin.

1170
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,957
And they're off.

1171
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:53,096
Oh, and the cheetah jumps out
to a remarkable lead.

1172
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:57,467
What a display of lightning
speed, ladies and gentlemen.

1173
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,508
And as they approach
the first bend,

1174
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,611
it's the cheetah
by six lengths.

1175
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:17,987
The cheetah is running away
with this race.

1176
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,093
Hold on.

1177
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,996
The cheetah's lead is down
to only three lengths.

1178
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,532
Can she be tiring already?

1179
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,701
Royal flush is gaining on her.

1180
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:38,441
And royal flush takes
the lead from the cheetah.

1181
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:43,312
Excuse me.

1182
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,281
There she is.

1183
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,316
Oh, too bad,
but that cheetah

1184
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,452
has run out of steam early.

1185
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,321
She's already out of the race.

1186
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:54,023
Royal flush and Sully
continue

1187
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:56,059
to battle it out
for the lead,

1188
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:58,862
with jolly o...

1189
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,831
What are you doing?

1190
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,332
Hey!

1191
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,806
Ted, it worked.

1192
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,507
She's coming this way.

1193
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,910
This is remarkable,
ladies and gentlemen.

1194
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:16,079
The cheetah has found
a second wind.

1195
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:20,183
We counted her out
prematurely.

1196
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:21,985
Something's gone wrong.

1197
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,187
The cheetah has caught up
with jolly o.

1198
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,190
She shows no signs of letting
up, ladies and gentlemen.

1199
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:30,226
She is right back
in this race.

1200
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,561
Wait.

1201
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:33,329
She's going right past us.

1202
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,497
I can't believe it.

1203
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,865
I think she's trying to win.

1204
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,667
Look at her fly.

1205
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,402
Go, duma!
Go, duma!

1206
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:41,170
Come on, girl!
You can do it!

1207
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,672
I know you can do it!

1208
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,674
Good grief!

1209
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,711
That cheetah's gonna
catch bunny.

1210
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:54,618
The cheetah's natural
hunting instincts

1211
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:58,421
have helped her to win it
by five lengths!

1212
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:12,201
How can we possibly
find them in this crowd?

1213
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:15,404
Do you see them?
There.

1214
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,540
Susan!
Mom!

1215
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,909
Morogo.

1216
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:22,411
Ted, are you all right?

1217
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:25,281
I'm okay.
Are you sure?

1218
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,559
Punish us later,
but we got to save duma first.

1219
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,094
What are you talking about?

1220
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:41,230
It's the guy who
skinned duma's mother.

1221
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,299
Come on. Let's go.

1222
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:12,862
Duma?

1223
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:13,963
Come here, duma.

1224
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,265
Come on.
Good girl.

1225
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,167
That's right.

1226
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,703
Uh-huh.

1227
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:21,671
Abdallah.

1228
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:27,376
We have been after you
a long time.

1229
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,614
Bad day for poachers,
eh, abdallah?

1230
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,116
I can't believe
you two did this!

1231
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,484
You were reckless!
You were irresponsible!

1232
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:36,953
You were disrespectful
of your parents

1233
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,521
and of your grandmother.

1234
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:04,513
Cheetah valley.

1235
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:06,182
It's weird, isn't it?

1236
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:08,684
After everything we went
through to get her back,

1237
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:10,419
we're gonna turn around
and give her up.

1238
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:11,654
At least we get
to say goodbye to her.

1239
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,656
And to each other.

1240
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,691
You know they've risked
so much for duma's sake.

1241
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:18,361
Why don't we all stay in Africa
this next month

1242
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:19,863
and keep duma with us
until we go?

1243
01:18:19,896 --> 01:18:21,731
I mean, we've had such
a wonderful time.

1244
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:23,867
Why should we end it
before we have to?

1245
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,935
Because it wouldn't
be fair...

1246
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:28,071
To duma or to us.

1247
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,538
- But, Ted--
- no.

1248
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:32,541
She's come so far,
and she's ready to hunt.

1249
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:33,877
That's right.

1250
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,779
Look, if we keep her now
and pretend

1251
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:37,713
everything's the way it was,

1252
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,548
what we went through
won't mean anything.

1253
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:44,020
If we really love her,
we have to let her go.

1254
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,588
Ted's right.

1255
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,590
We started the job.

1256
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,258
Now we have to finish it.

1257
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:51,127
Come on, duma.
Come on.

1258
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,902
Hey.

1259
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,269
Hey.

1260
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:01,771
Bye, duma.

1261
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:06,409
How are you supposed
to say goodbye to a cheetah?

1262
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:08,778
I think you already have,
suse.

1263
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:11,580
Look!

1264
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,116
Another duma!

1265
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,557
Go on.

1266
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,592
Go make friends.

1267
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:42,979
This isn't gonna be easy.

1268
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,356
Go away, duma.

1269
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:57,493
You have to leave now.

1270
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,864
Go, duma.

1271
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,632
You don't belong
with us anymore.

1272
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,835
Go away!

1273
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,640
Go away!

1274
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,859
Though we are far apart...

1275
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:32,661
Our spirits share
the same earth...

1276
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:34,830
And the same sky.
