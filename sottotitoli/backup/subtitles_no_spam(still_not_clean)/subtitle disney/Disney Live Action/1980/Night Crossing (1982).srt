1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,370
- East Germany,
August, 1961.

2
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,831
A divided nation watches
as its people stream across

3
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:18,376
a boundary from east to west
at the rate of 3,000 a day.

4
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:24,507
The east German regime
counters the mass exodus

5
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,634
with an act that startles
the world.

6
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,803
Military engineers erect
an enormous barrier

7
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:33,432
isolating a nation
of 17 million.

8
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,851
It is designed not
to keep enemies out,

9
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:40,188
but to keep its
own people in.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,524
The barricade of concrete
and barbed wire

11
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,776
cuts through villages
and farmlands

12
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:49,030
as it completely encircles
the nation of east Germany.

13
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:51,741
The border fences are equipped
with silent alarms

14
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:55,286
and automatically-firing
machine guns.

15
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:57,663
Beyond them is a corridor
three-miles wide

16
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:00,291
known as the east-west
border zone.

17
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,085
Movement within the zone
is highly restricted.

18
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:06,463
It is heavily patrolled
and seeded with land mines.

19
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,758
The entire area is designed to
discourage escape to the west

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,179
and it now works
to near perfection.

21
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,181
Today, only the very desperate
dare to risk

22
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:18,016
a crossing through
the border zone,

23
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:21,019
but east Germans
continue to try.

24
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,104
Some will succeed.

25
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,899
No one knows
how many will fail.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,151
This is the story
of one attempt.

27
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:39,203
*

28
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,488
- Sign right here.

29
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,325
Thank you.

30
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,869
Lukas!

31
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,329
- Hello, papa, Mr. wetzel,
Mr. strelzyk.

32
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:09,248
- Lukas, why aren't you
at school?

33
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,791
- Great honor, papa.

34
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,251
They excused Frederick
and me to carry out

35
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,128
this important mission
for the Republic.

36
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,629
Sign here.

37
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,839
- We already condemned
herr muller at work.

38
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,133
- Well, sign again.
Be twice as patriotic.

39
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:23,929
- Wasting a student's time
like this.

40
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,681
- Wouldn't you know
they'd honor me.

41
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,932
Who else in the class
has read

42
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,517
everything that muller
ever wrote?

43
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,477
- Shh.

44
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,479
- It's all right, papa.

45
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,815
Excuse me, ladies.

46
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:38,943
The people condemned the traitor
and the defector Horst muller.

47
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,488
Sign right here, please.

48
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,783
That's right.
Thank you, Mrs. meier.

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,760
Nothing like relaxing at
the end of a hard day's work

50
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,971
with good friends.

51
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:11,849
Some small talk, a joke or two,
a few laughs.

52
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,811
- Should never have signed.

53
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:20,608
- Instead of condemning muller,
we should be joining him.

54
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,693
- I asked for small talk.

55
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,320
- Talk, that's all
we ever do.

56
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,864
We're never gonna move.

57
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,533
- Well, we've plenty
of company.

58
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:33,495
Mentally, every man in this room
had his bags packed.

59
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,205
- Man alone has a chance,

60
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:37,082
but when there's a family--

61
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:40,001
- but, John, Lukas is ready.

62
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,461
- Impatient.

63
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,339
Finishes high school
in a few months and then what?

64
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,008
- Well, the army
of course.

65
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,346
He'll be sent to secure Russia's
border on China.

66
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,598
- A radical suggestion.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,892
Today we worked hard, hmm?

68
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,894
We're tired.
A little depressed.

69
00:04:57,935 --> 00:04:59,562
A little thirsty.

70
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:02,523
Sunday we'll all be together
for the picnic.

71
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:03,816
We'll be rested.

72
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,860
We can worry, plot, suffer.

73
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:09,947
What do you think?

74
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,824
- We've waited years.

75
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:15,577
What's a few more days?

76
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,995
Hello, frank.

77
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:20,040
- Papa.

78
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:32,844
- Math's okay.
Science.

79
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,679
The rest is--

80
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:38,099
- well, will it ever
be different?

81
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,269
- Government's change.

82
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,938
Frank, we know
how we feel

83
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,316
and you can say it out loud
to me or to your mother.

84
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,776
But to nobody else.

85
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:52,529
- Has it always been
this way?

86
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,074
- Since I can remember.

87
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:01,621
- Gonna pick up your mother.
She's shopping.

88
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:34,820
- Oh, wait.

89
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,822
- No, it's not worth
fighting over.

90
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,948
- I'm ashamed.

91
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,908
You take it, please.

92
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,743
Please.

93
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,787
- Thank you.

94
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,890
- Not "hello"
or "how was work?"

95
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,517
Or "did you have a nice day?"

96
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:07,852
Just "what's for dinner?"

97
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,898
Children only thinking
of themselves.

98
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,067
So what is for dinner?

99
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:27,287
- And the gentle trade winds
provide all the island's--

100
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:28,997
- you have schoolwork.

101
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:29,831
- Grandmama!

102
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:32,417
I learn more from television.

103
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,795
- We are not supposed to watch
west German television.

104
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,422
- Everybody does.

105
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:40,049
- Me too, but I don't
have schoolwork.

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,387
I baked those cakes
for your supper.

107
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:48,098
- Wish you lived here with us
all the time, grandmama.

108
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,684
- Don't flirt with me.

109
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:51,852
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, cakes!

110
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,229
- It's all right.
Supper's not quite ready.

111
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,732
- You'll spoil your supper.

112
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,400
- Well, well, well.

113
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,612
Honored by a visit
from pretzel, eh?

114
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:06,992
- Yes, mama.

115
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:12,622
It's just such a relief every
night to be home.

116
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:23,966
- Hi.

117
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,927
You have business
in the border zone?

118
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,762
- Just taking Karen home.

119
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:30,264
- Sign this.

120
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:31,682
- Here.
- All right.

121
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:32,850
Thank you, miss neihaus.

122
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,310
Visitors must be out
by 10:00 P.M.

123
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:38,897
And you're not permitted beyond
the neihause farm.

124
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,941
Go ahead.

125
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,131
- Good night, Lukas.

126
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,841
- Good night.

127
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:08,884
- See you tomorrow.

128
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:11,502
- Are they working late
on the road?

129
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,545
- No one advised us.

130
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,103
- Unauthorized vehicle
approaching.

131
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:05,136
Run!

132
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,644
- This way.
Over here.

133
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,812
Watch this wire.

134
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,823
- Stop!

135
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:45,842
- He's still alive, sir.

136
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:49,012
- Pick him up later.

137
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:51,890
We have more important
work here.

138
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:16,246
- Hey, wait a minute.

139
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,748
These are my old jeans.

140
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:18,915
- They're too small for you.

141
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:20,500
- Yeah, but they're
too big for you.

142
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,960
- They'll fit me too.

143
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,962
I feel taller already.

144
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,547
- Good morning.

145
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,298
- Morning, lieutenant.

146
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,845
Please.
Please.

147
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,888
Hans is the name.
Hans.

148
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,724
We are neighbors, Peter.
Friends.

149
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,434
You on your way to work?

150
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:39,977
- Yes.

151
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,938
- Your two assistants,
I believe?

152
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,815
- I have guenter wetzel
and Josef Keller, yes.

153
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,943
- Ah, Josef Keller.

154
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,695
An old friend.

155
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,822
We were in school together.
Now he works for you?

156
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,991
- Yes, he's a damn good
electrician.

157
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,244
- And the families,
they're close?

158
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:58,745
- Yes.

159
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,581
- The older boy Lukas,

160
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,750
good friend of yours?

161
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,919
- Yeah, we're
in school together.

162
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,420
The ftj.

163
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:10,965
- Lukas is very bright,
very popular, a leader.

164
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:15,595
You're one of his followers?

165
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:16,804
- I don't know what you mean.

166
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:19,974
Nothing to concern you.

167
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:23,060
Good day.

168
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:32,653
- Over here, Neil.

169
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:34,822
- Frank.

170
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:36,156
- Oh! Oh!
Yeah!

171
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:38,116
Give me that ball.

172
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:41,244
- Look at her.

173
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,580
Will that girl of mine
ever grow up?

174
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,959
- I hope not.

175
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,085
- Ah, you spoil her.

176
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:50,503
- We spoil each other.

177
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:53,631
- Oh, I've got to stop!

178
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:54,799
- Me too.

179
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,050
- Here.

180
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,803
Look at my boy!

181
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,306
- He's floating away.

182
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,433
- Next time I come over,

183
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:06,644
I'll bring balloons
for everybody

184
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,604
and some paint
for the adults.

185
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,648
- The border police will think
you're part of a plot.

186
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,608
- They don't care
what I bring in.

187
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,817
Only what I take out.

188
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,444
I wish you could bring us all

189
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:16,945
back in your purse, mama.

190
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,697
- It's almost big enough.

191
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:21,950
- If you wanted, Elsie,
you could come.

192
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:24,494
- Everybody I care about
is here.

193
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:27,288
- Richard, come on.
We're waiting.

194
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:38,966
- Let me.

195
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,886
- We shouldn't have come today.
We're spoiling the picnic.

196
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,262
- Look over here, Neil.

197
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:45,973
- I wish there was something
we could do.

198
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:49,018
- If only we knew where he is,
what's happened.

199
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:51,687
- Police didn't
tell you anything?

200
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:55,691
- They just asked questions
about Lukas.

201
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:58,694
Who is friends are,
what he reads.

202
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:04,699
Oh, Doris, I'm afraid.

203
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:09,329
- He'll be all right.
You'll see.

204
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,707
- "I'm tired of waiting
and hoping.

205
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:16,085
"Till we're together again
in a better place.

206
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,715
"Remember I love you all.

207
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:24,802
"We, like the eagles,
were born to be free.

208
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:28,138
Lukas."

209
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,266
- I found that in a copy

210
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:36,271
of Horst muller's poems
on his bed.

211
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:40,233
I knew he was desperate,
but...

212
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,235
I didn't do anything.

213
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,170
- Josef Keller.

214
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,766
Um, sorry to interrupt your
little outing,

215
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:18,895
but I have to ask Josef Keller
and his family to come with us.

216
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,273
Are they being arrested?

217
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,570
- If you'll just go to the cars,
we will explain.

218
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,280
- Our things.

219
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,283
- We'll take care of them.

220
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:12,780
- I keep seeing
those men today...

221
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:18,286
Taking Josef, magda,
and the children.

222
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:23,833
And we just stood there.

223
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:28,087
- It isn't right.

224
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:32,800
People weren't meant
to live like this.

225
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:37,137
- Lukas is dead.

226
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,848
He tried to cross the border
and was shot...

227
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,060
Many times.

228
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:47,605
They--

229
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:51,067
they showed me pictures.

230
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,654
Magda.

231
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:58,699
- They're so proud
of what they've done.

232
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:03,371
They have guns which don't need
to be fired by a person.

233
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:06,624
- Do you know...

234
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:09,960
Why they're keeping Josef?

235
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:12,880
- They blame us
for what happened.

236
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,799
We're bad parents.

237
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,593
We killed Lukas.

238
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:22,973
- Magda, you and the children
come and stay with us.

239
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,891
There's room.
- No.

240
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,601
Hmm.

241
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:30,480
You're kind,
but this is home.

242
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:36,319
We'll stay here...

243
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,821
Till Josef comes.

244
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:09,434
- Those same stars are shining
on people in Munich...

245
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,769
Frankfurt and Cologne.

246
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:18,776
- It's late.
Come on in.

247
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,904
- Doris, we have got
to get out.

248
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,743
Look at me.

249
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,579
- I understand how you feel.

250
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,792
Don't you feel the same?

251
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,293
Would you want to live
the rest of your life

252
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,794
in a place where they'll
do the same to you

253
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,629
as they're doing to magda?

254
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:42,132
- Magda is where she is because
of what Lukas did.

255
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:46,761
- Lukas simply reached
for what we all want.

256
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,847
- But look at what he's done
to that family.

257
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:52,559
- You can't blame the boy.

258
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,686
I blame the animals
that killed him.

259
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:56,396
I blame the pigs, bas--

260
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:57,897
- shh!

261
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:59,732
- Set up automated guns
and show pictures

262
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:01,817
of the boy's shattered body!

263
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,862
Yes, and I blame Josef,
who preached freedom and escape.

264
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:07,573
The only fault that Lukas ever
had was that he listened

265
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,074
and that he believed!

266
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:12,244
- Then we're all to blame.

267
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,538
Because we all talk about
freedom and escape

268
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,582
and we do nothing.

269
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,844
Wait another year till frank's
old enough to try it on his own?

270
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,387
Till they show you
pictures of frank

271
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:32,972
with his body riddled
with bullets?

272
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:35,892
- Don't.
Please don't.

273
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:43,482
- Hey, listen, listen...

274
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:46,986
I want it for us.

275
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,863
But more than anything,
I want it for the boys.

276
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,408
I want to give them
what should never

277
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:55,702
have been taken away
from them.

278
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:58,872
Like Lukas said in his note.

279
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:02,209
I want us all to be together
in a better place.

280
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,468
- I don't know yet.

281
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,971
But there's a way.

282
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:17,014
I'll find a way.

283
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:29,401
You're crazy!

284
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:31,070
We don't anything about it.

285
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,905
- We can learn.

286
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:34,907
I mean, compared
with building an airplane

287
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:36,909
or a helicopter,
it's simple.

288
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,411
Hot air is lighter
than cold air.

289
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:42,789
So we heat up the cold air
in a big sack made out of cloth

290
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:45,083
and logically,
the sack will rise.

291
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:48,378
- We build a burner.

292
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,296
Easy.

293
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,340
- No, it's not easy.
Nothing's easy.

294
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:53,716
But it is worth trying.

295
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:56,928
- How much material
to hold all that hot air?

296
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,930
- Well, I think
we could manage 1,000

297
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,058
to say 1,500 square yards.

298
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,435
- That's too expensive.
- I know.

299
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:07,730
And that's why I've withdrawn
all the cash from my savings.

300
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:10,774
- Building something this big
is going to take days,

301
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:11,942
weeks, months!

302
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:15,571
- But I'm an independent
contractor and you work for me.

303
00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:17,948
So we steal the time.

304
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,785
- You seem to have
all the answers.

305
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:23,787
People have always laughed
at great ideas.

306
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:25,956
- You want us to climb
into a balloon

307
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:27,374
and float away
to west Germany?

308
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:28,792
- Come on, it isn't funny
to make jokes

309
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,960
about going to the west.

310
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,213
- They're not joking.

311
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:35,631
- It's something we can get
the materials to build

312
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,258
and no one
will be expecting it.

313
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,303
It's so ridiculous.

314
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:42,471
What, eight of us
hanging up there?

315
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:49,311
- These are the plans.

316
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:50,896
We used various books,

317
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,565
including frank's
physics book

318
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:57,527
and a manual on the installation
of gas appliances.

319
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,821
- We'll need a bag
that can hold

320
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:02,657
70,000 cubic feet of hot air.

321
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:07,871
It'll take 1,250 square yards
of material.

322
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:10,039
- Will they sell you
that much fabric?

323
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,667
- Obviously we'll shop
where nobody knows us.

324
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,841
Oh, yes.
Yes.

325
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,092
Yes, we'll take that.

326
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,889
- Uh, 1,250 square yards.

327
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,727
- Gentlemen, if this
is your idea of a joke--

328
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,605
no.

329
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:35,981
I know it sounds
like a lot,

330
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:39,860
but we run a camping club
and we need it

331
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:41,236
to line the tents with.

332
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:48,702
Must be a very large club.

333
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:50,870
- It is.

334
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:53,748
With big tents.

335
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,797
- While I don't have it all,
but I'll give you what I have.

336
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,893
- Guenter, good evening.

337
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,437
- Hello, Mrs. roper.
- Hi.

338
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,690
You and Mr. strelzyk
have been shopping.

339
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:20,732
- Yes, we have.

340
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:21,942
- It's big.
Can I help you?

341
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:23,193
- No, no, no.
- It's quite all right.

342
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:24,402
We can manage.

343
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:25,737
- Excuse me.

344
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,031
- It's a rug.

345
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,282
- Of course.

346
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:32,076
It's that top Petra wanted
for the bedroom.

347
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:33,953
I can't wait to see it.

348
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:35,872
- No, no, later.
The children will be sleeping.

349
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:36,873
We wouldn't want to wake them,
would we?

350
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,875
Good night.
- Good night.

351
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,918
- Well, then good night.

352
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:46,257
- That woman never misses
a thing.

353
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,133
- Oh, she's only trying
to be a good neighbor.

354
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:50,261
- She also tries
to be a good party member.

355
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:53,055
She could be phoning
the ssd right now.

356
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,934
Is it for me?
- No, it's for--

357
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,771
you didn't buy all that here
in town, did you?

358
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:01,772
No.

359
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,524
- Can you two just
wait a minute?

360
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:05,942
This is heavy.

361
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,986
- Can I have it in my room,
please?

362
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:22,708
What are they doing, mama?
- Uh--

363
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,126
- it's a surprise.

364
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,711
- Yes, it's a surprise.

365
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:26,921
Come on.

366
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,215
Off to bed.

367
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,633
Say good night.

368
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,967
- Night-night.
- Night-night.

369
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,761
- Good night, Peter.
Good night, Andreas.

370
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:34,845
- Good night.

371
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:45,897
*

372
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,944
- Only if Petra gives us
three short ones.

373
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:56,715
It's taking her too long
to give us the "all clear."

374
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,133
- Wait.

375
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,469
Wait.

376
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,637
Here she comes.

377
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:11,688
- Mrs. roseler,
she brought you this.

378
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:13,523
- Oh.

379
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,733
Oh, what is it?

380
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,693
- Chicken broth.

381
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,612
She noticed you didn't go to
work yesterday or today,

382
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,072
so she knew you were sick.

383
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:23,574
- She notices too much.

384
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,534
- She asked about the motor.

385
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,911
I said what you told me
to say,

386
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,872
that you were using a compressor
to do some work at home.

387
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,416
I don't think she believed me.

388
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:35,919
Someday she'll be
at the door with the ssd.

389
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,379
- Then we'll be gone.

390
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:40,090
- Or out of
the balloon business.

391
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:48,682
- When do you think
you'll be finished?

392
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:50,725
- Tomorrow.

393
00:28:56,731 --> 00:29:01,152
[Muffled sewing machine
whirring]

394
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:22,589
It's finished.

395
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:29,429
We test it.

396
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:35,435
- Uh...

397
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:38,896
Peter found a spot...

398
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:40,857
With nobody around.

399
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:44,985
Oh!

400
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:47,404
My feet.

401
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:50,574
So sore.

402
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:54,411
I can hardly walk.

403
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,211
- We'll see.

404
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:06,089
- I never thought
you'd get this far with it.

405
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,929
- You think we'll really
try and go up in it?

406
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:14,973
- Uh-huh.

407
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:22,188
- It could go just high
enough to crash,

408
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,190
kill us all.

409
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:27,526
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:31,530
- Or suppose it catches fire...

411
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,658
Or explodes.

412
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,734
- We're just not getting
any air inside!

413
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:13,612
- And that's all the propane.

414
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,906
- Damn.

415
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:18,075
Maybe the burner
isn't strong enough.

416
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:19,618
- Yes, that's part of it,

417
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,703
but there's something else.

418
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:23,288
Come on, let's get out
of here.

419
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,915
Somehow we've got
to inflate the balloon

420
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:27,584
before we try
to heat the air.

421
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,349
- Yes.

422
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,102
- No trouble between
you and Peter?

423
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:49,355
- No.

424
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:51,815
- Lately he's been away
so much at night

425
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:54,193
and I know you're worried
about something.

426
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,236
- Peter and I are fine.

427
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:05,704
Mama, do you ever think
of applying to emigrate?

428
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:11,459
- One never knows
what's ahead.

429
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:12,794
- Well, I'm not
leaving poessneck

430
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:17,840
unless I have a better reason
than I have now.

431
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:24,764
- I'm going to win this game.

432
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,503
Josef, we didn't know
you were home.

433
00:32:57,503 --> 00:33:01,465
- Mr. Keller, this is an
extremely powerful painkiller.

434
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:04,552
- I hope so.

435
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,850
- We've--

436
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,852
we've tried to be close
to magda and the children.

437
00:33:13,894 --> 00:33:18,857
- I appreciate whatever
you did.

438
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:21,693
- And, uh, as soon
as you feel up to it,

439
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:26,114
then I'll certainly be glad
to have you back on the job.

440
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:29,200
- I won't be working
with you anymore

441
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:33,913
and I think it's best if the two
families don't see each other.

442
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:37,542
Just tell yourself
that Josef Keller

443
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,752
has an incurable disease.

444
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:41,796
Very contagious.

445
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,970
When a man
is in my condition,

446
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:55,017
the only way he can
be a friend is...

447
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:57,352
Not to be a friend.

448
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:59,229
- Yes.

449
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:01,356
Thank you.

450
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,574
- Good-bye.

451
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:15,745
- Bye, Josef.

452
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,934
- Peter.

453
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:40,769
How are you?

454
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:41,937
- Oh, I'm fine.

455
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:46,983
- Yes, I just added
to the frame

456
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,818
so that I can carry
more equipment.

457
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,945
- You work too hard.

458
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,780
Early, late.

459
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:54,866
I see you coming and going.

460
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:56,951
You only have one life.

461
00:34:56,993 --> 00:34:58,870
It's too short.

462
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:02,790
- Take time to enjoy a little.

463
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,838
Come on, tweedle.

464
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:14,343
- You're taking
too many chances.

465
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:16,220
- It'll soon be over.

466
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:18,722
- Peter--
- I know.

467
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:20,849
Guenter's waiting.

468
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:29,065
That's enough.
Cut the fan.

469
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:32,068
- It's looking good, Peter.
It really is.

470
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,903
- Damn burner!

471
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,321
Nothing goes right.

472
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:37,365
We still don't have
enough pressure.

473
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:43,037
- Another nozzle.
I don't know.

474
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,832
A different burner maybe.

475
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:50,836
- You know, maybe with
what we have to work with

476
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:53,505
there's just no way.

477
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:55,924
- There's a way.

478
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:57,509
- Falling!

479
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:58,677
I'm falling!

480
00:35:58,677 --> 00:35:59,845
- Petra!
Petra!

481
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,847
Petra, wake up!
Petra!

482
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:03,598
- Oh, my god!

483
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,183
Oh, my babies!

484
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:06,559
- Hold up.
That was only a dream!

485
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,852
- My babies!

486
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:13,274
I have to see 'em!
Let go!

487
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,735
Oh, thank god
they're all right.

488
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,779
I'm not going to do it.

489
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,202
- Petra.

490
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:27,246
- We have nothing more
to do with the balloon.

491
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:29,164
- Petra--
- I want out of it.

492
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:31,250
I want my children out of it.

493
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,835
- I'm doing it for you
and the children.

494
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:34,169
- You listened to Peter--

495
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:36,505
- because he had an idea.
A good idea.

496
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:39,216
- A crazy idea!

497
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:40,384
All right, all right.

498
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:42,511
Let Peter go kill himself
and his family

499
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:45,347
or get arrested for this
hopeless damn foolishness.

500
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:47,390
- You've had a bad dream.

501
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,102
- It's been a bad dream ever
since you started.

502
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:53,730
Sewing hours on end
in the attic.

503
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,025
The hiding and lying
night after night.

504
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,359
And I don't know whether you're
gonna come home

505
00:36:58,401 --> 00:36:59,694
from the damn tests.

506
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:02,738
I want--i want--
I want out.

507
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,241
- You want to be
with your mother?

508
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:08,369
- I want to be alive.

509
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,747
I want my babies alive.

510
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:17,753
Guenter, I want you alive.

511
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:19,588
- Peter says there
is no way--

512
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,881
- don't tell me
what Peter says!

513
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:24,759
I don't want to hear it.
I'm not married to Peter.

514
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,096
I love you.

515
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,598
I want you to be
your own man

516
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,227
with your own dreams
and your own risks.

517
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:41,108
I'll be with you then.

518
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:44,236
Guenter, please?

519
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:50,492
- I'll tell him tomorrow.

520
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,131
It's Petra.

521
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:07,842
She can't sleep at night.

522
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,886
She has these bad dreams.

523
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:11,513
- Oh, I know.

524
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:12,931
It's the same with Doris,

525
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,849
but we can't let
bad dreams stop us.

526
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:17,894
- If my children were older,

527
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:21,731
maybe it would be easier,
but they're babies.

528
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:27,736
If things went wrong and then
they were hurt or...

529
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:29,196
Left orphans--

530
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,615
- but if you don't try,

531
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,368
what chance
have your children got?

532
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,828
- Things are looking better.

533
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:38,497
They're making Petra
a controller at the factory.

534
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:41,541
Her own office.
3.50 an hour.

535
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,634
I'm sorry.

536
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:55,763
- I'll move the equipment
from your work room.

537
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:58,683
- When you can.

538
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:01,477
- The less we're seen together,
the better.

539
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,398
Because when we're gone,
they'll question you.

540
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,692
And the only way you'll be safe
is if you can honestly say,

541
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:12,029
"I don't know."

542
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,865
- Peter...

543
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,867
If it was just me--

544
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:20,704
- of course.

545
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:22,748
Of course.

546
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:29,838
Can you see the guard tower?

547
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:32,215
- I don't want to see.

548
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,675
- Look beyond then.

549
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:34,926
Look into west Germany.

550
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:40,348
- Seems so close,
doesn't it?

551
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:42,808
I'm sorry about the balloon.

552
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:49,231
- I don't want
to give it up.

553
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:54,820
- The four of us
could make it.

554
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:59,992
Frank will help me.

555
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:04,412
- No.

556
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:07,248
It has to be all right
with you first.

557
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:22,263
- There are boys not much older
than frank

558
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:23,931
ready to kill us
if we don't make it.

559
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,933
- Oh, yes,
and if they hesitate,

560
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:28,060
the automated guns
will do it for them.

561
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:35,859
Talk it over with him.

562
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:42,324
Even though you don't believe
in the balloon?

563
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:44,367
- I believe in you.

564
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,468
- This is better.

565
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,470
- Yes, you've been
saying that for months.

566
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,473
- Well, we've built
five already.

567
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:09,892
I think we do it better
every time.

568
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,062
- Well, maybe this
is the one.

569
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,981
- Yeah, let's hope so.

570
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,277
- Check outside.

571
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,159
More air, Doris.

572
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,161
We're not getting enough.

573
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:38,711
Tie it down, son!
Got it, frnk?

574
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:40,713
- I can't!

575
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,882
- I can't!

576
00:41:42,924 --> 00:41:44,759
Papa!

577
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,844
- Get out!

578
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:48,804
Get out!

579
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:10,825
- Come on.

580
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,703
We still don't have
enough flame.

581
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:16,414
- There must be some way
of increasing the gas pressure.

582
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:23,754
Frank, come here.

583
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:28,425
Help your mother.

584
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,470
- It's almost full, papa.

585
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:33,514
It's holding this time.

586
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,354
- Watch your lines.

587
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:42,189
- It's lifting!

588
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,857
- Come on!
Let's get fitscher!

589
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:45,901
- No, frank.
There's not enough gas.

590
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:47,694
But it works!

591
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:50,029
And tomorrow,
we'll go.

592
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:51,823
Oh, my god!

593
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,699
I can't believe it!

594
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,659
- That did it!
She's up!

595
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:06,754
- If I'd known
you were coming,

596
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:09,882
I would have at least made
something special for the boys.

597
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:12,718
- It was on the spur
of the moment, mama.

598
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,721
- And in any case,
we can't stay.

599
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,390
- No, there's school tomorrow.

600
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:23,061
- Should be vacation.

601
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:24,938
- Well, I hope we can

602
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,148
get the whole family together
for a meal.

603
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,776
Bernard, liesel, Oskar,

604
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,736
and maybe even
the meisen cousins.

605
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,740
What do you think?

606
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:40,912
- Oh, we'll talk about that.

607
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,914
- Speaking of family,

608
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:46,292
you promised me that picture
of you and papa.

609
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:54,299
- I'm trying to make up
a family album.

610
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,095
- Well, when I have the time,
I'll try to find it.

611
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,138
- I know where it is.

612
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,820
- I could have a copy made
if you'd like it back.

613
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,739
- No, you keep it.

614
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,408
- It's getting late.

615
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,327
Peter's so impatient.

616
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,705
- But he's
a good husband

617
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,208
and a good father.

618
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,836
- Mama...

619
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,759
- Put those somewhere where your
mother won't see them.

620
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,927
What for?

621
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,387
- Well, just in case
we have an accident

622
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,848
and we have to give
a signal when we land.

623
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,641
Where is she?

624
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,351
- Um, she was scrubbing
the bath tub

625
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,352
when I last saw her.

626
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,029
Oh, Doris,
what are you doing?

627
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:01,739
We're through
with this place!

628
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:03,074
We're finished.

629
00:45:03,115 --> 00:45:04,742
- When the police
find out we're gone,

630
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:06,077
they'll be in here
and I won't have them

631
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:10,873
saying I'm a bad housekeeper.

632
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,752
- Come on.

633
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:19,047
Come on.

634
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,049
Boys are in the car.

635
00:45:29,182 --> 00:45:30,725
- Just pictures.

636
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,144
I don't mind leaving the rest.

637
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:37,315
I'm coming.

638
00:45:37,357 --> 00:45:40,318
- Quickly, love.

639
00:45:57,376 --> 00:45:59,002
All right, frank,
take this

640
00:45:59,044 --> 00:46:01,129
and replace
the burner.

641
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,924
Doris, fitscher.

642
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:11,639
- Come on.
Wake up.

643
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,765
Wake up.
Quickly.

644
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:16,311
- Come, come.
We're going for a ride.

645
00:46:16,352 --> 00:46:19,188
- We're going to ride
in that?

646
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,945
- Doris, hurry!
We're ready!

647
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:30,824
Come on!
Quickly!

648
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:37,539
Okay, we're cutting.

649
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,791
Don't worry, mama.

650
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:43,795
Cast all them off.

651
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,630
Go!

652
00:46:57,308 --> 00:46:58,643
- Hey, look at us!

653
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:00,603
We did it!

654
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:02,647
We did it!

655
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:28,088
- It's about 300!

656
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,590
350 feet!

657
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:45,229
Nearly 800 feet!

658
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:47,273
Going up fast!

659
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:09,727
6,400 feet!

660
00:49:16,942 --> 00:49:18,944
6,500!

661
00:49:24,407 --> 00:49:27,619
- A flashing light
in the northeast,

662
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:30,622
approximately two miles
from here.

663
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:41,674
- Must be the dampness.

664
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:43,718
It's getting too wet.

665
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:51,392
- Yes, we're trying
to change the tank.

666
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:03,779
There.
That's it.

667
00:50:30,054 --> 00:50:31,722
Hand me that wrench,
frank,

668
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:33,766
and check the line
on your side.

669
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:54,619
- No, it's no longer visible.

670
00:50:54,661 --> 00:50:56,746
Yes, sir.

671
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,394
- Gas is flowing, papa,

672
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:22,437
but the pressure's
way down.

673
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:34,991
- Brace yourselves!

674
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,035
We're coming down fast!

675
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:51,674
Everybody all right?

676
00:51:51,715 --> 00:51:52,925
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

677
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:54,426
- Yes.

678
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:56,845
- Here, fitscher,
let me help you.

679
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:02,059
Doris, easy.

680
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,478
- Papa, the balloon!

681
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,938
Papa!

682
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,524
I can't--
- frank, no!

683
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:13,903
- Papa, it's getting away.

684
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,030
- There's nothing we can
do about that right now.

685
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:17,365
Are you all right, Doris?

686
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:18,533
Have you found everything?

687
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:20,868
- Yes, I think so.

688
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,871
- Frank, how long
were we up there?

689
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:25,706
- Uh, 34 minutes.

690
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:27,208
We made it,
didn't we?

691
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:28,918
- Well, maybe.

692
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,086
Look, stay here and look after
your mother fitscher.

693
00:52:31,128 --> 00:52:34,131
I'll take a look around.

694
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:05,161
Oh, my god.

695
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,799
- Papa!
Papa!

696
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:04,301
- Stand still.

697
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:06,344
Don't move.

698
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,860
- We're in the zone.

699
00:54:26,238 --> 00:54:27,907
There's wires everywhere.

700
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:30,993
Step on one and the alarms
will be set off.

701
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:35,747
Probably mines as well.

702
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:38,875
- Wait here till daylight,

703
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:41,420
then try and find
our way back.

704
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:10,489
All right,
we'll go in single file.

705
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:13,534
And watch out
for wires everywhere.

706
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,582
You go last, frank.

707
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:42,937
Careful.

708
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:50,986
Fitscher.

709
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:53,030
Stay by me.

710
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:26,270
- Looks like...
It's a balloon.

711
00:56:31,191 --> 00:56:33,527
- That must be lobenstein.

712
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:36,572
We'll have to risk it.

713
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,993
Easy.

714
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,856
Come on, frank.

715
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:15,734
Frank, keep up.

716
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,084
Don't look back.

717
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,771
- Whoever manned this
is still in the zone.

718
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,439
I want the entire
area covered.

719
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,274
Nothing is to be touched.

720
00:57:57,316 --> 00:57:59,359
Notify major koerner
immediately.

721
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:12,831
Papa, they found our car!

722
00:58:12,872 --> 00:58:14,457
- Oh, Peter!
Oh, my god!

723
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,959
- Come on.
Take it easy.

724
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,210
It just may be nothing.

725
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,295
It may be nothing at all.

726
00:58:19,337 --> 00:58:21,881
Come on.
Come on.

727
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:26,635
- This is ddr 22-z-8

728
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:28,137
ddr 22-z-8.

729
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,972
Request permission to land.

730
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:32,308
- Landing granted in area 12.

731
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:36,019
Be advised that everything
on perimeter has been armed.

732
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:04,213
Major.

733
00:59:09,927 --> 00:59:11,095
- Wait a minute.
This is it.

734
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:14,640
I think.

735
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:16,517
Yeah, it's not far now.

736
00:59:16,517 --> 00:59:17,518
Come on, frank.

737
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,019
- I'm tired, mama.

738
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:22,856
- You'll be all right.

739
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:24,900
Attaboy.

740
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:38,121
- There it is.

741
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:40,540
- They haven't found it!

742
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,586
- Hurry.

743
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,424
Frank, get the cables
off the battery quick.

744
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:52,051
- Go lie down in the car,
fitscher.

745
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:53,969
Go ahead.

746
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:02,853
- Yes, it's been converted

747
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:05,897
so it can be used
as an altimeter.

748
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:13,112
The burner's quite ingenious.

749
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,031
- All of it goes
to the lab in Berlin.

750
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,783
- Yes, major.

751
01:00:16,824 --> 01:00:20,077
They've located the place where
the balloon first landed.

752
01:00:45,477 --> 01:00:47,938
- Come on, fitscher.
We're home.

753
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:59,907
Nothing's changed.

754
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,784
- We came so close!

755
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:03,202
- Take it easy, frank.

756
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:05,955
- But it's not fair!

757
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,790
- There's a lot of things
we have to do yet.

758
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,124
- My pills.

759
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,460
I've lost my
blood pressure pills.

760
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,296
- Must have been when you
dropped your purse.

761
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,798
Be very difficult to trace.

762
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,549
I wouldn't worry about it.

763
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,176
What we do have to do
is get a note

764
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:24,639
to frank's teacher saying
that he's sick.

765
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,309
Then we'll take fitscher
to the clinic.

766
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,935
We'll say he's sick too.

767
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,311
And while you're
at the clinic,

768
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,980
I'll take the note
to school

769
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,148
and drop by the bank
and explain

770
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,482
why you won't be in.

771
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:49,914
Hello?

772
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:51,457
- Oh, Peter!

773
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:53,334
I tried to call you earlier.

774
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,043
When I called the bank...
- It's your mother.

775
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:57,296
- They said that Doris hadn't
been to work today.

776
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:59,590
- Well, the boys aren't well.

777
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,050
In fact, we're just about
to take fitscher to the clinic.

778
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:05,679
- And I wondered if everything
was all right with you

779
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,265
and the children
or what has happened.

780
01:02:09,307 --> 01:02:11,017
- It's nothing else,
and they'll be fine.

781
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:13,520
Doris will
call you back later.

782
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,840
- Sorry I'm keeping you awake.

783
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:30,260
- It doesn't matter.

784
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:35,682
- I'll go down
to the living room.

785
01:03:35,723 --> 01:03:38,726
Maybe read.

786
01:04:31,485 --> 01:04:33,987
- It's all right.

787
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:37,199
- It isn't.

788
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,992
It isn't.

789
01:04:39,034 --> 01:04:40,994
I failed you
and I failed the boys.

790
01:04:41,036 --> 01:04:43,288
- No, you didn't.

791
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,957
So close.

792
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:48,001
We were so close.

793
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:51,713
- I know.

794
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:54,757
- What if we--

795
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,094
if we'd come down
a few miles away...

796
01:04:58,136 --> 01:05:02,723
Or even a half a mile,
but...

797
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:08,312
A few hundred feet?

798
01:05:08,354 --> 01:05:09,897
Why?

799
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:11,273
Why couldn't I keep us
in the air

800
01:05:11,315 --> 01:05:13,025
just a few seconds longer?

801
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:17,321
- You did everything
you could.

802
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:21,950
- All my life...

803
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:24,870
Things have come easily
for me.

804
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:31,292
Too easily, perhaps,
but...

805
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:35,713
Anything that I wanted
to do...

806
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:39,967
Or anything that
I really wanted to do,

807
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:43,012
then I was able
to bring it off.

808
01:05:47,391 --> 01:05:50,728
Until, uh, this.

809
01:05:50,769 --> 01:05:52,062
I mean, it's the one--

810
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:55,232
it's the only important thing
in my life.

811
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,694
Couldn't do it.

812
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:03,198
- Darling, you mustn't blame
yourself.

813
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,953
- Didn't make it.

814
01:06:07,994 --> 01:06:09,996
It feel helpless.

815
01:06:10,038 --> 01:06:12,457
God, I do.
I feel hopeless.

816
01:06:12,499 --> 01:06:14,417
- Oh, no, no.

817
01:06:20,214 --> 01:06:22,216
Oh, god.

818
01:06:28,806 --> 01:06:31,141
- Uh...

819
01:06:31,183 --> 01:06:34,103
Is it all right?

820
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:35,813
- Yes.

821
01:06:35,854 --> 01:06:39,316
Yes, of course it is.
Sure.

822
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:44,863
- Uh, fitscher
and I were talking.

823
01:06:44,905 --> 01:06:47,949
Papa, we really didn't
do that badly.

824
01:06:47,991 --> 01:06:50,285
Did we?

825
01:06:50,285 --> 01:06:53,454
I mean, for our
first try.

826
01:06:53,454 --> 01:06:55,123
We went up.

827
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:57,542
And we came down.

828
01:06:57,583 --> 01:07:01,129
Nobody got hurt.

829
01:07:01,129 --> 01:07:03,047
We're here.
Home.

830
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:05,925
Safe.

831
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:09,845
And we learned a lot.

832
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:13,015
- We didn't make it.

833
01:07:13,057 --> 01:07:15,142
- All right.

834
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:18,645
But we did fly.

835
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:21,857
Papa--
papa, you put us up there.

836
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:25,235
You--you got us away
from all of this.

837
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:30,699
- Yes, for a very short while.

838
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,784
- Papa.

839
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:34,786
You know if it hadn't been
for that cloud

840
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:37,038
getting the balloon wet
and putting out the burner,

841
01:07:37,038 --> 01:07:38,081
we'd have made it.

842
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:41,792
- Yeah.

843
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:47,798
- And next time...

844
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,717
We will.

845
01:07:55,055 --> 01:08:00,310
I've made us some
back patches.

846
01:08:00,352 --> 01:08:02,354
Commander.

847
01:08:05,065 --> 01:08:06,900
Co-pilot.

848
01:08:07,943 --> 01:08:09,819
- Navigator.

849
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:12,238
Steward.

850
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:24,875
- The ssd is looking for us.

851
01:08:24,917 --> 01:08:26,836
You know they are.

852
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:30,005
And they're not gonna stop
until they find us.

853
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:33,300
- But you won't let 'em
find us, will you?

854
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,477
- No.

855
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:45,103
No.

856
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:46,938
No.

857
01:08:46,938 --> 01:08:48,481
No, I won't.

858
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:51,901
I will not let them
find us.

859
01:08:51,943 --> 01:08:54,112
I will not.

860
01:09:06,582 --> 01:09:08,876
- Ah, Mr. strelzyk.

861
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:11,170
- Hello, Mrs. roseler.

862
01:09:17,843 --> 01:09:20,971
- Peter.

863
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,975
- No, no.

864
01:09:24,975 --> 01:09:29,312
There is no good time.
Come on in.

865
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:30,980
Doris and your boys
all right?

866
01:09:31,022 --> 01:09:32,857
- Yes, they're fine.

867
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:33,817
- I've missed Doris.

868
01:09:33,858 --> 01:09:35,610
- Peter!
- Guenter.

869
01:09:35,652 --> 01:09:36,861
- Mama, mama.

870
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:40,615
- It's good to see you here.

871
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:41,949
- Come on, little Peter.

872
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:44,660
- Come on.

873
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:45,953
- What's the matter
with Petra?

874
01:09:45,995 --> 01:09:47,788
- Her mother
in west Berlin,

875
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:50,833
she's very sick and,
um,

876
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,793
they wouldn't let Petra
into the west to see her.

877
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:54,586
I tried to get an authorization
through her boss,

878
01:09:54,628 --> 01:09:55,671
through the party.

879
01:09:55,712 --> 01:09:59,591
- Eh, it sounds familiar.

880
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:04,471
- Um...

881
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:06,848
There was a rumor.

882
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,935
A balloon was found
at the border near lobenstein.

883
01:10:12,896 --> 01:10:14,814
We were so close.

884
01:10:14,814 --> 01:10:17,775
Literally a few hundred feet.

885
01:10:17,817 --> 01:10:21,237
I'm building another one because
the ssd is looking for us

886
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,949
and we have to get out.

887
01:10:24,991 --> 01:10:26,951
Wish you'd come with us.

888
01:10:26,992 --> 01:10:30,579
- The balloon...
It really worked?

889
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:32,998
- Guenter, you should
have seen it.

890
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,085
It was beautiful.

891
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:39,671
And with you along,
I know--

892
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:42,049
I know we could make it.

893
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:50,473
I have bought a new car.

894
01:10:50,515 --> 01:10:52,392
I was afraid that
the old moskvitch

895
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:57,772
would be recognized.

896
01:10:57,814 --> 01:10:59,607
I'll need a trailer hitch.

897
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:05,988
- Bring it around
this Saturday.

898
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:12,911
- The knife, the watch,
and the pliers

899
01:11:12,953 --> 01:11:14,872
are mass produced
and the lab found

900
01:11:14,872 --> 01:11:16,540
no individualizing markings.

901
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,377
The converted barometer
is more special.

902
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,087
We're running a check
on all the stores

903
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:23,839
in the gera district
that sell them.

904
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,759
- And still we haven't located
the pick-up point yet.

905
01:11:27,801 --> 01:11:31,262
- It's a very large area
so heavily wooded.

906
01:11:31,262 --> 01:11:34,307
There are hundreds of spots
that would be suitable.

907
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:36,893
- Yes, but someone
must have seen them.

908
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:39,771
- But chooses not
to come forward.

909
01:11:39,812 --> 01:11:42,899
- We know the amount
of fuel they used.

910
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,569
We know the approximate
weight they lifted.

911
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:49,238
We know the wind velocity
and direction.

912
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,533
I wonder how long they could
have stayed up there.

913
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:55,119
30 minutes?
35?

914
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:57,913
40 at the most.

915
01:11:57,955 --> 01:12:03,293
But that restricts the search
area considerably.

916
01:12:03,293 --> 01:12:06,671
Contact lieutenant fehler.

917
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:09,090
Tell him to use more men
if necessary.

918
01:12:09,132 --> 01:12:10,508
- Yes, sir.

919
01:12:11,676 --> 01:12:13,803
- Now that's our best lead.

920
01:12:13,845 --> 01:12:16,681
We're checking a list
of the stores that carry it.

921
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:18,599
- The stores should
all be alerted to report

922
01:12:18,641 --> 01:12:21,144
anyone trying to buy
this fabric in any quantity.

923
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:23,938
- And do you think they'll make
another attempt?

924
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,148
- They will.

925
01:12:36,325 --> 01:12:38,160
- We don't hear.

926
01:12:38,202 --> 01:12:41,788
It's driving me crazy.

927
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,749
You got a good deal
on this car.

928
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:46,960
It's in pretty nice shape
for it's age.

929
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,753
- Like me.

930
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:49,879
Want another beer?

931
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:52,090
- Not yet.

932
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,554
Have you started
building it yet?

933
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:03,809
- No.

934
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,978
Waiting to see how big
I should make it.

935
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:15,571
- Better make it for eight.

936
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:24,830
I told Peter we'd go with him
when they try again.

937
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:27,624
- I knew you would.

938
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:31,795
- You want to be
with your mother, don't you?

939
01:13:31,836 --> 01:13:35,840
I'm not gonna be a delivery boy
for the rest of my life.

940
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:38,468
I'm a mechanic.

941
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:42,680
A damn good one and I got
a right to prove it.

942
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,266
- There are other ways.

943
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:48,185
Helicopters fly people out
of czechoslovakia.

944
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:51,564
- How are we gonna get
into czechoslovakia?

945
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:56,443
Sneak across that border
with two little children?

946
01:13:56,485 --> 01:13:58,529
And even if we did,
we don't have the money.

947
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:03,784
They're charging
$10,000, $12,000 a run.

948
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:05,744
- You really think
we can do it?

949
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:08,246
- I know we can.

950
01:14:08,288 --> 01:14:10,749
We have to.

951
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,834
The police are gonna
find this strelzyks

952
01:14:12,876 --> 01:14:16,129
and when they do...

953
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:20,049
We're locked into it.

954
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:21,968
Well, I know you're scared.

955
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:24,553
- It's not just for me.
It's for all of us.

956
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:28,933
- We have no choice.

957
01:14:30,392 --> 01:14:33,771
- As soon as we
can get ready.

958
01:14:33,812 --> 01:14:35,814
- Okay.

959
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:50,870
- No, I'm sorry.

960
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,589
- They're all too bright.

961
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,674
We need more.

962
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:04,800
- 40 yards
is not a bad start.

963
01:15:04,842 --> 01:15:05,968
- Thank god you're back.

964
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,595
- We've been so worried.

965
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:10,264
- Here.

966
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:13,142
Read this.

967
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:15,686
- "The pictured items
were left

968
01:15:15,728 --> 01:15:16,812
at the scene
of a serious crime."

969
01:15:16,854 --> 01:15:18,146
- They're closing in.

970
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:19,398
We don't have enough time.

971
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:21,441
- It took guenter
two weeks before

972
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,984
and this one's
almost twice as big.

973
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:24,611
- We can sew day and night.

974
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,780
- I can work longer hours
and after that,

975
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:28,823
I'll get sick
for a few days.

976
01:15:28,865 --> 01:15:30,784
- There were two of them.

977
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:33,328
About a year ago it was.

978
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:38,249
They bought hundreds
of square yards of material.

979
01:15:42,295 --> 01:15:47,508
- The one who did all
the talking was dark.

980
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:49,802
About your height.

981
01:15:52,638 --> 01:15:57,017
- Maybe, uh, 35.

982
01:15:57,017 --> 01:15:59,019
The other one was younger.

983
01:15:59,061 --> 01:16:04,024
Mid-20s.
Fair and taller.

984
01:16:04,024 --> 01:16:07,819
- Could you possibly identify
them from a photo?

985
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,988
- Oh, yes.

986
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:15,326
I'm sure I could.

987
01:16:15,368 --> 01:16:18,413
- Could you tell me
why you need so much

988
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:21,749
of this particular material?

989
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:25,961
- Our group of young pioneers
are making sleeping bags

990
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:28,130
and there's nearly
100 of them.

991
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:30,508
- I see.

992
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:32,551
Just a minute.

993
01:16:58,951 --> 01:17:01,204
We are bringing
the material down

994
01:17:01,245 --> 01:17:03,539
right away from the warehouse.

995
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:06,459
Would you have a chair?

996
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,504
- No, I'll just have a look
around, if you don't mind.

997
01:17:20,973 --> 01:17:24,768
I know the ssd was
on its way.

998
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,979
And we still haven't
got the material.

999
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,481
Yesterday, five yards.

1000
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:30,648
Today, nothing.

1001
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,484
- Could you make
the balloon smaller?

1002
01:17:32,525 --> 01:17:33,651
- Yes, we could.

1003
01:17:33,693 --> 01:17:37,780
It wouldn't carry
eight people.

1004
01:17:37,822 --> 01:17:40,908
- He's building
another balloon.

1005
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,743
- Well, they got
no material in jena.

1006
01:17:42,785 --> 01:17:44,912
- But he is getting it.

1007
01:17:44,954 --> 01:17:47,081
A little here.

1008
01:17:47,123 --> 01:17:49,750
A little there.

1009
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,461
Damn this man!

1010
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:55,547
And who is that younger man?

1011
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:58,592
He didn't make
the first flight.

1012
01:17:58,634 --> 01:18:00,510
But why?

1013
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:01,762
- When he makes his attempt--

1014
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:03,221
- I'm stopping him
before that.

1015
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,765
Call fehler.

1016
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:07,934
I want that area where they
landed first searched again.

1017
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:09,769
- Sir, it's been two months.

1018
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,646
A very rainy season.

1019
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,440
- I want it searched
and I want

1020
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:19,278
special emergency precautions
taken at every border station.

1021
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,287
- I don't have tafeta.

1022
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,290
- Thank you.

1023
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,471
[Conversation
muffled by fan]

1024
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,811
- Petra, your turn.

1025
01:18:52,852 --> 01:18:54,229
- Oh, give me him.

1026
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,397
Give me the boy.

1027
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:58,816
You have to sit on the ground.

1028
01:18:58,858 --> 01:19:01,319
- Peter, you're right
here with me.

1029
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,196
- Andreas goes here.

1030
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:05,990
Fitscher, you're around here
between mama and frank.

1031
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,616
Frank, you're here.

1032
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:10,578
- Put your hands inside.

1033
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:11,954
- Well, that's it.

1034
01:19:11,996 --> 01:19:14,289
- Tomorrow.

1035
01:19:14,331 --> 01:19:17,126
- We don't have the time.

1036
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,127
If the weather's good and
the wind's right, then we go.

1037
01:19:40,857 --> 01:19:41,774
- Here they are, major.

1038
01:19:41,816 --> 01:19:43,067
They were found
just a few feet

1039
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:44,277
from the point of impact.

1040
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:45,778
- What have you
done about it?

1041
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,071
- When I wasn't able
to contact you, major,

1042
01:19:47,113 --> 01:19:48,280
I didn't take any action.

1043
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,448
- These pills should
have been analyzed.

1044
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,950
The buyer idtentified.

1045
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,117
- Without the number.
This may be a problem.

1046
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:55,329
- I'm not sure.
It's Saturday.

1047
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:57,581
- See that it is.

1048
01:19:57,623 --> 01:19:58,957
Come on, driver.
Hurry!

1049
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:01,251
- The forecast
is cold and clear.

1050
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:02,919
- It looks fine.

1051
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:04,796
- Petra says,
"come for dinner."

1052
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:08,049
Fine.

1053
01:20:14,472 --> 01:20:16,182
- We'll know for sure
after we check the wind.

1054
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:21,062
- We're going far,
far away.

1055
01:20:22,813 --> 01:20:24,065
- No.

1056
01:20:24,106 --> 01:20:26,525
A short one!

1057
01:20:32,364 --> 01:20:34,825
- Propranolol.
Prescribed for hypertension.

1058
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:36,785
High blood pressure.

1059
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:38,829
If had the number--

1060
01:20:38,871 --> 01:20:40,998
- I want the name.

1061
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:43,625
- We have to go through our
entire prescription file.

1062
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:44,960
That'd still be ten--

1063
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,169
- please try it.

1064
01:20:46,211 --> 01:20:48,463
- On Monday
when my staff is here--

1065
01:20:48,505 --> 01:20:50,924
- I would very much
like you to do it now.

1066
01:21:18,784 --> 01:21:21,578
- Becca hoodruff.

1067
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,289
Felder strasse 63.

1068
01:21:42,849 --> 01:21:45,810
Ertman, Max.

1069
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:48,437
Karl-Max,
apartment number 23.

1070
01:22:19,842 --> 01:22:22,011
- It's perfect.

1071
01:22:22,053 --> 01:22:23,971
Gentle wind to the west.

1072
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:26,390
- Should we make one test
before we risk it?

1073
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,893
- I'd like to.
Haven't got time.

1074
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:31,395
Now let's get back.

1075
01:22:31,395 --> 01:22:33,897
- Here's another one.

1076
01:22:33,897 --> 01:22:35,899
Freiling rezick.

1077
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:39,653
Town center,
complex 28.

1078
01:22:45,909 --> 01:22:48,912
- I don't think any of us knew
what the best...

1079
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,210
- We leave in 30 minutes.

1080
01:22:56,252 --> 01:22:58,338
We'll get our things
and we'll be right back.

1081
01:22:58,379 --> 01:22:59,589
Come on, fitscher.

1082
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:00,715
- See you soon.

1083
01:23:00,757 --> 01:23:03,885
- Bye.

1084
01:23:03,926 --> 01:23:06,804
- Better give the baby
the valerian so he'll sleep.

1085
01:23:06,846 --> 01:23:10,558
- It's really happening.

1086
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:12,726
- Norna Wilhelm.

1087
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,937
Schiller strasse 16.

1088
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:23,153
- Reports on the first
two names, major...Negative.

1089
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:28,950
- You're not mopping.

1090
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,994
- No, I did it this morning.

1091
01:23:33,163 --> 01:23:35,164
All right.

1092
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:41,587
No, leave the lights on.

1093
01:23:41,587 --> 01:23:43,256
Fitscher, no toys.

1094
01:23:43,297 --> 01:23:44,882
- These don't weigh much,
papa.

1095
01:23:44,924 --> 01:23:47,885
- Your favorite one,
that's it.

1096
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:50,888
- We'll buy some more
when we get there.

1097
01:24:00,814 --> 01:24:02,858
- You've gained weight.

1098
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:05,152
- I've got my good slacks
on underneath.

1099
01:24:05,193 --> 01:24:08,321
I'm not arriving in west Germany
looking like a bum.

1100
01:24:08,363 --> 01:24:10,573
- Uh-uh.

1101
01:24:10,615 --> 01:24:14,619
- Johannes bier schnapps.

1102
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:18,456
- Well, can't leave that
for the ssd.

1103
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:20,124
Champagne?

1104
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:24,170
- Mama brought it to us.

1105
01:24:25,838 --> 01:24:29,467
"To be used for
a very special occasion."

1106
01:24:29,508 --> 01:24:32,761
- Major koerner,
we haven't contacted

1107
01:24:32,803 --> 01:24:34,304
two of the possibles yet.

1108
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:36,890
The rest are clear.

1109
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:40,143
- Two s's for you.

1110
01:24:40,185 --> 01:24:41,603
Streiger, Stefan.
Apartment five.

1111
01:24:41,645 --> 01:24:42,979
Wartburgkreis.

1112
01:24:43,021 --> 01:24:45,857
Strelzyk, Doris.
Out in poessneck, 46.

1113
01:24:51,237 --> 01:24:53,239
My neighbors.

1114
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:02,165
He has a trailer.

1115
01:25:02,206 --> 01:25:04,959
Always coming and going
at night.

1116
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,010
- Come on, frank.
Let's start it.

1117
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:18,096
- We'll catch up with you.

1118
01:26:03,724 --> 01:26:06,726
- No one here.

1119
01:26:06,768 --> 01:26:08,937
- There's--

1120
01:26:08,937 --> 01:26:10,605
there's another family.

1121
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:11,815
Wetzer.

1122
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:14,484
Fair?

1123
01:26:56,316 --> 01:26:59,235
- Cover the back.
Quickly.

1124
01:27:06,784 --> 01:27:07,910
Are you sure?

1125
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:08,994
- Of course I'm sure.

1126
01:27:08,994 --> 01:27:10,788
They've been acting
very suspicious--

1127
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,706
- just a moment.

1128
01:27:12,748 --> 01:27:15,959
Major koerner, the woman
says both families left

1129
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:20,380
only a few minutes ago
in a blue and white wartburg.

1130
01:27:20,422 --> 01:27:21,965
- Emergency alert.

1131
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:23,592

license nk9743.

1134
01:27:30,098 --> 01:27:32,767
The vehicle is pulling
a trailer.

1135
01:27:32,809 --> 01:27:33,810
Repeat.
Emergency alert.

1136
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:13,431
- I don't know.

1137
01:28:32,324 --> 01:28:33,909
- I still don't see them.

1138
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:35,911
They should have
caught up by now.

1139
01:28:35,953 --> 01:28:37,287
What's happened to them?

1140
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:39,039
- I don't know.

1141
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:41,083
We'll wait for them here.

1142
01:28:43,794 --> 01:28:45,879
- So far, no trace.

1143
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:49,090
- Eight people,
a car, a trailer.

1144
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,009
Call lieutenant fehler.

1145
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:52,886
I'm going
to the border station.

1146
01:28:52,886 --> 01:28:54,095
- Yes, sir.

1147
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:01,602
- All right!

1148
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,605
Come on.
Come on!

1149
01:29:19,995 --> 01:29:21,371
- Something's happened.

1150
01:29:21,413 --> 01:29:22,914
I'm going back to the house.

1151
01:29:22,914 --> 01:29:25,500
- No, Peter.
Wait!

1152
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:41,182
- Sorry.
It stalled.

1153
01:30:26,183 --> 01:30:27,935
Thank you.

1154
01:30:27,977 --> 01:30:29,562
They may have been seen
near lebengrun.

1155
01:30:29,603 --> 01:30:32,565
- Send all available units.

1156
01:30:32,606 --> 01:30:35,234
And I want every lookout tower
on full alert.

1157
01:30:35,275 --> 01:30:37,111
- This is lieutenant fehler.

1158
01:30:37,152 --> 01:30:38,862
Send all units to
the lebengrun area.

1159
01:30:38,904 --> 01:30:42,908
[Alarm blaring,
siren wailing]

1160
01:30:59,215 --> 01:31:02,677
- We bought a new tent and
he wants to see if it works.

1161
01:31:02,718 --> 01:31:05,221
If the stakes fit
into the loops.

1162
01:31:05,221 --> 01:31:06,764
- A big truck ahead.

1163
01:31:06,806 --> 01:31:07,723
Get ready to pass.

1164
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:38,961
- Hey.

1165
01:31:39,003 --> 01:31:40,129
How we doing?

1166
01:31:43,174 --> 01:31:45,176
- It's cold out there.

1167
01:32:03,235 --> 01:32:05,278
- Climb on!

1168
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:12,702
- We're ready to go.

1169
01:32:12,744 --> 01:32:14,746
- Ready, Doris.

1170
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,962
- Let's go.
Everybody out.

1171
01:32:42,314 --> 01:32:48,194
*

1172
01:32:48,236 --> 01:32:49,195
- we're overheating!

1173
01:32:49,237 --> 01:32:50,989
Doris, tell them
to be quick!

1174
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:52,490
Quickly run here now!

1175
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:53,825
Come on!
Quickly! Quickly!

1176
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:55,034
- Hurry!

1177
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:57,495
- All right.

1178
01:32:57,495 --> 01:32:59,997
Take it easy.
That's all right.

1179
01:33:00,039 --> 01:33:01,707
- Here you go.

1180
01:33:01,749 --> 01:33:02,834
- You better sit down.

1181
01:33:02,834 --> 01:33:05,586
- Sit down.
Sit down.

1182
01:33:05,628 --> 01:33:07,254
- Yes, all right.

1183
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:09,298
- Easy, easy.
Watch it.

1184
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:15,888
- Watch out!
Watch out!

1185
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:17,890
- Sit down.

1186
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:18,849
All right!
Ready?

1187
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:21,143
- No, wait!

1188
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:23,770
- Yes!

1189
01:33:25,147 --> 01:33:26,815
- Ready!

1190
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:32,737
- No, take that one!

1191
01:33:35,532 --> 01:33:37,700
- Ready!

1192
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:39,744
Ow!

1193
01:33:48,544 --> 01:33:50,212
- Pa, we're on fire!

1194
01:33:50,212 --> 01:33:51,547
- Oh, my god, Peter!

1195
01:33:51,589 --> 01:33:53,549
- Frank, get the extinguisher,
for god's sake!

1196
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,800
- Oh, my god!
It's burning!

1197
01:33:56,552 --> 01:33:59,054
- Quickly!

1198
01:34:20,616 --> 01:34:21,784
- Frank has a nasty cut.

1199
01:34:21,826 --> 01:34:23,619
How about you, fitscher?

1200
01:34:23,661 --> 01:34:25,663
- It's all right, mom.

1201
01:34:46,099 --> 01:34:47,767
- It's already at 1,000 feet.

1202
01:34:47,809 --> 01:34:50,770
We're going up too fast.

1203
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:12,458
Will it hold?

1204
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:14,460
- It has to.

1205
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,705
- Oh, my god.

1206
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:53,998
Look!

1207
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,999
- Higher.

1208
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:15,768
- Tower 416 reporting.

1209
01:36:19,772 --> 01:36:23,317
- Major koerner,
they've been spotted.

1210
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:25,361
- Let's go.

1211
01:36:25,403 --> 01:36:27,530
Quick, we're moving out.

1212
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:47,299
- I don't know.
It seems to be blocked.

1213
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,384
How high are we?

1214
01:36:49,384 --> 01:36:52,387
- Almost 6,000 feet.

1215
01:37:06,734 --> 01:37:08,235
- It's cold.

1216
01:37:08,277 --> 01:37:09,737
I want to get off.

1217
01:37:29,923 --> 01:37:31,925
- There he is.

1218
01:37:39,807 --> 01:37:41,726
I've lost them.

1219
01:37:41,768 --> 01:37:43,019
- They must be out of fuel.

1220
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,770
- Then they're descending.

1221
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,355
We've got them.

1222
01:37:46,397 --> 01:37:48,190
All ground units.

1223
01:37:48,232 --> 01:37:49,859
Major koerner
to all ground units.

1224
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:52,903
Converge on sectors
15 and 16.

1225
01:38:12,464 --> 01:38:14,799
- Try the weld starter
again.

1226
01:38:19,262 --> 01:38:21,264
- Turn it up higher.

1227
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:27,812
- I'm falling!

1228
01:38:27,812 --> 01:38:31,190
I'm falling, mama.
I'm falling.

1229
01:38:31,232 --> 01:38:33,317
- It's all right, little Peter.
Mama's here.

1230
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:40,908
- It's lit!
More gas.

1231
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:51,167
It's just barely burning.

1232
01:38:53,211 --> 01:38:55,880
- 5,000 feet.

1233
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:09,226
- Shh.

1234
01:39:09,268 --> 01:39:11,896
It's all right.

1235
01:39:11,937 --> 01:39:16,358
* there was a little
Teddy bear *

1236
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,070
- frank, recheck
those other tanks.

1237
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:23,198
- * his hair was soft
as anything *

1238
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:24,366
- they're empty, papa.

1239
01:39:24,366 --> 01:39:26,368
Both of them.

1240
01:39:26,368 --> 01:39:31,373
- [Continues singing
indistinctly]

1241
01:39:41,632 --> 01:39:46,846
* and he made
the children sing *

1242
01:39:46,887 --> 01:39:50,266
* hold me

1243
01:39:50,307 --> 01:39:51,559
- oh, my god.

1244
01:39:51,559 --> 01:39:53,560
The gas is gone.

1245
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,896
- * hold me

1246
01:39:55,896 --> 01:39:57,898
* hold me, hold me

1247
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:00,734
* bum bum bum

1248
01:40:00,776 --> 01:40:02,903
* hold me

1249
01:40:02,903 --> 01:40:04,571
* hold me

1250
01:40:04,613 --> 01:40:08,700
* hold me, hold me,
bum bum bum *

1251
01:40:08,742 --> 01:40:12,746
[alarm blaring,

1252
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:19,002
- We've been up 27 minutes.

1253
01:40:19,043 --> 01:40:21,045
- It's not enough.

1254
01:40:33,265 --> 01:40:36,268
Guenter, see if the light
will reach the ground.

1255
01:40:40,939 --> 01:40:42,941
- I'm glad we tried.

1256
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:09,550
- Hang on.

1257
01:41:09,592 --> 01:41:11,719
We may hit the trees.

1258
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,138
- No, no, no!
There's a clearing!

1259
01:41:19,142 --> 01:41:24,106
- Hold on!

1260
01:41:24,147 --> 01:41:25,440
Everyone all right?

1261
01:41:25,482 --> 01:41:26,608
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1262
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,817
I think so.
- Easy. Give me your hand.

1263
01:41:27,859 --> 01:41:29,319
- I'll take the baby.

1264
01:41:40,913 --> 01:41:42,915
Single file.

1265
01:41:53,509 --> 01:41:54,551
Right.

1266
01:41:54,593 --> 01:41:56,845
Guenter and I will
scout ahead.

1267
01:41:56,887 --> 01:41:58,347
The rest of you stay here.

1268
01:41:58,388 --> 01:42:00,140
If we find anything,
then we'll light the flare.

1269
01:42:00,182 --> 01:42:01,141
- But if we're in the zone--

1270
01:42:01,183 --> 01:42:04,186
- please just wait.
Stay here.

1271
01:42:50,689 --> 01:42:53,858
- We didn't make it,
did we?

1272
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,652
- Hey, don't worry.

1273
01:42:55,693 --> 01:42:57,695
Pa won't let us down.

1274
01:43:30,935 --> 01:43:32,270
- Stop.

1275
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:34,606
You there,
come out!

1276
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,807
- Are we in the west?

1277
01:43:53,249 --> 01:43:57,628
- Of course you are.

1278
01:43:57,669 --> 01:43:59,671
- Hey!

1279
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:06,261
Yeah!

1280
01:44:06,303 --> 01:44:08,305
Guenter!

1281
01:44:12,392 --> 01:44:14,144
- Thank god!
- Yes!

1282
01:44:17,146 --> 01:44:20,775
- Go!
Come on!

1283
01:44:20,817 --> 01:44:22,693
- Oh, here.
Let me.

1284
01:44:26,197 --> 01:44:28,491
- Papa!

1285
01:44:28,532 --> 01:44:30,117
Papa!

1286
01:44:31,869 --> 01:44:35,289
Papa!

1287
01:44:39,084 --> 01:44:41,003
- We made it!
We did it!

1288
01:44:41,044 --> 01:44:43,338
Yeah!

1289
01:44:43,338 --> 01:44:45,006
Yeah, we did it!

1290
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:01,522
- We did it!

1291
01:45:01,564 --> 01:45:03,774
We all did it!

1292
01:45:03,816 --> 01:45:05,359
- Champagne!
