1
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,334
You there,
which way to Pepperinge Eye?

2
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,502
Couldn't say, sir.

3
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:18,924
It said on the wireless to paint out
the signposts in case the Nazis drop in.

4
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,635
I'm not a Nazi. I'm a British officer.

5
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,180
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

6
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,516
Drive on, Corporal.

7
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,415
Sorry to give you so many,
but you do have six bedrooms.

8
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,833
Oh, no trouble, my dear.

9
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,503
Anything to get the poor things away
from those terrible bombings in London.

10
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,505
Come along, love. Let's go.

11
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,301
Hey, what about us?

12
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,886
Oh, yes. What is your name, please?

13
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,291
Rawlins, ma'am.

14
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,265
Rawlins? Rawlins?

15
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,558
Oh, yes. Here we are.

16
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,895
Carrie, Charles, Paul.

17
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,649
Well, you're for Miss Price.
I'm expecting' her in.

18
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,738
I won't be a moment.
Please, don't touch anything.

19
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,365
Call out the tanks

20
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,617
From the Cliffs of Dover

21
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,578
call up the Gauls

22
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,665
And don't forget the loyal territorials

23
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,376
Who's digging in here?

24
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,378
Who will defend

25
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,674
every inch of England
no matter what they send?

26
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,595
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

27
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,890
The soldiers of
the old home guard

28
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,391
That's who

29
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,603
The soldiers of
the old home guard

30
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,983
For we wrote the story
of the old brigade

31
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,363
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades

32
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,617
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

33
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,453
The soldiers of
the old home guard

34
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,954
That's who

35
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,916
The soldiers of
the old home guard

36
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,128
Parade, halt.

37
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,797
Carry on, Sergeant.

38
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,592
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

39
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,178
here to check military preparations
in the area.

40
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,639
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

41
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,123
But nevertheless, I...

42
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,017
What on earth is that?

43
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,444
Good morning, General.

44
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,073
I received your message, Mrs. Hobday.
I assume that my parcel has arrived.

45
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,408
It's in the office.

46
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,659
Ah, lovely.

47
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,204
Who is that?

48
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,831
Miss Price, splendid woman.

49
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,667
Her late father served
with me at Vimy Ridge.

50
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,128
What's she burn in this thing?
It smells a bit like sulfur.

51
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,339
Ridiculous. One can't make
motor fuel out of sulfur.

52
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,674
Here we are.

53
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,386
Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

54
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,804
Thank you.

55
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,556
Is it what you expected?

56
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
I imagine so.

57
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,685
Professor Browne sent you a cat
last time, did he not?

58
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,812
Yes.

59
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,690
Professor Browne is well?

60
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,483
I haven't the faintest idea.

61
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,236
Are we to have
the pleasure of meeting him?

62
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,448
I very much doubt it. I don't know
Professor Browne personally.

63
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,510
- Was there something else?
- As a matter of fact, there is.

64
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,845
Would you come this way, Miss Price?

65
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,430
Well, I'm very anxious
to get home, you know.

66
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,829
Come along, please.

67
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,541
Get down, Charlie. I want to ride.

68
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,420
Stop it this instant!

69
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,175
Children, this is Miss Price.

70
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,803
Carrie, Charles, and Paul Rawlins.
All the way from London.

71
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,889
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?

72
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,891
The government's trying to evacuate

73
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,393
as many children as possible
into the country.

74
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,561
Very sensible.

75
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,688
Today they sent us 45.

76
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,400
And I've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

77
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,277
These are the last three.

78
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,613
All right, children, pick up your things.

79
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,578
You're not suggesting that I should
take these children into my house?

80
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,038
Exactly.

81
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,582
Oh, I'm sorry,
but that's quite out of the question.

82
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,918
Children and I don't get on.

83
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,837
I believe you, miss.
Come on, back to London.

84
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,922
Hurray!

85
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,256
Be quiet.

86
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,259
Besides, I have work to do,
very important work.

87
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,930
Miss Price, you do have
that entire house to yourself.

88
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,432
And according to the order
of the Ministry of Civil Defense,

89
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,808
you have no choice.

90
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,435
I see.

91
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,830
Very well, if that is the case,

92
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,272
I shall take them into my house
with the understanding

93
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,150
that you find a more suitable home
as soon as possible.

94
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,568
Fine, come along.

95
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,618
Ah! Good morning, Miss Price.

96
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,162
There they are. Oh, Miss Price.

97
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,956
What a charitable thing you are doing,

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,208
taking in these poor
unfortunates from the city.

99
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,459
Hold this very carefully.

100
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,462
I wonder, Miss Price,
if I may drop by later this afternoon.

101
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,505
Why?

102
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,193
Ah, well, we have their spiritual
needs to consider now. Do we not?

103
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,177
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

104
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,303
Oh!

105
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,659
My parcel, please.

106
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,161
Bring your things inside.

107
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,833
A bit murky, ain't it?

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,293
Yeah.

109
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,337
Not another house
around here for miles.

110
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,967
Wipe your feet.

111
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,343
Big place, this.

112
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,012
Who else lives here?

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,597
I live alone.

114
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,515
It suits my purpose.

115
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,519
All right. Come along, everybody.

116
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,945
A cat!

117
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,450
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.

118
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,328
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him, that's all.

119
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,498
Yes, scared to death. You can see that.

120
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,169
What do you call your cat?

121
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,630
I don't believe in giving
animals ridiculous names.

122
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,549
I call him Cosmic Creepers,
because that's the name he came with.

123
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,552
You will sleep in here.

124
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,179
This was my father's bedroom.

125
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,681
And I want you
to be very careful of everything in it.

126
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,224
You boys take the bed, there.

127
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,309
All right, miss.

128
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,186
- What was your name?
- It's Carrie, miss.

129
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,438
Carrie, you sleep on the sofa in there.

130
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,773
Thank you, miss.

131
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,066
Is that all you brought?

132
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,526
We ain't exactly burdened
down with frillies.

133
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,779
Travel light, that's us.

134
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,074
Well, I don't think this
arrangement is going to work,

135
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,159
but it seems that I have no alternative.

136
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,578
We'll do our best, miss. Really we will.

137
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,623
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.

138
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,668
Supper is at 6:00.
You will wash thoroughly...

139
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,544
- Wash?
- You will wash yourselves,

140
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,421
otherwise there will be no supper.

141
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,839
Is that clear?

142
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,261
A house of horror,
that's what we've come to.

143
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,145
Please don't bother to whisper.

144
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,856
I'm exceptionally keen of hearing.

145
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,275
You are planning to run back to London.

146
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,569
If you've any plotting to do,
please do it elsewhere

147
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,363
where I shan't have to listen to it.

148
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,491
I'm afraid I don't know much
about what children eat.

149
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,368
You'll have to make do as I do.

150
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,954
Is there anything particular
that you fancy?

151
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,833
Sausage and mash,
bubble and squeak, toad in the hole.

152
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,293
Fried fish. Oh, anything at all.

153
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,547
I'm afraid you
won't find any fried foods in this house.

154
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,340
- No fried food?
- No.

155
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,259
How do you keep your health?

156
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,972
Cabbage buds, rose hips,
glyssop seed, elm bark,

157
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,266
whortle yeast and stewed nettles.

158
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,282
"Dear madam, with this shipment,

159
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,743

"Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne."

00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,765
My first broom.

165
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,897
Time to go. Everybody up.

166
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,485
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

167
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,488
Now, let's see how we fly this thing.

168
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,156
Here we are.

169
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,036
"Clasp the broom with both hands."

170
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,497
Yes, of course.

171
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,299
"No, never astride the broom."
Yes, of course.

172
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,736
"Technically, a witch is always a lady

173
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,803
"except when circumstances

00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,223
"Take an easy,
graceful, sideways position."

175
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,183
Of course, that's much better.

176
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,477
An easy, graceful, sideways position.

177
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,564
There we are. How's that?

178
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,069
"To start up the broom,
your basic formula."

179
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,952
I wasn't ready!

180
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,974
Now, watch this.

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,314
Here we go.

182
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,212
It's going to be a little
different this time.

183
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,930
All right, I know it's not ladylike.

184
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,901
- Cor!
- What's the matter?

185
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,490
- How does she do that?
- 'Cause she's a witch.

186
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,034
- That's the sort of thing witches do.
- Oh.

187
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,763
She don't fly good, do she?

188
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,104
She's crashed!

189
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,356
Come on, now's our chance to hop it.

190
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,649
Suppose she's hurt?

191
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,985
Go on. You can't hurt a witch.

192
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,112
Look out!

193
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,581
She's proper cross, now.
Let's get away from here.

194
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,333
Hang on. I'm having a bit of a think.

195
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,919
"A witch she is," says you.

196
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,714
"Then let's use the old loaf," says I.

197
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,424
Let's get back to London.

198
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,468
What we have here is an opportunity.

199
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,971
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

200
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,431
Not ruddy likely.

201
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,141
That's the opportunity.

202
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,436
And I intend to make the most of it.
Come on.

203
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,605
Bran porridge.

204
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,689
Thank you, miss.

205
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,775
Very healthful, I'm sure.

206
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,612
Hurt your foot, Miss Price?

207
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,280
Oh, just twisted my ankle.

208
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,656
Sorry to hear that.

209
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,326
Thank you. It's nothing serious.

210
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,495
Lovely weather for flying last night.

211
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,002
Why did you say that, Charles?

212
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,171
Game's up, Miss Price.

213
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,173
We know what you are.

214
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,883
I see.

215
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,681
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.

216
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,104
Thank you. I should be most grateful
if you didn't tell anyone in the village.

217
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,233
'Course, there'll have to be one or two
little changes made around here.

218
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,153
I mean, I'd like to see an occasional
sausage on the table here.

219
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,780
A bit of strawberry jam.

220
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,906
Charlie!

221
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,491
Let me handle this.

222
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,452
And another thing, Miss Price,
there'll be no more of this

223
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,579
wash, wash, wash, mornin' and night.

224
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,581
Anything else?

225
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,919
Now you mention it,
I could do with a bit of lolly.

226
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,213
Lolly?

227
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,633
Cash, cold hard cash.

228
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,635
You must have buckets of it.

229
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,095
For your information,

230
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,723
the most accomplished of witches
can't make money out of thin air.

231
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,892
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?

232
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,564
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

233
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,984
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

234
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,652
I am a witch, you know.

235
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,323
What will you do? Turn me into a toad?

236
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,784
Lovely, a toad with pink eyes.

237
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,245
I might just do that.

238
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,414
Go on, then. I dare you.

239
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,416
Very well, Charles.

240
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,045
You shouldn't have said that to her.

241
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,755
She don't frighten me.

242
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,632
She can't even ride a proper broom.

243
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,759
Excuse me, Charles.

244
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,311
Oh, Charlie!

245
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,565
That's better than a toad.
That's a rabbit.

246
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,067
Bother! I never seem
to be able to manage toads.

247
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,824
Stop! Leave him alone!

248
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't let Charlie get hurt.

249
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,122
Oh, not to worry.
My spells don't last very long.

250
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,916
I'm just an apprentice witch, you know.

251
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,637
Look out, Charlie!

252
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,814
You flamin' brute!

253
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,070
I'll teach you to do that to me!

254
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,990
Let Cosmic Creepus alone.
Weren't his fault.

255
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,368
I'm afraid it's my fault.

256
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,662
Bad enough not being
able to manage a broom,

257
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,373
I can't perform a simple, basic spell.

258
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,833
You dared her to do it.

259
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,211
I don't see why we can't all be friends.

260
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,588
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.

261
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,298
Of course I'm not.

262
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,052
- See?
- If only I could trust you.

263
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,430
You see, the work I'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

264
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,182
How do you mean?

265
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,685
I mean, exceptionally important.

266
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,436
Most secret.

267
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,982
What do you say, Charlie.
We can keep a secret.

268
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,485
Yeah, if someone made
it worth our while.

269
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,445
I don't follow.

270
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,700
Simple, you give us something
valuable to seal the pact.

271
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,286
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

272
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,871
It's for her own protection, ain't it?

273
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,456
If we broke the pact,

274
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,042
we'd have to give back
the valuable object.

275
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,378
I think it's an excellent idea.

276
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,006
I wonder what I could give you?

277
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,925
Would you settle for one of my spells?

278
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,969
I bet that's not worth much.

279
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,221
Come with me.

280
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,603
I liked you better as a rabbit, Charlie.

281
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,980
Shut up, you.

282
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,732
Well, I never had a rabbit.

283
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,986
Careful what you touch in here.

284
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,741
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

285
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,119
When I signed for my witchcraft course,

286
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,914
there was a free bonus,
a certain marvelous traveling spell,

287
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,291
if you paid promptly in advance.

288
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,752
I think I'll give you that one.

289
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,129
- Is it valuable?
- Certainly!

290
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,093
Poisoned dragon's liver!

291
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,179
Poisoned dragon liver.

292
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,640
You mean you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

293
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,019
Well, it comes prepared.
It's part of the school equipment.

294
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,064
Ah, here we are. "The traveling spell."

295
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,775
All right, everybody gather around.

296
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,445
All right, now let's see.

297
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:49,033
Does anyone have a bracelet or a ring?
Something that you can twist.

298
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,201
No, Miss Price.

299
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,369
What about you, Paul?

300
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,080
I always carry a few things
around with me.

301
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,457
You never know when
they might come in useful.

302
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,459
A piece of blue glass.

303
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,628
A lovely bit of string.

304
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,089
Horseshoe nail.

305
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,801
What's that?

306
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,678
A knob, come from the bed upstairs.

307
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,389
It twists, don't it?

308
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,557
Yeah, twisted right off.

309
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,268
Yes, I think that will be all right.

310
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,647
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit,
will you?

311
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,089
There.

312
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,507
Isn't that pretty!

313
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,800
Is that all we get?

314
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,054
This knob will now work
the famous traveling spell.

315
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,849
And what's the famous traveling spell?

316
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,183
How does it work?

317
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,311
Well, you take this knob
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

318
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,148
Then, turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left.

319
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,024
Then, in a firm, clear voice,

320
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,361
tell it where you want to go,
and the bed will take you there.

321
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,989
- Go on!
- Miss Price, will it really?

322
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,658
Well, I see no reason to think otherwise.

323
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,245
Oh, thank you for the lovely gift.

324
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,789
Oh, I'm sorry, but it does belong to Paul.

325
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,791
He's the only one
who can work the spell.

326
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,876
Me?

327
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,002
Yes.

328
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,879
That's right. Mine, now wasn't it.

329
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,048
That's the way the spell works.

330
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,718
Nice mess he'll make of things.

331
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,388
Oh, bother.

332
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,848
You children run upstairs,

333
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,018
but mind you, don't try anything
with the bedknob till I get back.

334
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,813
"Dear madam,
it grieves me to inform you,

335
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,690
"that due to the war,
we have been forced

336
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,318
"to close down
our college of witchcraft.

337
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,153
"This means that we shall
not be sending you

338
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,740
"the final lesson in which
you expressed so much interest."

339
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,912
We were wondering
what was keeping you.

340
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,872
I've had some very bad news.

341
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,582
Is there anything we can do?

342
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,459
No, no, thank you.

343
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,006
Yes, yes, there is
something that Paul can do.

344
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,842
- Me?
- Paul, I need the bedknob back.

345
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,469
I must get to London immediately.

346
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,555
No, I want to go to the jungle.

347
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,015
Come with me, Paul.

348
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,940
Now, Paul, ridiculous as it may seem

349
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,442
to have to explain this
to a six-year-old child,

350
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,944
but I do need your help.

351
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,278
Go ahead.

352
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,740
I was expecting a very
important spell in the mail

353
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,284
from my teacher,
Professor Emelius Browne,

354
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,744
and it hasn't come.

355
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,829
What's that got to do with my knob?

356
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,832
I must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

357
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,462
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

358
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,506
That is why I need the knob.

359
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,259
What is your decision?

360
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,559
Thank you, Paul.

361
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,314
I brought this for your hair, Carrie.
It may be windy.

362
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,650
Thank you. Oh, it's ever so nice.

363
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,361
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?

364
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,904
- Twice.
- Good.

365
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,699
Charles, you'd better
put on something warmer.

366
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,867
The bed may travel quite fast.

367
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,829
I'm not going. I'm staying right here.

368
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,290
But why, Charlie?

369
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,875
All that rubbish about a traveling bed.

370
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,128
It won't work, that's why.

371
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,672
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

372
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,551
We don't want to scratch
the wall when we take off, do we?

373
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,886
How's a ruddy big bed, like that,

374
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,931
going to get out of this room,
with those little windows?

375
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,642
I don't know, Charles.

376
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,228
There's a great many things
about magic that I don't know.

377
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,980
We'll just have to find out.

378
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,025
Lovely. Just so's you leave me out of it.

379
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,652
I don't fancy making a fool of myself.

380
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,030
What's come over you lately, Charlie?

381
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,698
You're no fun, anymore.

382
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,302
Help me to tidy up the bed, Carrie.

383
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,827
We don't want to go to London
with an unmade bed.

384
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,037
How old is Charles?

385
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,705
Eleven, going on twelve.

386
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,543
I see. That's what my father used to call
the age of "Not believing."

387
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,212
What's that supposed to be?

388
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,675
When you rush around
in hopeless circles

389
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,888
Searching everywhere
for something true

390
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,726
You're at the age
of not believing

391
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,396
When all the make believe is through

392
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,398
That's Charlie to a T.

393
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,319
When you set aside
your childhood heroes

394
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,448
And your dreams
are lost upon a shelf

395
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,161
You're at the age of not believing

396
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,749
and worst of all you doubt yourself

397
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,709
Throw that into the wastebasket.

398
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,922
You're a castaway
where no one hears you

399
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,259
On a barren isle in a lonely sea

400
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,844
What's that supposed to be? Poetry?

401
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,681
Where did all the happy endings go?

402
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,268
Where can all the good times be?

403
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,270
Everyone on the bed who's going.

404
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:15,109
You must face the age of not believing

405
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,029
Doubting everything you ever knew

406
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,239
The knob, Paul.

407
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,493
Until at last you start believing

408
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:30,040
There's something wonderful in you

409
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,001
Lovely sentiment, I'm sure.

410
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,504
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

411
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,297
Repeat after me.

412
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,301
Take us to Professor Emelius Browne.

413
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,638
Take us to Professor...

414
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,308
Emelius Browne.

415
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,643
Very good.

416
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:54,148
Headmaster,
Correspondence College of Witchcraft.

417
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:59,319
Headmaster, Correspondence College.

418
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,781
Of Witchcraft, London.

419
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,659
Of Witchcraft, London.

420
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,828
Now, when I say "go,"

421
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,957
tap the knob three times
and turn it a quarter turn to the left.

422
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,836
- Left.
- That's it.

423
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,756
Now, we better hold on tight.

424
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,843
The behavior of the bed
is something I'm not quite sure of.

425
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,304
Let me breathe a little.

426
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,347
All right, Paul, ready?

427
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,767
Go.

428
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,021
One, two, three.

429
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,496
Is this London?

430
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,499
Course it is.
Can't you smell that lovely, sooty air?

431
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,875
Marvelous, ain't it?

432
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,627
Well, Charles,
are you convinced by now?

433
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,045
Not yet, I ain't.

434
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,381
I don't see no Professor Browne.

435
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,924
Neither do I, in point of fact.

436
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,302
You children look after the bed
while I make inquiries for Mr. Browne.

437
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,099
I told you this flamin' bed wouldn't work.

438
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,934
Oh, Charlie, don't start that again.

439
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,519
It didn't work proper.

440
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,605
- This bed was supposed to take us to...
- Look!

441
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,775
Professor Browne!

442
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,735
Come on!

443
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,622
Ladies and gentlemen!

444
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,083
Gather around, please,
ladies and gentlemen!

445
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,045
Please note the name,
ladies and gentlemen,

446
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,714
Professor Emelius Browne.

447
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:29,011
I am here to divert, to amuse,
and, yes, even to help you.

448
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,512
There he is!

449
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,306
It is not what things are.

450
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,311
It is what they seem to be.

451
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,937
Is that not so, madam?

452
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,440
That ain't the kind
of professor I expected.

453
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,860
I'm not sure it's the kind of professor
Miss Price expected, either.

454
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,322
What effect a little smoke is

455
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,868
with a dash of hocus pocus
and the scent of burning...

456
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,789
And the scent
of burning sulfur in the air.

457
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,170
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for my next trick,

458
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,252
may I draw your attention

459
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,922
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass

460
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,966
framed in an ordinary,
unprepared frame.

461
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,262
May I also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

462
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,850
Now, I shall place the framed glass
in this brown, unprepared,

463
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,102
unprepared, mark you,
ladies and gentlemen,

464
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,480
unprepared, brown, paper bag.

465
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,981
I shall now attempt

466
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:27,778
to drive the steel nail through the glass
without breaking the glass!

467
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,572
"Impossible," I can hear you say.

468
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,532
We shall see.

469
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,040
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

470
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,686
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
No, ladies, please don't go.

471
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,046
Don't leave now
and regret lost opportunities later.

472
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,473
You, young sir,

473
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,893
would you care to warble
like the storied nightingale?

474
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,396
With this inexpensive device,

475
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,899
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so.

476
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,405
How much?

477
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,281
For you, sir, one penny.

478
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,742
One copper coin of the realm.

479
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,295
Carrie, I'm very surprised at you,
wandering off like this.

480
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,382
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

481
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,010
It don't work. I've been cheated!

482
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,971
Is that Professor Browne?

483
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,473
It is indeed, my dear.

484
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,766
How may I serve you?

485
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,453
Would you be interested
in the mating call

486
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,687
of the Brazilian Matouacan bird?

487
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,605
Known as the bird of love?

488
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,608
Very useful, eh?

489
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,943
You are the headmaster

490
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,571
of the Emelius Browne
Correspondence College of Witchcraft?

491
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,780
The late headmaster.

492
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,074
The college, alas, is now defunct.

493
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,036
Professor Browne,
I am one of your pupils.

494
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,165
My dear lady, you are, indeed,
an ornament to the college.

495
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,958
- Splendid!
- Not at all.

496
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,128
I was shocked and dismayed
when you closed down the college

497
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,464
without that most important last lesson.

498
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,966
I'm sorry, my dear, no refunds.

499
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,259
Look at your contract.

500
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,637
But I must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson!

501
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,848
The matter is closed.
I bid you good day!

502
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,517
I have an appointment
at my club for squash rackets.

503
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,395
The matter is not closed!
Don't let him get away.

504
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,772
Right-o!

505
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,777
Leave go of me!

506
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,822
Would you mind? Would you mind?
Would you mind...

507
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,990
Ah, here we are.

508
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,117
Will you get this child off my leg?

509
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,327
Would you get this child...

510
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,832
Cor!

511
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,756
Now, I trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

512
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,549
Look out!

513
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,470
Well, there goes another rabbit.

514
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,514
Oh! What was all that about?

515
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,225
I changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

516
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,812
My spell? From my school?

517
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,374
Not one of your
best spells, in point of fact.

518
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,690
It doesn't last very long.

519
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,609
Some of your others are much better.

520
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,319
But I don't understand.

521
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,779
My spell?

522
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,615
They were just nonsense
words that I got out of an old book.

523
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,450
Well, they worked perfectly well for me.

524
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,371
They worked for you?

525
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,545
Good woman, some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

526
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,548
You got the words for these spells
out of some old book you say?

527
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,050
Well, more or less.
I changed them 'round a bit.

528
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,428
I gave them a bit
of my own style as it were.

529
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,722
The old sorcerers
did have a bit of a tendency

530
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,891
to waffle on, but dear lady,

531
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,978
I never thought I'd meet
somebody like you.

532
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,814
What a treasure.

533
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,401
Mr. Browne, will you
please stick to the point!

534
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,028
I would like
to see this book, immediately!

535
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,071
Certainly.

536
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,865
It's at my new town house.

537
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,409
Would you care to
join me for luncheon?

538
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,245
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

539
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,539
Thank you. We'd be delighted.

540
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,291
We shall all go together.

541
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,918
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul.

542
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,093
You go 'round the other side.
I always travel on the left.

543
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,097
Will you give the address
to Paul, please.

544
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,684
May I ask, how we're going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

545
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,353
My dear Professor Browne,
with your own traveling spell,

546
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,814
the one you gave with
the course as a bonus.

547
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,774
My traveling spell?

548
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,401
That works, as well?

549
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,486
Just give the address, please.

550
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,156
Eight Wynchfield road.

551
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,452
Bed, take us to Eight Wynchfield road.

552
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,630
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

553
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,632
Oh, perfectly safe.

554
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,302
Bit theatrical, perhaps,
but then, most good spells are.

555
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,464
Well, we're here.

556
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,591
I would never have believed it.

557
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,068
You must have given us
the wrong address.

558
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,762
You don't live here, do you?

559
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,556
In point of fact, I do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

560
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,518
I found the front door open.
The house was deserted.

561
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,728
Everyone has left the neighborhood.

562
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,189
Now, why should they do that?

563
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,401
This probably
has something to do with it.

564
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,697
Merciful heavens!

565
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,950
I should think you'd be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

566
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,303
You'd have thought so, wouldn't you?

567
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,704
I am by nature, a little bit of a coward.

568
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,580
But then I pondered, as I often do.

569
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,416
In the perverse nature of things,

570
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,628
this diabolical object is probably
the best friend I've ever had.

571
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,007
It enables me for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

572
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,091
Shall we go in?

573
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,013
Rothschild '26.

574
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,683
Noble, worldly-wise,
but with a charming touch of innocence.

575
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,978
- Wouldn't you say?
- Mr. Browne, the book. Where is it?

576
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,813
Dear lady, you are relentless.

577
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,189
The book is in the library

578
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,192
and we shall proceed there
after finishing our cheese and wine.

579
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,570
Why'd you keep the curtains closed?

580
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,115
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candlelight.

581
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,993
More likely,
so's the coppers don't peek in

582
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,745
and catch you hidin' out here.

583
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,414
Now, why don't you young things
have a look around the house?

584
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,268
I want to have a chat with Miss Price.

585
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,126
- May we?
- Yes, run along, children.

586
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,627
But mind you, don't touch anything.

587
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,255
Remember, this house doesn't
belong to Mr. Browne.

588
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,425
Mr. Browne, where is that book?

589
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,511
I must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

590
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,108
What is it? A toy shop?

591
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,360
No, it's a nursery.

592
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,111
Ain't you ever seen a nursery?

593
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,030
No, and neither have you.

594
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,404
Would you hold this, please?

595
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,129
What do you think of that?

596
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,053
Well, I don't know what to think.

597
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,056
Miss Price, just think
how successful I could be

598
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,267
with an assistant
who can really do magic!

599
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,351
Oh?

600
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,728
Dear lady, have you ever
considered entering,

601
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,730
what some of us call, "Show business?"

602
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,774
The what business?

603
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,443
The theater, pantomimes,

604
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,736
village fairs, the seaside, Brighton,

605
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,405
Blackpool, follies on the prom...

606
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,032
Mr. Browne,
I have very important work to do.

607
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,493
Listen to me. We could make a packet.

608
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,954
Let us strike a bargain

609
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,000
You possess a gift
but I can speak the jargon

610
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,877
That will give your
gift the needed lift

611
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,961
Oh?

612
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,007
You possess the know how
and I command the show how

613
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:14,471
Oh, how successful
you could be with me

614
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,765
I'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.

615
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,309
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.

616
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,643
No, your first name, my dear.

617
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,769
Eglantine.

618
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,896
Eglantine?

619
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,733
Eglantine

620
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,651
Oh, how you'll shine

621
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,155
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

622
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,824
Eglantine, Eglantine

623
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,367
Hark to the stars

624
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,703
Destiny calls us

625
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,332
The future is ours
as the shine sells the boot

626
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,334
And the blossoms the fruit

627
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,962
All you need to succeed in your plan

628
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,717
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely

629
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,553
And I'm your man

630
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,767
For I have an acumen
that's nigh superhuman

631
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,436
I sell things that nobody can

632
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:08,358
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest

633
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,402
I'm your man

634
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,613
Eglantine, Eglantine

635
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,697
Mr. Browne!

636
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,823
Oh, how you shine

637
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,968
Mr. Browne, will you please...

638
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,117
Your lot and my lot

639
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,161
Have got to combine

640
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,496
Eglantine, Eglantine

641
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,660
Mr. Browne, do you hear me?

642
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,082
Hark to the stars

643
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,124
Destiny calls us

644
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,269
Mr. Browne, I'm warning you.

645
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,002
The future is ours

646
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,132
What are you reading?

647
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,971
Isle of Naboombu.

648
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,764
Can't be no such place.

649
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,891
There is too such a place.

650
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,477
These pictures proves it, don't it?

651
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,564
A bit weird, ain't it?

652
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,983
Animals wearing hats and things?

653
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,569
I like it.

654
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,238
I warned you, Mr. Browne.

655
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,365
Now, where is the book?

656
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,993
Well? Where is it?

657
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,804
At last, Mr. Browne!

658
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,062
The Spells of Astoroth.

659
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,147
Of course.

660
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,151
Here's the traveling spell.
This is where you got it.

661
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,280
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

662
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,198
Oh, you're back, Mr. Browne.

663
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,368
Miss Price, a word about your tactics.

664
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,038
I don't mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger,

665
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,349
or something with a bit of dash to it,

666
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,708
but always a fluffy, white rabbit?

667
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,917
It's intolerable!

668
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,545
Ah, here we are.

669
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,631
"Substitutiary locomotion."

670
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,508
"The ancient art of...

671
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:05,183
"The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words.

672
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,726
"These words are..."

673
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,151
But the rest of the book is missing!

674
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,487
Now you see why
I closed down the college.

675
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,865
But where are the other pages?

676
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,034
Oh, I haven't the foggiest.

677
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,535
Listen to me, Mr. Browne.

678
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,745
I'm all ears.

679
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,413
You will be if you don't pay attention.

680
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,666
Where did you get this book?

681
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,394
I bought it from a chap
in the street market.

682
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,544
There was a bit of unpleasantness
as a matter of fact.

683
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,339
He claimed
that I'd given him a dud coin, I ask you.

684
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,925
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.

685
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,177
He got one half and I got the other.

686
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,596
But where's the other half now?

687
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,075
Oh, it's probably been thrown away.

688
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,077
If it still exists,
there's only one place to find it.

689
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,101
Where is that?

690
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,146
Portobello Road

691
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,691
Portobello Road

692
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,236
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed

693
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,572
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

694
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,118
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

695
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,455
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road

696
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,293
Rare alabaster

697
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,878
Genuine plaster

698
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,340
A filigreed samovar
owned by the Czars

699
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,802
A pen used by Shelley
a new Botticelli

700
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,264
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars

701
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,473
Made in Hong Kong?

702
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,851
Two bob a dozen, would you say?

703
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,103
Waterford crystal

704
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,813

the banks of the Thames

708
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,494
Very interesting,
but where do they sell books?

709
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,580
There's a little place around the corner.

710
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,001
Portobello Road Portobello Road

711
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,546

You'll meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road

715
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,642
Lovely to see you, goodbye.

716
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,316
What I want is the other half
of this book.

717
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,067
All in good time, my dear.

thank you.

735
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,852
This good lady is looking
for the other half of this book.

736
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,158
It's called, The Spells of Astoroth.

737
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,748
I don't keep no torn
or damaged books here.

738
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,835
What do you think I am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?

739
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,924
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road

740
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,763
I think, if I'm right, there's another book
store along here, somewhere.

741
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,432
Grandpa, you don't
expect to sell a piano like that do you?

742
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,810
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

743
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:41,440
Portobello Road Portobello Road

744
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,152

down in Portobello Road

747
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,773
Come on, ducks.

748
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,985
Come on, girls.

749
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,998
Lovely.

750
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,455
Oh!

751
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,658
Closing time. Closing time.

752
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,827
Closing time.

753
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,457
Closing time.

754
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,085
- Bye.
- Bye.

755
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,503
Bye.

Anything and everything
a chap can unload

760
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,164
Hey, guv'nor,
somethin' for the lady friend? Nylons?

761
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,416
- No, thank you.
- Uh, petrol coupons?

762
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,126
- Chocs for the little ones?
- Nope.

763
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,921
How about one of these?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

764
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,191
Do be a good chap and run away.

765
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,882
Would you fancy this, then?

766
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,426
Ah...

767
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,762
Now you have my undivided attention.

768
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,157
What can I do for you, friend?

769
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,265
You're to get over
to the bookman straightaway.

770
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,100
He wants to see you.

771
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,560
You, too!

772
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,020
Who is the bookman?

773
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,439
And what right has he got
to order me about?

774
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,150
Under the circumstances
I think we better ask questions later.

775
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,485
Excuse me.

776
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,909
Sorry, guv, no one
told me about the stairs.

777
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,995
Why didn't you just bring
Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

778
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,331
and half the household's cavalry,
as well?

779
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,333
What's the bed for?

780
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,001
It's a present for you.

781
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,836
That's what he said.

782
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,297
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.

783
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,424
Except for this knob, which is mine.

784
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,926
Be that as it may.

785
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,637
Bookman, there's been
bad blood between us long enough.

786
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,807
Let this glittering gift
begin friendship anew.

787
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,558
Draw the curtains and lock the door.

788
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,851
You'll be snug as a bug.

789
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,312
Mr. Browne,
isn't that the section of the manuscript

790
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,563
that we've been looking for?

791
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,524
Who is this person?

792
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,359
A Miss Eglantine Price,

793
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,444
a charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

794
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,031
Miss Price, I've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

795
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,326
Mr. Swinburne told me you
were in the market making inquiries.

796
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,828
And here we are.

797
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,498
I don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last,

798
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,458
there isn't much I wouldn't do.

799
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,294
Or haven't done, for that matter.

800
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,670
Right, guv?

801
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,214
You'll close your mouth, Swinburne!

802
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,049
Is that clear?

803
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:09,722
It's all rather like a jolly detective
story, or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

804
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,725
We're both after the same spell.

805
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,228
You have one clue. I have the other.

806
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,775
In that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

807
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,697
I assume you're looking
for the same thing I am.

808
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,574
May I?

809
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,662
This is quite a moment for both of us.

810
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:41,086
"Substitutiary locomotion,
the lost miracle of the ancients."

811
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,713
And so on and so forth.

812
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,423
Ah. Here we are.

813
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:48,802
"The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words.

814
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,179
"These words are..."

815
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,518
"Engraved on the star that was always
worn by the sorcerer, Astoroth."

816
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,812
But where are
the words of the spell?

817
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,815
I assumed they'd
be in your half of the manuscript.

818
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,567
But I thought they'd be in yours.

819
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,905
Once again, a dead end.

820
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,784
I shall never know the secret.

821
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,621
Isn't that old Astoroth?

822
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,373
And there's his star.

823
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,125
It's a pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

824
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,668
But why the animals?

825
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,964
Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages

826
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,468
and searched for the spells that would
make them more like humans.

827
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:33,847
The legend is that finally the animals
rebelled at the experiment,

828
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:38,143
killed Astoroth,
and stole many of his powers.

829
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,646
Including the star with the spell on it.

830
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,358
Possibly. They found a ship,
sailed away,

831
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,318
and were never heard of again.

832
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:50,489
However, there's a final notation
in my half of the book,

833
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,991
saying that in the 17th century,

834
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,286
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea

835
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,873
half-mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

836
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:05,045
Before he died, he swore
he'd seen an island ruled by animals.

837
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,256
Where?

838
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,718
There is, I regret to say,
no such island.

839
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,555
I looked for it in every chart.

840
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,142
The Isle of Naboombu does not exist.

841
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,018
Oh, it does, too!

842
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,395
Got me own...

843
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,355
What is he trying to say?

844
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,192
Nothin'.
When he don't say nothin' he burbles.

845
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,362
I wish the child to speak!

846
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,906
Now you've done it.

847
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,367
There is, too, such a place.

848
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:40,581
Got me own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

849
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,542
Let me see it.

850
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,712
You're not interested, Bookman.
It's just a simple children's book.

851
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,380
I'll be the judge of that.

852
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,215
- Give it to me.
- No!

853
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,593
Please don't annoy me.

854
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,012
Give me the book, boy!

855
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,722
Not likely.

856
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,392
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it?

857
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,566
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather use me own.

858
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,234
Sentiment, you know.

859
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,654
Come along, Paul,
I believe it's time to go.

860
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,617
Go? How, my dear?
The door is locked.

861
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,953
Observe the fundamental
weakness of the criminal mind.

862
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,914
You'll believe in no one, or in anything.

863
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,832
I understand. The knob, Paul.

864
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,417
- Right.
- Of course you do, my dear.

865
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,212
Do you realize
we can tell them the complete truth?

866
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,963
They will believe nothing!

867
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,090
He's up to something, you know.

868
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,636
Bookman, before your very eyes,
I shall cause this bed

869
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,347
and all the occupants upon it,
to disappear.

870
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,723
Disappear?

871
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,268
I'd like to see a cheapjack,
tenth-rate entertainer

872
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,145
do a trick like that.

873
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,731
Cheapjack entertainer!
Now, that was naughty.

874
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:48,982
All right, Paul.

875
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,609
Where to?

876
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,486
To the Island of Naboombu.

877
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,571
- I'm very curious about that place.
- Good.

878
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,492
Bed, take us
to the Island of Naboombu.

879
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,458
Enough of this nonsense.
Get the book.

880
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,415
Beastly climate!
I never did fancy the sea.

881
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,083
Where are we?

882
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,793
Naboombu, of course.

883
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,171
I ain't never seen no
island like this before.

884
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,216
I'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

885
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,593
That's right!

886
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,970
Here we are, on page three.

887
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,687
Ahoy, Mr. Codfish.

888
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,356
Hello, young fellow.

889
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,067
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

890
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,654
Now I'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

891
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,741
Not too bright, is he?

892
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,285
- He's me brother.
- Oh!

893
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,120
Sorry.

894
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,123
Mr. Codfish,
where is the island of Naboombu?

895
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,875
You mean the land part?

896
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,376
Oh, that.

897
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,046
Straight up. You can't miss it.

898
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:39,885
None of my business, of course,
but I shouldn't go there if I were you.

899
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,096
Having troubles, they are.

900
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,306
Troubles?

901
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,392
He's right, you know,
a lot of trouble.

902
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,228
Well, trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

903
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,938
I wish to see who is in charge.

904
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,233
What's the rush?
It's really rather splendid down here.

905
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,902
For you, my dear.

906
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,904
Oh, thank you.

907
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,454
How pleasant!

908
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,414
Bobbing along

909
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:14,795
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

910
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:20,425
What a chance
to get a better peep

911
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,596
At the plants
and creatures of the deep

912
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,390
We glide

913
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,727
Far below the rolling tide

914
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,940
Serene

915
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,111
Through the bubbly
blue and green

916
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,573
It's lovely bobbing along

917
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:49,663
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

918
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,960
What if the octopus
the flounder and the cod

919
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,295
think we're rather odd?

920
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,798
It's fun to promenade

921
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,551
Bobbing along singing a song

922
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,888
On the bottom of the
beautiful briny sea

923
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,266
Look.

924
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,572
It's lovely bobbing along

925
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:53,328
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

926
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,667
What a chance to get a better peep

927
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,963
At the plants and creatures of the deep

928
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,006
It's grand

929
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,261
When you're dancing on the sand

930
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,390
Each glance

931
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,602
Bubbles over with romance

932
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,399
It's lovely bobbing along

933
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:27,779
Bobbing along through the water
where we get along swimmingly

934
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:33,451
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above

935
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,787
Two beneath the blue

936
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,706
Could even fall in love

937
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,500
Bobbing along singing a song

938
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:45,213
On the bottom of the beautiful briny sea

939
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,967
Bobbing along singing a song

940
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:53,221
On the bottom of the beautiful briny

941
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:58,310
Shimmery shiny
beautiful briny sea

942
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,692
Bravo. Bravo.
Most exciting. Most exciting.

943
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,655
You've won the ruddy cup.

944
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,347
Help! Help!

945
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,780
This time I really got a whopper!

946
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,619
Whew!

947
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,083
People! People!

948
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,668
Oh, no!

949
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,878
What scurvy luck!

950
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,547
- My goodness!
- I'll deal with this, my dear.

951
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,591
Don't you know that...

952
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,759
Good day, Captain.

953
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,553
L used to be a bit
of a seafaring man, myself.

954
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,056
Many's the time
I've shipped out of Portsmouth.

955
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,266
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.

956
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,893
Huh?

957
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,561
Now, stow it, mate.

958
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,522
Oh, really!

959
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,066
Can't you read readin', huh?

960
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,527
Uh, it says...

961
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,738
"No peopling allowed."

962
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,658
"No peopling allowed." Ridiculous.

963
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,035
Don't antagonize him, Mr. Browne.

964
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,956
That means I gotta throw you all back.

965
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,249
That's what it do.

966
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,625
Wait a minute.

967
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,171
It says here that anybody
can see the King, and that's the law.

968
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,215
Where do it say that?

969
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,758
Here, in me book.

970
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,593
Mmm-hmm.

971
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,803
So it do.

972
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:02,684
But if you people
knew what was good for ya,

973
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:06,396
you'd get yourselves all throwed back!

974
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,274
The King don't like people!

975
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:13,653
Nonetheless, we must see the King
on an urgent, personal matter.

976
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,780
Please lead the way.

977
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,865
Uh-huh.

978
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:21,036
But just don't say
I didn't warn ya, see?

979
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,455
Follow me.

980
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,548
I'm a peaceable sailor
and that sure ain't all

981
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,593
Blow, blow, blow the man down

982
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,148
Get out of here!

983
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,908
Yes, yes.

984
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,993
What can I do for you?

985
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,997
I, uh, caught some people
down at the sea lagoon.

986
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:08,708
They want to see the King.

987
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,043
Really?

988
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:14,172
Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

989
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,843
I don't know that I fancy this.

990
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:22,680
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.

991
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,226
Excuse me, sir. As an all-around
entertainer of sorts,

992
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,436
I am considered not without talent.

993
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,146
Perhaps I can cheer him up?

994
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,689
No, no, no.

995
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:34,192
You don't understand.

996
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,528
As everyone knows,

997
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:41,324
His Majesty is the world's
greatest soccer player.

998
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,998
But, due to a technical problem,

999
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,544
the royal cup match
cannot take place today,

1000
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,797
and His Majesty
had so set his heart on it.

1001
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,841
Throw these...

1002
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,053
Creatures back into the sea.

1003
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,680
Aye, aye, sir.

1004
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,307
Just a moment. I can help.

1005
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,895
Do you really think so?
I'd be most grateful.

1006
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,648
Do you know soccer?

1007
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,900
Do I know anything about soccer?

1008
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,028
Why, I was captain
of Tottenham Hotspurs for two years,

1009
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,239
three seasons with Manchester United.

1010
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,283
- Yes, yes, yes, you'll do.
- Before that I...

1011
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,451
Come this way, please.

1012
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,496
Mr. Browne, are you certain
you'll be all right?

1013
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,921
Now what?

1014
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:42,594
Not an ideal person in many respects,
but Mr. Browne is a very brave man.

1015
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,225
Do you think he's done for?

1016
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,983
Do you think so?

1017
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:05,617
I can't tell you how I appreciate this.

1018
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:09,996
For some reason,
we have great difficulty

1019
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,833
finding referees 'round here.

1020
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:19,839
If there be one thing we like,
it's volunteers.

1021
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,217
Eh, Birdy?

1022
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,639
He's a proper king.
Look at his crown.

1023
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,140
What's he got 'round his neck?

1024
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,144
What a magnificent...

1025
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,854
Ornament, sire.

1026
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,272
Ah, yes.

1027
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,567
Wouldn't be without it.

1028
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,111
Been in the family for years.

1029
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,364
The star of Astoroth.

1030
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,745
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

1031
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:54,415
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers from boiled sweets, please.

1032
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,136
Rise, please.

1033
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:14,602
Loyal fans, this is official.

1034
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:19,357
We have a volunteer referee.

1035
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,541
Let the match begin!

1036
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,920
He's still wearing it.

1037
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,382
Right, Dirty Yellows,
let's have a nice, clean game.

1038
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,887
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.

1039
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,344
Weird sort of game they play here.

1040
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,969
Hurry up. Get rid of it.

1041
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,660
Gracious.

1042
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,288
You're doing fine, matey.

1043
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:47,547
Move it around. Move it around.

1044
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,801
Get on with the match!

1045
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,945
- Foul! Foul!
- They're only animals.

1046
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,364
That's no excuse for dirty football.

1047
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,395
Ref, are you blind?

1048
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:47,565
Be quiet, Charles.
Don't forget who the referee is.

1049
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:11,422
- Don't they have no rules?
- 'Course they do.

1050
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,466
The King makes them up
as he goes along.

1051
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,387
Poor Mr. Browne.

1052
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,597
Do you think he's all right?

1053
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,349
Well, he's moving.

1054
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,144
Steady, matey. Move it around.

1055
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:17,113
Oh, he almost had it then.

1056
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,676
Looks like he's done for, this time.

1057
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,197
Don't just stand there!

1058
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:01,991
Head it in!

1059
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:43,157
Stop that ball!

1060
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,154
Goal.

1061
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,367
Game's over. I win.

1062
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,042
Ah, let me give you a hand, matey.

1063
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,295
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you, so much.

1064
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,298
Oh, please, let me help you on
with your robe.

1065
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,634
Why, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

1066
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:47,972
- Can't have you cold, Sire. Can we?
- Why, no, no.

1067
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,308
Have you ever heard of something
called "the gypsy switch"?

1068
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,393
No.

1069
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,019
Can't say that I have.

1070
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,021
Remind me to tell you
about it sometime.

1071
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,899
I can't tell you when
we've had such a good time.

1072
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,403
We'll carry the memory of Your Majesty
in our hearts for a long while.

1073
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,530
I think it's time to leave.

1074
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,825
Aye. Must you go?

1075
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,161
We must be dashing.
Marvelous game.

1076
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,829
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

1077
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1078
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,245
- Come, children.
- Goodbye.

1079
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,833
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1080
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,668
Friendly lot.

1081
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,213
Don't mind them visiting.

1082
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,049
Wouldn't want them living here!

1083
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:27,845
Come along, children.

1084
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,014
Come on, children. Hurry up.

1085
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,188
Stop gibbering.

1086
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,648
What's the matter with you?

1087
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,026
Your royal star!

1088
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:45,279
They've stolen your royal star.

1089
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,700
Don't be ridiculous.

1090
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,453
What do you think this is?

1091
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,046
Why didn't you

1092
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,132
say so?

1093
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:09,220
All right, Paul,
put the knob on the bed.

1094
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,891
At last, the magic words.

1095
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,022
I'll keep it. Women always lose things.

1096
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,320
Hurry, Paul, the knob.

1097
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,571
It's stuck!

1098
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:31,867
I suppose I should do something.

1099
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,536
Please do. Quick!

1100
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,081
Got it.

1101
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:49,927
Oh, bother! I do hate shoddy work.

1102
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,123
I don't suppose I shall ever
get used to this thing.

1103
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:21,959
Children, will you push the bed
back into place, please.

1104
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,169
I think we could all do
with a nice cup of tea.

1105
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,421
Oh, no time for that.

1106
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,756
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to find this spell.

1107
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,633
I'm going to try it immediately.

1108
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,096
Mr. Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

1109
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,348
My shoe? Oh, fine.

1110
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,309
What's the shoes for?

1111
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,603
Really, Charles,
if you had been paying attention,

1112
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:41,896
I should think you'd be aware

1113
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:46,275
that substitutiary locomotion is the art
of causing inanimate objects

1114
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,652
to take on a life force of their own.

1115
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:52,281
Obviously, I must have
inanimate objects to experiment with.

1116
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,158
Makes sense, don't it?

1117
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,245
Stand back, everyone.
I need plenty of room.

1118
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:06,045
I want you all to be absolutely quiet.

1119
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,047
Mr. Browne,

1120
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,883
- you have the star of Astoroth, I believe.
- Oh, yes.

1121
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,010
It's in my nice, clean hanky.

1122
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,852
It's all right, Mr. Browne.

1123
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,438
I should have realized that it
would be quite impossible

1124
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:26,941
to take an object from
one world into another.

1125
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:35,532
If only I would have had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

1126
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:37,201
I know the words, Miss Price.

1127
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,370
Don't bother Miss Price. She's thinking.

1128
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,580
Charlie, why don't you and I
nip down to the village

1129
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:42,873
and get something for supper.

1130
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:47,962
And I might conceivably call into
the pub for a pint to steady my nerves.

1131
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,840
- Trebonna?
- I do know the words, Miss Price.

1132
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,050
Come along.

1133
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,969
- How can you know the words?
- Frebunna?

1134
01:22:58,598 --> 01:22:59,598
Troop movements,

1135
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,559
and massing of barges
in French and Dutch channel ports.

1136
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,104
The prime minister
has told the nation

1137
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:07,940
to be on the alert
for signs of a possible invasion.

1138
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,040
That was the news...

1139
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,736
To think I might have been able
to do something about all this.

1140
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,446
It's out of your hands now, my dear.

1141
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,407
If only I could have
remembered those words.

1142
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:17,658
It's maddening!

1143
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,369
Why don't someone ask me?

1144
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:21,620
Come off it, Paul.

1145
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,248
You can't remember
those kind of words.

1146
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,166
You mean like...

1147
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,051
How do you know that?

1148
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,386
Easy.

1149
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,054
Says right here in me book.

1150
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:46,228
You mean, it was there in your book
all the time?

1151
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,440
Yes, but nobody ever listens to me.

1152
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,784
Nothing happened!

1153
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,747
Am I doing something wrong?

1154
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,708
Well, to tell you the truth,
it does seem a bit old fashioned.

1155
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,793
After all, we are in the 20th century.

1156
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,378
What do you suggest?

1157
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,715
Well, it needs rhythm, tempo, music.

1158
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,217
As I always say, "Do it with a flair."

1159
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,720
- Do you mind if I have a go?
- Oh, of course not.

1160
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,265
Now, come along, you lot.
We need all the help we can get.

1161
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:36,487
Substitutiary locomotion

1162
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:40,908
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion

1163
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:45,621
It's so weird so feared
And yet wonderful to see

1164
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:49,500
Substitutiary locomotion come to me

1165
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,626
Shh!

1166
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:52,628
Now.

1167
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:07,392
Cor!

1168
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:17,736
I don't want
locomotiary substitution

1169
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:22,074
or remote intransitory convolution

1170
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,703
Only one precise
solution is the key

1171
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:30,874
Substitutiary locomotion it must be

1172
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:35,254
Treguna, mekoides
and trecorum, satis, dee

1173
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,772
Oh!

1174
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:01,113
Substitutiary locomotion

1175
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:05,242
Lovely substitutiary locomotion

1176
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:09,746
You've made substitutiary history

1177
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:14,042
With Treguna, mekoides
and a little help from me

1178
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,670
With Treguna, mekoides and

1179
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,547
Trecorum, satis, dee

1180
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:24,803
Lummy!

1181
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,440
Mr. Browne, what is going on here?

1182
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,108
I haven't the foggiest.

1183
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,152
How do you do?

1184
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,446
Oh, shall we?

1185
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,031
That's my nightgown!

1186
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,616
Is it really, my dear?

1187
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,993
Yes, and I'm not responsible
for its behavior.

1188
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,578
Obviously not, my dear.

1189
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,166
Paul, what on earth are you doing?

1190
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,919
Having a jolly good time, that's what!

1191
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,923
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? It's really most agreeable.

1192
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,549
Yes, but we must do something!

1193
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,052
Didn't I give you
my all-purpose, cut-off spell?

1194
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,678
- Lesson number eight.
- Number eight.

1195
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,115
Yes, number eight, I think it was.

1196
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:09,932
Oye! Me Sunday trousers!

1197
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,814
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner. Oh!

1198
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:21,818
Ow!

1199
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,163
Be careful, Carrie, slow down.

1200
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,668
Charles!

1201
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:43,423
Mr. Browne, will you please
control your shoes?

1202
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:47,177
Dear lady, I very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

1203
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,157
Do you mind?

1204
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:30,512
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash?

1205
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,722
No more for me, thank you.

1206
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:32,889
Oh, Carrie?

1207
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,392
It's very good,
but I've already had two helpings.

1208
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:36,893
I'm full.

1209
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:38,228
Me, too.

1210
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,189
Well, at least somebody wants some.

1211
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,071
Cheer up, my dear.

1212
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,796
This should be
something of a celebration.

1213
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,742
I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:53,827
There doesn't seem
to be much to celebrate.

1215
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:57,456
I still haven't mastered that spell.

1216
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,001
Of course you have! You just need
a little more practice, that's all.

1217
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,211
Do you really think so?

1218
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,546
No doubt about it.

1219
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,132
Meantime, there's nothing
to liven the spirits

1220
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,551
like a little masterjuggling.
Right, Charlie?

1221
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,636
Go on, then, guv.
Give us some juggling.

1222
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,229
Very few better than me at this.

1223
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,108
All you need is 20 years practice,
and a touch of genius.

1224
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,747
Never happened to me before.

1225
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,376
I don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

1226
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,671
Look, she's laughing.

1227
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,103
Oh!

1228
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,775
Oh, Mrs. Hobday, do come in.

1229
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:07,984
Oh, I can't stop, my dear.

1230
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:10,278
I just come by
to bring you the good news.

1231
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,656
- Good news?
- Yes, yes. Mr. Bisselthwaite,

1232
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,282
who brings the milk, you know?

1233
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:16,284
Well, he's promised
to take the children in.

1234
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,247
He and his wife have got that farm,
just the place for growing children.

1235
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:22,332
Put a bit of color back in their cheeks.

1236
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,626
Why? What's the matter?

1237
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:26,503
I thought you'd be pleased.

1238
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,357
You told me yourself
that you were much too busy.

1239
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,215
You have no time
to take care of children.

1240
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:34,511
Circumstances have changed,
somewhat.

1241
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:37,722
That's right.
We got a dad now, Mr. Browne.

1242
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:39,933
Paul.

1243
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,561
Miss Price, is this true?

1244
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:43,770
Of course.

1245
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,731
You do want him to stay with us,
don't you, Miss Price?

1246
01:30:49,485 --> 01:30:51,713
I suppose I hadn't really
thought about it.

1247
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:52,737
What about him?

1248
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:55,198
What do you say
about it, Mr. Browne?

1249
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,033
Well...

1250
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,297
It's all rather sudden.

1251
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:01,455
I don't quite know what to say.

1252
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:04,708
Then I'll leave you two to talk it over.

1253
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,668
Oh, I'll come back in the morning.

1254
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:08,295
Yes. Good night.

1255
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:09,963
- Good night.
- Good night.

1256
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,677
It is true, Mr. Browne,

1257
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,221
you are going to be
our father now, aren't you?

1258
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,683
Well, we...

1259
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:25,395
We are rather rushing
things, aren't we?

1260
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,276
Perhaps Mr. Browne has other things
besides you children to think about?

1261
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,741
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I should have left ages ago.

1262
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:40,076
I... I must get a train
back to London tonight.

1263
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:43,371
It's rather an important matter,
as a matter of fact.

1264
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:44,725
I'd like to tell you about it,

1265
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,209
but it's a little bit hush-hush, you know.

1266
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:48,835
Sort of a secret.

1267
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:52,714
Well, uh, if...

1268
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:59,054
If I've been any sort of help to you,
I'm pleased.

1269
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,224
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

1270
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,684
I've enjoyed being with you.

1271
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:07,103
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.

1272
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,314
Will you be coming back?

1273
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,233
Someday, my dear.

1274
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,818
I, uh, certainly hope
that we shall meet again.

1275
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:17,197
Someday, when all
this war business is over.

1276
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,574
I see.

1277
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:22,118
And then, perhaps,
I shall realize my fondest dream,

1278
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,539
"Eglantine and Emelius,
illusionists extraordinary."

1279
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,543
Just think how
that will look on the poster, huh?

1280
01:32:29,752 --> 01:32:31,152
The children are going to miss you.

1281
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:35,442
Do you really think they will?

1282
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,508
Yes.

1283
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:40,178
Well, I shall miss you, all of you.

1284
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:46,601
If I don't go now,
you might never get rid of me.

1285
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:50,647
Goodbye, Carrie.

1286
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:53,984
Must you really go?

1287
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:56,111
I think it's best for everybody.

1288
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:57,153
Goodbye, Paul.

1289
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,322
I still think you should be our father.

1290
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:01,866
Goodbye, Charlie.

1291
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,619
Do you want me
to come down to the station with you?

1292
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:05,829
No. No.

1293
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:09,624
No, you stay here
and look after everybody.

1294
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:13,962
Goodbye, Miss Price.

1295
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,172
Goodbye, Mr. Browne.

1296
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,392
When is the next train
to London, please?

1297
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,561
Lord bless you, sir.
There ain't no train.

1298
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,105
Nothing till milk job,
4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1299
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:15,334
Do you mind if I wait in here?

1300
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,317
You suit yourself. Good night, sir.

1301
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,194
Good night.

1302
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:42,592
Out you go, Cosmic.

1303
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,602
Hello? Hello?

1304
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,273
Hello!

1305
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,861
Hello? Hello?

1306
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:10,036
Emelius Browne.

1307
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:11,932
Do you know
you could be warm and cozy

1308
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,332
in that house at this very moment?

1309
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:17,794
For once in your useless life
you really seem to have been needed.

1310
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,131
You're a failure, Emelius Browne.

1311
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,508
And a coward.

1312
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,303
No, Fraulein, this is not the invasion,

1313
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:31,433
just a little exercise,
a minor raid to induce panic,

1314
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,309
and to spread a little mischief.

1315
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,770
When you English
get it through you head,

1316
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:39,607
that the German forces can land at will
wherever and whenever we please,

1317
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,651
perhaps you will consider
a reasonable peace.

1318
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,403
Not bloody likely!

1319
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,531
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him.

1320
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:49,367
I must say, it's very tempting.

1321
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:52,328
Colonel, how would you feel
about being turned

1322
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,205
into a nice, white rabbit?

1323
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:58,926
I said, "How would you feel
about being turned

1324
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,837
"into a nice, white rabbit?"

1325
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:03,882
Be quiet, please!

1326
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,390
Not again?

1327
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,559
Your memory, Miss Price.

1328
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:20,190
Charles, would you kindly fetch my
notebook from the workroom, please.

1329
01:36:20,232 --> 01:36:21,316
Right-o.

1330
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,819
Let him go!

1331
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,781
Silence!

1332
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:30,950
Fraulein, we have work to do.

1333
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:33,828
I am sorry, but I must send
all of you someplace

1334
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,872
where you will no longer be a nuisance.

1335
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:50,386
As the words tell the tune

1336
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:52,889
and the moonbeams the moon

1337
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:57,310
all I need to succeed in my plan

1338
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,231
is a champion rare

1339
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:04,234
with a flourish and a flair

1340
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:42,397
Eglantine.

1341
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:12,987
Where is the spell for rabbits?

1342
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:15,281
"Easiest of all," she says.

1343
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,119
Confound it! Can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

1344
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:28,086
There it is.

1345
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:32,090
That's it!

1346
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,096
Uh...

1347
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:51,359
Now, come along, my boy.

1348
01:39:51,443 --> 01:39:54,278
Just for once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

1349
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,614
That's it.
Good lad.

1350
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:34,379
Now what's the use
of putting the children and me

1351
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,070
in that drafty castle?

1352
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:37,613
It's quite chilly.

1353
01:40:37,656 --> 01:40:40,199
Because, Fraulein,
the colonel believes

1354
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:42,262
when the British female
decides to become a nuisance,

1355
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:44,537
she can become the greatest
nuisance in the world.

1356
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:46,289
And I'm inclined to agree with him.

1357
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,917
You need a lesson
in manners, Sergeant.

1358
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,795
If I only had my notebook,
I'd make certain you'd learn a few.

1359
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,313
Jumping Jehoshaphat, more Jerries.

1360
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:23,493
Take it easy, can't you?

1361
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:25,661
Try holding your breath.

1362
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,080
I am holding it.

1363
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,999
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

1364
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,668
No, it's no good.

1365
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,504
He can't do it.

1366
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,049
I could've told you
that in the first place.

1367
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,096
If we can't get Paul
out to give the alarm,

1368
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,306
we'll just have to think
of something else.

1369
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:48,017
What about that spell
that makes things move about?

1370
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:49,462
Oh, but I need weapons.

1371
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,604
How about all these things?

1372
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,983
I'm afraid they're a bit ancient.

1373
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:58,778
Where did this come from?

1374
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:00,988
It's Mr. Browne. That's who it is.

1375
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,615
He's on his way to London.

1376
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:06,577
Mr. Browne?

1377
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:09,622
If you are Mr. Browne,

1378
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:11,666
would you be kind enough
to get down off my lap?

1379
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,378
It is Mr. Browne!

1380
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:18,840
It is you!

1381
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:22,088
You didn't think
that I could do that spell, did you?

1382
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,012
I am glad to see you!

1383
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,681
What about all these Germans?

1384
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:27,849
Well, as Charlie says,

1385
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:30,518
"What's wrong
with the substitutiary locomotion spell?"

1386
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:31,811
That ought to be useful.

1387
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:32,997
No, but it isn't ready, yet.

1388
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:34,501
You saw what happened this afternoon.

1389
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,940
Well, we have to chance it.

1390
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:39,735
We can't let these so-and-sos get away
with their beastly little raid.

1391
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:41,458
Mr. Browne,
won't you get up off the floor,

1392
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,738
and we'll go to work.

1393
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,616
Herr Oberst!

1394
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,135
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you, Emelius.

1395
01:43:04,219 --> 01:43:06,239
Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell, Miss Price.

1396
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:07,430
Oh, not this time, Charlie.

1397
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:10,224
Found this in the castle.
Probably not a magic broom,

1398
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,744
but it might make you feel
more at home.

1399
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:13,746
Well, thank you, Carrie.
That was very thoughtful of you.

1400
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:15,938
Come now, children.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

1401
01:43:58,690 --> 01:43:59,815
Look.

1402
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:57,576
Sound the advance!

1403
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,125
Just in time for the kickoff.

1404
01:47:37,993 --> 01:47:39,577
Steady on the left.

1405
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:45,291
Victory for England and Saint George!

1406
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:48,669
Like the Lord Mayor's show.

1407
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:50,713
Pikemen, hold your distance.

1408
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:24,907
Fire!

1409
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:32,087
Blimey!

1410
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,956
Where's it coming from, Sergeant?

1411
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,249
Sounds like the sea road, sir.

1412
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:11,085
- Come on, lads. After me!
- Come on.

1413
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,931
Good shooting, bowmen!

1414
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:57,983
Well caught, sir! Very good.

1415
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:08,911
Knock his block off! That's it!

1416
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:12,289
Mr. Browne, make those children
take cover this instant!

1417
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:22,276
Are you still there, Colonel?

1418
01:52:22,318 --> 01:52:24,194
I thought you'd be on your way by now.

1419
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:32,494
You see? Things may not be so easy
for you, after all.

1420
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:46,425
Goodbye, Colonel.

1421
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:39,311
- Eglantine, oh, Eglantine.
- Dear Mr. Browne.

1422
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:41,688
Miss Price,
we thought they'd damaged you.

1423
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:43,649
See? No one can hurt Miss Price.

1424
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:49,905
There they are, lads.
I sensed something was afoot.

1425
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:52,366
All right, drive them into the sea.

1426
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:54,785
Firing positions, you fellas. Both sides.

1427
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:03,335
All right, men, hold your fire.

1428
01:54:07,298 --> 01:54:09,508
I think we've taught the Hun a lesson.

1429
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:13,136
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

1430
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:19,601
It's tragic. All your spells,
your equipment, all gone.

1431
01:54:19,644 --> 01:54:23,105
Still, I was able
to perform some small service first.

1432
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:26,233
That mean you ain't going
to be a witch no more?

1433
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:27,401
Never?

1434
01:54:27,443 --> 01:54:28,485
No, Paul.

1435
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,989
I realized some time ago
that I could never be a proper witch.

1436
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:33,198
When was that?

1437
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:35,784
Was it that first magic moment
when you laid eyes on me?

1438
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:39,496
No, it was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

1439
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:41,957
I knew then that anyone

1440
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:45,085
who felt the way I did
about poisoned dragon's liver,

1441
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:47,379
had no business being a witch.

1442
01:54:56,055 --> 01:54:57,931
You're certain
you're doing the right thing?

1443
01:54:58,016 --> 01:54:59,099
Well, I think so.

1444
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:01,810
The way things are, it's much
too dangerous being a civilian.

1445
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:03,645
Take care of yourself, guv.

1446
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:04,813
I'll do that.

1447
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:07,316
And I'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

1448
01:55:07,358 --> 01:55:09,038
We'll be together again.

1449
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:11,069
Sounds like you have an escort
to the station.

1450
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:15,949
Parade, halt!

1451
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:19,328
Well, here we go.

1452
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:40,432
Permission to move off, sir!

1453
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,100
Carry on, Sergeant.

1454
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:47,189
Parade, by the right, quick!

1455
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:52,486
March! Left, left. Left, right, left.

1456
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:01,662
Suppose that's it.

1457
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:04,456
We ain't going to have no fun no more.

1458
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:06,959
Well, still got this, ain't I?

1459
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:19,137
Call out the navy
Call out the ranks

1460
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:22,891
Call out the air force
Call out the tanks

1461
01:56:23,434 --> 01:56:25,602
From the Cliffs of Dover

1462
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,688
call up the Gauls

1463
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:31,566
And don't forget the
loyal territorials

1464
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:34,236
Who's digging in here?

1465
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,405
Who will defend

1466
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:40,742
every inch of England
no matter what they send?

1467
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:44,997
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

1468
01:56:45,081 --> 01:56:47,749
The soldiers of
the old home guard

1469
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:49,334
That's who

1470
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:55,966
The soldiers of
the old home guard
