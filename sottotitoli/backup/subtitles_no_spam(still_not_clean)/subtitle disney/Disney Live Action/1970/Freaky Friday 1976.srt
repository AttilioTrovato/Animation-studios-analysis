1
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,477
I'd like to be you
for a day

2
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:20,040
I'd like to be you
for a day

3
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,487
I'd like to be you
for a day

4
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:30,722
I'd like to be you
for a day

5
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:51,849
I'd like to be you
for a day

6
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:55,785
I'd like to climb
into the dreams you hide

7
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:59,346
To know the grown-up
and the child inside

8
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:03,952
Whatever makes you smile

9
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,462
I'd like to see it

10
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,330
Go ahead and free it

11
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,641
I'd like to be you
for a day

12
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:28,311
I'd like to be you
for a day

13
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:31,982
Are you excited
by electric trains?

14
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:35,322
And kind of lonely
every time it rains?

15
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:39,990
To stare out
through your eyes

16
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:45,901
Would start revealing
all the things you're feeling

17
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,181
What's on your mind
when you hear a tune

18
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:05,781
Or ride a toy balloon?

19
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,951
Just let me look,
let me read your book

20
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,860
And learn it

21
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,368
Loving every page
as I turn it

22
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,819
I'd like to be you
for a day

23
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,151
I'd like to be you
for a day

24
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:41,989
There's so much more
I need to understand

25
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,496
It's not enough
to simply hold your hand

26
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:50,001
And hear
the words you say

27
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,660
I want to touch you

28
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,830
I want to reach you

29
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:59,343
In every single way

30
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,675
I'd like to be you
for a day

31
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,113
To put you back
on the track

32
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:07,447
When you go astray

33
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,612
I'd like to be you
for a day

34
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,246
To know your aims

35
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:15,453
And to share the games
that you play

36
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:19,623
I'd like to be you
for a day

37
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:28,573
I'd like to be you
for a day

38
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:29,801
I'd like to be you
for a day

39
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,507
You're not gonna believe me.

40
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,204
Nobody in their right minds
could believe me.

41
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,974
But it's true.
Really, it is.

42
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,380
15 this morning...
No, wait.

43
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,146
Let me start back further.

44
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,813
My name is Annabel Andrews.

45
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,584
This is my room.

46
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,183
I like it this way.

47
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,660
You don't have to look
for anything.

48
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,027
Good morning.

49
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,588
It's Friday the 13th.
Ready?

50
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,327
No way.

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,162
And this is me.

52
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,638
Born in Mountview Hospital
13 years ago.

53
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,935
Give or take a month.

54
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,273
Female, blond.
Natural, of course.

55
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,108
Blue eyes.
Height about 5'2".

56
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:11,274
I don't remember what I weigh,
but I'm watching it.

57
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,112
Which my mother says
is ridiculous

58
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:17,053
because I'm not mature
in my figure yet.

59
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,316
Mmm...

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,381
Maybe by summer, though.

61
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:26,521
Gross.

62
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,697
I have one little brother.
Look at him.

63
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,963
Gorgeous hair,
gorgeous teeth,

64
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,006
gorgeous eyes,
gorgeous eyelashes.

65
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,802
He's what you call neat.

66
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,639
Not neat terrific.
Neat neat.

67
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,305
He is so neat it's revolting.

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,280
He only does it to show me up.

69
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,976
A goody-goody, you know?

70
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,110
A perfect person and a creep.

71
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:49,983
His name is Ben,
but I call him...

72
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,649
Ape Face!
Will you get out of here?

73
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:55,158
Don't come busting in
without knocking.

74
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:56,819
It's time for breakfast.

75
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,796
So? Come on, beat it.
Get out of here.

76
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:00,854
I am.

77
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,593
You'll be late for school.

78
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,100
So what do I care?

79
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,138
Actually, I care.
I mean, school is okay.

80
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,604
I got friends, sports.

81
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,109
Yesterday I was made captain
for today's playoff game.

82
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,838
Kind of neat, huh?

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,141
I'm also pretty good on water.

84
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,621
We got a super water-ski club.

85
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,352
And we're gonna put on
a real aquacade for my dad.

86
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,621
Oh, yeah, about my parents.

87
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,528
William Waring Andrews.
45.

88
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:36,829
6 feet tall.
Well, 5' 11. 5".

89
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,132
The hair's too short,
but I've seen worse.

90
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,638
All in all,
a fantastically cool person.

91
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,731
My, oh, my
what a wonderful...

92
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,606
He's with Joffert and Jennings.
Public relations.

93
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:50,239
And the most beautiful person
in the world.

94
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,873
Almost.

95
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,983
That's Boris Harris.
What a fox!

96
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,183
I mean, he's really
something else.

97
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,987
Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,392
Unfortunately,
ever since a little incident

99
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,431
that happened a while ago,
Boris leaves me alone.

100
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,523
Annabel!

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,760
Time!

102
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,735
Which is more than I can say
for her.

103
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:15,534
Mom and I haven't been
hitting it off well.

104
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,666
It's not that
I don't love her. I do.

105
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,232
Why shouldn't I?

106
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,802
Everybody knows mothers
are sweet and kind

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,110
and lovely and gentle and...

108
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,615
Annabel!

109
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:26,616
And loud.

110
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:27,617
Ahh!

111
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,883
Max, you big hamburger.

112
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,550
Annabel, where are you going?

113
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,218
I thought we had this
all out last night.

114
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:38,284
Who? Me?

115
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,126
I'm not very hungry.

116
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:43,793
I don't go for that
eggs and bacon stuff.

117
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,460
I want you to be healthy.

118
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:46,970
That's all, Annabel.

119
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,302
I'm gonna grow up
and be a blimp.

120
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,773
I'm already late.

121
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:52,309
What about your room?

122
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,810
Perfect.

123
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:56,972
And your bed?
That's made, right?

124
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:00,814
I forgot, Mom.
It just slipped through my mind.

125
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,080
I got a lot of things
to think about.

126
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,587
Mmm.

127
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,920
Annabel,
I don't want to be preachy.

128
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:10,894
But childhood is the best time
in a person's life.

129
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,429
Sure. I'm all for it.

130
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:15,125
But I got a lot of worries.

131
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,861
Name one.
Just one.

132
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:18,598
All right.

133
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,195
Worry number one.

134
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,762
I'm late to meet Virginia.

135
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:23,773
Wish me luck.

136
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:25,438
Bye-bye.

137
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,604
Bye. Good luck.

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,444
Good luck to me, too.

139
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,108
Annabel.
Wait a minute.

140
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:34,173
Annabel!

141
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,782
Don't forget the orthodontist!

142
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,552
Don't forget the aquacade!

143
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,616
How much you
want to bet she does?

144
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:45,959
- Forget the aquacade?
- Forgets the orthodontist.

145
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,498
It'll serve her right.

146
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:50,625
Today Dr. Basinger's
gonna take her braces off.

147
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,967
It was gonna be a surprise.
You think I should've told her?

148
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,768
About the aquacade?

149
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,133
Oh, Bill, honestly.

150
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,836
What do you think of this?

151
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:00,911
What?

152
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:06,212
"Friends, respected clients,
and future developers,

153
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:09,048
we are, indeed, honored
that you could be present

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,519
for this formal announcement

155
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:14,922
of our luxurious,
new Oceana Marina."

156
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,791
It's good.
I don't think the name is good.

157
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,592
It should be
the Isle of Whispering Winds.

158
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,565
- It's interesting.
- Helen, please.

159
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,761
No more help.

160
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,930
You just show up
looking beautiful, as usual.

161
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,406
I'll take care of the rest.

162
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,670
Certainly.

163
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:37,242
Turkey, where you been?

164
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,010
Where have I been?

165
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,109
I've been waiting for hours.

166
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,279
You and me both, kid.

167
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,948
Give me the usual
and shake the lead out.

168
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,983
Well, I got quiz number 2A
about my room.

169
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,028
It's my room.

170
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,894
I should be able to keep it
the way I want to.

171
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:57,628
All due to
the extraordinary efforts

172
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,260
of this brilliant...

173
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,635
- ingenious...
- Revolting.

174
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,266
I'm afraid that's
not complimentary enough

175
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,833
to the developer, my dear.

176
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:10,312
Nothing very complimentary
could be said about Annabel.

177
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:14,112
No wonder they
call it "the terrible teens."

178
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:16,915
Have you seen
how she dresses lately?

179
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,719
Without her, I don't have
a water show this afternoon.

180
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:24,421
Would you like to know where
I have to go this afternoon?

181
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,590
To see Mr. Dilk,
the principal at school.

182
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,223
He's asked for a conference

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,963
to discuss Annabel's
lack of academic progress.

184
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,629
What do you think of that?

185
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,936
I'm sure
you can handle it, dear.

186
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,943
I'm up to my neck in this.

187
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,309
Thank you.

188
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,144
She's not gonna let me go
to Hilary's.

189
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:48,310
She says she knows all we do
there is kissing games.

190
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,947
She's also on my back
to get my hair trimmed.

191
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,890
Last time it was trimmed,
they hacked 6 inches off.

192
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,759
I try to be cool, right?
Parents seem to be immune to it.

193
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,354
Sometimes I blow my top.

194
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,898
Yesterday I said to her,

195
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,628
"What are you trying to do?
Change my image?"

196
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:07,102
She said, "I wouldn't know
where to start."

197
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,935
Chuckle, chuckle.
That's funny.

198
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,305
If it's any comfort to you,

199
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:14,038
my mom's even rottener
than yours.

200
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,307
Mothers don't understand
what a person goes through.

201
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,939
I'm an individual.

202
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,779
I can't eat what I want,
wear what I want,

203
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,648
keep my hair and nails
the way I want!

204
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,186
Last night we had it out.

205
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,653
"Listen!" I screamed.

206
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,418
I'm not a screamer.

207
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,154
"You're not letting me
have any fun.

208
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,992
You're always pushing me,
telling me what to do.

209
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:36,659
How come nobody ever gets
to tell you what to do?"

210
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,258
"Annabel," I said.

211
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,328
"When you're grown-up, people
don't tell you what to do.

212
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,169
You have to tell yourself."

213
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,402
Which is sometimes
more difficult.

214
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,774
"Oh, yeah," I said
in this bitter tone.

215
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,370
That always blows her mind.

216
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,039
"Yeah, you can tell yourself

217
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:54,243
to watch TV all day,
go to lunch with friends,

218
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,616
eat what you want

219
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,554
or go to big parties
or movies with Dad."

220
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:01,183
"And do the laundry,"
I reminded her.

221
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,784
"And the shopping
and the cooking.

222
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:07,298
Make things nice for everybody."

223
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:12,132
Honestly, Bill, that child has
not got a clue about my life.

224
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:15,070
Not a single clue.

225
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,630
Sounds like a picnic to me.

226
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:23,345
I wish I could
switch places with her

227
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:26,212
for just one day.

228
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,861
All right, what's going on
out there?

229
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,666
Something really freaky.

230
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,639
Wait a minute.

231
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:53,005
That's not my voice.

232
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,738
That's Mom's voice.

233
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,607
Hey, what's the matter with you?

234
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,710
Good grief.
What am I doing here?

235
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:05,654
That's not my voice.
That's Annabel's voice.

236
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,315
Are you okay, Annabel?

237
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:09,994
Annabel?

238
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,325
You all right, Ellen?

239
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:15,294
Ellen?

240
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,932
Hey, whose foot is that?

241
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,106
That's not my foot.
That's Mom's foot.

242
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,975
Good grief.
That's not my hand.

243
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,743
That's Annabel's.

244
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,307
Mom's legs.

245
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:38,481
And her stomach.

246
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,649
And her, uh...

247
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,386
uh...

248
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,589
Wow.

249
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,430
Mom's body has got
my mind in it.

250
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:03,303
Annabel's body
has got my mind in it.

251
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,108
I'm Mom.

252
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:08,414
I'm Annabel.

253
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,448
Hi, Mom.

254
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,353
I love your teeth.

255
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,361
Annabel, say something.

256
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,634
Who can talk
through all this scrap iron?

257
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,129
Could I trouble you
for a dime, dear?

258
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:30,038
"Could I trouble you
for a dime, dear?"

259
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,598
Sure.

260
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:40,976
Wow!

261
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,252
Ellen?

262
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,310
You all right?

263
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,981
All right?

264
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:47,888
I'm great!

265
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,260
Hello?

266
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,562
Hello, Bill?

267
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:58,829
Yes.

268
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,268
Who's this?

269
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:03,000
This is...

270
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,773
Annabel, is that you?

271
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,242
Well, yes and no.

272
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,779
Please, if this
is some kind of a joke,

273
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,246
I don't have any time.

274
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,010
Button up and listen, Bill.

275
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,608
Who are you telling
to button up?

276
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,619
Since when do you
call me "Bill"?

277
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,279
What's got into you?

278
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,119
A lot more than you can imagine.

279
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,180
Please, Bill.

280
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,624
Annabel, stop that!

281
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,456
I am not "Bill" to you!

282
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,121
All right.

283
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,289
Dad.

284
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,128
All right.
Now, that's better.

285
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,224
What do you want?

286
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,132
- How's Ellen?
- Ellen?

287
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:33,966
Mom, I mean.
Is she all right?

288
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,403
Feeling all right?

289
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:38,636
Annabel, please, if this
is some kind of game...

290
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,872
No, it's very important.
Would you take a look?

291
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,671
Hang on.

292
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah, she is acting
a little funny.

293
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,777
She's blowing bubbles
and hopping up and down.

294
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:23,980
Hopping?

295
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:27,923
I suppose it would look like
hopping to the waltz king.

296
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,516
Who's that on the horn?

297
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,788
Oh, that's Annabel.

298
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:34,389
She wants to know
if you're feeling all right.

299
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:35,523
Are you, honey?

300
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,295
Oh, I feel terrific.

301
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,802
How does she feel?

302
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:43,204
She's worried about you.
Maybe she ought to come home.

303
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,469
No, tell her absolutely not.

304
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,137
Childhood is the best time
in a person's life.

305
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,476
Today I want her
to enjoy every minute.

306
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,675
Especially the big typing test.

307
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,682
Oh, yeah.

308
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,311
Tell her I hope she does
well in the hockey game.

309
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:59,151
That is an important playoff.

310
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:02,215
If she messes up,
everybody will hate me.

311
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,555
Her.

312
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,197
Dear, your mother says...

313
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,326
I heard her, Daddy.
Goodbye.

314
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:12,960
- Hi, Virginia.
- Hi.

315
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,870
Come on, Annabel,
let's move out.

316
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,874
You guys are my friends, right?

317
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,706
- I've got to talk to you.
- So talk.

318
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,611
Now, girls, you're not
children any longer.

319
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,842
I feel I can speak
with you as adults.

320
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,078
You're intelligent enough
to grasp

321
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:30,780
exactly what I have to
say to you right now.

322
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:34,184
What is this?

323
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:37,921
It's your usual "Rum Raisin
Banana Split" breakfast.

324
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,195
Figures.

325
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:44,632
What else would the junk-food
junkie eat for breakfast?

326
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:47,364
That is about the most
revolting concoction

327
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:49,497
I've ever put inside my mouth.

328
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,974
You see something different?

329
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,707
Something different?

330
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,275
You see I am
diametrically different

331
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,976
from the Annabel you know.

332
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,919
Correct?

333
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,455
All right.

334
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,081
Listen very carefully.

335
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,853
I'm not Annabel.

336
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,087
Who are you?

337
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,187
I'm her mother.

338
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:18,101
Oh, that's sensational!
Today we'll be our mothers.

339
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,729
Virginia, dear,
do something with your hair.

340
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,433
Don't scuff your shoes.

341
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,941
No, I mean it.
I'm Mrs. Andrews.

342
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,272
Oh, me too, darling.

343
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,506
I'm not Jo-Jo.
I'm Mrs. John Mayberry.

344
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,945
I love it.

345
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:33,381
Give me a pack
of menthols, please.

346
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,543
Are you kidding?

347
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,382
Don't be fresh with me,
young man.

348
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,081
I'll report you to the manager.

349
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,623
Oh, no!

350
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,454
You're terrific, Annabel.

351
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,551
You ought to be in Drama class.

352
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:47,757
Hurry along, children.
You'll miss the bus.

353
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:50,596
There's only one thing wrong
with this routine.

354
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:54,126
Our mothers couldn't get through
the day like we put in.

355
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,604
What did you say?

356
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,540
- Right on, Annabel.
- Our mothers couldn't hack it.

357
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:01,134
Your mother wouldn't make it
through first period, Bambi.

358
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,873
For sure.

359
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:07,075
I can just picture my mom
trying to handle Miss McGuirk.

360
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,984
Or Ms. Murphy in typing.
They'd freak out.

361
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:12,750
My mother would not freak out.
Believe me.

362
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,758
You're really weird.
Just a few minutes ago...

363
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,384
Young lady,
a great deal has transpired

364
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,485
in the last few minutes.

365
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,689
You really have that down.

366
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,232
I like this game.

367
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,463
- Children, don't tarry.
- Yes, we mustn't miss our bus.

368
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:26,764
Are they kidding?

369
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:29,772
What's so tough
about a simple school day?

370
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,001
You coming, Annabel?

371
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,944
You bet she is.

372
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,138
I am.

373
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,441
Okay, what'll it be, lover boy?

374
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,108
You said scrambled eggs.

375
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:44,280
Sorry. I don't have time
to wash a messy scrambled pan.

376
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,549
Fried?

377
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,682
Cooking's not my thing today.

378
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,123
You can eat this.

379
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,785
Oh, I can't.

380
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:53,625
That's Annabel's sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles,

381
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,529
which she bought with her money

382
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,294
to eat when she watches
television.

383
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,960
She'll kill me if I eat them.

384
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:00,469
What a nerd.

385
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,233
Annabel wants you to eat

386
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,898
her sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles.

387
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,566
- She does?
- She does.

388
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:06,575
I ought to know.

389
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,238
Move it.
You'll be late for school.

390
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:11,747
Bye, Mommy.

391
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,647
Yuck!

392
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:18,020
Hon, I want you to do
something for me

393
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,420
for the ceremony.

394
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,752
Besides water-ski?

395
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,884
- What?
- What?

396
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,292
You've never been on water skis.

397
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,694
I was only kidding, Daddy.

398
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,164
"Daddy"? You never called me
"Daddy" before.

399
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,100
No. I never will again,
Bill, dear.

400
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:33,329
Are you feeling all right?

401
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,735
- Never better.
- Good.

402
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,534
Hmm.

403
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:40,043
Better bring me a change
of wardrobe for tonight.

404
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,039
White slacks.

405
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,274
A maroon tie.

406
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,680
See if you can find
my matching socks.

407
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,633
Are you sure
you're all right?

408
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,468
Fine. Fine.

409
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,134
Where was I?

410
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,268
I was finding
your matching socks.

411
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:15,642
Oh, yeah.

412
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,374
- My white shoes.
- White shoes.

413
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,177
- Blue blazer.
- Blue blazer.

414
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,445
It might need a trip
to the cleaners.

415
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,010
That shirt with
the ruffles down the front?

416
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,851
Be careful when you press it.

417
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:28,084
It's pure silk, you know.

418
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,319
Anything else?

419
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,758
Now that you ask.

420
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,820
If the shoes need a polish,
I'd appreciate it.

421
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,229
Of course.

422
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,323
Thatagirl.

423
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,470
I do my job,
you do yours, right?

424
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:42,335
Oink, oink, Daddy.

425
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:45,273
Well, maybe Mom will enjoy
being in my shoes.

426
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:48,334
No wonder Annabel
runs around barefooted.

427
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:51,745
These sneakers feel
like they're full of marbles.

428
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,686
You're right about your hair.
My mom had mine all hacked off.

429
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:57,880
And now look at me.

430
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,217
To tell you the truth,

431
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:01,154
it's much more becoming
to you short.

432
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,454
Whose side are you on?

433
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,289
How can you expect me
to sympathize

434
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,352
about your horrible,
mean mother?

435
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,795
That's uncalled for.

436
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,231
I'm using your words exactly.

437
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,768
Is that so?

438
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:14,134
Come on, girls.
Pay now, talk later.

439
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,537
You're holding up everything.

440
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,866
I don't have one
of those cards.

441
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:21,977
It's okay.

442
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,514
Money's perfectly acceptable.

443
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,311
Virginia, could you possibly?

444
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:28,783
No, I couldn't possibly.

445
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,821
I know you have
more change on you.

446
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,480
I could tell by your walk.

447
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,818
My walk?

448
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,951
Oh, of course, my walk.

449
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,333
Oh, my God. Jeez.

450
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,994
Excuse me.

451
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:49,232
Sir? Thank you.

452
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,675
- There you go.
- Thanks.

453
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:11,117
I don't believe
how dirty this foot is.

454
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,288
I doubt it's ever seen
a bathtub.

455
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:14,729
Hmm.

456
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,288
But why should it?

457
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,494
The sock isn't much cleaner.

458
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:24,702
Ooh.

459
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,936
Dumb, dribbly gook.

460
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,310
Yuck!

461
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,315
Who needs hand lotion, anyway?

462
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,647
Let them get old and wrinkled.

463
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,551
Now. What next?

464
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,284
How about a little makeup
for the cheeks?

465
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,827
Yeah, why not?

466
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:47,955
Hmm.
Sadie the painted lady.

467
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,010
You're lovely, my dear.
Simply lovely.

468
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:04,103
Wait till they see you
this afternoon at the marina,

469
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:06,048
sipping champagne.

470
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,550
Ooh, I love champagne.

471
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,611
Wait a minute.
I've never had champagne.

472
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,384
Maybe I won't like it.

473
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:15,687
Oh, well.
I'll try everything.

474
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:20,789
I wish I hadn't tried this.

475
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:22,456
Come on! Stick!

476
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,694
Stick, you hairy,
little monster!

477
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:28,303
Maybe I can cover them up.

478
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,636
Ah, forget it.

479
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,699
Just a touch of color.

480
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,811
Beautiful.

481
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:41,316
Oops.

482
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,312
Perfect. Just gorgeous.

483
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:48,154
It's not real.
No, it can't be.

484
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:50,189
Ridiculous.

485
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:56,665
Impossible!

486
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,361
What is?

487
00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,868
Nothing.
I was just thinking.

488
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,962
Well, I wish you'd stop it.
Everybody's staring.

489
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,202
You look crazy,
talking to yourself

490
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,970
and waving your hands around.

491
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:08,102
Sorry.

492
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,112
I wonder what she's doing?

493
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,944
She probably thinks I
spend my day snacking,

494
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:14,279
watching TV.

495
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:16,376
She'll find out.

496
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:18,819
Ha! Will she find out!

497
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:20,288
What's with her?

498
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,450
Something wrong with her noggin?

499
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:23,652
How would I know?

500
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,252
I've never seen her before
in my life.

501
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,833
Oh, ain't that so cute?

502
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:08,699
What's the big deal
about housework?

503
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:10,535
How tough can it be?

504
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:15,170
Toss in a little stuff here.
Toss in a little stuff there.

505
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:27,651
If it doesn't want to go,
you make it go.

506
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:34,793
That wasn't so bad.

507
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,425
Now for some potato chips.

508
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,469
A little of the boob tube.

509
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:41,393
Come on, Max.

510
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,134
Whoa.

511
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,180
The makers of Phos Free,

512
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:54,615
the newer, brighter detergent,
bring you "Sewing with Susie."

513
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,710
So long, Sister Susie.

514
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,118
Adios, muchacho.

515
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,492
Wiggling, friends.

516
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,190
Can you wiggle like Wiggly?

517
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:10,426
Let's go.
Come on, wiggle.

518
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,934
Don't let go, Wiggly.

519
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,663
Wiggle this way.

520
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:16,262
Wiggle!

521
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,103
Wiggle!

522
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,511
It's alive!

523
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,347
Whoa, there!

524
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:34,913
Take it easy!

525
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:35,720
You're gonna be fine.

526
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,284
Just a little case
of the hiccups.

527
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,173
Hello?

528
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,209
Wait!
There's too much racket!

529
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,211
I'll have to take it
in the hall!

530
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,143
Thank you!

531
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,747
Hello?

532
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:06,312
Hang on. I got to hang up
in the other room.

533
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,454
Holy cow!

534
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,067
Couldn't you pick
some other day to break down?

535
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,502
What was the matter
when Mom was around?

536
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:24,006
You had to shake yourself
to death on my big day?

537
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:25,439
Come on, now, shape up.

538
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,945
Ulysses' Repair and Plumbing.

539
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,314
Four.

540
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:36,943
Hey, there! Hello?

541
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,784
Hey, Ellen! Ellen?
What's happening?

542
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,620
Hello? Operator?

543
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:44,286
Sir, this
is a cross-wire connection.

544
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,556
Simply hang up.
Redial your number.

545
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,564
You will be able
to reach your party.

546
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:49,929
This is a recording.

547
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,399
Is this my home?

548
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:54,631
Well, slow down, Mack.
Who is this, anyway?

549
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:55,967
Bill. It's Bill.

550
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,802
Bill? Bill who?

551
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,308
Oh. Oh!

552
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:00,842
Hello?
What's going on?

553
00:28:00,878 --> 00:28:03,005
My husband.
Hi, there, Billy Boy.

554
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,911
How's it going
in the salt mines?

555
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,007
Never mind.
What's happening there?

556
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:09,712
Just rinsing out
a few things. Why?

557
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:10,718
Oh, okay.

558
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,812
Joffert, Jennings,
and the entire board

559
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,585
may be dropping by for drinks.

560
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:16,421
You better drive down
and pick up booze.

561
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,654
Booze?

562
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:19,923
Drive?

563
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:22,465
Honey, what's the matter?

564
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,432
Nothing.
It's just I didn't intend

565
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,901
to drive anywhere today, Daddy.
Bill.

566
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:31,300
At noon, after you pick up
Ben from school.

567
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,570
Ben?

568
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:34,975
Oh, Ape Face.

569
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,273
You know that slinky
black dress?

570
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:38,644
Why don't you wear that?

571
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:41,582
I got to run.
Anything else, I'll call you.

572
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,381
Booze?

573
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:46,555
My husband, Bill.

574
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:48,955
Iron this, polish that.

575
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,425
Go here, go there.

576
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:52,257
As a dad, you're super.

577
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,763
As a husband, you're more
like a traffic cop.

578
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,299
Annabella couldn't find
a steady fella

579
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,356
For pity's sake.

580
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,300
I got a rise
out of metal mouth.

581
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:01,632
You did not.

582
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,572
I can lead some people
around by the nose.

583
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,768
Her you can lead by the teeth.
All you need is a magnet.

584
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:08,504
One thing you need, young man,

585
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,102
is a good,
old-fashioned spanking.

586
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,080
- Give me mercy.
- Come on, Annabel.

587
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:15,448
Forget that silly game.
It's not like you.

588
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,453
Hi, I brought
your favorite today.

589
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:20,490
- Tuna fish and peanut butter.
- Tuna fish and peanut butter?

590
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:23,253
And grape yogurt.
Meet you at lunchtime, okay?

591
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,658
Sure. Okay.

592
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,788
How sickening. No wonder
she never eats at home.

593
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,559
You can't eat with Gordy.

594
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,931
Remember we have
band practice at noon?

595
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,095
What a shame.

596
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:43,279
Now let's see
how tough this really is.

597
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,440
Wait a minute.
Where am I going?

598
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:48,609
Oh, schedule, schedule,
schedule.

599
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:49,447
Let's see.

600
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,080
I'll be lucky if I can read
her writing, that's for sure.

601
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:56,519
"Friday, first period.

602
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,857
The Principles
of Still Photography."

603
00:29:58,929 --> 00:29:59,918
Oh, sure.

604
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,864
The cornerstone
of a good basic education.

605
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,135
Well, at this stage,

606
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:09,138
the developing action
has almost been halted,

607
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:13,142
but the film
is still highly sensitive.

608
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,306
The safe red light continues
to serve its purpose.

609
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:20,350
And extreme caution
should be taken

610
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,977
to avoid any outside light

611
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:27,422
for fear of ruining
the exposed film.

612
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,516
Now, the next step is to...

613
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:30,992
Is this Still Photography?

614
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,722
Sorry I'm late.

615
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:41,431
What about the windows?
You want me to get the shades?

616
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,831
I think we've goofed.

617
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,174
Sorry about that.

618
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:59,086
That's 555-3069.

619
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,851
And only 2 more calls
this hour

620
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:04,291
to solve the K6500
musical mystery medley

621
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:07,296
and win over $5,000
in prizes and trips.

622
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:10,629
All right here on your music,
music, music station.

623
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,190
K6500.

624
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,230
Morning.

625
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,736
I said, "Good morning"!

626
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:27,711
Mrs. Schmauss, you scared me!
I didn't hear you!

627
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:28,751
No wonder!

628
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:31,481
What with this rock 'n' roller
stuff blaring.

629
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,988
It gives you a headache!

630
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:35,319
That's better.

631
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:38,418
Now I don't have to yell!

632
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:41,487
Ah, what a shame.

633
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:44,329
You ruined that precious outfit.

634
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:45,891
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

635
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:48,437
Well, where do I start, honey?

636
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,974
In the kitchen.
We had a problem this morning.

637
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,908
What happened?

638
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:56,946
The washing machine
went bananas.

639
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:59,675
Let's take a look
and see what's going on!

640
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:01,717
Oh, no, no!

641
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,116
No wonder!

642
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,450
You're gonna cram your shirts.

643
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:07,615
And your rugs.

644
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,956
Ohhhh!
And your hose.

645
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,120
And your sneakers.

646
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:15,756
And some little tin things.

647
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:17,129
And...

648
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,794
What are these
little tin things?

649
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,304
Oh, jacks.
That's cute.

650
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,964
That's cute.

651
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,338
And all your jacks
in here together.

652
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:29,867
Not to mention,
you used too much soap.

653
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,947
That is your problem.

654
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:34,574
Well, that's what comes

655
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:37,142
of letting Annabel help
with the laundry.

656
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,484
That sweet thing,
trying to be helpful.

657
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:42,691
A genuine first.

658
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,559
Mrs. Schmauss,
get ahold of yourself.

659
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,461
I want you to
finish this laundry

660
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:51,057
and then sew up this
dress for tonight.

661
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:52,658
Hold it, honey!
Hold it!

662
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,328
When I came to work for you,

663
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:57,567
there were a couple of things
we agreed upon I don't do.

664
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,974
Number one is, I don't do
no personal maiding.

665
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:03,307
I see.
What is the number two thing?

666
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:05,439
Do we have to
go into that again?

667
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:08,075
Just give me a refresher on it.

668
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,517
What is the number two thing
you won't do?

669
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,454
The number two thing
I don't do is,

670
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:16,219
I don't pick up pigpens.

671
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:20,286
That's an honor I reserve
for the mother of the pig.

672
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,127
Well, look at this.
Dirty clothes.

673
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
Ahh.

674
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,260
Banana peel.

675
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,208
Half a paperback.

676
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:35,911
And now we get to see

677
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:39,210
what's behind
curtain number three.

678
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,917
A bicycle pump.

679
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:46,381
A broken water ski.

680
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:49,718
A tin shovel.

681
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,486
All right.

682
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,122
Begin.

683
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,345
This is a snap.

684
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,460
Hey, Bambi.
Psst! Bambi.

685
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:28,588
There's something wrong
with my machine.

686
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,130
Well, turn it on.

687
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,567
What do you mean?

688
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,798
It's a typewriter,
not a television.

689
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:39,603
An electric typewriter
needs electricity.

690
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:40,802
Dummy.

691
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,811
Electric?

692
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,337
Oh, well,
how different can it be?

693
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,302
This is ridiculous!

694
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,077
Annabel, what's the trouble?

695
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,050
Small mechanical problem here.

696
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:24,109
Go use one of
the other machines.

697
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,781
I'll give you
a few extra minutes.

698
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,225
Mrs. Schmauss, would you...

699
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:12,166
That's another thing
I don't do. Answer doorbells!

700
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:15,270
All right, already!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

701
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,431
Right over there, baby.

702
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,838
Your car, Mrs. Andrews.

703
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,105
Washed, lubed,
and I changed the oil.

704
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:25,374
Oh, thanks...

705
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:26,380
Lloyd.

706
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,041
$14.50.
A check will be good.

707
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,050
Check?

708
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,053
How many years for forgery?

709
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,349
Will you take cash?

710
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,447
Yeah. Some people
still use that.

711
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:35,957
Okay, just a second.

712
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:39,426
I have to get my mother's...
my purse.

713
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:46,629
Hang in there, Lloyd.

714
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:49,137
I have to...

715
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,107
Let me go see who's
at the other door.

716
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,645
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.

717
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:00,010
Right on time.

718
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,609
Yes, right on time.
What are you on time for?

719
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,949
The carpets, remember?
It's Friday.

720
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:07,751
Sure. Sure.

721
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,655
Just slipped my mind.

722
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:11,557
Cool it, Max.

723
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,425
Care where we start?

724
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:15,361
Just pick a carpet.

725
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:17,400
Can I get my $14.50,
Mrs. Andrews?

726
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,094
Yeah, I forgot.

727
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:21,433
I'll get the $14.50.
Excuse me, fellas.

728
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,205
I'll find it, Lloyd.

729
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:28,767
Any of you fellas got $14.50
you could loan me?

730
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:31,439
Hey, you got $14.50?

731
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:32,776
Come on.

732
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,445
There you are.

733
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,281
And while we're on the subject.

734
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:40,447
I have something else
to tell you, Mrs. "A."

735
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:42,115
That kid has no discipline.

736
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:44,456
And a kid without discipline

737
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,961
is the fault of the mother
and the father.

738
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,624
Not necessarily, Mrs. Schmauss.

739
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,223
What am I saying?

740
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:01,744
Hi!

741
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:03,574
Oh, how do you do,
Mrs. Gilbert?

742
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:06,240
Oh, feel free to call me
Mary Kay anytime.

743
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,409
Oh, yeah. Mary Kay!

744
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:10,248
Listen,
I need the hair drier.

745
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,651
Sure. Borrow mine.

746
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,781
No, yours is broken.
You borrowed mine yesterday.

747
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:17,088
Yeah! Here.
Hold Max.

748
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,094
It must be
around here someplace.

749
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,653
- In the kitchen?
- I'm sure it is.

750
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:25,565
I've seen it time and again
with you saucy liberals.

751
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,001
That kid'll be on dope
before you know it!

752
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:30,562
Oh, what makes you so sure,
Mrs. Schmauss?!

753
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,198
Mrs. Andrews, can I...

754
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,300
Oh, yes, $14.50
and the hair drier.

755
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:35,776
You got a pair of pliers?

756
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,775
Ohhhh!

757
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,941
Listen, you, here.
You hold Max.

758
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:43,451
While you're looking
for the hair drier,

759
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,545
find this gentleman the pliers.

760
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:46,987
I have to find the door.

761
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:48,887
I wanted my hair drier.

762
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,026
- Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
- Hi.

763
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,827
Bet you thought
you'd never see us again.

764
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,130
Brought your nice,
clean draperies back.

765
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:01,965
Pick a window that's empty
and put them on it.

766
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:05,406
Just in case
you're interested, Mrs. Andrews.

767
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:09,775
You want to know how it starts?
I'll tell you how it starts.

768
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:12,406
Remember Wednesday
when you asked me

769
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:15,974
if I saw that half bottle
of gin on the bar?!

770
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,077
I suppose that was your way

771
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:20,918
of accusing me
of drinking your liquor.

772
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,423
Yes, probably was.

773
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:25,723
Aha. Well, I have
a secret for you.

774
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,293
Excuse me.

775
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:31,094
Mrs. Andrews,
we've run into a problem here.

776
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,692
Grab a number!
Get in line!

777
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:38,070
But do you know
who's drinking your gin?!

778
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,472
Annabel, huh?

779
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,271
You said it.
I didn't.

780
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:42,436
Hey, action city.

781
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,911
You're fired!

782
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,447
That suits me fine!

783
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:46,777
Not now, Mrs. Schmauss!

784
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,147
After you finish
my daddy's shirts.

785
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:50,150
Do them yourself!

786
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:52,915
You traitor!
Your mop stinks!

787
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,957
Could I just get my $14.50?

788
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:56,457
What about my hair drier?!

789
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:57,993
Here's your dog, lady!

790
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,154
Maybe we'll come back
some other time.

791
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:01,594
Ellen, my hair drier!

792
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,291
We got to move
the china cabinet.

793
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,560
You owe me $14.50.

794
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:07,398
My hair drier!

795
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,370
The hair drier!

796
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,428
Ellen!

797
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:25,348
That typing teacher
was highly indignant.

798
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,820
She just could not accept

799
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,449
that it was
an unfortunate accident.

800
00:40:29,525 --> 00:40:32,323
Sorry I missed it.
Sounds like it was a blast.

801
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:35,023
What a trying day.
I don't know what to expect.

802
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,293
Nothing, as long as
you're ready for McGuirk.

803
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,629
"Mc" who?

804
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,135
McGuirk.
English. Term paper.

805
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:42,933
Oh, no.

806
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,667
What's wrong, Annabel?

807
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,437
It's due today.
Don't you have one?

808
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,312
No. What'll I do?

809
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,138
You better cut English.

810
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:55,309
I'll tell McGuirk you went
to the nurse with a headache.

811
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,943
Should I actually do that?

812
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,386
No, you nerd.
She might send you home.

813
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,423
That's a good idea.

814
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:02,719
You can't go home.

815
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,625
The big hockey game's today.
Everyone's counting on you.

816
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:06,627
Hockey?!

817
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,596
Those kids will kill me.

818
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:11,361
I think I do feel
a sick headache coming on.

819
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,595
Hey, we're up.

820
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,165
Annabel!

821
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,902
Do you know where you are?!

822
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:57,707
No. But if you hum a few bars,
maybe I can pick it out.

823
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:10,251
The buffet is set up onshore.

824
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:13,124
But I thought that our clients
and the investors

825
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:15,630
would have more fun
with the show itself

826
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:17,893
by watching it from this float.

827
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:21,562
There's an overall picture
of the property.

828
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:23,798
A good view of the shoreline.

829
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:26,364
And there's an excellent
viewing position

830
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,969
for the fireworks display
and, of course, the aquacade.

831
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:31,707
I think we should've held out

832
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:34,682
for the professional
water-skiers.

833
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:37,584
I can assure you there's
gonna be a top-notch show.

834
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:40,281
My daughter and her club
have been rehearsing.

835
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:41,880
This is a big account.

836
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:45,086
You're sure these kids
aren't in over their heads?

837
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:47,322
Mr. Joffert, I can assure you

838
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:49,557
it's gonna be
very, very, very good.

839
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:53,329
And, well, if I
do say so myself,

840
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:56,166
my daughter Annabel
is the star of the show.

841
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,298
You really should see her.

842
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,308
I can hardly wait.

843
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,970
Excuse me.

844
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:05,638
Hello?

845
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,376
It's my wife.

846
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,077
Hi, honey.

847
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,746
Well, if you fired her,
you fired her.

848
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,789
I don't understand
why you're worried

849
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,653
about how upset
your mother's gonna be.

850
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:18,455
Your mother lives in Dayton.

851
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:21,156
I could've told you
she was a heavy drinker.

852
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,788
That's not her mother.

853
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:25,265
That's someone else.

854
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,199
Listen, honey, I'm busy now.

855
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:31,229
Mechanic, too?

856
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:32,501
The carpet cleaners?

857
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:35,671
And the drapery man?

858
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:38,938
Is the dog still there?

859
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:42,647
No, I know that's
not funny, Ellen.

860
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:46,154
Now, look, I'll take care
of everything later.

861
00:43:46,222 --> 00:43:47,280
Honey, I got to go!

862
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:48,846
No, look, no.

863
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:51,758
I'll see you
at the marina at 5:00.

864
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:54,558
Don't forget my clothes.
Yeah, goodbye.

865
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,963
What do you think, Max?

866
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,508
At least there's no ring
around the collar.

867
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:09,008
Okay.

868
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,443
Oh, great.

869
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,608
He's gonna kill me.

870
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,078
I quit!

871
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:20,383
I really quit.

872
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:22,356
I'm with Mrs. Schmauss.

873
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,620
I don't do personal
maiding either.

874
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:27,925
Everybody around here
has had breakfast but me.

875
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,797
Rotten Ape Face!
I'll clobber him!

876
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,973
All right,
macaroni and cheese.

877
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,872
Breakfast at last.

878
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,310
What a morning.

879
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:54,015
I'm bored.
Really bored.

880
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,149
Hmm. Bored.

881
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:58,125
I wonder if Boris is home.

882
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:03,395
Hey, Annabel.
Now's your chance.

883
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:05,934
I can make a pitch for me
when I'm not gorgeous.

884
00:45:06,002 --> 00:45:08,129
I mean, when I am gorgeous
and not me.

885
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:09,671
What'll I say?
Let's see.

886
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,263
What's happening, man?

887
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,932
Hi, lover boy.

888
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:14,772
Hello, Boris?

889
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:17,938
This is Mrs. Andrews
across the street.

890
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,448
I was wondering,
could I borrow a cup of...

891
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:22,711
Sugar's too corny.

892
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:27,115
...kibble?

893
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:29,783
Kibble. K-l-B-B-L-E.

894
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,555
You know, the stuff dogs eat?

895
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:35,654
Yeah, cat kibble.
That'll be fine, too.

896
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:38,461
When Max is hungry,
he'll eat anything.

897
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:41,128
He's not a kibble quibbler.
Not he.

898
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:43,137
So I wonder, could...

899
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:44,797
No.

900
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,104
Annabel's not home.

901
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:51,475
Terrific.

902
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:52,479
See you.

903
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:54,311
Oh, wow.
He's coming over.

904
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:56,317
I can't let him see me
like this.

905
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:58,649
I've got to
find something devastating.

906
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:02,087
Sexy, slinky.
Velvet maybe.

907
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:11,830
Door's open!

908
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,699
Come in, Boris!

909
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:22,074
I'll only be a moment, Boris.

910
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:26,478
Do make yourself
extremely comfortable.

911
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:30,909
Shut up, Max!

912
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:42,190
No, that'd be overdoing it.

913
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,305
Boris!

914
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:52,466
Oh, this is good of you.

915
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,702
Do come in.
Come in.

916
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:56,802
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.

917
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:58,141
Far out!

918
00:46:58,214 --> 00:47:00,648
"Catty Kibbles with horsemeat."

919
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,049
And a ten-cent coupon
for a little flea collar.

920
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,577
I can only stay a minute.
I got homework.

921
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:09,215
Oh, Boris.
I'll treasure it for life.

922
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,417
I got to go.

923
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:14,429
Yum-yum. Oh, Boris, that's
a dreadful cold you have.

924
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:17,762
Oh, no, no. Let me get you
some vitamin "C."

925
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,198
You don't have to.

926
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:20,758
I'll put this away.

927
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:22,098
You don't have to.

928
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,264
In the jewelry box.

929
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:29,003
You know, Boris,
this, I believe,

930
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:31,273
is the first time
you've had a chance,

931
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:33,611
to see our lovely, lovely home!

932
00:47:33,682 --> 00:47:35,445
It's simple but elegant!

933
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,816
Boris? Boris?
Where are you?

934
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:39,445
Who lives in here?

935
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,217
My son, Ben.

936
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,383
With a canopy bed
and a dollhouse?

937
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,256
With a canopy bed
and a dollhouse.

938
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:47,295
He's a peculiar boy.
He's liberated.

939
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,695
I'll say.
He's also a slob.

940
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:50,925
Excuse me, Boris.

941
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,628
Boris, here.
Vitamin "C."

942
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:55,226
Take two.
They're chewable.

943
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:56,293
Thank you.

944
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,703
Hmm. They're good.

945
00:47:57,773 --> 00:47:59,468
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.

946
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:02,043
I don't really have a cold.
It's adenoids.

947
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:04,171
Or an allergy to my mother.

948
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:06,077
Anyway, it comes and goes.

949
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:08,582
It keeps me home from school.

950
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:10,911
Well...

951
00:48:10,986 --> 00:48:14,080
Boris! You want to hang around
outside for a while?

952
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:17,557
Being cooped up in here
just gets me crazy.

953
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:19,093
Sure.

954
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:23,564
But aren't you dressed kinda
funny to be hanging around?

955
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:27,159
You're right.
I'm gonna put on some shoes.

956
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:33,434
You and your boy
have the same size feet?

957
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, I told you he's peculiar.

958
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:39,411
Okay.

959
00:48:39,482 --> 00:48:40,813
Let's go.

960
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:46,821
...Which indirectly led
United States intervention

961
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,288
into what, class?

962
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:49,654
Korean Conflict.

963
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:50,749
Yes.

964
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:53,488
And that took place when,
children?

965
00:48:53,562 --> 00:48:55,223
In June or July of 1950

966
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:57,891
with the naval air and ground
forces leading the way.

967
00:48:57,967 --> 00:48:59,525
Precisely.

968
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:02,399
Didn't anyone else do
their preparation for today?

969
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,565
Go on, Annabel.

970
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,074
Brownie points coming right up.

971
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:11,341
Well, in order to fully
comprehend the Korean Conflict,

972
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:13,779
it is necessary to review
all the events.

973
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:17,018
Is that very hard to throw?

974
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,915
Not if you know how.

975
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:21,547
Want me to show you?

976
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:22,818
Mm-hmm.

977
00:49:23,926 --> 00:49:25,450
Come here.

978
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:26,790
Okay.

979
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,256
Okay.

980
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,424
Excuse me.

981
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,526
Okay, you just swing
your arm back.

982
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,400
- Then bring it forward.
- Mm-hmm.

983
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,133
- Swing it back.
- Mm-hmm.

984
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,765
Then you bring it forward.

985
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:41,639
- Then you swing it back.
- Mmm...

986
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,405
Then you bring it...

987
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:46,372
Try it by yourself.

988
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:47,608
Okay.

989
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:54,054
Say, I bet you do
great for a lady.

990
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:57,820
If you think I'd be good,
you should show Annabel.

991
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:59,019
She'd be so good.

992
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:00,857
I'd rather show you.

993
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,229
Not Mom. Me, dum-dum.

994
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,431
Actually, Boris, lately,
Annabel is completely changed.

995
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:13,373
She's no longer the same person
who cut your head open

996
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:16,377
with a tin shovel in the
playground five years ago.

997
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:19,039
Four.
I've still got the scar.

998
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:20,604
Okay, four.

999
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,651
Anyway, if you'd seen
her lately,

1000
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:24,743
you wouldn't recognize her.

1001
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,617
Does she still have braces?

1002
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:29,556
'Cause if she still has braces,
I'd recognize her.

1003
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:33,823
I mean, now Annabel is so nice.

1004
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,363
She's nice-nice nice.

1005
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:37,922
- Well, I'm sure she is.
- Extremely nice.

1006
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,798
But, Miss Andrews,
to be perfectly frank,

1007
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,166
that's not saying much.

1008
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:44,365
Boris, you turkey.
I can't bear it.

1009
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,176
Split!

1010
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,339
It didn't turn around
and come back.

1011
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,111
Did it ever do that with you?!

1012
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:57,846
No, I just got it today.

1013
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,444
I never thrown it.

1014
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:04,049
The responsibility fell on
the Eisenhower administration.

1015
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:07,895
"Open me"?

1016
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:11,931
"Clam up and"... Hmm.

1017
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,593
Very cute.

1018
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:18,338
Go ahead, Annabel.
You're doing just fine.

1019
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:21,137
Responsibility fell on
the Eisenhower administration,

1020
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,304
which was the first Republican
administration in 20 years.

1021
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,840
The most salient characteristic
of the Eisenhower years was...

1022
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,509
What's going on back there?!

1023
00:51:30,586 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm sorry, Miss Benson.
I seem to have dropped a book.

1024
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:38,818
I gotta get some books
at the locker.

1025
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,521
I'll meet you after class.

1026
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,359
I have an even better idea.

1027
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:43,659
Come on.
I'll show you.

1028
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:46,633
You're too much!
I just can't believe it.

1029
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:47,794
What's wrong?

1030
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,963
One day you don't know
about history.

1031
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:52,439
Today you made us all
look like dummies.

1032
00:51:52,508 --> 00:51:54,135
I don't understand, Virginia.

1033
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,803
I was just doing
what I was supposed to do.

1034
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,541
What do you want me to do?
Pretend I didn't know?

1035
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:03,042
- See you later, Annabel.
- Let's get out of here.

1036
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,713
Bye-bye, Brains.

1037
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:07,983
How do you win?!

1038
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:09,615
One bunch thumps you
if you don't do well.

1039
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,718
The other bunch snubs
you if you do!

1040
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:14,990
Oh! What a zoo!

1041
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:17,395
Sorry about that accident.

1042
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:21,425
My fault. I just owe Mary Kay
a hair drier and a window.

1043
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:23,334
Yeah, well, anyway, thanks.

1044
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:25,202
Okay.

1045
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:26,298
It's really nice.

1046
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,206
Maybe we should do it again.

1047
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:30,643
I mean, we could play Monopoly,
something.

1048
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:33,079
- Well, I'd like that.
- Yeah?

1049
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:35,207
Most grown-ups
don't want to play games.

1050
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,616
They're always too busy
or something.

1051
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,849
But, then, you're not
the same as most grown-ups.

1052
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:42,652
Go on. I love it.

1053
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:44,317
You're...

1054
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:46,361
- Yeah?
- Well.

1055
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:48,988
Did you notice
my allergy is completely gone?

1056
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:49,826
Yeah.

1057
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,798
Maybe I'm allergic to my mother.

1058
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:54,893
But I'm certainly
not allergic to you.

1059
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,269
In fact, I kinda wish
I was 20 years older.

1060
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,138
And I wish I were
20 years younger,

1061
00:53:01,243 --> 00:53:04,542
or something like that,
I guess.

1062
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:11,815
Oh, well, see you, Boris.

1063
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,616
- And Mrs. Andrews?
- Hmm?

1064
00:53:13,689 --> 00:53:16,055
Well, you shouldn't
blame yourself.

1065
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:19,322
It's not your fault
that Annabel's the way she is.

1066
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:22,421
I mean, she's probably what
they call a bad seed.

1067
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:24,693
Oh!

1068
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,530
I wish I was dead!

1069
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,744
Team, listen up!

1070
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:46,516
Listen up!

1071
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:49,421
I don't have to tell you
what this game means.

1072
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:51,618
They're out to kill us!

1073
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:55,254
I want you guys to get out there
and hit 'em high! Hit 'em low!

1074
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,821
I don't believe this.
I've joined the Marines.

1075
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,424
Yeah!

1076
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:01,059
Can we beat these cream puffs?

1077
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:02,195
Yeah!

1078
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,499
Are we gonna beat 'em?

1079
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:04,630
Yeah!

1080
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:07,539
Let's get out there
and knock their blocks off!

1081
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,882
Where's your team spirit,
Annabel?

1082
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,814
Never seen you so down before.

1083
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:17,511
You haven't?

1084
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:19,816
I guess I'm just
a little nervous.

1085
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:21,048
Don't be silly.

1086
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:22,522
All you gotta do

1087
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:26,152
is make your usual zillion
goals, and we got it made.

1088
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:27,889
Oh, yeah? No problem.

1089
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:29,123
Andrews!

1090
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:30,130
Uh-oh.

1091
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,463
Andrews, why aren't
you changed yet?

1092
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:33,592
Get on the stick!

1093
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:35,603
Sure, but which one's
her locker?

1094
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,640
Andrews, move, move, move!

1095
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:39,833
My locker's stuck.

1096
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:42,069
You'll just have
to perform without me.

1097
00:54:42,144 --> 00:54:44,271
Perform without you?

1098
00:54:44,346 --> 00:54:46,007
What's with the big words?

1099
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,309
Here!

1100
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:52,753
Don't you ever take
anything home to be washed?

1101
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,118
Never!

1102
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:58,853
Now, suit up and get out there
on the double.

1103
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:08,698
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1104
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,829
Shut up, you guys,
and listen!

1105
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:13,568
Now, remember our game plan.

1106
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:15,166
Get the ball to Annabel!

1107
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:18,077
If anybody's gonna win it
for us, it's our tough,

1108
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:20,808
rock-'em, sock-'em,
superjock Annabel Andrews!

1109
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,646
Get your butts out there
and kill, kill, kill!

1110
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,223
Now, listen, girls.

1111
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,192
I taught you to play fair,

1112
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:35,196
to play clean,
and with good sportsmanship.

1113
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:38,461
Still, the name of
the game is winning.

1114
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:41,731
And we can only win this one
if you remember one thing.

1115
00:55:41,803 --> 00:55:44,601
Get Annabel Andrews
and get her good!

1116
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,675
Look, I'm gonna try
my best today,

1117
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:52,839
but if anything
should go wrong...

1118
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,109
Well, why should it?

1119
00:55:54,182 --> 00:55:56,946
Well, I told you.
I'm not the same person today.

1120
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:59,681
So I've noticed.
You have to snap out of it.

1121
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:02,120
This is a real important game.

1122
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:03,419
I'll try.

1123
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:06,359
But I mean it.
I'm not the same person.

1124
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,791
Forward in the "centa"!

1125
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:11,798
Center.

1126
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:12,799
Oh!

1127
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:14,358
Hey, that's you.

1128
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:16,495
Go get 'em, Annabel.

1129
00:56:23,278 --> 00:56:25,371
I played this once
in eighth grade.

1130
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,506
Ready to bully!

1131
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:32,648
Bully!

1132
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,552
Come on, let's go!

1133
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:42,392
Ow! Ow! Oh!

1134
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:45,433
Don't worry. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.

1135
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:48,601
Go get it!

1136
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:07,553
How come you didn't bring
the car?

1137
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:10,148
How come I didn't bring
the car?

1138
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:11,624
Quit griping, will you?

1139
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:13,684
I thought we could use
the exercise.

1140
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:15,889
We'll never make it home
for lunch.

1141
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:19,195
Sit here. It just happens
I brought lunch with me.

1142
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:21,929
It's a pickup lunch.
Pick up anything you want.

1143
00:57:22,004 --> 00:57:24,199
Throw the rest
back in the bag.

1144
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:27,207
- Gin?
- Aaah!

1145
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:29,835
That's the wrong bag, honey.

1146
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:32,505
No lamb chops, baked potato,
and string beans?

1147
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:34,981
Not unless you want to
cook it yourself.

1148
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,278
I fired Mrs. Schmauss.

1149
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:37,841
Yahoo!

1150
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:39,716
You didn't like her either.

1151
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:42,382
Like her?
Mom, I hate her!

1152
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:44,652
She talks cross
and smells funny.

1153
00:57:44,726 --> 00:57:46,216
But mostly I hate her

1154
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:49,457
because she says Annabel's
a spoiled brat and a pig.

1155
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:52,728
I heard that once today.
I don't have to hear it again.

1156
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,826
Besides, does it make sense?

1157
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:57,872
You hate Mrs. Schmauss because
Mrs. Schmauss hates Annabel.

1158
00:57:57,939 --> 00:57:59,839
But Annabel hates you.

1159
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,501
By rights, the person
you should hate is Annabel.

1160
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:04,307
I know.

1161
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:06,643
I try, but I just can't.

1162
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,647
Why not?

1163
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:08,842
Well, for one thing.

1164
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,351
Let's see.
She gets neat ideas.

1165
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,854
Like the time we filled up
balloons with water

1166
00:58:13,922 --> 00:58:15,480
and threw them out the window.

1167
00:58:15,557 --> 00:58:17,821
Oh, that was really neat.

1168
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:21,351
Want to tell Mommy some other
neat things Annabel thinks up?

1169
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,796
There's Billy and John!
Can I go play with them?

1170
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:25,958
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1171
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:30,004
He's not as finky as I thought.

1172
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,435
Don't just lie there, Annabel!

1173
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:39,742
Get up and hit 'em back!

1174
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,579
We're gonna lose if she
don't get off her duff.

1175
00:58:57,499 --> 00:58:58,727
Time-out. Time-out.

1176
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:00,961
I gotta tie my shoelaces, here.

1177
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:07,204
No, hold on!

1178
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,270
Who did that?

1179
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:15,646
You're gonna get it this time.

1180
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:20,583
Foul!

1181
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:23,715
Yes, definitely a foul.
Questionable.

1182
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,693
Two years and $2, 000 to
get these teeth straightened,

1183
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:29,230
and they want to knock them out
in one afternoon.

1184
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:30,286
I quit!

1185
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,229
Annabel, come on back!

1186
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:34,996
Annabel, where are you going?

1187
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,264
The game's not over.

1188
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:38,329
The score is tied.
We can still win.

1189
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:41,068
Where are you going, Annabel?
Can't you take it?

1190
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:43,771
She's probably changing
from blue to yellow.

1191
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,676
Annabel, yellow?

1192
00:59:45,747 --> 00:59:47,180
Sloppy, yes.

1193
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:49,080
Yellow, never!

1194
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:51,852
All right, give me
that broomstick,

1195
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,115
and get out of my way!

1196
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:55,816
We're gonna win this game!

1197
01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:05,927
I got this!

1198
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,932
I got it!

1199
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:07,990
Ahh!

1200
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:11,163
Yeah!

1201
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,968
Wow!

1202
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,770
No way!

1203
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:38,165
Yay!

1204
01:01:07,795 --> 01:01:08,955
You're out!

1205
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,497
What do you mean, I'm out?

1206
01:01:10,565 --> 01:01:12,055
- You're out!
- No, I'm not.

1207
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:13,794
- I was safe.
- You're out!

1208
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:15,358
What do you mean, I'm out?

1209
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:16,368
Go take a walk!

1210
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:18,234
Okay. Mmm!

1211
01:01:41,796 --> 01:01:44,128
Strike three!
You're outta there!

1212
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:16,320
Whoo!

1213
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:17,625
All right!

1214
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:26,773
No, no.
That's the wrong goal!

1215
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:28,672
Come back, Annabel!

1216
01:02:28,743 --> 01:02:30,506
Don't do this to me!

1217
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:32,512
Hey, way to go, Annabel!

1218
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,548
Good move!

1219
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:36,913
No, Annabel.
No! No!

1220
01:02:36,984 --> 01:02:38,576
No! No! No!

1221
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:42,880
Oh!

1222
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:44,515
Time!

1223
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:48,050
Winning goal by blue captain,
Annabel Andrews!

1224
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:49,653
Final score.

1225
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,497
Reds, eight.
Blues, Seven!

1226
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:57,969
Where did I go wrong?

1227
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,833
I know it's hard for you
to remember.

1228
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:03,570
I'm Jo-Jo, and you're Annabel.

1229
01:03:03,644 --> 01:03:06,636
And we both play
for the same team.

1230
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:10,081
Oh, good grief.
I've goofed again.

1231
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:12,210
Boy, Mom, that was terrific.

1232
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:15,653
That's even better than Annabel.
She's a super ballplayer.

1233
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:17,190
Really?

1234
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,793
- And she's beautiful.
- She's what?

1235
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:24,025
I think she's beautiful.
And I love her braces.

1236
01:03:24,098 --> 01:03:26,965
I hope when I get that old,
I'll have braces, too.

1237
01:03:27,034 --> 01:03:29,662
With your luck,
you won't need braces.

1238
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,830
That's what I'm afraid of.

1239
01:03:31,906 --> 01:03:35,205
Then Annabel's gonna hate me
more than she does now.

1240
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:37,608
Well, why does she
hate me so much?

1241
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:40,340
Because there's nothing
more annoying

1242
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:43,110
than a little blue-eyed saint
with perfect teeth

1243
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:46,642
who's always on time,
never has a messy room.

1244
01:03:46,721 --> 01:03:48,416
Do you hate me, too?

1245
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:49,649
Don't be a jackass.

1246
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:51,987
I'm trying to tell you
why Annabel hates you.

1247
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:54,153
But I can't help those things.

1248
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:56,253
I can't help what I look like.

1249
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,857
And about being neat.
I can't help that, either.

1250
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:02,402
Listen, if I thought
she'd like me better,

1251
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,131
I'd be messy.

1252
01:04:04,205 --> 01:04:06,605
I've even tried being messy.

1253
01:04:06,674 --> 01:04:09,040
Once I took all
my piled-up blocks

1254
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,702
and the books on the shelves

1255
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:14,612
and the big bag of marbles
and the LEGOs and threw them

1256
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:19,085
so Annabel wouldn't be
the only one getting in trouble.

1257
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:21,053
That stinky old Mrs. Schmauss

1258
01:04:21,122 --> 01:04:24,990
said I was too young to know any
better and picked everything up.

1259
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:28,586
So no matter what I do,
Annabel keeps on hating me.

1260
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:31,131
Well, why don't you
hate her back?

1261
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:32,564
That's a good idea.

1262
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:33,998
I told you before.

1263
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,035
I tried.

1264
01:04:35,102 --> 01:04:37,832
But you can't hate someone
and love them.

1265
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:39,839
Can you, Mom?

1266
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:43,536
No, I didn't use to think so.

1267
01:04:43,611 --> 01:04:45,408
But maybe you can.

1268
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:49,540
Now blow.

1269
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:51,107
- Feel better now?
- Uh-huh.

1270
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:53,153
Come on, let's go home.

1271
01:04:57,592 --> 01:04:59,287
Honey, where have you been?!

1272
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,351
Never mind.
We've got problems.

1273
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:05,160
That rat-fink Mary Kay.
She called you?

1274
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:08,566
Told you about the boomerang
through the window, did she?

1275
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:10,035
I've got a real problem.

1276
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:12,163
Will you listen
for half a minute?

1277
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,175
We have no buffet
for the marina tonight.

1278
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:18,235
Mrs. White thought Mrs. Matthews
was gonna handle this.

1279
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:21,213
Mrs. Matthews thought Mrs. White
was gonna handle this.

1280
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:22,249
Who's gonna handle it?

1281
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:24,181
- You are!
- Me?!

1282
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:26,049
There's only gonna be 25 people.

1283
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,556
I've already told them
what a great cook you are.

1284
01:05:29,624 --> 01:05:31,387
- No! But I...
- Honey.

1285
01:05:31,459 --> 01:05:33,120
You got three whole hours.

1286
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,162
Thanks, love.
Goodbye.

1287
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:36,161
Whew!

1288
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,959
Bah!

1289
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:41,901
Male chauvinist pig.

1290
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:45,928
Mommy, why did you call Daddy
a male chauvinist pig just now?

1291
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,497
Because that's what he is.

1292
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:48,940
But what is one?

1293
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:53,003
A male chauvinist pig is a
husband who spends three months

1294
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,344
taking bows for a shindig
he's gonna throw,

1295
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:59,512
and he gives his wife
three hours to save his skin.

1296
01:05:59,587 --> 01:06:02,681
Oh.

1297
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:06,923
Yes, Mr. Andrews?

1298
01:06:06,994 --> 01:06:07,926
Uh-oh.

1299
01:06:07,995 --> 01:06:09,690
Where did she come from?

1300
01:06:09,764 --> 01:06:12,426
Uh-huh.

1301
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,661
Oh, could you hold on
a minute, please?

1302
01:06:14,735 --> 01:06:15,667
May I help you?

1303
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:17,203
Could you tell Mr. Andrews

1304
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:19,933
that his daughter
would like to see him?

1305
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:21,565
Mr. Andrews?

1306
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,667
Your daughter is here.

1307
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,714
Fine.

1308
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:30,273
Would you walk this way, please?

1309
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:36,356
You've got to be kidding.

1310
01:06:36,424 --> 01:06:39,086
You're the new secretary,
I suppose.

1311
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,218
Enjoying your work?

1312
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:41,727
Oh, very much.

1313
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:43,559
How is Mr. Andrews to work for?

1314
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,223
Oh, he's just a doll.

1315
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,358
We get along.

1316
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:55,972
He's pleasant
and very professional.

1317
01:06:56,043 --> 01:06:57,670
I can't complain.

1318
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,610
I can.

1319
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:02,206
You know, Miss...

1320
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:03,580
Gibbons.

1321
01:07:03,651 --> 01:07:04,845
Miss Gibbons, yes.

1322
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:07,820
My father is an extremely
devoted family man.

1323
01:07:07,888 --> 01:07:09,583
Extremely devoted.

1324
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:11,249
Oh, I know he is.

1325
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:15,261
He talks about you and
your mother all the time.

1326
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:19,026
She must be a lovely person.

1327
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,160
Darn tootin'.
She's quite a doll, also.

1328
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:25,899
Dangerous lady to lock horns
with, if you know what I mean.

1329
01:07:35,316 --> 01:07:36,510
- Hi.
- Huh?

1330
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:38,950
Oh, hi, Honey.
What brings you here?

1331
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:40,350
Oh, nothing much.

1332
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:42,946
Why didn't you tell Mom
about your secretary?

1333
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:44,217
What's there to tell?

1334
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:47,920
But, darling,
you always used to tell me.

1335
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:54,765
Too late, Miss Gibbons.
I've already seen your action.

1336
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:58,134
Mr. Andrews, you wanted to sign
this as soon as it was ready.

1337
01:07:58,205 --> 01:08:00,070
Thanks.

1338
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:02,974
Lucille, you're
not going somewhere?

1339
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:03,975
Oh, no.

1340
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:07,036
It's just a bit chilly
in here, don't you think?

1341
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:08,638
Oh, yeah.

1342
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,175
Hadn't noticed.

1343
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,615
Thank you.

1344
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:16,155
Mm-hmm.

1345
01:08:20,161 --> 01:08:22,220
Now, what can I do for you?

1346
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:24,992
Look at me.
Aren't I revolting?

1347
01:08:25,065 --> 01:08:27,397
You look like
a typical teenager to me.

1348
01:08:27,468 --> 01:08:29,527
And I think
it's time for a change.

1349
01:08:29,603 --> 01:08:31,264
You came to ask me that?

1350
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:32,771
Well, no, not exactly.

1351
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,776
You know, I'm getting my braces
off this afternoon.

1352
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:39,472
I thought I'd get my hair done
and my nails.

1353
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:41,344
What's left of them.

1354
01:08:41,415 --> 01:08:43,815
You don't need
my permission for that.

1355
01:08:43,884 --> 01:08:44,612
Oh, I know.

1356
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,243
But I thought I'd go out

1357
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,948
and get some new clothes
to go with the new me.

1358
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,423
I wondered if I could borrow
your credit cards

1359
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:53,790
with a note of authorization.

1360
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:55,158
I think we can do that.

1361
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:56,924
Miss Gibbons
can take care of it.

1362
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:58,464
I'll bet she can.

1363
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,864
I think I hate Miss Gibbons.

1364
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:09,569
Yes, Mr. Andrews?

1365
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:10,940
Yeah.

1366
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:22,646
Would you take
a short note, please?

1367
01:09:23,924 --> 01:09:25,391
Yes, sir?

1368
01:09:25,459 --> 01:09:29,020
To whom it may concern.

1369
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,165
"To whom it may concern."

1370
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,930
Please allow my daughter,
Annabel Andrews,

1371
01:09:36,003 --> 01:09:37,834
whose signature appears below,

1372
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:40,738
to use my credit cards,
et cetera, et cetera.

1373
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:42,366
Sincerely yours.
Got that?

1374
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:44,343
Certainly.

1375
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:46,641
Have it ready for you
in a jiffy.

1376
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:57,480
Ugly-looking thing, isn't she?

1377
01:09:57,558 --> 01:10:00,459
I'll tell you the truth.
I've seen her look better.

1378
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:01,859
She's got a lot on her mind.

1379
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:03,726
She better not have.

1380
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:05,025
Such as?

1381
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,964
Husband's out of a job,
sick kid,

1382
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:08,729
and a difficult mother-in-law.

1383
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:11,896
Annabel, I don't have time
to spend on this.

1384
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,496
Anything else I can do?

1385
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:15,405
No, nothing.
This is fine.

1386
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:16,909
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Dad.

1387
01:10:16,977 --> 01:10:22,347
Ellen Andrews, you are a
conniving, suspicious old bat.

1388
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:24,247
Thanks a lot, Daddy.

1389
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:29,084
Okay.
Preheat oven to 325.

1390
01:10:29,156 --> 01:10:30,145
How do you do that?

1391
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,125
Turn it to preheat, stupido.
Sweetie.

1392
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:34,626
Preheat on our stove

1393
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:36,890
is when the oven
and the broiler are on.

1394
01:10:36,964 --> 01:10:38,431
It gets hot faster.

1395
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:40,433
Oh.

1396
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:45,302
For a 20-pound bird,
that will take 61/2 hours.

1397
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:46,361
Do we have time?

1398
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,534
Only if you double everything.
Turn it up full blast.

1399
01:10:51,545 --> 01:10:54,105
Answer that, will you?

1400
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:56,308
Hello?

1401
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:58,544
Hang on.
It's for you.

1402
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:01,144
Can't you see I'm up
to my armpits in gunk?

1403
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:03,314
Who is it?
What do they want?

1404
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,689
Who are you,
and what do you want?

1405
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,728
Okay, I'll tell her.

1406
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:11,560
That was
the principal's office.

1407
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:16,365
He says you're 15 minutes late
for the conference with him.

1408
01:11:16,437 --> 01:11:18,302
Mr. Dilk?

1409
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:21,297
What does he want?

1410
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:23,070
Wow!

1411
01:11:23,143 --> 01:11:24,906
What does he want?!

1412
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,207
Oh!

1413
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,544
Male chauvinist pig!

1414
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:29,878
Mr. Dilk, too?

1415
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:33,044
No, still your father
for getting me into this mess.

1416
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,985
Who are you calling?

1417
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:37,148
Hello, Boris?

1418
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:38,987
This is Mrs. Andrews.

1419
01:11:39,059 --> 01:11:43,496
How would you like to babysit
a small boy and a turkey?

1420
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,390
Let's see, what else
can I tell you?

1421
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:47,866
The bird's in the oven.

1422
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:50,403
Just don't touch it,
whatever you do.

1423
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:52,666
And, Boris, you don't say

1424
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,504
you could whip up a dessert
for about 25?

1425
01:11:55,576 --> 01:11:58,101
Oh, you know, Jell-O,
something like that.

1426
01:11:58,178 --> 01:12:00,203
I made a chocolate mousse once.

1427
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,645
Do that again.

1428
01:12:01,715 --> 01:12:02,773
He's gonna cook?

1429
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:05,011
Isn't that sort of
a sissy thing to do?

1430
01:12:05,085 --> 01:12:06,643
Look who's talking.

1431
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,382
The kid with the canopy bed
and the dollhouse.

1432
01:12:09,456 --> 01:12:11,720
- I don't have a...
- Your nose is runny!

1433
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,487
I wouldn't mention that.

1434
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,494
He's sensitive on the subject.

1435
01:12:15,562 --> 01:12:16,688
I can imagine.

1436
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:19,197
Everything fine?

1437
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:21,097
Okay, I'm off and running, kids.

1438
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:23,329
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

1439
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:25,372
- Got your car keys?
- Car keys?

1440
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:26,667
For the car, you mean?

1441
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,800
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

1442
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:30,866
In the state I'm in,

1443
01:12:30,944 --> 01:12:36,007
I'd probably kill
myself if I drove.

1444
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,675
I can take the bus.

1445
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:39,810
I've got bus fare.

1446
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:42,355
I'll put this on in the bus.

1447
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,708
Annabel!
Where have you been?!

1448
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:17,341
We've been looking all over!

1449
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:18,907
I got some new clothes.

1450
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:20,476
Come on.
We have to hurry.

1451
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,181
Come on, Annabel!
Hurry up!

1452
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:24,986
Why didn't you tell us
where you were going?

1453
01:14:25,058 --> 01:14:26,116
You look different.

1454
01:14:26,193 --> 01:14:27,888
Your dad's gonna be mad.

1455
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:30,327
Let's get this hearse moving.

1456
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,467
How could you come up
with a grade like that?

1457
01:14:36,537 --> 01:14:38,368
Doesn't she talk up in class?

1458
01:14:38,438 --> 01:14:39,427
All the time.

1459
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:41,440
Doesn't that add up
to something?

1460
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:44,033
It does. 37.

1461
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:46,636
But Annabel has
an extraordinary I.Q.,

1462
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:50,012
and her verbal aptitude is
higher than a college freshman.

1463
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,948
Nobody ever told me that.

1464
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:53,646
Why didn't you tell me that?

1465
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,187
I'm really a whiz?

1466
01:14:55,255 --> 01:14:57,815
I admire and love
your little girl.

1467
01:14:57,891 --> 01:14:59,017
She's the child

1468
01:14:59,092 --> 01:15:02,084
every teacher dreams of
discovering in her classroom.

1469
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:05,427
When you finally do and can't
get through to her at all,

1470
01:15:05,499 --> 01:15:09,367
then you have to face the fact
that perhaps I am the failure.

1471
01:15:09,436 --> 01:15:12,064
And that Annabel,
in more capable hands,

1472
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:15,267
would learn to implement the
gifts that God gave her.

1473
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:17,503
But I don't have that ability,
I guess.

1474
01:15:17,578 --> 01:15:20,308
And it just breaks my heart.

1475
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,042
Come now, Miss McGuirk.
Don't cry.

1476
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:24,515
It's not your fault.

1477
01:15:24,585 --> 01:15:28,077
She's sometimes a bit
of a flaky chick, that's all.

1478
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:30,487
This is your daughter
we're discussing.

1479
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:31,546
Yes, I know.

1480
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,093
She's suddenly changed
from a model student

1481
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:37,494
to a flaky chick.

1482
01:15:37,564 --> 01:15:39,327
Yes, flaky. That's it.

1483
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:41,833
There has to be a reason
for her behavior.

1484
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:44,200
A variation in her environment?

1485
01:15:44,271 --> 01:15:48,674
The emergence of a heretofore
suppressed sibling rivalry?

1486
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:51,802
Will you run that by me
in plain English, please?

1487
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:54,609
Does your family favor
your son over your daughter?

1488
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:57,172
Ape Face?
No, he's just a kid.

1489
01:15:57,251 --> 01:16:01,187
Well, she's obviously
rebelling at something.

1490
01:16:01,255 --> 01:16:04,884
I think she just wants to do
her own thing, that's it.

1491
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,256
Naturally, that's
the normal teenage...

1492
01:16:07,327 --> 01:16:08,851
Could it possibly be you?

1493
01:16:08,929 --> 01:16:10,897
Are you an attentive mother?

1494
01:16:10,964 --> 01:16:12,864
Too darned attentive, I'd say.

1495
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:14,560
Are you understanding?

1496
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:15,567
Never.

1497
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:16,933
Overdemanding?

1498
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:18,538
You bet.

1499
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:20,630
Hey, this is fun!

1500
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:23,175
With all due respect,
Mrs. Andrews,

1501
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:26,110
do you consider yourself
an able parent?

1502
01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:27,111
Yeah.

1503
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,239
I'm not number one
on the charts,

1504
01:16:29,316 --> 01:16:31,216
but I'd say I'm in the top ten.

1505
01:16:31,285 --> 01:16:33,879
You are loving to
your daughter, aren't you?

1506
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:36,616
Of course I am.
What kind of question is that?

1507
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:38,282
That's a dumb question.

1508
01:16:38,358 --> 01:16:41,259
Yeah, what kind of
a dumb question is that?

1509
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:45,560
This is going to be a little
more difficult than I...

1510
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:49,966
Tell me, is there trouble
between you and your husband?

1511
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:52,562
Now, hold on, Charlie!

1512
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:53,765
Charles, please.

1513
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,172
Charles, this is
getting out of hand.

1514
01:16:56,243 --> 01:16:59,474
We're here to talk about grades,
not my father.

1515
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:02,947
Oh, ho ho! Mrs. Andrews.
Did you hear what you said?

1516
01:17:03,016 --> 01:17:05,507
Yes, I called my husband
my father.

1517
01:17:05,585 --> 01:17:06,779
Big deal!

1518
01:17:06,853 --> 01:17:08,320
Revealing, don't you think?

1519
01:17:08,388 --> 01:17:10,652
I think you have
an awful lot of nerve

1520
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:12,919
prying into people's
personal affairs.

1521
01:17:12,993 --> 01:17:14,483
Attaway to go, Mom.

1522
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:17,758
We're interested in getting at
the root of Annabel's problem.

1523
01:17:17,831 --> 01:17:19,093
She needs help.

1524
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:22,033
And she's not the only one.

1525
01:17:22,102 --> 01:17:24,935
Besides, I think
she just got that help.

1526
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:26,165
Come Monday morning,

1527
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,707
you're going to see
a brand-new Annabel.

1528
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,335
We mustn't expect her
to change just like that.

1529
01:17:31,411 --> 01:17:35,177
Stranger things have happened,
McGuirk.

1530
01:17:36,249 --> 01:17:38,046
You think
we ought to turn it off?

1531
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:40,177
Sounds like it's gonna explode!

1532
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:42,346
Your mother said
not to touch it.

1533
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:43,946
Now what happens?

1534
01:17:44,024 --> 01:17:47,460
The chocolate gets blended
with the egg whites and brandy.

1535
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:48,619
I'll do it!

1536
01:17:48,695 --> 01:17:49,684
No!

1537
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:52,289
Turn it off!

1538
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:57,132
Creep!

1539
01:17:57,204 --> 01:17:59,729
Oh, man! Now I gotta
start all over again.

1540
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:00,738
Sorry!

1541
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:03,709
Hey, that's kinda good.

1542
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:06,744
Boris, look!

1543
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:09,577
Yeah, yeah, I see you're a mess.

1544
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:11,276
Come on.
You need a bath.

1545
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:12,283
But, Boris...

1546
01:18:12,352 --> 01:18:13,319
Come on!

1547
01:18:16,223 --> 01:18:17,713
Hi, guys.

1548
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:20,191
Ape Face. Ape Face.

1549
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,194
It's nice to see you
looking dirty.

1550
01:18:22,262 --> 01:18:23,786
Making mud pies?

1551
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:25,161
- Mousse pies.
- Yeah?

1552
01:18:25,866 --> 01:18:27,026
It blew up by mistake.

1553
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,567
Blew up?
You're joking.

1554
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:29,932
The turkey's about to...

1555
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:30,992
That's enough, Max.

1556
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:33,539
Let the chocolate soldier
go get washed up.

1557
01:18:33,607 --> 01:18:34,835
Ooh, great.

1558
01:18:34,908 --> 01:18:36,273
Come on, you two.

1559
01:18:36,343 --> 01:18:39,608
You clean up the walls.
You clean up the body.

1560
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:40,611
To the showers.

1561
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,204
Go, go to the showers.

1562
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:44,443
You to the kitchen.

1563
01:18:44,518 --> 01:18:46,042
What's that smell?

1564
01:18:49,022 --> 01:18:51,354
Oh, no.

1565
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:54,121
Open a window,
if you can find it.

1566
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:56,719
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, a vent.

1567
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:58,822
I can't breathe.

1568
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,976
Exploded mousse
and burnt turkey!

1569
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:12,136
Boris, how could you
do this to me?

1570
01:19:12,212 --> 01:19:14,305
Sorry.

1571
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:16,679
What now?
Get myself together.

1572
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,944
Just pretend.

1573
01:19:18,018 --> 01:19:18,950
Hello?

1574
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:20,714
Yes?

1575
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:23,756
Ellen, where are you?!
Where's the food?!

1576
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:26,725
Right here.
It's all around me, actually.

1577
01:19:26,793 --> 01:19:28,954
Where's Annabel?
I need her help now.

1578
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:31,827
She's getting ready
for the aquacade.

1579
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:33,957
What?
She's going to water-ski?

1580
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,228
She'll be killed!

1581
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:38,430
She's one of the best
water-skiers in the state.

1582
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:41,497
She may have been this morning,
but she isn't now.

1583
01:19:41,575 --> 01:19:43,475
You've got to stop her, Bill.

1584
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:46,671
Honey, you just let me handle
this end of it, will you?

1585
01:19:46,746 --> 01:19:48,577
You get down here
with that food!

1586
01:19:48,648 --> 01:19:50,240
Counting on you both.

1587
01:19:50,317 --> 01:19:52,751
But you're counting
on the wrong both!

1588
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:54,811
I want my Mommy!

1589
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,321
It's all right.

1590
01:19:56,389 --> 01:19:58,550
Let's make this
a creative enterprise.

1591
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:01,423
Boris, let's start all over.
Forget this thing.

1592
01:20:01,495 --> 01:20:03,690
We have some Catty Kibble left,

1593
01:20:03,763 --> 01:20:06,027
some green noodles,
Tabasco sauce.

1594
01:20:06,099 --> 01:20:08,033
We'll make a New Orleans
casserole.

1595
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:10,296
We'll sprinkle
a little bread crumbs.

1596
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:13,737
I think I have some olives.
It'll be wonderful.

1597
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:15,502
Parsley!

1598
01:20:15,575 --> 01:20:17,634
Let's get going, Boris.

1599
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:44,366
Come on, Annabel.
Get your skis on.

1600
01:20:44,437 --> 01:20:46,428
I'm not going through
with it, Bill.

1601
01:20:46,506 --> 01:20:49,270
Don't start that.
I've been bragging for weeks.

1602
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:50,570
Don't let me down now.

1603
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:52,942
I'm not the same person
you think I am.

1604
01:20:53,013 --> 01:20:57,006
You sound just like your mother.
Let's get into your skis.

1605
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,142
You don't care whether
I live or die.

1606
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:01,244
We'll talk about that
after the aquacade.

1607
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:03,755
I'll help you.
Come on, into the skis.

1608
01:21:03,823 --> 01:21:04,915
There we are.

1609
01:21:04,991 --> 01:21:06,652
First the foot.

1610
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:09,620
Have we got everything?

1611
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:11,186
Where's the turkey?!

1612
01:21:11,264 --> 01:21:12,856
You're gonna eat that thing?

1613
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:16,061
You ever heard of smoked turkey?
Go get it, tiger!

1614
01:21:16,136 --> 01:21:19,196
Listen, Boris.
I haven't got much time.

1615
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:21,968
There are a few kooky things
you should know.

1616
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:24,875
Try and understand.
I need your help desperately.

1617
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:25,877
You name it.

1618
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:27,846
Well, to begin with,

1619
01:21:27,914 --> 01:21:31,577
I know it's hard to believe,
but I don't know how to drive.

1620
01:21:31,651 --> 01:21:33,551
You're right.
I don't believe you.

1621
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:35,611
Do you drive, Boris?

1622
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:38,556
Kinda, but I don't got a
license. I can get arrested.

1623
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,651
It's better than getting killed.
I can't drive.

1624
01:21:41,728 --> 01:21:44,253
I'm only 13 years old.

1625
01:21:44,331 --> 01:21:47,027
Oh, sure, and I'm only 38.

1626
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,295
Please, Boris,
don't you believe me?

1627
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:50,563
I'm not my mother.

1628
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:54,300
I'm Annabel Andrews
in my mother's body.

1629
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:57,070
You understand?
Don't ask me how it happened.

1630
01:21:57,143 --> 01:21:58,872
You don't believe me, do you?!

1631
01:21:58,945 --> 01:22:00,310
I think you're crazy.

1632
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:04,009
Boris, I can't argue that.
Not in the very least.

1633
01:22:04,084 --> 01:22:05,346
I am a fruitcake.

1634
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:07,784
But what kind of
irresponsible person are you

1635
01:22:07,854 --> 01:22:10,118
to let me, a fruitcake,
drive a car?

1636
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,248
I might get killed.

1637
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:12,382
Don't you care?

1638
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:14,188
Well, yeah, I care.

1639
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:15,558
All right.

1640
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:19,588
If you care, get into this car
and drive me to the marina

1641
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:23,261
so I can save my Dad's neck
and my Mommy's life.

1642
01:22:23,336 --> 01:22:24,997
I don't care that much.

1643
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:26,800
Boris, buzz off.

1644
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:28,864
Go ahead! Go away.
Who needs you?

1645
01:22:28,942 --> 01:22:31,035
I got the turkey, Mom!
Let's go!

1646
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:33,636
Wait a minute! 'Cause I
don't want to go to jail

1647
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:35,476
doesn't mean I don't
want to help.

1648
01:22:35,548 --> 01:22:36,480
Creep, get in.

1649
01:22:37,684 --> 01:22:40,482
Onward and upward!

1650
01:23:05,745 --> 01:23:07,838
Listen, let me put it this way.

1651
01:23:07,914 --> 01:23:09,973
Number one,

1652
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:12,382
I'm not gonna make
a fool out of myself,

1653
01:23:12,452 --> 01:23:13,942
let alone break every bone.

1654
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,851
Annabel, you can't
do this to me.

1655
01:23:15,922 --> 01:23:17,822
My job may depend on this deal.

1656
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:20,621
I'm sorry.
But I just can't do it.

1657
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:22,958
Okay, okay, I give up.

1658
01:23:23,029 --> 01:23:25,293
Here, sit down.
We'll talk about it.

1659
01:23:25,365 --> 01:23:27,390
Here, hold this.

1660
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,560
Hit it, Charlie!

1661
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:34,267
I'm sorry, honey!

1662
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:36,866
I had to do it!

1663
01:23:36,943 --> 01:23:40,845
Bill, you dirty louse!

1664
01:23:43,616 --> 01:23:46,483
Oh! Help!

1665
01:23:49,622 --> 01:23:52,090
- Which way do I turn here, left?
- Right.

1666
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:53,455
- Right?
- No, left.

1667
01:23:53,526 --> 01:23:54,458
- Left?
- Right.

1668
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:55,994
- Right?
- Left's that way.

1669
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:09,806
Uh-oh.

1670
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:12,367
Hey, I think we got company.

1671
01:24:23,656 --> 01:24:26,454
I wish I had my own body back!

1672
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:34,530
Right body, wrong place!

1673
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,432
Annabel, where'd you come from?

1674
01:24:36,503 --> 01:24:38,300
- Where did Mom go?
- Don't ask me.

1675
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:39,963
How'd you do that?

1676
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:42,735
- Could you do it again?
- I hope not.

1677
01:24:58,024 --> 01:25:00,492
Wait, wait, wait!

1678
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:10,833
Andrews, isn't that
your wife out there?

1679
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:11,836
Yeah. What?

1680
01:25:14,007 --> 01:25:16,601
Yes, sir, yeah.
I believe it is.

1681
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:19,307
What is she doing out there?

1682
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:21,438
What? Well...

1683
01:25:21,514 --> 01:25:23,812
It's a mother-and-daughter
act, Jennings.

1684
01:25:23,883 --> 01:25:25,350
Yeah, that's it.

1685
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:28,353
That's exactly it.

1686
01:25:28,421 --> 01:25:30,150
Where's the daughter?

1687
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:32,088
Huh?

1688
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:34,456
Hey, Annabel,
what are you doing?

1689
01:25:37,063 --> 01:25:39,827
Why don't you stop
before somebody gets killed?!

1690
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:41,093
Mom needs us.

1691
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:43,658
And if I'm here,
she's worse off than we are.

1692
01:25:43,736 --> 01:25:45,761
I find that hard to believe.

1693
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:25,909
Oh, oh, oh!
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!

1694
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:42,556
Hey, what are you doing?

1695
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:43,857
No!

1696
01:26:46,266 --> 01:26:47,824
Hey, where'd everybody go?

1697
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:49,266
Coming through.

1698
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:50,495
No, no, right.

1699
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:52,402
- No, the other way.
- No!

1700
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:55,966
Look out, Mister!

1701
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,703
Look out, everybody!

1702
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:11,481
Get your mitts off the wheel.
Take this thing off my head.

1703
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:24,196
- They're getting closer!
- More of them!

1704
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,532
Yeah, I see 'em.

1705
01:27:29,309 --> 01:27:30,503
Whoa, whoa!

1706
01:27:30,577 --> 01:27:32,272
Whatcha doing?

1707
01:27:32,345 --> 01:27:33,778
Wait a minute!

1708
01:27:33,846 --> 01:27:37,009
Hold it!
No, no, no!

1709
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:40,542
Why aren't you driving the boat?

1710
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,864
She's amazing, Andrews.

1711
01:27:55,935 --> 01:27:58,369
Why didn't you tell us
about her?

1712
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:00,565
Well, I want it to be
a surprise, sir.

1713
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,302
Well, it sure is to me.

1714
01:28:03,376 --> 01:28:04,900
That makes two of us.

1715
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:06,104
Three of us.

1716
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:07,441
- Huh?
- Huh?

1717
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:17,352
Good show!

1718
01:28:17,423 --> 01:28:19,220
Would have been better at night.

1719
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:21,692
Nonsense.
You had it planned that way.

1720
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,661
Yes, I did.

1721
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,220
What's next?
What's next?

1722
01:28:25,298 --> 01:28:30,167
Well, I think the
next trick's out there

1723
01:28:30,236 --> 01:28:31,703
somewhere in the water.

1724
01:28:57,897 --> 01:28:59,296
Road hog!

1725
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:01,959
Neat wheelie, Mrs. Schmauss!
Don't lose it!

1726
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:08,568
Stop this thing!
I want to get off!

1727
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,844
Coming through, fellows!

1728
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,478
Excuse me!

1729
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:24,822
Pardon me!

1730
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:56,221
Look out behind you!

1731
01:29:56,289 --> 01:29:58,052
Down! Down!

1732
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:01,555
Oh, no! No! No!

1733
01:30:23,716 --> 01:30:25,411
- Pardon me, young man.
- Whoa!

1734
01:30:25,485 --> 01:30:26,884
Can you help me, please?

1735
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:29,114
Watch out, lady.
What are you doing?

1736
01:30:29,188 --> 01:30:31,452
Let go of me!

1737
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:32,718
C'est bizarre!

1738
01:32:16,028 --> 01:32:17,325
What?

1739
01:32:17,396 --> 01:32:18,658
What?

1740
01:32:21,434 --> 01:32:23,925
- Huh?
- Hey, what? What?

1741
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:36,977
Don't take your eyes
off him, folks.

1742
01:32:37,049 --> 01:32:39,017
He's the daredevil of Bay City.

1743
01:32:39,085 --> 01:32:41,451
I believe you've got
your sexes mixed up.

1744
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,452
Beg pardon?

1745
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,455
It's not a he.

1746
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:46,923
It's not a he.
She's my wife!

1747
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:49,393
She's up in the air!
She's on a kite!

1748
01:32:50,897 --> 01:32:53,092
She's so young!

1749
01:32:55,034 --> 01:32:56,968
Ellen!

1750
01:32:57,036 --> 01:32:58,867
Honey!

1751
01:32:58,938 --> 01:33:01,634
Don't "honey" me!

1752
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:17,785
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the kiteflyer.

1753
01:33:28,868 --> 01:33:29,926
Look out!

1754
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,706
Did you see that pile-up?

1755
01:33:36,776 --> 01:33:39,677
Really gross!

1756
01:33:44,283 --> 01:33:45,807
Uh-oh!

1757
01:33:50,656 --> 01:33:52,021
Yippee!

1758
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:53,524
Stop!

1759
01:33:54,994 --> 01:33:58,521
Quick, Annabel.
Put it in reverse!

1760
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:09,264
- Mrs. Andrews?
- Mom?

1761
01:34:22,555 --> 01:34:25,820
- Come on, Mom!
- Oh, Annabel!

1762
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:27,756
I thought you were gonna
wipe out.

1763
01:34:27,827 --> 01:34:28,691
So did I.

1764
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:30,524
It's nice to know
you care, my darling.

1765
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:31,927
It's nice to know I do.

1766
01:34:31,998 --> 01:34:33,124
Believe me, I do.

1767
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,224
Oh, Mom, I really love you.

1768
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:36,893
I love you, too, darling.

1769
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:39,870
Hey, Mom, can I take
driving lessons from Annabel?

1770
01:34:40,873 --> 01:34:42,534
Not on my street, you're not.

1771
01:34:42,608 --> 01:34:44,007
We'll see, Benji.

1772
01:34:44,076 --> 01:34:47,273
Right now, I'm so glad
to be me again.

1773
01:34:47,346 --> 01:34:49,280
Hey, right on, Mom.

1774
01:34:49,382 --> 01:34:51,009
How do you like yourself?

1775
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:51,982
I don't know.

1776
01:34:52,051 --> 01:34:54,519
Annabel, about your hair.

1777
01:34:54,587 --> 01:34:56,851
They only took off
an inch and a half.

1778
01:34:56,922 --> 01:35:00,050
I bought you a new outfit.
You don't have to wear it.

1779
01:35:00,126 --> 01:35:02,651
Your teeth.
Don't you like your new teeth?

1780
01:35:02,728 --> 01:35:04,161
Not the way I look.

1781
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:06,994
I was talking about
the way I am.

1782
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:09,432
I am so much smarter
than I thought.

1783
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:10,935
And so much dumber.

1784
01:35:11,003 --> 01:35:14,905
Oh, my darling, aren't we all?

1785
01:35:14,974 --> 01:35:17,442
Oh, Annabel.

1786
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:23,273
Your family is
a bunch of comedians.

1787
01:35:23,349 --> 01:35:26,341
That's one of the funniest
shows I have ever seen.

1788
01:35:26,419 --> 01:35:29,252
Yeah.
I guess it was, wasn't it?

1789
01:35:29,321 --> 01:35:30,345
You bet it was.

1790
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:34,623
No way to top it.
Right, Jennings?

1791
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,890
I think we should have held out
for professional...

1792
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:47,739
That doesn't quite
explain it for me, Ellen.

1793
01:35:47,807 --> 01:35:50,605
I don't quite understand
how you got on the kite.

1794
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:53,803
Darling, all's well
that ends well.

1795
01:35:53,846 --> 01:35:56,280
Yeah, but that doesn't...

1796
01:35:56,348 --> 01:35:58,543
- You look great, Annabel.
- Thanks.

1797
01:35:58,617 --> 01:36:01,848
Yeah, you're not the same way
you used to be at all.

1798
01:36:01,921 --> 01:36:03,047
Is that good or bad?

1799
01:36:03,122 --> 01:36:04,714
Well, no.
What I mean is,

1800
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:07,258
you're a completely
different person.

1801
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:10,557
Well, maybe not completely yet,
but I'm working on it.

1802
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:12,324
Stew, stew, stew.

1803
01:36:12,398 --> 01:36:14,764
You're being less
than direct with me.

1804
01:36:14,834 --> 01:36:16,995
I'm a little worried
about your mom.

1805
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,969
She's acting kind of weird.

1806
01:36:19,038 --> 01:36:22,735
You don't think she's what they
call a bad seed, do you?

1807
01:36:22,808 --> 01:36:24,901
Well, I think
you'll be noticing

1808
01:36:24,977 --> 01:36:26,444
some changes in her, too.

1809
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:28,946
I like a more level-headed
woman like you.

1810
01:36:29,014 --> 01:36:31,312
You know what I mean?

1811
01:36:31,383 --> 01:36:33,817
Yeah, I think I know
what you mean, Boris.

1812
01:36:35,654 --> 01:36:37,315
Where are you guys all going?

1813
01:36:37,389 --> 01:36:39,152
We're gonna get some pizza.

1814
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:40,089
Oh.

1815
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:41,854
You want to go with us?

1816
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:43,189
Me? Really, me?

1817
01:36:43,262 --> 01:36:44,320
Really. Come on.

1818
01:36:46,565 --> 01:36:47,691
Oh, man.

1819
01:36:49,902 --> 01:36:52,666
Ellen, what I saw you do today
was impossible.

1820
01:36:52,738 --> 01:36:54,262
How can you sit there?

1821
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:57,036
We're gonna go get some pizza.
Anybody want any?

1822
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:58,804
I can't get a straight answer.

1823
01:36:58,878 --> 01:37:01,039
Would you explain
what happened today?

1824
01:37:01,113 --> 01:37:02,307
Please, will you?

1825
01:37:02,381 --> 01:37:07,648
Look, did I or did I not
force you into the water?

1826
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,153
Well, yes and no.

1827
01:37:10,556 --> 01:37:13,787
Great.
You're just like your mother.

1828
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:15,349
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1829
01:37:16,228 --> 01:37:18,788
Mom, Boris and I are gonna go
to the beach tomorrow.

1830
01:37:18,864 --> 01:37:20,161
Can you drop us off?

1831
01:37:20,232 --> 01:37:22,359
Sure.
That's very nice.

1832
01:37:22,434 --> 01:37:23,799
I could do it.

1833
01:37:23,869 --> 01:37:26,736
I've got to get started
on my motorcycle campaign.

1834
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:29,035
What am I gonna do
while everyone is busy?

1835
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:31,508
Tomorrow's Saturday.
You ice-skate, right?

1836
01:37:31,577 --> 01:37:33,306
I hate ice-skating.

1837
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:35,677
My feet get cold,
and my ankles hurt.

1838
01:37:35,748 --> 01:37:40,082
When I was a boy,
I used to love ice-skating.

1839
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:42,712
You get all the fun stuff
to do, Dad,

1840
01:37:42,788 --> 01:37:46,053
like kiteflyers
and ride motorcycles.

1841
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:49,151
As long as we're comparing,
I'd like to be in your shoes.

1842
01:37:49,228 --> 01:37:50,490
And I'd rather be you.

1843
01:37:50,563 --> 01:37:53,896
Bill, I wouldn't pursue
this any further if I were you.

1844
01:37:53,966 --> 01:37:57,424
You would not want to change
places with Ben, believe me.

1845
01:37:57,503 --> 01:38:00,836
Yeah, you don't want to change
places with Dad over there.

1846
01:38:00,906 --> 01:38:02,840
- Oh, yes, I do!
- Oh, yes, I do!

1847
01:38:02,908 --> 01:38:04,000
Help!
