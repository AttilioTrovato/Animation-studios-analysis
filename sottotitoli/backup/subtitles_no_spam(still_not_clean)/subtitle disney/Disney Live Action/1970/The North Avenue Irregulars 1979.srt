1
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,085
<I>Ooh, It's So Pretty.

2
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,489
Yeah.
Let's Go Look.

3
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,826
God?

4
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,930
Are You Home?

5
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,930
Dean!

6
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,367
Well, Dad Always Says
It's God's House.

7
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,979
Let's Go Look Around.

8
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,979
Okay.

9
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,519
I Wonder What's Up There.

10
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:56,197
You Better Get Down. You're
Gonna Get In Trouble. Dean!

11
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:56,197
Okay. Yeow!

12
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,100
Whoa! Whoa!

13
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,942
- Help!
- Dean!

14
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,545
Help! Somebody Help Me!
Help Me! Rose!

15
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,149
That Sounds Like Your Husband, Mrs. Rafferty.

16
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:20,086
<I>Help! Where Are You?

17
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:20,086
That's Delaney, All Right.
Now What Is He Up To?

18
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:26,459
<I>Help! Help!

19
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:26,459
Hey, That's Someone In Trouble.

20
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,129
What Did You Do?

21
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,129
Nothing.

22
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,836
Gangway!

23
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,473
Delaney, What Are You
Doing Up There?

24
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,376
<I>You're Supposed
To Be Painting.

25
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,878
Rose, Now, Don't Start.

26
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,883
- Don't You Yell At Me.
- Don't Jump, Mr. Rafferty.

27
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:53,187
<I>You've Got Lots To Live For.

28
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:53,187
You Think
I Don't Know That?

29
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,222
Why Doesn't Somebody
Get A Ladder?

30
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,159
- There's One Out Back. Okay, Come On.
- I'll Give You A Hand.

31
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,230
You Can Stop
Your Hollering, Delaney.

32
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,067
<I>They're Coming For You.

33
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,067
Hurry, Hurry.
Me Hands Are--

34
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,408
Has Anybody Called
The Fire Department?

35
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,408
There's A Phone In The Office.

36
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,379
Gangway!

37
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,379
<I>Come On! Come On!

38
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,117
Hang On.
We Got The Ladder.

39
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,319
Hang On!
It's Coming Up.

40
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,692
- Stop Kicking Around! You'll Tire Yourself Out!
- It's Too Short.

41
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,963
Maybe We Should Take The Ladder Up To
The Belfry And Lower It Down To Him.

42
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,598
Hey, That's A Good Idea.

43
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,598
Yeah, Do That.
Take That Down.

44
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,668
- Everybody, Push.
- Where Are You Going Now?

45
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,672
Well, Can't You Get The Cat
Out Of The Tree Later?

46
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,507
Well, A Man's Life
Is In Danger.

47
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,579
Forward! Forward!

48
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,049
Go Back. Back Up.

49
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:02,423
It's The North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.

50
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,526
Hurry! Hurry!

51
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,526
That's The Way
To Go.

52
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,997
- Honey!
- Go Back! Go Back!

53
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,634
Hold On!
They're Coming!

54
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,401
Hold On!

55
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,139
Somebody, Get Around.<I>
Move It! Hurry Up, You Two

56
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,141
Sorry.

57
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,143
Sorry.

58
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,178
Ouch.

59
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,178
Sorry.

60
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,281
Ow!

61
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,281
Sorry.

62
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,484
That Ain't Gonna Make
Much Of A Cushion.

63
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,420
Hey, You With The Flowered Shirt.
Could You Just Take The End There?

64
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,024
Sure.

65
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,024
<I>Hang On, Delaney!

66
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,396
Grab On To The Ladder,
Mr. Rafferty.

67
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,033
- Pull Me Up.
- Okay.

68
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,436
Ready? Pull.

69
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,108
- Oh, I Can't Look. I Can't Look.
- Help! Somebody Help!

70
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,745
Delaney! Delaney!

71
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,745
Grab On
To The Ladder!

72
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,653
Help, Somebody!

73
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,995
The Other Side.
The Other Side.

74
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,269
Rose, The Will Is
In The Top Drawer!

75
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:37,518
Is He All Right?<I>
- Is He All Right? Can You See Anything?

76
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,529
<I>Rosie! Rosie!

77
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,167
Delaney! Delaney!
Me Poor Darlin'! Are You All Right?

78
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,637
Thanks To You,
Rosie, Me Darlin'.

79
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,637
Ah!

80
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:01,341
Don't Touch Me.
You're A Mess.

81
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,144
Where's Dad?

82
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,144
Dad!

83
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,448
Dad, Are You All Right?

84
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,448
Dad!

85
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,349
<I>Are You All Right?

86
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,349
Who's He?

87
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm Reverend Hill,
Your New Pastor.

88
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,824
Oh, He's
The New Pastor.

89
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,225
<I>Glory Be!
It's The New Pastor.

90
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,128
I Hope You Were Praying For Me When I Was Up There.

91
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,664
Welcome To New Campton,
Reverend. I'm Cleo Jackson.

92
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,366
I Hope He Feels All Right.

93
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,746
<I>Look, We Tried To Be On Time.
It Was Just An Awful Mistake.

94
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,816
The Whole Thing, From Start To Finish.
I Volunteer Voluntarily,

95
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,852
Except I Have
Baby-Sitting Problems.

96
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,787
Would You Please Let Him Get His
Hat Off Before You Start That?

97
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,757
Reverend Hill,
I'm Claire Porter.

98
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,757
How Do You Do?

99
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,759
Well, You Know,
We Didn't Expect You Till Tomorrow.

100
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,093
We Would've Had A Less Hectic
Reception If We'd Known.

101
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:59,500
<I>Would You Happen To Have A Little Of That
Sacramental Wine On The Premises, Reverend

102
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:04,605
Sacramental. Watch Your Hands.
You Wanna Get Paint All Over The Reverend's Chair?

103
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,341
Haven't You Done Enough
For One Day?

104
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,643
Please, Let's Go Home
And Get You Cleaned Up.

105
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,513
Rosie, You're
Straining Me Patience.

106
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,513
Oh, I'll Strain More Than That.

107
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,849
- Isn't This Nice?
- Very... Nice.

108
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,354
- Oh, That Must Be Howard.
- Howard?

109
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,191
My Fiance.
I Told Him I'd Be Waiting For Him Out Front.

110
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,294
If-If-If You Get A Chance,
Please Check Your Calendar,

111
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:31,432
Because We're Getting Married June 25,
And We'd Like You To Perform The Ceremony.

112
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,869
- Oh, Thank You. That's--
- It's Really Been-- Oh, Sorry.

113
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,738
- It's Really Been A Pleasure Meeting You. Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,807
I Have To Dash Too. It's Been Terribly Nice.
I Have To Pick Up My Children...

115
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,411
And I Have To Get
My Dog Bruno Out Of The Vet.

116
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,447
They Charge An Extra Day If I
Leave Him In There After 4:00.

117
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,350
He Was, Uh,
Foaming At The Mouth.

118
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,688
Well, Saint Bernards Do. But, Uh,
It Was Quite An Excessive Amount.

119
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,293
I Think It Was Just An Oral Problem.
Nothing Rabid. Well, Good-Bye.

120
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,833
My, You're A Tall One.<I>
Come On, Claire.

121
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:11,304
I Do Believe Our Dear Reverend Has A Lot To Do
And Can Use The Time. See You Later, Annie.

122
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,841
<I>Have A Nice Day.
Come On, Darlin'.

123
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,877
You'll See Him Another Day.
You'll See Him In Church.

124
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,877
Good-Bye.

125
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,945
Good-Bye.

126
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:29,722
- Quite A Group.
- Yes, They Are.

127
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,863
- Oh. Oh, I'm-I'm Anne Woods.
- How Do You Do?

128
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:40,766
Here's The List
Of The Church Membership.

129
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,736
<I>Minutes Of The Meetings
For The Last Couple Of Months.

130
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,639
That's My Office Right Out There.
If You Have Any Questions--

131
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,942
<I>Unless, Of Course,
You Have Plans To Hire A New Secretary.

132
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,313
No, No.
I Feel Very Fortunate To Have You Stay On.

133
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,420
Oh, Well, Then, In Case--
Here Is...

134
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,754
The Key
To The Outside Door.

135
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,725
Um, These Are The, Uh,

136
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,927
Presbyterian Financial Reports,
The Sinking Fund,

137
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,365
Which Is Emergency Money,

138
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,367
Um,

139
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,572
The Men's Club Book And, Uh--

140
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,572
<I>Is Anything
The Matter?

141
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,943
<I>It's Very Difficult
For Me...

142
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,613
Having A Stranger Take Over
At North Avenue.

143
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:32,052
But, Miss Woods, You Must Understand
That I Didn't Ask Your Father To Retire.

144
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,655
- Oh, I Know.
- I Only Applied For The Job.

145
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,292
Of Course I Know That.
It-- It's Just That...

146
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,661
This Church Was Our--

147
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,597
Was His Life.

148
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,740
Yes, There's, Uh--

149
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,410
There's Plenty
Of Evidence Of That.

150
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,813
Either You Or Reverend Woods
Chaired Most Of The Committees.

151
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,716
Someone Had To Do It.

152
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,716
<I>Yes.

153
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,519
But I Think Active Participation
By The Whole Membership...

154
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,788
Is What Really Makes
A Strong Church.

155
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,426
In Fact, I've Got A Lot Of Plans
Along Those Lines For This Church.

156
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,929
I Think You'll Find If You Want Something Done Here...

157
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,865
That It's Easier
To Do It Yourself.

158
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,966
Then That Way, You'll Know
When It Gets Done.

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,937
Oh, I'm Sure There Are A Lot Of People
Who Would Like To Help, Given The Chance.

160
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,640
Good Luck.

161
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,547
Oh! Pardon Me, Reverend.
Delaney Left His Hat.

162
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,615
Oh, Here It Is.

163
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,354
<I>Ah, I'm-I'm Sorry.
Very Sorry.

164
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,354
Ah, Excuse Me, Mrs.--

165
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,956
Oh. Rafferty.

166
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,956
<I>Mrs. Rafferty.

167
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,495
- I Wonder If You Could Help Me With Something.
- Help? You? Me?

168
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,132
Oh, Why, Anything.
Anything I Can Do. Anything.

169
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,836
How Would You Like To Be
In Charge Of The, Uh--

170
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,903
The Church Sinking Fund.

171
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,608

172
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,608
Uh-- Uh, Reverend Hill.

173
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,676
Oh, I'd Like It.
In Fact, I'd Love It.

174
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,713
There You Are, Madam Chairman.
And We Thank You.

Thank <I>You.

176
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:12,151
- Uh, Mrs. Rafferty?

177
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,154
Start Thinking About Ways
Of Building Up The Fund.

178
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:20,626
Of Course I Will. Sure.
Why Not? Why, Uh, Good-Bye.

179
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,001
It's, Uh,
All In The Wrist.

180
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,905
<I>Â™ª Oh, How Our Hearts â™ª

<I>â™ª Till Death â™ª

189
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,743
Let Me Have It.
Give Him To Me.

190
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,212
We Don't Bring Norman To Church.
I'll Put Him In Here.

191
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,449
<I>Â™ª We Will Love â™ª

192
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,449
What?

193
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,019
<I>Â™ª Both Friend And Foe â™ª

194
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:25,859

Amen. Amen. Oh.

202
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,264
Oh! Reverend Hill,
I Gotta Talk To You.

203
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,499
Certainly, Mrs. Rafferty.
Why Don't You Drop By After Services?

204
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,903
<I>Oh, It'll Be Too Late Then.
The Third Goes Off In Ten Minutes.

205
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:16,509
- The Third What? - After You Put Me In
Charge Of The Church's Sinking Fund--

206
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,814
â™ª Amen â™ª

207
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,817
You Know, The Different Ways To Make
Money For The Church? You Remember.

208
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:28,288
I Remember, Mrs.
Rafferty, But I Can't Discuss It Now. Excuse Me.

209
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,960
<I>He Bet It On A 7-1 Shot
He Says Is Wired.

210
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,629
He What?

211
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:42,503
Delaney Bet It All On Sundae Treat
To Win In The Third At Aqueduct.

212
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,737
Your Husband
Put It All On--

213
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,878
Your Husband Bet
The Whole $1,206...

214
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,848
<I>On A Horse Race?

215
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,815
<I>How Could He Do
Such A Thing?

216
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,954
He-- Well-- Well--

217
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:05,291
- Where Did He Make The Bet?
- One Of The Bookies Downtown.

218
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,694
Come With Me.

219
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,694
<I>Â™ª A-- â™ª

220
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,575
Jephthah, The Soldier,
Was A Man Of Mighty Valor.

221
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,577
And We Would All Do Very Well To Follow His Example.

222
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,080
<I>Let Us Pray.

223
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:31,317
<I>We Thank Thee, O Lord,
For All Thy Bounties.

224
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,721
- Amen.
- Amen?

225
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:48,602
Well, You Sure Won't Fall Asleep
During One Of His Sermons.

226
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,971
Reverend, What
Are You Gonna Do?

227
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,971
Stop That Bet.

228
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,875
We'll Take The Bike.
It's Faster. Here. Put That On.

229
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,777
Yes, Sir.

230
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,180
Get On, Mrs. Rafferty.

231
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,180
All Right,
I'm Getting On.

232
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:08,655
You All Set?

233
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:08,655
I Think So. Ah!

234
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,730
What's Going On?

235
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,100
Where Is This Bookie?

236
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,100
I Don't Know
Which One He Used.

237
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:26,239
There's More Than One?

238
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:26,239
Lots. Carlucci's Bakery,
The Pet Store On Friar...

239
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,041
And The Orthopedic
Shoe Store.

240
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,041
Ortho--

241
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,846
But I'll Lay You 8-1
He Used Harry, The Hat.

242
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,281
Harry, The Hat?

243
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,281
Right.

244
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,351
<I>Mrs. Rafferty, Hang On!

245
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,057
Pull In Right Here.

246
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,000
There's Harry's Place.

247
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,000
Harry? It Says Sam.
Are You Sure?

248
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,135
I'm Sure. You Better Hurry.
It's Almost Post Time.

249
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,840
Throw 'Em
On The Back Of The Chair.

250
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,411
Are You Harry?

251
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,411
Nope. Sam.

252
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,180
Sam. I Knew It.

253
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,783
What Harry
Did You Want?

254
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,783
Harry. The Hat.

255
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,086
Uh-Huh. In The Back.

256
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,092
- Hold It. Your Pants.
- What?

257
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,429
Pants Pressed While You Wait.
It's Part Of My Deal With Harry.

258
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,998
- Well, All I Wanna Do Is Talk To Him.
- No Exceptions.

259
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,932
Get 'Em Off.

260
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:32,305
Ridiculous. I Have
To Take My Pants Off.

261
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,975
- Here You Are.
- Ah, Better Pay Now While You Still Got The 50 Cents.

262
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,412
Yeah.
In The Pants.

263
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,682
Oh, Yeah.

264
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,724
Oh, You Didn't Get A Vision Or Anything,
Did You, Padre?

265
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,728
Which One Is Harry?

266
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,728
Harry. Oh, That's
Harry Right There.

267
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,199
Uh, Harry.

268
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:05,171
Oh, Don't Worry, Father.
All Our Players Enjoy Complete Anonymity.

269
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,441
It's Reverend.
And I'm Not Concerned About Anonymity.

270
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,910
I'm Concerned About $1,206
Of Our Church's Money...

271
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,813
That A Parishioner
Bet, Here.

272
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,182
So That's Where Delaney
Got That Kind Of Dough.

273
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,418
<I>And You
Want It Back, Right?

274
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,418
Right.

275
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,123
<I>Look, Father,
My Advice Is Let It Ride.

276
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,157
Sundae Treat's
The Horse To Beat.

277
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,360
And At 7-1,
You'd Really Hate Yourself If She Comes In, Right?

278
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,462
All I Want Is
To Get The Money Back.

279
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,462
<I>The Horses Are At The Post.

280
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,865
And They're Off!

281
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,534

<I>Sundae Treat, Bengal Boy. As They Head For The Finish,

296
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,068
<I>They Cross The Wire,
And It's Bengal Boy!

297
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,172
Bengal Boy!

298
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,846
So, Maybe You Can Make
A Comeback In The Next Race.

299
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,247
Guiding Light
Looks Good At Six Furlongs.

300
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,451
I Want That Money Back. And If I Don't Get It,
I Will Go Straight To The Police.

301
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:30,456
We Don't Want Any Trouble. I Mean,
It's Bad For Business. You Know What I Mean?

302
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,959
Hey, Charley.

303
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,959
<I>Yeah?

304
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,528
You Remember The Wad That
Delaney Put On Sundae Treat?

305
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,133
Yeah.

306
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,133
Well, It Turns Out The Dough
Belongs To The Bishop Here.

307
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,468
It Belongs To The North Avenue Presbyterian Church.

308
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:44,403
And It's Reverend.

309
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,374
Well, See If You Can Work Something Out.
Uh, Not Here.

310
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,444
It Turns Out I'm Giving Money Back,
They'll Start A Stampede.

311
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,214
You Know What I Mean?

312
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,481
We'll Take Care
Of It.

313
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,481
All Right.

314
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,819
Let's Step Out Here.

315
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, Open Up!

316
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,540
Hey! Hey, Listen!

317
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:26,245
I'm Gonna Get Every Cent Back--

318
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:26,245
Hey, Mac, Everybody Else
Loses Their Shirts In There.

319
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,352
But, Mother Carlisle, It<I>
Was Brief And To The Point.

320
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:37,390
It Was A Disgrace.
I Have Never Been So--

321
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,235
How Come He Doesn't Have
Any Pants On?

322
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,538
Well, We--
We Don't Know Why.

323
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,207
We-- We Don't Question Why.

324
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,113
Why Don't We? Are We All Supposed To
Pretend He Has Pants On When He Doesn't?

325
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,249
Mm-Hmm. Yes.

326
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,122
Morning. Morning.

327
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,346
It's Hard To Believe This Sort Of Activity's
Taking Place Right Here In The Center Of Town.

328
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,949
Well, This Will Make A Believer Out Of You, Captain.
It's Right Here.

329
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:40,485
It's This Way, Captain.

330
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:40,485
Just A Minute, Reverend.
Are You The Owner Here?

331
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,521
Yes, Sir.

332
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,521
Search Warrant.

333
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,224
It's Right Back Here.

334
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,626
Sam, Would You Mind?

335
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,626
Mind What?

336
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,430
The D--

337
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:56,169
Are You Sure You're In The Right Place,
Reverend Hill?

338
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,637
I'm Sure.

339
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:03,142
And If We'd Come Right Over When I Lodged
The Complaint, You Would've Seen For Yourself.

340
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:06,378
Well, This Is America. You Can't Just
Barge Into A Business And Arrest People...

341
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,448
Because Somebody Said So.

342
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,450
We'd Be Infringing
On Civil Rights.

343
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,552
I Don't Need A Lecture On
Civil Rights From You, Captain.

344
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,123
And I Know Of At Least Three Other
Illegal Gambling Spots In This Same Area.

345
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,625
Well, Give Me Those Addresses.
I'll Get The Necessary Warrants Right Away.

346
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,997
It's Obvious We're Wasting Each Other's Time.
I Have Work To Do.

347
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,766
And I'm Sure You Do Too,
Whatever It Is You Do.

348
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,103
Well, We'll Look Into It Further.
And If We Come Up With Anything, We'll Call You.

349
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,676
As Part Of This Station's
Public Service Programming,

350
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,178
We Invite The Pastors
Of New Campton's Churches...

351
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,781
To Address Us
On "Words To Live By."

352
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,451
This Evening's Message Is Brought
To Us By The Reverend Michael Hill...

353
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,455
<I>Of The North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.

354
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,293
Another Day Is Closing.

355
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:58,197
But Revelation 22 Tells Us
That There Shall Be No Night,

356
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,268
And They Need No Candle,
For The Lord Giveth Them Light.

357
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,570
And I--

358
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,107
And I'm-I'm Sorry.

359
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,109
<I>But There Won't Be
Much Light In New Campton...

360
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,446
If We Don't Face
Another Revelation...

361
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,415
Of More Immediate Concern
To All Of Us.

362
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,618
I-- I've Just Moved
To New Campton,

363
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,354
And My Family And I Were
Delighted With What We Saw.

364
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,423
<I>But It Was
Revealed To Me Today...

365
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,825
That Our Town Is Plagued,

366
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,528
Plagued By Large-Scale
Illegal Gambling.

367
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,230
It Was Made Clear To Me
That This Criminal Element...

368
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:35,400
Works Hand In Glove
With Your Own Police Force.

369
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,502
<I>Hold It. Leave It On.

370
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,502
A Complaint By A Citizen...

371
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,772
Does Not Result
In The Arrest Of The Guilty...

372
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:43,241
<I>But In The Humiliation Of The Citizens
Foolish Enough To Register A Complaint.

373
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,644
<I>If This Condition
Is So Obvious To Me,

374
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:49,149
<I>Then The People Of New Campton
Cannot Possibly Be Ignorant Of It.

375
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,250
<I>Well, It Doesn't Take
An Expert To See...

376
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:54,486
<I>That Large-Scale Gambling Can
Steadily And Systematically...

377
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,489
Drain A Town
Of Its Resources.

378
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,192
The Money That's Gambled And Lost
Here Does Not Recycle In Our Town.

379
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,862
<I>It Funnels Into The Hands
Of Criminals And Crime Bosses.

380
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,699
This Money Is Then Used To Support
Other Forms Of Organized Crime,

381
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,669
Like Bribing City Management And Police Officials.

382
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:15,208
Way To Go, Rev. You Tell 'Em.

383
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:15,208
Tell Em?
He's Askin' For It.

384
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:19,377
If Our Police And Elected Officials
Cannot Or Will Not Rid Our Community...

385
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,514
Of These-- These Parasites,

386
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,783
Then They Should Be Replaced By People Who Will.

387
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,552
Thank You.
And God Bless You.

388
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,855
You Have Just Heard
"Words To Live By"--

389
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,855
<I>Shut It Off.

390
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:36,394
That's The Same Guy,
Mr. Roca.

391
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,798
Maybe I Should've
Given His Dough Back.

392
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,467
- It'll Blow Over.
- So How Long Do I Gotta Stay Closed?

393
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,604
You Can Open Up Tomorrow.

394
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,173
We'll Keep
The Preacher In Line.

395
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,141
Thank You, Mr. Roca.

396
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:01,787
North Avenue Presbyterian Church.
May I Help You?

397
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:04,523
Who Should I Say
Is Calling?

398
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,793
Reverend, It's Another
Threat For You.

399
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:14,767
- Forget It.
- I'm Sorry. He's Not Taking Threats Without Names.

400
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,703
Hello.
Has The Committee Head Meeting Started Yet?

401
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,273
- Uh, Maybe Later.
- These Are For You.

402
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,776
Aren't They Beautiful?

403
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,776
Would You Excuse Us,
Mrs. Porter?

404
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:28,248
We're In The Middle
Of A Meeting.

405
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:28,248
Oh, I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.

406
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,283
Put Them In This Vase.
They're Just Lovely.

407
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,254
All Right, Anne,
Where Were We?

408
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:39,224
It Boggles The Mind That You
Have The Unmitigated Gall...

409
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,663
To Use This Church As-As-As A Soapbox
For Your Self-Serving Ambitions.

410
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,299
Self-Serving?
I Merely Put Out The Word...

411
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,835
That New Campton Is Being
Systematically Ripped Off By Gamblers.

412
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:53,939
- Rubbish.
- Our Own Church Has Lost Over $1,200.

413
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,576
Exactly.
And How Did It Get Lost?

414
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,980
Will Somebody
Answer That, Please?

415
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,980
<I>I'll Get It.

416
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,682
<I>Hello. North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.

417
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,185
Who?

418
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,888
Uh, Just A Minute, Please.

419
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,824
- Dr. Fulton.
- Who Is Dr. Fulton?

420
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,960
The Presbyterian Executive.

421
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,764
Excuse Me, Ladies.
Excuse Me.

422
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,764
Huh?

423
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,600
Please?

424
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,844
Dr. Fulton, What
A Pleasure To Hear From You.

425
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,279
I'll Come Right To The Point,
Reverend Hill.

426
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,585
General Council Feels That Prayer On
Television Is Intended To Be Just That.

427
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,887
It Is Not Intended As A Forum
For Politicking Or Mudslinging.

428
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:46,325
I Assure You, Dr. Fulton,
That Was Not The Talk I Had Prepared.

429
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,527
It Was Just
A Spur-Of-The-Moment Thing,

430
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,762
Prompted By My Experiences
Of Yesterday.

431
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,566
Dr. Fulton, They Have
A Real Problem In This Town.

432
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,902
- Such Matters Are Not Your Concern, Reverend Hill.
- They're Not?

433
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,705
Now, In The Future, We Suggest
You Concentrate Your Efforts...

434
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:03,843
On Revitalizing North Avenue
And Increasing The Membership.

435
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:09,781
Well, I-- I Had Planned To Go Out This
Afternoon And Do That Very Thing.

436
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,318
Uh, Well, If You Don't Drive,
Perhaps Your Son Could Bring You.

437
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,054
We'd Like To See
You Both At Church.

438
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,589
My Son Thinks
You're Some Kind Of A Nut.

439
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,560
Oh.
Well, I Have Some Appointments This Afternoon.

440
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,498
It's Been Nice Talking
To You, Mr. Younger.

441
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,504
<I>I Understand You Were Once One Of
Our Most Active Members, Mrs. Gossin.

442
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:35,607
Well, My Ex Was Kind Of A Jesus Freak,
But When He Split, I Sort Of Lost Interest.

443
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:40,079
- I'm Into Yoga Now. - I Think There's Room
For Both In A Person's Life, Don't You?

444
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,716
Hmm, I Guess.
Got Time For A Drink?

445
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,818
Uh, No, I'm Afraid
I Haven't, Mrs. Gossin.

446
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,555
But I Do Hope
You Can Make It Sunday.

447
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,600
<I>Â™ª

448
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,479
<I>Okay.

449
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,479
Hi, Guys.

450
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,414
Uh, We Gave
At The Office.

451
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,518
No, No, No, No.
I Just Want To Talk To You About Your Music.

452
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,322
- Sure.
- I, Uh-- I Kind Of Have An Idea.

453
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,824
<I>Everybody, I'd Like You To Meet Strawberry Shortcake.

454
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,394
Hi.
- This Is Shorty,

455
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,730
Uh, Billy,
Doodles And Sam.

456
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,432
These Gentlemen Have Kindly
Consented To Serve The Lord...

457
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,135
By Helping Us Kind Of,
Uh, Hype Up The Crowd.

458
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,872
- Hype It Up?
- Yeah, Give It Some Pizzazz,

459
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,874
Attract Some
Of The Younger People.

460
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,143
Younger People?

461
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,447
Our Hymns Have Lasted For Centuries
Without The Benefit Of, Uh, Pizzazz.

462
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:52,785
Well, The Lord Never Asked His
Followers To Be Long-Faced And Doleful.

463
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,021
<I>He Said,
"Happy Are The People Whose God Is The Lord."

464
00:30:56,154 --> 00:31:00,925
- Amen.
- I Think We Ought To Try Something New.

465
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,496
Well, That's Fine,
Reverend Hill.

466
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,965
I Think In That Case, Though,
That I Should Turn Over The Choir...

467
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,735
To Shorty Here
And The Shortcakes.

468
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,538
Uh, Excuse Me.

469
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,858
Hey, Who Is It?

470
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,858
Get
The Window.

471
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,858
Right.

472
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,827
Say, Who's There?

473
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,766
<I>What's Going On Here?

474
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,902
What Do You Want?

475
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,941
Easy, Reverend. Easy.

476
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:54,112
I'm, Uh, Marv Fogelman.
This-- I Got Some I.D. Here Somewhere.

477
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,882
This Is My Partner Here,
Tom, Uh, Voorhees.

478
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,084
We're, Uh--
We're, Uh,

479
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:02,587
<I>Special Investigators For The, Uh,
Treasury Department.

480
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,791
- There It Is.
- Did You Guys Ever Hear Of A Phone?

481
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:11,197
Uh, Thou Shalt Not Use The Telephone
Too Much In Our Business, Reverend.

482
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,168
People Listen.

483
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,168
We Heard About Your
Broadcast, Reverend Hill.

484
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,038
<I>We Thought Maybe You
Could Give Us A Hand.

485
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,038
Doing What?

486
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,674
Breaking Up The Gambling
Organization Here In New Campton.

487
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,913
Ah, Thanks, But, Uh,

488
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,715
This Thing Has Put Me
On Thin Ice Already.

489
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,985
It Could Cost Me My Job.

490
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,954
We Don't Expect You
To Do Nothing.

491
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,721
You're Too Hot To Get Near
A Gambling Joint Now Anyway.

492
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:40,059
We Just Want You To Round Up A Few Men
You Can Trust, And We'll Take It From There.

493
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,529
<I>What Do You Say?
For God And Country?

494
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,502
Mr. Webber,
They Need Men Like You,

495
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:54,207
Men That Are Known In The Community,
To Work With The Treasury Department...

496
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,275
And Then Testify
In Court.

497
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,045
Then Get A Rock Through My Window,
Or Worse.

498
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,182
If We Can Close Them Down, Then People
Won't Have To Be Afraid Of Things Like That.

499
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,118
I'm Sorry.
I've Got Customers.

500
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,594
Reverend, People Gamble.
They Always Have. They Always Will.

501
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,264
I'm Not Talking About A Poker Game On
Saturday Night Or A Day At The Races.

502
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,567
I'm Talking
About Organized Crime.

503
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,635
Have You Tried
Bob Purcell?

504
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,771
Mr. Purcell Plays Golf
With The Chief.

505
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:28,874
He Doesn't Want To Do Anything
To Strain The Relationship.

506
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,144
I Wish I Could Help You.

507
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,915
But It's Not Your Town Anymore.
It's Their Town.

508
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,951
Uh--

509
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,153
Yeah. Mm.

510
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,824
Yes, I Understand.
I Understand, Yeah.

511
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,826
Thanks.
Thanks Anyway. Yeah.

512
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,665
Come In.

513
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,736
Uh, Reverend Hill,
We're All Ready To Leave Now.

514
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,138
The Chairs Are All Folded
And Locked In The Storeroom.

515
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,842
The Newsletters Are All
Stamped And Ready For Mailing.

516
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,046
Oh, I-- I Regret
To Inform You...

517
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,151
That, Uh, The-- The Women's Association
Annual Bean And Salad Supper...

518
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,688
Will Be
A Dollar-Fifty This Year...

519
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,189
Instead
Of The Usual Dollar.

520
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,726
Oh. Oh,
That Is Bad News.

521
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,195
So--

522
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:28,701
Well, Thank You, Claire.
You've All Been A Great Help.

523
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,369
Oh, You're Welcome.
Thank You.

524
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,369
You've All Been Very Helpful.

525
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,173
You've Been Very Gracious.
Thank You.

526
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,275
- Thank You. Good Night.
- Bye.

527
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,312
<I>Good-Bye.

528
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,320
<I>Claire. Claire.

529
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,657
Uh, What Do You Do
In Your Spare Time?

530
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,327
Oh. Well, It's
Just One Mad World.

531
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,329
Take Tonight
For Instance.

532
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:00,298
I'm Going To See <I>Casablanca
For The Eighth Time,

533
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:04,737
And, Uh, Then I'm Going To Dine On A
Peanut Butter And Banana Sandwich,

534
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,905
And Then I Will Hit
The Feathers.

535
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:11,143
It's Like That Every Night,
Just Frantic.

536
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,313
How Would You Like To Spice Up
Your Life A Little?

537
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:18,817
Oh, Need A Secretary For The
Youth Activities Committee?

538
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,252
Meet Me Tomorrow Night
At 9:00.

539
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,990
Nine?

540
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,793
Oh, Sure.

541
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,696
You Know Where I Live?

542
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,200
That's Too Conspicuous.
Make It The Sunday School Room.

543
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,705
The Sunday School--

544
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,705
Yeah, And Make It
The Side Entrance.

545
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,208
Side Entrance.

546
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,800
Oh, Claire,
How Pretty You Look.

547
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,800
Do You Look Beautiful!

548
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,671
<I>Lovely.

549
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,671
Claire.

550
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,441
Ah, Glad You Could
Make It, Claire.

551
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,777
- 'Course You Know All The Girls.
- Of Course. Hi.

552
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,181
Hi.
I'll Get You For This.

553
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,849
Now Will You Explain What
We're All Here For, Reverend?

554
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:31,155
You All Realize That
New Campton Is In Trouble.

555
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,025
<I>There Are Some Men In Town That Need Our Help.

556
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,028
Our Help?

557
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,028
Why Us?

558
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,298
Because I Think You're Game
And Can Keep Your Mouth Shut.

559
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:43,202
Keep Our Mouths Shut?
Let Me Out Of Here.

560
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,172
I'm Expecting--

561
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,173
Sorry.

562
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,242
Excuse Us.

563
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,480
<I>Who Was That?

564
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,480
Just A Minute.

565
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,182
What's With The Broads?

566
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,185
I Talked To Over 20 Men.
No Takers.

567
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,124
<I>They Don't Want
To Make Waves.

568
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,124
So You Got
Ladies Instead, Reverend?

569
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,460
- It's Either Those Ladies Or Nothing.
- You Made The Wrong Choice.

570
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,929
<I>No, I Don't Think So.
At Least Talk To Them.

571
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:15,000
Me, Talk?
Do They Know Why They're Here?

572
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,903
I, Uh, Thought I'd
Let You Handle That.

573
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,903
No, Don't Open The Door.

574
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:23,775
Uh, Ladies, Uh,
These Are The Gentlemen I Told You About.

575
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,311
Oh, How
Do You Do?

576
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,981
Hello.

577
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,981
They Work
For The Government.

578
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:33,952
This Is Marv Fogelman
And Tom... Voorhees.

579
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:33,952
Voorhees.

580
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,324
<I>Uh, What He Means, Uh,

581
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:44,195
We're, Uh, Special Investigators For The, Uh,
Treasury Department.

582
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,197
We're Looking
For People...

583
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:50,469
<I>To Do, Uh, Infiltration
And Undercover Work...

584
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,472
To Help Us Break Up The
Rackets Here In New Campton.

585
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,009
And, Uh,
Your Reverend...

586
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,379
<I>Thinks That You Ladies
Could Hack It.

587
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,385
Have Any
Of You Ladies, Uh,

588
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,953
Ever Made A Bet
With A Bookie?

589
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:17,863
- Ever Played The Numbers?
- No. No, Bingo. We All Play Bingo Friday Nights.

590
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,465
Fridays.

591
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,099
Bingo, Huh?

592
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:26,871
Okay, Um,
Let's Start From Square One. You See,

593
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,610
<I>Uh, You Would Be, Uh,
Expected To, Uh, Go...

594
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:36,581
<I>Into Established Gambling
Joints, See, And Make Bets.

595
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,018
Now, If We Could Get
Two Witnesses...

596
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,621
Or If A Federal Officer Is Present
When You Make The Bet,

597
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,989
We Could Usually
Make It Stick.

598
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,160
Yeah. We Want To Build Airtight
Cases Against As Many As We Can.

599
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,296
Then We Lower
The Boom, See.

600
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,931
If We Close Down Enough Of Them,
Their Bank Dries Up.

601
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,001
Then You Get
Your Town Back.

602
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,070
You Mean To Say They
Even Have A Bank?

603
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:01,874
Well, They Call It
"The Bank" Or "The Office."

604
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,610
<I>It's Where All The Money
And The Bank Slips Go.

605
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,980
The Big Man In This County
Is Max Roca.

606
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,251
Well, Anyhow, That's
The Bones Of It. Uh--

607
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,922
Yeah. Well, Ladies,

608
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,990
What Do You Think?

609
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,262
I'm In.

610
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,597
They Got Their Hooks
Into My Brother-In-Law.

611
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,469
He Can't Quit, And He Can't Get Even.
You Bet I'm In.

612
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:35,340
- If It Keeps Me From Cleaning The Oven, I'm Game.
- I'm Free On Mondays.

613
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,577
<I>I Could Change My Exercise Class To
Wednesday And Take Macrame On Thursday.

614
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,882
I'd Like To Do My Part
For The Government.

615
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,183
However, Do You Have Provisions For Baby-Sitting?

616
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:50,355
Baby-Sitting?
Lady, This Is--

617
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,491
This Is
Tom's Department.

618
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,095
Tom Will Answer
All Your Questions.

619
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,095
Aw, Marv.

620
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,496
Anything You Want--

621
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,601
I'm Delighted To Meet You.
What About Guns?

622
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,536
No. No Guns.

623
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,105
I'd Rather You
Didn't Tell Anybody.

624
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,607
Think About It.

625
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,344
Who Would Suspect A Bunch
Of Ding-A-Ling Dames?

626
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,146
After All,
It's Your Home, Howard.

627
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,215
We Can Put A Cot
In Your Room.

628
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:53,318
It's Foolish To Be Buying A House When
You Don't Know If It's Going To Work Out.

629
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,519
It'll Work Out
Just Fine, Mother.

630
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,356
<I>Jane-- Jane's
A Wonderful Girl.

631
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,394
Then What's She Doing
Going... In There?

632
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,235
How's Tricks?

633
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,235
Huh?

634
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,269
How's Tricks?

635
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:16,173
Oh. Fine.

636
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,777
Um, I'll Have
A Margarita.

637
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,380
One Margarita
Coming Up.

638
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:26,018
Uh, Bartender, Uh,
Put That On My Tab.

639
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,619
Well, Thank You.

640
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,322
My Pleasure.

641
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,322
Aren't You Sweet?

642
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,425
How Am I Doing?

643
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:36,762
You Live In, Uh,
New Campton?

644
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:36,762
Oh, All My Life.

645
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,764
You From Out Of Town?

646
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,764
Minneapolis.

647
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,134
We Put Out A Line Of Gaskets For Diesel Engines.

648
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,202
Isn't That Exciting?

649
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,571
Let's Not Overdo It.

650
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,571
Oh.

651
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,208
Um, Today's My Birthday.

652
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,313
I'm 28 Years Old.

653
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,313
Congratulations.

654
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,682
- Thank You.<I>
- Here You Are. One Margarita.

655
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,784
Thank You Very Much.

656
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,254
Oh, Um, I'm Sorry.
Excuse Me.

657
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,256
<I>I, Uh,
Want To Buy A Number.

658
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,527
I Want To Put, Uh,
Ten Bucks On Number 281.

659
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,730
That's One To Grow On.

660
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,365
Ten Bucks On 28--

661
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,365
Jane!

662
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:18,403
- Howard!
- What Are You Doing In Here?

663
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,075
Uh, I Was, Uh--
Having A Little Refreshment.

664
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,777
Oh, Is That What
They Call It These Days?

665
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,813
Ask Her Who
The Man Is, Howard.

666
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,813
Who Is--

667
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:31,248
- Howard, I'll Call You Later.
- Ask Her Who The Man Is, Howard.

668
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,452
- Who Is--
- Howard, I'll Call You Later.

669
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:39,423
- Who Is That Man?
- It's Just A Guy.

670
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,126
He Bought Me A Drink.
Is That A Crime?

671
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,529
I Told You She Wasn't Right
For You In The First Place.

672
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,535
Yes, Mother.
Maybe-- Maybe We Should Think It Over, Jane.

673
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,072
- Mm-Hmm.<I>
- I'll Call The Church And Talk To Reverend--

674
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,273
No!

675
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,273
Oh, Howard.
Oh, Why--

676
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,443
I'm So Sorry.

677
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,443
Oh, Howard, My Baby.
Take Your Hands Off Him.

678
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,179
<I>Howie!

679
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,179
<I>I'm So Sorry.

680
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:05,818
Why Did
You Do That?

681
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:05,818
You Brute!

682
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,720
Howard, Howard, I Can
Explain Everything.

683
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:13,725
I'll Explain It All.
I Can Explain It, Howard.

684
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:13,725
And She Hit Me.

685
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:18,295
<I>What Do You Mean You Can Explain?
You Know What Kind Of A Person You Are?

686
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:25,237
I've Always Wanted
To Do Something Like This.

687
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,840
Something That Would Be
Interesting, Challenging...

688
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,275
And At The Same Time,
A Public Service.

689
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,278
You Know
What I Mean, Tom?

690
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,715
Yes, Ma'am.
There's Bootsie's Place.

691
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,583
Ooh, That's, Uh--

692
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,153
This Is It.

693
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,153
That's Right.

694
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:46,925
Wait A Minute. What Do I Say?
What Do I Say? What Is It? Tell Me Again.

695
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,528
When The Guy Comes Up, You Just Say,
"I Want Tickets On These Numbers."

696
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,463
I Want Tickets On These Numbers.

697
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,463
It Doesn't Matter
What The Combinations Are...

698
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,166
But No More Than Three Numbers In Any One Group.

699
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,602
When I Come In, I Say I Want
Tickets On These Combinations...

700
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,602
I Want A Ticket.

701
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,639
Of Groups Of--

702
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,639
Why Don't You Just Read It
Off The List I Gave You?

703
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,576
Oh, The List. The List.

704
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:17,722
<I>Can I Help You?
I Have A Special On "Chrysanthenums."

705
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:23,427
I Want To Bet A Hundred Groups
On These Tickets Of Three.

706
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,731
- What?
- Ah, Oh--

707
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,568
Oh-- Uh-- Ah--

708
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:34,673
It's All Right.
I Got It.

709
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:34,673
Ah, I Want--

710
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:39,678
I Want To Bet A Hundred Tickets
On This Three Group Combination.

711
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,679
My-- My Wife's
A Little Nervous,

712
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:44,583
Because If She Wins,
We're Going On Our Second Honeymoon.

713
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,550
Oh, Yeah. We're--

714
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,387
A Hundred Dollars
On These Numbers. Here.

715
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,387
A Hundred Dollars. Wait.

716
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,192
<I>Here.

717
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,192
I'll Get Your Copy.

718
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,795
How Did I Do?

719
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,966
I've, Uh, Never
Seen Anything To Top It.

720
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:05,769
Oh. Uh, If You Lose, Does The Treasury
Department Give You Back Your Money?

721
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:11,242
I Thought So.
Here's Your Order, Lady.

722
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:11,242
Oh--

723
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:15,780
And Next Time Take Your
Business Someplace Else.

724
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,702
Did You Have To Wear That?
We Look Like The Bobsey Twins.

725
00:45:38,835 --> 00:45:40,971
Or Triplets.

726
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,278
- Did You Make The Bet Yet?
- Shh.

727
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:49,347
You Got It.

728
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,719
I Got A Tape Recorder.

729
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,888
Is It On?

730
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,888
No.

731
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,290
<I>Why Don't You Put It On
So That It'll Be Running...

732
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:03,394
When We Make The Bet.

733
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:03,394
Good Idea.

734
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,864
<I>Not That Way. That's Reverse.

735
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,668
What'll It Be?

736
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,903
Uh, Coffee.

737
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,903
Coffee.

738
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,903
Figures.

739
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,739
And A Fiver On 268.

740
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:20,311
<I>My Horoscope Says That Even Numbers
Are Going To Be Very Lucky For Me Today.

741
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,780
Fin. 268.

742
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,849
- Did You Get It? - I Think So.
- You Better Make Sure.

743
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,021
<I>- Â™ª
- Shh.

744
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:35,326
Â™ª Oh, Roll Out The Barrel â™ª

745
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,563
<I>â™ª We'll Have
A Barrel Of Fun â™ª

746
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,565
Yippee!

747
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:44,101
Â™ª Roll Out The Barrel â™ª

748
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:48,940
â™ª We've Got The Blues
On The Run â™ª

749
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,911
- â™ª Sing Boom Ta Rar Ra â™ª
- Get Outta Here!

750
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,847
Â™ª Ring Out
A Song Of Good Cheer â™ª

751
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,751
â™ª Now's The Time
To Roll The Barrel â™ª

752
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:03,822
â™ª For The Gang's
All Here â™ª

753
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,791
â™ª Ba Da Da Da
Ba Da Da Da â™ª

754
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,827
Delaney Told Me
It Was A Blank Tape.

755
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,097
Mrs. Rafferty,
We're Fortunate We're Not Dead.

756
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,467
After All,
We Don't Even Look Like The Andrews Sisters.

757
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,902
Ladies!

758
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:20,438
Ladies!

759
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:23,440
Look, There Is No Point
In Rehashing It.

760
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,477
We Blew It,
All The Way Down The Line.

761
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:29,447
It Is Over, Done With.
It Was A Crazy Idea.

762
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,884
Not Your Fault.
I Accept Full Responsibility.

763
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,019
Yeah, Well,
I'm Sure We'll Handle It Better Next Time.

764
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,489
We Will. We'll Handle
It Better Next Time.

765
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,857
<I>Next Time?
What Next Time?

766
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:43,094
The Way They Fixed It,
Serpico Couldn't Get In One Of Those Joints.

767
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,829
Well, What About In A Couple Of
Weeks When Things Cool Down?

768
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:49,000
Couple Of Weeks.
They Won't Even Know Us In A Couple Of Weeks.

769
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,436
Thanks, But No Thanks.

770
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,973
Hey, Just Because We Made A Couple Of Goofs,
You're Not Gonna Bench Us.

771
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,976
We're Not Out
Of The Ball Game Yet.

772
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,976
I Agree.

773
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:02,914
Frankly, I'd Like
To Stick It To 'Em Good.

774
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:06,718
What Did You Have
In Mind, Tiger?

775
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:06,718
Well, I Don't Know.

776
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:09,086
I Have An Idea.

777
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:12,590
Uh, Why Don't We Go After That
Bank You Told Us About? Yes?

778
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,760
You Said If They Dried Up The Bank,
They'd Go Out Of Town.

779
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,829
Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa.

780
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:21,532
Now, Look, You're A Gung Ho Bunch Of Dames.
I Like That.

781
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,736
But It Takes Professionals Years To Find A Bank,
If They're Lucky.

782
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:30,040
<I>There Is No Way That Five
Inexperienced Ladies--

783
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:30,040
Oh!

784
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,577
Capable As You Are-- Are Gonna Find Their Bank.

785
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,614
Why Not?
Who'd Ever Suspect Us Of Following Them?

786
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,651
Following Them?

787
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:43,021
Lady, When Those Pickup Men
Are Carrying Slips And Money,

788
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,456
They're Checking
For Tails All The Way.

789
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,891
I Mean, You Would Need
Your Expert Drivers,

790
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,928
You Would Need
Your Code Names,

791
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,663
You Would Need Your
Radio-Equipped Cars For Switch-Offs.

792
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,599
We Got The Drivers.
We Got The Cars.

793
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:58,536
First Of All, My Department Would Never Spring For It.
So Forget It.

794
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:02,673
<I>I Will Spring For The Radios,
If You All Would Like To Use Them.

795
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,741
Claire, That's Terrific.

796
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,913
So?

797
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,913
Yeah.

798
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,913
<I>How About It?

799
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:12,616
- Marv, Give Us A Chance.
- Why Not?

800
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,856
I Don't Know.
It's Like Chicken Soup.

801
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:22,693
It Won't Do Any Good,
But It Couldn't Hurt.

802
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,531
I Guess!

803
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,738
This Is Home Plate
Calling All Units.

804
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,878
Hold It! Hold It!

805
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:43,615
I Told Youse, You Can
Only Talk One At A Time.

806
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,585
Uh, Phantom Fox.

807
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,956
Uh, Max And I Are Watching Freddie, Uh,
Two Fingers Snooker Parlor, And, Uh,

808
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,927
I Expect To Be Murdered
Any Minute.

809
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:01,231
If That Should Happen,
Would Somebody Please Contact Alfredo?

810
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,268
He Does My Hair.

811
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,971
Ten-Four.

812
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,971
Five Dames
Ain't Ever Gonna Find No Bank.

813
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,606
We'll Be Lucky If They Don't Get Us All Killed.

814
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,176
If You Want Me Honest Opinion,
It's A Wild-Duck Chase.

815
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,746
Who-- Who--
Who Is That?

816
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,950
It Sounds Like Delaney Rafferty.
Blarney Stone,

817
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:23,288
The Whole Idea Is That They'd Be Less
Suspicious With Women Following Them.

818
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,824
I Know. I Know.
But I Can't Drive, Reverend.

819
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:29,927
And You'll Never
Recognize Delaney.

820
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,062
Don't Use My Name,
I Told Ya.

821
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,065
If It Got Out
What I Was Doing,

822
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,902
I'd Be Spending The Night In The River,
That's What. Them Guys Play For Keeps.

823
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,605
<I>Today's Cooking Corner Recipe
Is A Fantasy All Of Us Know.

824
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,577
<I>It's Called
Fairy Queen Pudding. Mmm.

825
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,745
<I>First You Prepare
Four Egg Whites.

826
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,286
<I>June Bride.

827
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,625
There's A Man Leaving Big Chin's With A Paper Bag.

828
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,963
This Could Be The Pickup Man.
Describe The Suspect, Please.

829
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,798
Brown Pants
And A Blue Jacket...

830
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,034
<I>With Red And White Stripes
Down The Sleeves.

831
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,137
<I>I Think
It's A Polyester.

832
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,606
June Bride,
What Is He Doing Now?

833
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,141
I Don't Know.
He's Gone. He Drove Off.

834
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,179
<I>Follow Him!

835
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,179
All Right.
Don't Shout.

836
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:25,916
Of All The Dumb, Stupid Broads!
My Acid Is Flowing.

837
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,121
<I>June Bride, Uh,
Could You Describe The Car?

838
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,760
Yes. It Was Olive Green.

839
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,963
No, Maybe It Was
More Avocado.

840
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:43,166
Well, It Was Lighter Than A Forest
Green But Not As Bright As Kelly Green.

841
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:45,836
I Think We Better Stick
With Avocado.

842
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:49,907
Try To Locate The Car,
And Hurry!

843
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:49,907
Please.

844
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,976
<I>Please.

845
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,012
<I>I See Him.
He's Driving A Plymouth.

846
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,750
He's On Lexington.

847
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,750
Okay, Okay. Beautiful.
That's Good.

848
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,652
- Which Way On Lexington?
- Towards That New Boutique.

849
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,021
She's Trying
To Kill Me.

850
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,021
I Think She Means East.

851
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,224
<I>I'm Getting Stopped By A Red Light.
Am I Allowed To Run It?

852
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:12,195
<I>No, No. Stop.
- Marv, Kiddie Car Could Probably Pick Him Up.

853
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:15,365
Kiddie Car, Come In.
Please!

854
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:19,703
Oh. Um-- Um, Hello.

855
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,773
Uh, Excuse Me.

856
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:25,043
All Right, All Right, Toby,
Give Betty Back Her Creepy Crawlers.

857
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:27,711
Toby, They're
Her Creepy Crawlers.

858
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,681
Hold The Line.

859
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:33,985
Toby, You Have Your Ray Gun.
You Don't Need Her Creepy Crawlers.

860
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:39,123
Marvin, Will You Tell Toby To Give
Betty Back Her Creepy Crawlers.

861
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:44,328
I Will, If You'll Go To Lexington And
Look For A Green Plymouth, And Hurry.

862
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,898
I Can't. I'm Not
Anywhere Near There.

863
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:48,465
You're Supposed To Be.

864
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:53,070
I Was,
But I Forgot Today Was My Day To Pick Up The Cobras.

865
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,372
- Pick Up What?
- The Cobras.

866
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,808
They're Six And Two
On The Season.

867
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,746
If They Take The Tigers,
They're A Cinch For The Play-Offs.

868
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,750
<I>How Long Will It Take You To Get
To Lexington And High Street?

869
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,818
We Can Leave...

870
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,056
Just As Soon As The Shortstop
Gets Out Of The Boys Room.

871
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,224
Tell Them All To Go Home.
Forget It. It's All Over.

872
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:18,730
Listen, Marv, If He Stays East On Lexington,
Clunker Could Pick Him Up.

873
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,198
Clunker?

874
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,469
Have We
Had That One Yet?

875
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,469
Not Yet.

876
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,909
- Clunker, Are You There?
- Ready To Go.

877
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,912
Good.

878
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:40,318
- Could You Go To Lexington And Look
For A Green Plymouth? - On My Way.

879
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,287
She's Going.

880
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,459
Come On,
You Rare Beauty.

881
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:54,833
<I>Clunker, The Driver Is Wearing A Blue
Jacket With Red And White Stripes.

882
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,970
Gotcha.
Come On, Baby.

883
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,805
We Gotta Take A Hike.

884
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,216
Gotta Help Auntie Cleo.
That's A Precious Lamb.

885
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:15,018
Yes, Indeed.
Good Boy. Good Boy. Good Boy.

886
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:17,388
Yes, Yes, Yes.
Here You Are. Here You Are.

887
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,858
This Your Car?

888
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,858
No, Sir. It Belongs
To Classic Used Cars.

889
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,462
My Husband Works There.

890
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,462
I See. Uh, Didn't You
See The Sign?

891
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:29,200
<I>Oh, Boy.

892
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:29,200
<I>May I See Your
Operator's License, Please?

893
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:33,538
Here You Are, Sir.

894
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:33,538
Thank You.

895
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,952
Watch It, Lady.
Watch It. Watch It.

896
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,428
I Got Him.

897
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,428
Good.

898
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,496
He's Not On Lexington.
He's On King Street.

899
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,101
I'm Right Beside Him.

900
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,101
Does He Still Have
The Bag, Clunker?

901
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,842
<I>Clunker, Does He Still
Have The Bag? Answer.

902
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,577
<I>Clunker, Answer.

903
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,980
I Can't See.

904
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:20,984
- Go To Sleep For Mama. Nice Baby.<I>
- What's With "Go To Sleep"?

905
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,920
<I>Can You At Least Get
The License Number?

906
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:27,358
- Hey, You, Lady!<I>
- Clunker, What Are You Doing?

907
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:30,061
<I>Will You Give Us
The License Number?

908
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:33,396
Now, You Listen To Me.
You Keep Quiet Till I Tell You, You Hear?

909
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:37,367
Or You'll Wish You Had.

910
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:37,367
That's No Way
To Talk To That Infant.

911
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,470
Butt Out, Lady.

912
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,372
<I>Hey! Hey!

913
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,378
Hey, Lady,
I Could Cite You For Evading Arrest.

914
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,582
And If That Piece Of Junk
Isn't Moved In Five Minutes,

915
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,619
I'm Gonna Have It
Towed Away And Impounded.

916
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:56,988
You Got Yourself A Deal.

917
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:07,063
I Lost Him For A Moment,
Home Plate, But I Got Him Now.

918
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:11,369
He's Coming Out Of A Market,
And He's Driving North On Crown Street.

919
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,205
- Good. Stay With Him.
- Can't Do It, Home Plate.

920
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,407
I'm Out Of Gas.

921
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,110
- What?
- Give It To Phantom Fox.

922
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,113
<I>Phantom Fox,
He's Coming Your Way. Move Out.

923
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,653
With Pleasure.

924
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,549
Got Him, Home Plate.
He Stopped At The Park.

925
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,586
<I>He's Heading Toward A Man
On A Picnic Table.

926
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,956
He's Sitting
At The Picnic Table.

927
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:08,492
Watch Him, Phantom Fox.
Every Move.

928
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:13,297
He Has A Bag. He's Reaching
Inside The Bag.

929
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,067
He's Taking Out A... Sandwich.

930
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:24,208
He Threw The Bag Away
In The-- In The Garbage.

931
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,050
<I>Mr. Martin, Please.

932
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,353
<I>Check Okay
On Register Number Six.

933
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,355
Hi, Mom!

934
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,355
Hi! Hi!

935
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,523
Hi.

936
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,523
Why Are You Buying
So Much Cheerios?

937
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:43,360
I'm Not.
What Do You Know About Shopping?

938
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,396
Go-- Go Find
Your Little Sister.

939
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,465
Can We Get
Some Ice Cream?

940
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:51,469
Ah, Yes. Don't
Bother Mommy Now.

941
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:51,469
Thanks, Mom!

942
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,403
Excuse Me.

943
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,216
He's Still At
The Magazine Stand.

944
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:08,052
<I>Just Be Patient.
This Is Where We Blew It Yesterday.

945
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,356
He Keeps Checking His Watch
And Looking Out The Window.

946
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,527
The Other Guy Must Be Late.
Keep Watching Him!

947
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,270
There's Another Man Who
Came In With A Paper Bag.

948
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,240
This Could Be A Pass.
Everybody Stay Awake.

949
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:43,586
They Did It. They Did It.
They Switched Bags. They're Leaving.

950
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,623
Okay.
Follow Him.

951
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,526
- Follow Him? Which One?
- The One With The Bag!

952
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,763
- They Both Have Bags.
- The Newer One With The Old Bag.

953
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,831
Oh, Uh, Yes.
He's On His Way Out The Door,

954
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,499
<I>And He Has
A Plaid Shirt On.

955
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,537
<I>I See Him!

956
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,106
<I>Subject Is A Male Caucasian
About, I Don't Know, 5'8,

957
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,108
<I>Sandy Hair And A Little
Paunchy.

958
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:06,376
He's Getting Into
A Little White Car.

959
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:11,214
All Units, Plan "A."
Look For A Little, Uh, White Car.

960
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:51,255
He's Turning Right On Danny.
Danny Avenue.

961
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:53,523
<I>Stay With Him.
Stay With Him.

962
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:05,135
- He's Speeding Up, Home Plate.
- You're Burned. You're Burned. Peel Off!

963
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,471
<I>Peel Off!
Peel Off!

964
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,641
<I>Who's Got Him?
Who's Got Him?

965
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,576
Not I, Home Plate.
I Peeled Off As Instructed.

966
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,378
Not Me.
I Peeled Off.

967
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,714
<I>We Did Like You Told Us.

968
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,714
<I>Me Too!

969
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,418
<I>I Just Peeled Off.

970
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,418
They All Peeled Off?

971
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,457
I Got Him!
I Got Him!

972
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:30,594
Break For Phantom Fox.
Suspect In View.

973
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,331
<I>Rear View.

974
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,331
<I>Phantom Fox,
Where Are You Located?

975
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,302
I'm On-- I'm On 4th Street.
He's Right Behind Me.

976
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,271
All Right, Now.
Now, Listen.

977
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,307
Listen, Slow Down,
Let Him Pass You And Stay With Him.

978
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:49,547
He's Turn-- He Turned Down The Alley,
Down On Jefferson.

979
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,250
That's All Right.
Turn Around And Go Back.

980
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,418
She Can't Turn, Marv.
That's A One-Way Street.

981
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:57,188
Phantom Fox, We'll Give You Instructions.
You Can't Turn.

982
01:00:57,288 --> 01:01:00,391
I Can't Back Up Either.
Well, I'll Try.

983
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,581
<I>There He Is, Down The Alley.
I'll Double Back.

984
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:28,519
<I>All Right, That's Good,
But Do Not Get Too Close.

985
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:30,855
<I>Do Not Get Too Close.

986
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,594
I'm Terribly Sorry.
Are You All Right?

987
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,795
Look What You Did.
Are You Crazy, Lady?

988
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:41,332
<I>Phantom Fox, What's Happening?

989
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:43,967
<I>Here, Let Me Have That Thing.

990
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:48,239
<I>Phantom Fox, If You've Lost Him,
Return To North Avenue For Further--

991
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:52,610
Don't Say North Avenue On The Thing!
They'll Hear You!

992
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:58,481
I Never Could Stand
That Show.

993
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:09,326
The Doctor Said Complete Rest
And Quiet For A Few Days,

994
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,328
But You Can Talk To Him.

995
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,771
Hi, Marv.
How Are You Feeling?

996
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,771
Wonderful.

997
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:25,943
Marv, The Girls And I
Were Talking.

998
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:28,579
<I>And, Uh, Well,

999
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,481
<I>They'd Like To Take
Another Shot At It.

1000
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:34,718
Reverend, We Shot At It...
Three Times.

1001
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,722
Each Time,
It Was A Fiasco.

1002
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:41,658
My Stomach Isn't Up To It.

1003
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:45,362
Claire Said She'd Get A Radio
For My Office At The Church.

1004
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,664
It's Her Money.
Get Two.

1005
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:52,635
Then I'll Tell Them
It's Okay To Continue?

1006
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,504
Tell Them Anything You Want,

1007
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,840
As Long As I Don't Have
To Hear It Or Be There.

1008
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,446
Thanks, Marv.
Hope You Feel Better.

1009
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,114
I'll Be In Touch.

1010
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,114
Don't Bother.

1011
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,922
<I>Mike, He's Doing
Just As You Said, Home Plate.

1012
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,590
<I>He's Coming Back
On Raymond.

1013
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:18,494
<I>He's Stopping.
He's Making A Pass...

1014
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,664
<I>To A White Cable Tv Van.

1015
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,467
<I>He Could Be The Collector.

1016
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,869
<I>Let The Car Go.
Stay With The Van.

1017
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,846
He's Leaving,
And I'm Right Behind Him.

1018
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:40,016
Now, This Can't Take
Very Long, Home Plate.

1019
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,419
It's Karate Day,
The Girls Are Having A Recital,

1020
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:44,889
I'm Having A Tupperware Party
In A Half Hour.

1021
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,424
<I>He's Turning Left--
Left On Victory.

1022
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:52,596
Bruno, Out Of The-- What'll I Do?
Bruno! Bruno!

1023
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,931
<I>Let Him Go.
Blarney Stone, You're Near.

1024
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,367
That's Us!
Get Going!

1025
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,003
It'll Take At Least
Ten Minutes From Here.

1026
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,003
Oh, No, It Won't.

1027
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:04,974
If Ya Can't Drive,
Don't Be Touchin' The Wheel!

1028
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,810
We're Takin'
A Little Shortcut.

1029
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,581
<I>Blarney Stone, Where Is He?
Do You Copy?

1030
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,983
<I>Blarney Stone,
Have You Spotted Him?

1031
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,855
- Where Are You?
- Don't Ask!

1032
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:22,026
<I>Get Off The Track!

1033
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,394
Don't Yell At Me!

1034
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,394
Who Do You Think
You Are?

1035
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,001
All Units, We Lost Him.
Come On In. Home Plate Out.

1036
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,001
What Is This?

1037
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,003
What Are You Doing?
Are You A Minister Or Batman?

1038
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,472
Look At This.
You've Turned This Into A War Room.

1039
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,472
Anne--

1040
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,908
Sit Down. Sit Down.
I've Got Something To Tell You.

1041
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,908
I Didn't Mind About The--

1042
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,577
Please, Sit Down.

1043
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,980
The Treasury Department
Asked Me To Help Them.

1044
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,182
<I>The Treasury Department?

1045
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,487
They Came To Me.
They Need Us.

1046
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,487
Why?

1047
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,856
Chasing Criminals Has Nothing
To Do With You Or North Avenue.

1048
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:54,858
The Police Are Paid
To Do That.

1049
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,793
Oh, The Police.
In This Town?

1050
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,793
Yes.

1051
01:04:56,827 --> 01:05:00,464
Anne, You Said It Yourself.
Somebody Has To Do It.

1052
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,865
If The Church Is Not
A Moral Force In The Community,

1053
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:06,103
Then It's Just Another Building With
Stained Glass Windows And A Steeple.

1054
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:09,572
But You Are Meddling In Something
Dangerous With All This.

1055
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,575
I Think The Only Thing You're
Gonna Accomplish In The End...

1056
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,577
Is-Is Harm To The Church.

1057
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,746
Yes, But They're Actually
Making Headway.

1058
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:19,482
Those Women, In Their Own Crazy Way,
Are Giving The Mob Fits.

1059
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,985
If We Can Just Hang In There,
We Can Put A Crimp In Their Operation,

1060
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,021
Maybe Stop It Altogether.

1061
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:26,757
We Get Closer Every Day.
Today, I Think We Found The Collector.

1062
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:29,592
You're All Risking
Your Lives--

1063
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,595
Well, That-That's It.

1064
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:35,666
I'll Have No Part Of Any Of That.
I Resign As Your Secretary.

1065
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,869
And I'm Going To Go To The Executive
Committee And Tell Them Why.

1066
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:41,137
- Anne.
- What?

1067
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,507
I Do Understand
How You Feel,

1068
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,478
But I Don't Know
What Else To Do.

1069
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,547
Give It Up.

<I>Mm-Hmm.

1103
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:03,113
For Happy Are The People...

1104
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,849

01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,849
<I>Amen!

1106
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:09,152
What Are They Trying To Do?

1107
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:09,152
Find The Bank,
Close Us Down.

1108
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:12,288
Do They All Work For Hill?

1109
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:12,288
One Of 'Em We Know
Goes To His Church.

1110
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:15,626
Hill Isn't An Ordinary Guy
Off The Streets.

1111
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:17,760
We Hit Him,
The Papers Get In On It,

1112
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,762
The Cops Have To Do
A Number.

1113
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,664
Well, They're Slowin' Up
The Work, Sir,

1114
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,002
And Things Are Gonna Get Worse
If We Don't Do Somethin'.

1115
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,304
Okay. Lean On 'Em.

1116
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,789
I'm Awake.

1117
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,924
Yeah?

1118
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:51,194
Hey.

1119
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:53,764
What's All That About?

1120
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,201
Did Miss Woods
Mean What She Said?

1121
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:01,038
Well, She Strikes Me As
The Kind Of Person That Does.

1122
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,240
I Mean...

1123
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:06,276
Are You Really Gonna
Lose Your Job?

1124
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,445
Oh.

1125
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,649
Well, I Certainly Hope Not.

1126
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:19,355
Dad, Why Don't You Give It Up?
It's Not Your Business.

1127
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,792
Sayeth Carmel.

1128
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:26,697
Why Can't You Just Be
A Minister And A Daddy?

1129
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:32,670
Oh, Honey, That's--

1130
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:35,239
That's What I'm Trying To Be.

1131
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,261
Help!
Oh, Help, Somebody!

1132
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,364
Call The Fire Department!

1133
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:03,899
Help!

1134
01:10:03,932 --> 01:10:06,435
Carmel,
Call The Fire Department!

1135
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:09,773
Are You All Right?

1136
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:09,773
Yes!
Call The Fire Department!

1137
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,241
Hank, Come Here!
Help Me With The Fire Hose!

1138
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,951
Turn It On!

1139
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:33,329
Hey, You,
Would You Help Here A Minute?

1140
01:10:33,363 --> 01:10:35,332
The Rest Of You, Get Back!

1141
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:06,362
I Had No Idea...

1142
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,867
They'd Do This.

1143
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,408
I'm Sorry, Anne.

1144
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,319
It Would Help
If You'd Say Something.

1145
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,220
Anything.

1146
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:37,895
I, Uh--

1147
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:41,864
I Was So Wrong.

1148
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,502
So Wrong.

1149
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:52,509
Mike, Um--

1150
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,383
I...

1151
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:02,051
Wanna Fight Them With You.

1152
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:31,949
<I>Rookie?

1153
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,650
<I>Rookie, What's Happening?

1154
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,921
Lost Him, Home Plate.
Sorry, Mike.

1155
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,296
Yuck!
Whose Chili Dog Is This?

1156
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,399
I Got Him, I Got Him.
I'm Right Behind Him.

1157
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,501
<I>Good, Phantom Fox.
Stay With Him, Stay With Him.

1158
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,673
You Dummy!
What Do You Think You're--

1159
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,977
Watch Out!

1160
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,349
<I>Phantom Fox, What's Going On?

1161
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,921
I Got Cut Off
At The Pass.

1162
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,291
Get Closer!
Watch Out For That Car!

1163
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,259
Take Your Hands
Off The Wheel!

1164
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:20,096
There's A Lady!
Look Out!

1165
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:22,164
Look What You Did!

1166
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,134
<I>I'm Trying To Stay With Him,
Home Plate,

1167
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,136
But He's Really Moving!

1168
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,072
<I>Be Careful, June Bride.
Be Careful.

1169
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:37,247
Are You All Right,
June Bride?

1170
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:40,650
Yes, But I Don't Know What
Howard's Gonna Say About His Car.

1171
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,021
We're Turning On Klump Street,
And I'm On His Tail.

1172
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,123
<I>Good Going, Rookie.
Hang In There.

1173
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,603
Yahoo!
Not This Time.

1174
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,498
<I>Where Could He Have Gone To?

1175
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,634
I Don't Know,
But I'm Having Trouble With My Radio Again.

1176
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,669
I'm Coming In.

1177
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:11,240
When We Don't Pay The Winners Off On Time,
They Get Nervous.

1178
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:15,145
They Think Something's Wrong.
Business Falls Off. We Don't Want That.

1179
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,479
They Got Stakeouts
On Every Road.

1180
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:21,283
I Lose One, I Look Back,
There's Another One Comin'.

1181
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:23,286
They Ain't As Easy To Shake
As They Used To Be.

1182
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:27,024
A Bunch Of Church Ladies?
I'm Not Gonna Let A Preacher...

1183
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,092
And Some Ding-A-Ling Dames
Ruin Our Business.

1184
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,163
They Get Too Close
To This Place, Hit 'Em.

1185
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,465
Yes, Sir.

1186
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,507
Every Time The Collector
Has Shaken Us,

1187
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,510
It's Been In Here.

1188
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,412
Then The Bank
Must Be In There.

1189
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,680
Probably, But It's Still
A Very Big Area.

1190
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,817
It Sure Is.

1191
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,817
Well, He Just Plain
Outdrives Us.

1192
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,756
Not Necessarily.

1193
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,756
I Don't Know What He Fuels
That Crate With.

1194
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,659
Now, He's Obviously Got Something
Bigger Than A Stock Engine Under There.

1195
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:06,063
You Can Say That Again.

1196
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:06,063
That's Right.

1197
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,802
"Dear Reverend Hill,
The General Council...

1198
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,538
"Has Voted Not To Rebuild
North Avenue.

1199
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:20,143
North Avenue Has Served Its
Purpose And Will Be Dissolved."

1200
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,445
Well--

1201
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,445
Dissolved.

1202
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:26,615
Well, We'll Appeal That.
I'll-I'll Call The Presbytery Myself.

1203
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,422
"Further, It Is The Intention
Of The General Council...

1204
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:37,761
"To Declare The Pulpit
Of North Avenue Vacant.

1205
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,896
<I>"Dr. Rheems And Reverend
Wainwright Will Be Joining Me...

1206
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,133
<I>"For The Disposition
Of The Real Estate.

1207
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:47,170
Sincerely Yours, Victor A.
Fulton, Presbytery Executive."

1208
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,873
Oh, Mike,
I'm So Sorry.

1209
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,442
<I>What Exactly Does That Mean,
"Declare The Pulpit Vacant"?

1210
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,480
It Means He's Fired.

1211
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,385
It Means I've-I've...

1212
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,387
Cost You Your Church.

1213
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,533
<I>Â™ª

1214
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,735
We Certainly Have Lovely
Weather For You Folks.

1215
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:23,206
Unfortunately, We're Not Here
To Enjoy The Weather.

1216
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,274
Has Dr. Fulton Arrived?

1217
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,145
Oh, Yes.
He's With Reverend Hill Right Now.

1218
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,518
There's Certainly A Lot
Of Static On Your Radio.

1219
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:37,454
Yeah.

1220
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,960
Oh!

1221
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,596
Mike?

1222
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:50,533
<I>Mike, Answer!
Answer!

1223
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:54,269
Glen Park Church Is Over
Five Miles From Here, And--

1224
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,338
What's That Beeping Noise?

1225
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,742
Oh-- Oh, That's A Radio
I Use For Emergencies.

1226
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:03,912
And, You Know, Transportation Will Be A Real
Problem For Some Of Our Older Members.

1227
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:07,216
Hadn't You Better
Answer That?

1228
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:07,216
I-I-- Oh, Sure.

1229
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,260
Reverend Hill Speaking.

1230
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,730
Mike, Hi. I Think
I Found The Missing Link.

1231
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:23,966
<I>I'm Tailing A Camper
South On Airport.

1232
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,471
Uh, Could We Discuss This At A More Propitious Time?
I'm In Conference Just Now.

1233
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:31,373
No, This Won't Wait!

1234
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:34,344
I'm Positive This Is The Collection
Van Disguised As A Camper,

1235
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:37,680
Because The Motor Is Giving Over
The Same Static Over The Radio.

1236
01:18:37,712 --> 01:18:40,916
<I>Can't You Hear It?

1237
01:18:37,712 --> 01:18:40,916
<I>That's Hardly Conclusive.

1238
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:43,920
I Recognize The Driver.
It's The Same Guy.

1239
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:46,723
Aren't You Supposed To Be
Picking Up Some People?

1240
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,391
Oh. Uh, Yeah,
They're Here.

1241
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:51,461
Mike, Look, Uh,

1242
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:53,829
If It's Old Sourpuss Fulton
That You're Worried About,

1243
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,999
<I>Well, He Wouldn't Know
A Good Minister...

1244
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:59,369
<I>If God Put His Arm Around Him
And Said, "That's My Boy."

1245
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,503
Know What I Mean?

1246
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:04,441
This Is It.
Please Send Us Some Help.

1247
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:08,645
Excuse Me, Dr. Fulton,
But This Is Really Important.

1248
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:13,716
Okay, Rookie.
I'll Send The Shortcakes Over And Get Jane.

1249
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:18,020
<I>And Then I'll Call Cleo,
And I'll Send You All The Help I Can Get, All Right?

1250
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:20,690
Good Luck,
And Keep Me Posted.

1251
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,460
Yippee!

1252
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,831
Carmel, Dean,
Do You Have Any Idea Where Mrs. Simms Is?

1253
01:19:28,863 --> 01:19:32,734
- There's A Pet Show At The Park.
- Find Her And Tell Her To Long-Distance Rookie.

1254
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,639
Okay.

1255
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,639
<I>And Hurry, Kids, Please.

1256
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,319
Are You Ready Now?
All Right, Everybody.

1257
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:53,289
Oh, Uh, Move In Just A Little Bit.
Oh, Yes, That's Beautiful.

1258
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,729
Now, Everybody Get Around The Wedding Cake.
I Want One Of The Wedding Cake.

1259
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,966
Move In, Move In.
Oh, Everything All Right, Dear?

1260
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,471
Â™ª

1261
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:15,078
Oh, Hello There.
Who Are You?

1262
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,447
Friends Of The Bride.
Nice To Meet You.

1263
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,447
Right.

1264
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,848
Oh, No, No, No. Wait A Minute.
You Can't. This Is A--

1265
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:24,019
<I>This Is A Respectable Wedding.
Uh, No Gypsies Here.

1266
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,090
Sorry, Howard, I Gotta Run.
I'll Call Ya.

1267
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,090
What?

1268
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,491
Jane? Excuse Me.

1269
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,994
Jane?

1270
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,564
Jane, Look.
I Don't Know What You've Been Up To Lately...

1271
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:37,132
And I Don't Want To,
But You're Not Running Out On Me Now.

1272
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,570
Then Pile In And Fasten Your
Safety Belt. I'm Driving.

1273
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,570
Okay.

1274
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,684
Well, That Figures.

1275
01:20:56,418 --> 01:21:00,023
Howard, What About The Rice?

1276
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,159
I Haven't The Vaguest Idea
What's Happening, Miss Woods,

1277
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,162
But I Wouldn't Miss It
For The World.

1278
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,965
Oh, Good. Well, Uh,
Watch Out For Police.

1279
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:14,970
Okay.
Reverend, Check For Smokies In Plain Brown Wrappers.

1280
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:20,842
- What?
- I'm Kahx-1235, The Ecumenical Enchantress.

1281
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,079
Well, You've Just Been Drafted.

1282
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:26,950
All Right,
All You Good Buddies.

1283
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,918
This Channel Is 10-33.
Keep It Clear.

1284
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,826
There She Is!
Mrs. Simms!

1285
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,826
Mrs. Simms!

1286
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,796
Mrs. Simms!

1287
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,796
Mrs. Simms!

1288
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:44,167
Dad Says To Long-Distance Rookie,
And To Hurry! This Could Bust The Bank!

1289
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,437
All Right. I'm Sorry, Children.
The Pet Show Will Have To Wait.

1290
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,807
I Wanna Go To The Pet Show!

1291
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,807
You Mean I Washed
My Turtle For Nothing?

1292
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,476
Get In Back Here.

1293
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,983
Oh, No!
My Snakes Fell Out!

1294
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,890
<I>We Better Pick Him Up,
Mrs. Simms!

1295
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,728
<I>I'm Awfully Sorry, Folks.
Things Have Gone Amuck.

1296
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:20,837
No, You're--
You're Going The Wrong Way.

1297
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,472
Uh, This-This Way.

1298
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,541
This Way.
Aah!

1299
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,844
What's Happening Here?

1300
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:31,714
Come On, Hurry!

1301
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:31,714
Now Look What You Did
With All Your Hurryin'!

1302
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,682
You Got A Run
In Me Stockin'!

1303
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:37,553
Well, It's The Last Time You'll Have To Wear Them,
I Hope.

1304
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,489
It Looks Like I Slid
Into Second.

1305
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:43,091
Oh, Will You Shut Up And
Get In And Drive The Car!

1306
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:43,091
Get Yourself In!

1307
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,194
Rookie To Home Plate. Suspect Heading South,
Both Feet On The Floor.

1308
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:50,600
- How Am I Hittin' Ya?
- That Sounds Like Dr. Rheems. Dr. Rheems?

1309
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,568
You Got It.

1310
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,503
<I>What Are You Doing Getting
Mixed Up In A Thing Like This?

1311
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,939
I Want You And Reverend Wainwright
To Get Out Of That Car Immediately.

1312
01:22:57,972 --> 01:22:59,942
<I>Sorry, Doctor.
Don't Read You.

1313
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,914
The Ecumenical Enchantress,
10-8 And On The Side.

1314
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:16,859
Nobody Panic.

1315
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,662
Oh, There's Bruno.
Get Him, Danny! Get Him, Danny!

1316
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,532
Bruno! Bruno!

1317
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,532
<I>Bruno!
That's A Good Bowser.

1318
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,568
Get Off My Car!
Get Off Of There!

1319
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,738
Oh, The Snake.
Did Anybody Get The Snake?

1320
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:36,746
He's Still At The Beer Joint, Home Plate,
Like-- Like He Has Nowhere To Go.

1321
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:39,181
<I>He Could Be Cooling The Work.
Hang Back, Rookie.

1322
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:41,818
<I>Let Us Know When He Moves.

1323
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:41,818
Okay.

1324
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:43,820
<I>Easy.

1325
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,021
Easy, Mrs. Porter.

1326
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,021
Thanks, Alfredo.
Give Me The Keys.

1327
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:48,758
Where Are The Keys?
Open The Door.

1328
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:48,758
Easy.

1329
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:51,092
All Right, Maximilian, Inside.
Okay, Give Me The Keys.

1330
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,994
Okay, Bye, Pam.
See You Later.

1331
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,994
Be Careful.

1332
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,030
Watch Your Nails.

1333
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,030
I'll Come Back
For My Things Later.

1334
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:59,235
Heavens! Oh.

1335
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,570
Watch-Watch Your Back.

1336
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:04,974
Easy.

1337
01:24:10,244 --> 01:24:12,314
Okay.
I Think We're All Set.

1338
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:14,617
Everybody's In.
Hello.

1339
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,252
You Better Pull It Over To The Curb, Lady.
This Is Gonna Take A While.

1340
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:19,889
Oh, No, No, I'm Sorry.
I-I Can't Right Now.

1341
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,724
I'm Terribly Sorry.
I'm Awfully Busy.

1342
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,994
You're Busy?
Pull This Car Over There!

1343
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:28,030
Hang On, Children.

1344
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:28,030
Hey!

1345
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,567
Hey!
What Are You Doing?

1346
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:34,103
<I>Where Are You Going?
Come Back Here!

1347
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:39,609
I Really Appreciate This,
And-And You Two Have Been Just Wonderful.

1348
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,743
But, You Know,
Maybe You Should Get Out While You Can.

1349
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:43,679
This Could Get A Little Rough
Before It's Over.

1350
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:46,916
You Do What You Want,
Reverend Wainwright.

1351
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,885
But Personally, I Haven't
Has This Much Excitement...

1352
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,220
Since I Got Snowed In
At The Elks Convention.

1353
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,961
There He Goes!

1354
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,030
He's Making His Move,
Home Plate! We're On Our Way.

1355
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,869
Keep Your Distance, Rookie.
Let Us Know His Area And Direction.

1356
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:46,743
Lost Him, Home Plate.

1357
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:48,810
<I>He May Have Taken
Brunswick Road. Try It Anyway.

1358
01:25:48,845 --> 01:25:51,047
Hold It!
Hold It!

1359
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:56,085
<I>Look! That Gate Is Closing,
And There's Dust Settling On The Road Over There.

1360
01:25:56,118 --> 01:25:58,754
<I>I'll Bet He Drove
Up To That Warehouse.

1361
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:02,725
Yahoo! We Found It.
This Has Gotta Be It, Home Plate.

1362
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,168
All Right, Here We Go.

1363
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,207
Everybody Gets Some Money.

1364
01:26:22,478 --> 01:26:25,114
How Did It Go?

1365
01:26:22,478 --> 01:26:25,114
Milk Run.

1366
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:32,454
Rookie To Home Plate,
Rookie To Home Plate.

1367
01:26:32,488 --> 01:26:36,458
It's An Old Warehouse On Hudson,
Just West Of Davenport.

1368
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:40,029
And Old Hawkshaw Wainwright
Here Nailed It.

1369
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,032
Um, We Don't See
Anything Right Now,

1370
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,067
<I>But The Camper Must've Gone
Inside The Building.

1371
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:47,336
<I>Mike, I'm Positive
This Is Their Bank.

1372
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,142
You're In Charge.

1373
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,142
Reverend Hill!

1374
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:58,381
Where Are You Going?
Reverend Hill!

1375
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:29,477
Jane! Jane!

1376
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:29,477
All Right, Howard,
I'm Coming! I'm Coming!

1377
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,917
Shh!

1378
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,917
Shh!

1379
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,853
Shh!

1380
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,853
Shh!

1381
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:38,954
Shh!

1382
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:38,954
Shh!

1383
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,990
<I>Hey, Look.
Someone's Coming Out.

1384
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:43,959
Rookie To Home Plate.
The Door's Opening,

1385
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:47,096
And There's A Tall,
Grey-Haired Man...

1386
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,465
<I>Getting In The Limousine,
And They're Leaving.

1387
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,801
Come On, Everybody.
Into Your Cars. Quick!

1388
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:03,045
Jane? Oh.
Jane?

1389
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:05,481
Look, I-I Don't Want
My Car Mixed Up In This.

1390
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,317
I-I Just Got It Repaired,
And It's Perfect Again.

1391
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,317
Howard.

1392
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:11,320
Howard, This Car Is Now
Community Property,

1393
01:28:11,485 --> 01:28:13,322
So Get In
Or Get Out Of The Way.

1394
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:15,891
Yes, Mother.
Jane!

1395
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:38,514
What's That?

1396
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,986
<I>It's Those Dames! Back Up!
Use The Other Gate! Come On!

1397
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:55,264
All Right, Everybody!
Grab The Stuff! Out! Let's Go!

1398
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:59,068
Move, Move!

1399
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:09,612
<I>Step On It, Eddie.
Step On It!

1400
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:12,248
He's Not Gonna Stop!

1401
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:12,248
Stop!

1402
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,317
Look Out!

1403
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,292
Oh, Look!
There's More Coming Out!

1404
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:27,229
<I>They're Getting Away!
All Units, All Units, Stop Them.

1405
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,297
<I>Somebody Do Something!

1406
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:32,368
Stand Back.
Heavy Duty Comin' Through.

1407
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:48,050
- Good Going, Clunker!
- You Name It, I Claim It.

1408
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:51,353
Jane, Stop!
You'll Hurt My Car!

1409
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,622
Howard,
Will You Get In!

1410
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:56,090
June Bride, June Bride,
Coming At You Now. Head Him Off.

1411
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:58,027
- We'll Get Him, Rookie.
- <I>Jane!

1412
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,129
<I>Will You Stop Worrying
About This Car?

1413
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,129
<I>Jane, I Can't!

1414
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,497
Well, Then Don't Look.

1415
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:14,510
Kiddie Car, Watch It.
There's One On Your Tail.

1416
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:21,283
Bruno, What Are You
Doing Here?

1417
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,989
We Winged One!
We Winged One!

1418
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:31,059
Phantom Fox, Six O'clock.
Oh!

1419
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:31,059
He's Got A Gun!

1420
01:30:36,163 --> 01:30:38,532
Hold Your Course,
Phantom Fox. I'm Coming In.

1421
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:44,573
Oh! Well Done!

1422
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:52,448
- He's Backing Up! - <I>Someone Stop That Camper!
- Back Up! Back Up!

1423
01:30:57,284 --> 01:31:00,655
He Ain't Goin' Nowhere.

1424
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:04,093
<I>Stop Him! Stop Him!

1425
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:05,994
I Will.

1426
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:09,698
Oh, No, You Won't.

1427
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:09,698
Howard!

1428
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,634
- Howard!
- Oh, Howard!

1429
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,604
I Made It.
No, Look, The Car's All Right.

1430
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,604
Will You Let Me Drive?

1431
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,671
Oh!

1432
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:07,422
Watch It, Will Ya?

1433
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:11,359
Phantom Fox, Phantom Fox,
Kiddie Car In Trouble.

1434
01:32:11,393 --> 01:32:13,762
I'm Going In.

1435
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,309
Look Out!

1436
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:31,313
Way To Go, Claire.
That's Neat!

1437
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,415
Look Out, Vickie!

1438
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:40,789
- You All Right, Kiddie Car?
- Splendid.

1439
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:46,628
I'm Back, Children.
I Told You I Wouldn't Be Long.

1440
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:56,338
Smack Her!
Give It To Her!

1441
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,425
Now It's My Turn.
We'll See How You Like It.

1442
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:28,270
Look At That!

1443
01:33:30,704 --> 01:33:34,476
She's Nuts!
Get Away From Her!

1444
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,849
Look, He's Getting Away!
Faster!

1445
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,259
I Can't See Nothin'!

1446
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,228
Where Are We?

1447
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,228
What Did You Do?

1448
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:57,432
<I>Look Out, Phantom Fox!

1449
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:05,373
We Did It!

1450
01:34:09,578 --> 01:34:11,547
Fantastic!

1451
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,782
<I>I Knew We Could Do It!

1452
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,853
That's The Way To Go!

1453
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,823
Look, Look, Lookit!
They're All Trapped! We Got 'Em!

1454
01:34:22,856 --> 01:34:25,761
Anne, Are You All Right?

1455
01:34:22,856 --> 01:34:25,761
Mike!

1456
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,197
Mike, We Did It! We Did It!
And The Bank Is Up There.

1457
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:31,166
<I>We Got Everything.

1458
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:31,166
Fantastic!

1459
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,573
Hey!

1460
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:41,443
Oh, Look! There's Roca!
He's Getting Away In That Convertible!

1461
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:44,813
Hang On To Your Socks, Howard.
We're Going In.

1462
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:48,583
Jane, You Can't Do This.
This Is My Car.

1463
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:48,583
Yes I Can, Howard.

1464
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,685
I Won't Let You Do It.

1465
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,685
Hush, Howard.

1466
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:01,829
Oh! Mike, Be Careful!

1467
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:08,670
Get Out Of The Car!

1468
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:08,670
Stop The Car!

1469
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,373
Get Him, Rev!
Get Him!

1470
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,228
Hold It, Hold It, Hold It,
Mr. Roca.

1471
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,297
Wait Just A Minute.

1472
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,297
Give Me My Briefcase!

1473
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:37,298
Oh, I Will In A Minute.

1474
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:39,568
- Mike!
- Anne!

1475
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,536
Hold It, You!

1476
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:46,307
If You'd Broken All Of My Nails,
I'd Really Be Mad!

1477
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,944
I Need A Safety Pin.

1478
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,944
I Got Mine.

1479
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:53,481
One False Move
And You Got A New Nose!

1480
01:35:53,515 --> 01:35:55,517
Keep His Hands Up There.

1481
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:59,721
You Have A Right
To Remain Silent, Sucker!

1482
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:02,390
Anne, We Hit The Jackpot.
We've Got The Names,

1483
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:04,826
We've Got The Numbers,
We've Got The Slips, We Got The Money.

1484
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:07,730
Twelve Hundred Dollars
For The Church Sinking Fund.

1485
01:36:09,863 --> 01:36:12,667
We Did It. We Did It.
We Did It.

1486
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,703
Oh!
It's A Miracle.

1487
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:19,474
- I Know.
- This Car In Unscathed.

1488
01:36:19,506 --> 01:36:22,810
- Huh?
- I Am Going To Give You A Nice, Warm Bath.

1489
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:25,413
And Then,
I'm Going To Polish You.

1490
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:27,583
It's A Thing Of Beauty,

1491
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:29,618
A Joy Forever.

1492
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:31,853
It's Gonna Stay--
Oh, No, No!

1493
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,623
Don't Hit My Baby! No!

1494
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,623
Howard,
Get Out Of Here!

1495
01:36:35,657 --> 01:36:37,693
No!

1496
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:47,001
Oh, No.

1497
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,971
And...

1498
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:53,942
The Arrests Have Resulted In
At Least 12 Indictments So Far.

1499
01:36:57,612 --> 01:37:00,382
Also-- Also, I Have It
On The Best Authority...

1500
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:03,018
That We Can Expect Some
New Faces Down At City Hall.

1501
01:37:08,021 --> 01:37:10,024
Uh, And I--

1502
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:12,694
I Don't See Them
Among Us This Morning,

1503
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,430
But I'd Like To Take
