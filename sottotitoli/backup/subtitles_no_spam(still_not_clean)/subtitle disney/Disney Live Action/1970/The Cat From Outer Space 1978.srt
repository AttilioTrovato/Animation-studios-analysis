1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
(whirring sound overhead)

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,400
(clucking)

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,900
(neighing)

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,300
(chickens clucking/cows mooing)

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
What is it?
What is that light?

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
l don't know.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
(banging)

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,300
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,700
I’m gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,900
(whimpers)

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Chicken.

12
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,800
Holy mackerel!

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,500
(male voice) This is Earth Probe Zunar J5
calling Mother Ship.

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,900
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in. Mother Ship.

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,300
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5
calling Mother Ship.

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,200
(female voice) This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,700
Affirmative. Mother.
Request repair party.

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Negative. Zunar J5. You'll have to
effect emergency repairs yourself.

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,800
and rendezvous with us at grid dissect
830 4 at 69 hours minus 1 7.

20
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,500
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable. Zunar.

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Next mission to this galaxy due in 1 1 5.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,500
- Days?
- Years.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Good luck. Zunar J5.
Over and out.

24
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah. So long. Mother.

25
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,600
(whistles)

26
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,700
l don't see any hammer and sickle,
do you, Colonel?

27
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,800
Maybe it's on the inside, General.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
No sign of life, either.

29
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
l want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.

30
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,700
- Captain.
- Sergeant.

31
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,300
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.

33
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Rover?

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Rover?

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Rover?

36
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
Rover?

37
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,500
(General) Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.

39
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Take their names. Colonel.

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,300
Captain.

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,200
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,000
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.

43
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,100
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.

44
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,600
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,300
On to Hopscotch.

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,300
All right, men.
Let's move it!

47
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,100
- Let's move out. Colonel.
- Captain.

48
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,100
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,900
(electronic beeping)

50
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
(collar beeps)

51
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,200
(General) When we get to Hopscotch,
l want mark-four priority security.

52
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.

53
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,300
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?

54
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
- Yes, sir. Sergeant?
- Got it.

56
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,900
Well?

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,700
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It’s state of the art.

58
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
You trying to tell me something,
Allison?

59
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,800
- It’s definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?

60
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Certainly not Russia.
It’s far beyond...

61
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,200
OK, Allison. Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?

62
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,300
l don't know, General.

63
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,300
We'd better find out. l wanna know who
made it, flew it and where it came from.

64
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,800
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.

66
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,800
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins,
Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.

67
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,500
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Double pronto!

69
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,800
lf we don't find out where that thing came
from, this country could be in trouble,

70
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,100
big, big trouble.

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,500
- Colonel.
- Captain.

72
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,200
You say it's not man-made, Allison.

74
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,600
What's that leave us?

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,300
Outer space.

76
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
With no sign of the pilot.

77
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,000
Big, big trouble.

78
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
While you and l are talking
this very minute,

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,900
some slimy green-headed 1 2-legged creep
could be crawling into the White House.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Big, big trouble.

81
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
We're up against genius.

82
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,300
We'd better come up
with some genius of our own.

83
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,900
(man) l believe, General, you've
already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
I’d like to introduce
some members of our team.

85
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,600
Dr. Robeson of Caltech,
who's our expert on fossil fuel.

86
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,800
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.

87
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,100
Huh.

88
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,100
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing
some intriguing work in garbage research.

89
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
- So what?
- Dr. Link.

90
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Just a second, Dr. Heffel. l have to relay
some vital information to a colleague.

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Oh, yes. This is our hard-water man,
Dr. Leach.

92
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,100
Right, Ernie. The Lakers by a point
and a half for 1 00 bucks.

93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
When will you have the line
on Philly and the New York Knicks?

94
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,800
(Heffel) I’d like you to meet Mr. Jurist,
who also is involved in Thermal.

95
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,100
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor
Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.

96
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey,
our head of Nuclear.

97
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement
and Supplies. What are you doing here?

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,000
When the call went out for an
emergency meeting, l naturally assumed...

99
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,200
You assumed wrong. Scientists.
Double-A clearance only. Out.

100
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,600
- But l might have a contribution.
- lf we need any pencils, I’ll send for you.

101
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.

102
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Sorry, General. Where was l?
Oh, yes. Professor...

103
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,900
Dr. Heffel, l didn't come for a roll call,
l came to pick brains. Are they all here?

104
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,900
- Yes. These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,800
l understand, General.
Attention, everyone.

106
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,200
(Heffel) Dr. Link.

107
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,800
That's it, Professor.
I’ll call tomorrow with more input. Bye.

108
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,200
All right, Sergeant. Open it.
Drapes.

109
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,700
Ladies and gentlemen, what you
are about to see is top secret.

110
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,900
The United States government
will countenance no leaks.

111
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Now.

112
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,500
What's holding it up?

113
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
- Nothing.
- It’s amazing.

114
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,700
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?

115
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
(man) A propulsion unit of some sort,
ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,200
Never mind where we got it.

117
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,500
We have other experts working on that.

118
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,200
What we want to know from you is,
what makes it tick?

119
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
OK. Let's have your hypothesis.

120
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,500
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.

121
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,600
We've checked on that.
Negative.

122
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,500
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...

123
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
- Checked out. Negative.
- Oh.

124
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,700
It’s not propelled by garbage, l know that.

125
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.

126
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Come in, Olympus.

127
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
l think I’m on to
something very big and very...

129
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Jellyfish.

130
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,600
Your man in ERL?

131
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Yes, sir. That Jellyfish.
l think I’m on to something.

132
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,100
No, sir. l think you'll find this a great deal
more interesting than my last report.

133
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting

134
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,600
with a four-star general
and a whole gaggle of scientists.

135
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,500
What are they meeting about?
l don't know, sir, it's a secret.

136
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,100
Get in there and find out?

137
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,100
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?

138
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,700
Do you? Well?

139
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
(clears throat)

140
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring
Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?

141
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
- Wilson?
- Yes.

142
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,000
He might very well come up
with an applicable theory.

143
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,300
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,900
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool. Oh...

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,900
That is, we live in the same building.

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.

147
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
No.

148
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,600
What I’m trying to say is,

149
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,200
he's a very bright young physicist who's
come here recently on loan from Caltech.

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,300
A loan, l might add,
that is bearing absolutely no interest.

151
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,900
(laughter)

152
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,600
He's a little unorthodox,
but a brilliant theorist.

153
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.

154
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
- What?
- Get him.

155
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,200
His output couldn't be any less
than what we've gotten so far.

156
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, General.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
He really has an unusual mind.

158
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,600
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It’s beautiful.

159
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Don't you have any other observation?

160
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.

161
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,900
What makes it tick?

162
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
Mayonnaise?

163
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Negative.

164
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,200
No, l was only joking, sir.

165
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,500
l do have a theory, sir, actually,
in line with the work I’ve been doing.

166
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
l have a hunch it's tapping
the primal mainstream.

167
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
The primal mainstream?

168
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,500
It’s everywhere,
only on different frequencies.

169
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,100
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -

170
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,300
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet,
visible light, infrared, radio waves.

171
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you know how much we finite human
beings can tune into with our senses?

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,700
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.

173
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,200
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.

174
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,500
lf l taped terminals to your head, General,
your brain could run an electric train.

175
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
- Electric train?
- (Heffel) I’m sorry, General.

176
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Perhaps electric train
wasn't the most apt example.

177
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,500
(Heffel) Thank you very much.

178
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.

179
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,300
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?

180
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,700
- Yes, General?
- l want action.

181
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
(bell rings)

182
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,700
You know, Drexel, I’ve seen
the most amazing thing. Amazing.

183
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,700
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It’s classified.

184
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,900
(bell rings)

185
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Thank you, Drexel.

186
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,900
Well.

187
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,100
How did you get in here? Huh?

188
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,200
Now look, you're asking for trouble.

189
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,800
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy
about animals in the building.

190
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about
people in the building either.

191
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,900
What's your name, huh?
Charlie? Cuddles? Jake?

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, yes. You look like Jake.

193
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,400
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.

194
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,500
And, one of these days, that sun of ours
is going to turn into a big black hole.

195
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,100
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.

196
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,300
We're loaded with it.

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,800
You know, it's crazy, but you almost
look like you know what I’m talking about.

198
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,400
All right, give me a hand with this,
Sergeant. Easy, easy. That's it.

199
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Stallwood, administration emergency!

200
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I’ll take you home with me.

201
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,300
My neighbor Liz has a cat
named Lucybelle. She's really cute.

202
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,500
And the cat's not bad either.

203
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
Liz! Hi.

204
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,900
Ouch! I’ve...

205
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,600
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?

206
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
This is Jake.
I’m going to take him home with us.

207
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,700
You won't have to drive Professor Link
and myself home tonight.

208
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- l can wait.

209
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,700
That won't be necessary.

210
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
- How about a coffee?
- No.

211
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,000
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,600
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore? Sore?

213
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,300
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it? What did l do?

214
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,500
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

215
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
Mayonnaise?

216
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Electric trains?

217
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Well, now, look, really, all that...
that was just a joke, Doctor.

218
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, nobody laughed,
especially the general.

219
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,600
Has he had water?

220
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,600
- The general?
- The cat.

221
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Oh. Water?

222
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,000
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,200
A bowl? Right here, yes. Here.

224
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,700
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.

225
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Look, Liz... Dr. Bartlett.

226
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,600
Just because some general lacks
a sense of humor, that's no reason...

227
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,100
- All l was trying to convey...
- I’m really not interested, Doctor.

228
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,900
Besides, l wasn't trying to be funny.

229
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It’s just that the magnitude of what the
general showed us just bowled me over.

230
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
- it did?
- Oh, completely.

231
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,800
- Black.
- What?

232
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,000
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right. Check. Coming right up.

233
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,400
l really don't understand, that's all.

234
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,200
The man who wrote the article you did
for The Scientific Quarterly...

235
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,400
- You read it?
- Well, of course. it was brilliant.

236
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,200
I’ve been wanting to tell you.

237
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,200
We don't get much chance to talk in the car
pool, but I’ve been following your work.

238
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,500
- You have?
- Closely.

239
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,500
It’s very impressive, very innovative,

240
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,400
very attractive.
l mean, it's bound to attract attention.

241
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Oh, well, um,

242
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,800
l am writing an article at the moment
and l would love to have your criticism.

243
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh. Maybe at lunch or,
even better, at dinner sometime?

244
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
- Yeah, I’d like that. When?
- Tonight?

245
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
No, that's right,
you've got that late meeting.

246
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,300
That may not go all that late.
l should be out by seven. Is that too late?

247
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,000
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.

248
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Well...

249
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
it was delicious.

250
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,400
- l think she digs you.
- l sure hope so.

251
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
- Who said that?
- l did.

252
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down. We've gotta talk.

253
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,800
I’m running out of time, and you're
the only one l can depend on to help me.

254
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,700
- It’s you?
- It’s not the mouse. Now, sit down.

255
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,900
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.

256
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,800
Thought transference. Nothing exceptional
where l come from. Now, sit.

257
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,300
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.

258
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
Zunar...?

259
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,400
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?

260
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,900
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 1 3,

261
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,500
l made an emergency landing
in a spaceship from another galaxy.

262
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,200
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.

263
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
But... you're a cat.

264
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Granted. But you see, in our civilization,
that's as far as we needed to evolve.

265
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,600
We developed our brain to a fine point.

266
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,900
Now, man rose off his four legs and
developed tools, machinery, agriculture

267
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,900
and a chronic pain in his lower back.

268
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,100
We developed tools for the mind. This
collar here, it amplifies brain power.

269
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,900
- it does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Look, let me give you a demonstration.

271
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,900
(cello music)

272
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,800
- (flute plays)
- Not a bad little tune.

273
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,800
(humming along)

274
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,700
Mm-mmm.

275
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,100
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?

276
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It’s all they had at the deli.

277
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
it really hits the spot. I’m gonna take
a couple of cases for my trip back.

278
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,800
Sure beats the blah I’ve been eating.

279
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,100
Well, now back to my problem.

280
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,400
Frank, l need an answer.

281
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
- What do you say?
- Say about what?

282
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Can l count on you
to help me repair my spaceship?

283
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,800
- Why me?
- Because l like the way you think.

284
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:38,000
Your equations rather interest me. In fact,
they're really not bad at all... for a human.

285
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,800
- Really? I’m on the right track?
- Quite definitely,

286
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,100
but years away from a solution.

287
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,000
Frank, on my planet,
we have an expression -

288
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,300
you rub my fur, I’ll rub yours.

289
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
How would you like
to make a quantum jump?

290
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You help me, and I’ll give you
a push in the right direction.

291
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,100
- You're serious?
- I’m serious.

292
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,500
- You really are from outer space?
- l am from outer space.

293
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,500
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank! Is it a deal?

294
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
It’s a deal. Oh, that's...

295
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,700
We better move. I’ve got to make repairs
to my ship by 5:1 3 Sunday for liftoff,

296
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,500
or I’ll miss the rendezvous
with the mother ship.

297
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
Right. I’ll get my sweater.

298
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Uh, do you think that you can find your way
back to that airport?

299
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,200
No problem.
l made a memory imprint.

300
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,500
- With the collar?
- Right.

301
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Fantastic.

302
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,200
How developed does your brain
have to be to use that collar?

303
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.

304
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,200
You wanna try?

305
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,900
Do we have time?

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,900
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.

307
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,000
Easy. Don't take it off.
Without it, I’m just an average cat.

308
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Right.

309
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,300
- Right. OK?
- OK.

310
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.

311
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,400
Think levitation.

312
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
Levitation.

313
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,800
You're as light as a feather.

314
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,900
Look at me. I’m floating!

315
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,200
It’s just plain incredible!

316
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,500
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.

317
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,300
Yeah.

318
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,100
Hi, Frank. Gotta use your set.

319
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,600
(commentator) The ball goes
crosscourt to Brown. He brings it...

320
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,900
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...

321
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,200
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.

322
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
- Link, I’m busy.
- Yeah. Well, just forget I’m here.

323
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,000
The last minute of the game, and Francine
throws me out of the apartment.

324
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,500
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.

325
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat. He's just visiting.

326
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,600
- Hi, Jake.
- I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.

327
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,800
Do you mind, Frank?

328
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,700
Remember. the score's tied at 1 08. Atlanta
has the ball and a basket could win it.

329
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,000
Win it? Oh, man! And l gave a point
and a half. There goes my 1 00 bucks.

330
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,700
Come on, defense. Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...

331
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,800
The crowd is really on its feet now.

332
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
The guy in the corner.

333
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,600
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball. What a play.

334
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,300
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.

335
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer. there's no chance.

336
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,700
Wait...

337
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Wait a minute.

338
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,900
Wait a minute!

339
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't believe it. He scores!

340
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,400
He made it in the last second.
and the Lakers will win it by two.

341
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,900
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?

342
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,100
Yeah.

343
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
I’m really gonna have to ask you to leave.

344
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,600
- l could use another beer.
- I’m out of beer, I’m sorry.

345
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,000
- How about a ginger ale?
- I’m out of that, too.

346
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
- Could l at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.

347
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,100
I’d like to have a little celebration.

348
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,500
I’ll see you later.

349
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,500
The basketball game?
You did that?

350
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,100
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
it was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.

351
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,500
Let's go.
It’s less than 36 hours to liftoff.

352
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
Right. Oh...

353
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,900
Do you think l ought to carry you, so people
don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Good thinking, Frank. Besides,
my left paw's been acting up again.

355
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,000
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no. Polo.

356
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Now let's go.

357
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,200
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.

358
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,600
- I’ll handle that, too.
- It’s fantastic.

359
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,400
Hi. Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?

360
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
- Jake.
- Jake, right.

361
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,200
Jake, this is Lucybelle. l thought they could
get acquainted while we're at dinner.

362
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
- At dinner?
- Yeah.

363
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,300
it was tonight, wasn't it?

364
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,400
Right. Right, yes.

365
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,900
l was just about to call you.

366
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Something came up. I’m afraid you're
going to have to give me a rain check.

367
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh.

368
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,900
Oh, well, of course.
it really doesn't matter.

369
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,100
But it does.
it matters a lot, Liz. Dr. Bartlett.

370
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,500
You see, what happened was...

371
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
(Jake sneezing)

372
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,400
It’s Jake. He took sick.
Suddenly. Out of the blue.

373
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,600
Really? What is it?

374
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,700
l think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.

375
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
(sneezing)

376
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,900
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.

377
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.

378
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,200
- What?
- l said l was about to rush him to the vet's.

379
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,900
The vet. That's a good idea, Frank.

380
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,000
D'you know there's a very good vet
who lives in the building? A Dr. Wenger.

381
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,300
He specializes in cats.
I’m sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.

382
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I’m sorry about dinner. I’ll make it up to you.

383
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,800
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?

384
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,400
- You handled that very well.
- l didn't enjoy lying to Liz.

385
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,600
She's a very unusual person.

386
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,900
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.

387
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's all right for you to say. But I’ve been
confined to a spaceship for five months.

388
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,700
Ohh...

389
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,200
(vehicle approaches)

390
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
- (Jake) The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.

391
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
There's got to be a way in.

392
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,000
- It’s locked.
- No problem.

393
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,600
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.

394
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,300
The coast is clear. Let's go!

395
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,900
There she is.

396
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Somebody's coming.

397
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,100
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- l know, l know.

398
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
What's happening?

399
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
It’s all clear.

400
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,400
- Let's go!
- It’s this way.

401
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
(dog growls)

402
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
(barks)

403
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,600
Forget it. it wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.

404
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,800
Come on, let's go.

405
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,700
Incredible.

406
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,800
An older model, but in pretty good shape
for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.

407
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Now let's see about getting it operational
again. We've only got 34 hours left.

408
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,100
Right. Through here?

409
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,100
Hm-hm. Put me down.

410
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,200
Oh, it's just incredible.

411
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,500
The artichoke.
l was right.

412
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,000
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.

413
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
- And this?
- Uh, computer.

414
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,200
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.

415
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,700
I’ll explain it all later, l promise.

416
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,600
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?

417
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,600
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find
the transducer switch on top of the ship.

418
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,900
Just coordinate with me.

419
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Well, how do l get up there?

420
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,200
- Fly.
- Fly? You mean use your collar?

421
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,700
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.

422
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,600
Concentrate, and when you get on top,

423
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,200
engage the switch with the intercog
and thought-project ''seven max triad.''

424
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,500
- Seven max triad.
- Right. The computer will do the rest.

425
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,300
Seven max triad. Right.

426
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,000
Hey!

427
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Whoa!

428
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,900
Whoa!

429
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?

430
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,000
Frank?

431
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
Jake, I’m ready to plug it in.

432
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,900
Right. Go ahead.

433
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,100
- It’s in.
- OK. Thought-project.

434
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,300
Seven max triad.

435
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,100
OK, Frank. Come on down.

436
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,800
Amazing.

437
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,400
l was afraid of that. The focal terminal
on the microtransformer's vaporized.

438
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,500
- You're sure?
- Positive. But I’ll double-check.

439
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,800
- Just what l thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?

440
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Acts as a catalyzer.
I’ll need a small amount of org 1 2.

441
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,200
- What's org 1 2?
- What the focal terminal's made of.

442
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,100
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 1 2 on this planet?

443
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?

444
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,200
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back. I’ll run it through the computer.

445
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
(horn honks)

446
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,000
Hey, Tom! You all right?

447
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,200
Tom!

448
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,600
Org 1 2...
ductile yellow metallic element.

449
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,900
Melting point - 1.063.

450
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,100
Tensile strength - 1 9.000.

451
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,800
- Tensile strength what?
- 1 9.000.

452
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,700
Atomic weight - 1 96.967.

453
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.

454
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,100
Wow!

455
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,700
(alarm blaring. bell ringing)

456
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,700
(soldier) Out! Out!
Everybody out!

457
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,500
What is that?

458
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,000
Come on, let's go.

459
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,100
Follow me!

460
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,900
Holy cow.

461
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,400
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.

462
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Let's get out of here.

463
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,100
Over here! Follow me!
Move out!

464
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Watch it!

465
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Come back here!

466
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,000
(Jake) Where are you going?

467
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,700
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!

468
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,300
Look out!

469
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,400
- (meowing)
- What is it?

470
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,900
Get it off of me!
Get it off!

471
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,700
(soldier) Was anybody in there?
Back it out. Look out. Who's driving?

472
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,000
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!

473
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,900
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?

474
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,100
l did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.

475
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,500
Cat? Cat? Cat?

476
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,500
Yes, sir. Here's his collar.

477
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,500
Jake!

478
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,800
Excuse me.

479
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,700
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.

480
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!

481
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!

482
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Move it out!

483
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Whoa!

484
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,800
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.

485
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,900
(Frank) 1 7 times...

486
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Um, five of...

487
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,100
Now cosine of...

488
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Yeah. Uh...

489
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,800
This is even better than the stuff
l had last night. What's it called?

490
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,200
- Tuna.
- Tuna? Love it.

491
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,600
- it doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?

492
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,700
According to your figures, we're going to
need $1 20,000 worth of gold.

493
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,400
- So?
- So?

494
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,100
Jake, forgetting the money, which l can't
forget, you know how much gold that is?

495
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,000
It’s that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?

496
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,700
You folks are still operating
on the bulk system.

497
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
I’ll reduce it to the size l need
and still retain all its properties.

498
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,400
- How?
- I’ll get into that later. First buy the gold.

499
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,300
Buy it? Jake, in order to buy $1 20,000's
worth of gold, you need $1 20,000.

500
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,500
- So? Is that a problem?
- A prob...?

501
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,700
My entire capital is tied up
in my next paycheck.

502
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,900
- Then what's the alternative?
- l don't know what...

503
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,200
Hi.

504
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,000
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.

505
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.

506
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,600
Just bring me a beer and forget I’m here.

507
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,500
Hi, Jake.

508
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,800
Link...

509
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,700
Wife's worked out
an equitable TV schedule.

510
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,300
The Peachtree Derby and the football
game's on your set, and the opera on mine.

511
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,800
- Can't you see I’m busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?

512
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,500
- Link...
- Franklin, please.

513
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,400
I’ve got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.

514
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,900
(softly) We've got problems to solve,
things to do.

515
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,300
What?

516
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,400
- Link, I’m gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!

517
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,900
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?

518
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,700
No.

519
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,600
- Come on, Sweet Jake. Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?

520
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,100
Yeah. It’s a hunch bet.
1 00 on the nose at 1 5 to 1 .

521
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,900
l tell you, if she comes in, tiger,
and I’m gonna be 1 500 in front,

522
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.

523
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Did you forget my beer or did l drink it
already? Never mind, I’ll get it.

524
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,700
- I’ll try to get rid of him.
- (softly) Wait a minute.

525
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,600
Did you hear what he said? lf Sweet Jake
finishes first, he wins $1 500.

526
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,900
- So?
- So if Link can win $1 500,

527
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,200
why can't we win 1 20,000?

528
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,900
No. Wait a minute. He just made a bet.
He could win 1 500. it doesn't mean he will.

529
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,000
With me on his side, he will.

530
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,300
- Did you say something?
- Hmm? No, nothing.

531
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
OK, OK. Let's pipe down.

532
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,300
l got 1 00 big ones riding on this nag.

533
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,000
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.

534
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,800
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.

535
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,100
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?

536
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,800
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.

537
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,300
At the clubhouse turn. it's Denny's Doll
by half a length. Attaboy Star.

538
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,500
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.

539
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,300
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind. but he's moving.

540
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,300
Uh-oh. I think he stopped to have lunch.

541
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,200
l don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!

542
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,600
See what l mean?

543
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,700
Sweet Jake! l should have bet
on the Metropolitan Opera.

544
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,100
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby. Denny's Doll and Seabottom.

545
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,500
Sweet Jake's finished eating
and started running.

546
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,900
And. ladies and gentlemen. is he running.

547
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,900
But not even Silky Sullivan
could come from this far behind.

548
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,600
It's Booky Baby taking the lead. Daddy's
Poppa moving into second. Attaboy Star.

549
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,500
And making up incredible ground
is Sweet Jake.

550
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:20,200
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?

551
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,500
At the top of the stretch. it's Booky Baby
in the lead. Daddy's Poppa.

552
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,400
And turning for home. it's Sweet Jake.

553
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,700
Come on, Jake. Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.

554
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,500
Attaboy. Here we go.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Jake.

555
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,300
Attaway. Come on, Jake.

556
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,100
Come on. Come on, boy! That's it! Hot dog!

557
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,400
We got it! Yahoo!

558
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,400
Yeeha!

559
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,800
The story here today.
ladies and gentlemen. is Sweet Jake.

560
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,900
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.

561
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,600
- How about you? I’m buying.
- No, thanks.

562
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,600
Oh, incidentally, Frank,
you could use another six-pack.

563
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,600
l got a feeling I’m gonna murder them
on the football games.

564
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,200
Frank, that's the solution to the money.

565
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,700
- No, no. It’s ridiculous. it won't work.
- Why won't it?

566
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,200
l don't know anything about placing a bet.
l wouldn't know where to go, what to do.

567
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,700
l gotta call Ernie with my football bets. The
Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.

568
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,600
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?

569
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,100
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?

570
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,400
- Link? Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise? Who are you talking to?

571
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,200
Ask how many football games
we can bet on.

572
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,500
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!

573
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,200
- It’s crazy.
- Buddy?

574
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,800
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?

575
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,800
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West. Who?

576
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,100
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?

577
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,200
l don't think it's a good idea, but OK.

578
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
You know, I’d say you
were talking to the cat.

579
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,100
l was.

580
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
Right.

581
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,500
Look, Frank, this can happen
to anybody in government service.

582
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,200
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.

583
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,500
- Link. Take a deep breath.
- OK.

584
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,300
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.

585
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,900
Well, it all started when this spaceship...

586
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,200
- Spaceship?
- ...from another galaxy landed in a field.

587
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,400
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?

588
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:38,600
Now, you're trying to tell me that your
little pussycat came from another planet

589
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,700
from another galaxy in a spacecraft
and landed on Earth?

590
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,200
- Is that it?
- That's right.

591
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,300
- You're squeezing.
- See? You heard him talk.

592
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,800
Uh-huh. Look.

593
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,100
l mean, l don't know how you're doing
your little trick, you know.

594
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,700
But l gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb. You know what I’m gonna do?

595
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,700
I’m gonna drink your last beer, watch three
football games on your television set,

596
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,400
and then I’m going home,
because this is dumb, Frank. Real dumb.

597
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,900
Now, that's dumb.

598
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,100
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.

599
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,000
l don't want to hear it, Frank.
l don't want to hear it, Frank!

600
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,500
- OK?
- OK.

601
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,700
Thank you.

602
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,700
That does it, Frank! I’m going home
and watch the Metropolitan Opera.

603
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,100
Oh, now, Link. We need your help.
Jake needs your help!

604
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,300
l don't want to hear about it!

605
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,600
You're the only person l know who knows
how to place a bet. l don't anything about...

606
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,400
What kind of a spaceship?

607
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,800
You're beautiful.

608
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,900
(phone rings)

609
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,600
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?

610
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,500
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking. What's your pleasure?

611
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Yeah. Give me four balls.
I’ll double it.

612
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,700
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- l say give him five.

613
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,000
The man says give him five.
You got it. Honest Harry holds.

614
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,600
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.

615
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,500
- Can l trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?

616
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,900
You wanna bet what?

617
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,400
Hold on.

618
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,600
- Hey, Ernie. Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.

619
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,700
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet
Jake and parlay the three football games.

620
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,200
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?

621
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah. It’ll come to 1 20 G's if he makes it.

622
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,400
It’s like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.

623
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,600
- He's down.
- You're down.

624
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,400
(man) Hold it right there.

625
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,800
General? General?

626
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,700
Fingerprints, sir. They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.

627
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,800
And they are the prints of a human being.

628
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,300
So whatever power brought this ship here
was aided by some disloyal American.

629
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,900
Gentlemen, we are dealing
with a collaborator.

630
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,900
l want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.

631
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,400
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!

632
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,200
General!

633
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,200
- Look at this. They found more.
- What in blazes is that?

634
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,700
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.

635
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,500
Even more important, we found tiny prints
in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.

636
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,300
Pussycat? Why aren't l hearing some
tickety-tacks? What about the fingerprints?

637
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,800
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.

638
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,500
What do you want me to do with this?

639
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,100
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.

640
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,400
(Stilton) ''ID - Wilson, Frank. Doctor.
Social Security, 631 -07-0829.''

641
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,900
''1 951 to '55. US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech.''

642
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,700
''Current employment, theoretician.'' ERL?!

643
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,200
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.

644
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,400
We'll have him in the slammer
within the hour.

645
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,500
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big,

646
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,200
and this double-crossing fink is gonna
lead us to him. To find the rat, tail the cat.

647
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,300
- Cat?
- It’s just an expression.

648
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,400
(football commentary on TV)

649
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,500
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks. I’ll wait till Frank gets back.

650
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,900
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead? The Rams won the game.

651
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,100
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.

652
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,900
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?

653
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,300
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah. Coming right up.

654
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,300
(TV) There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 2 1- 1 9. Houston driving.

655
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,300
- Another one in the bag.
- (knocking)

656
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
- Come in.
- Frank?

657
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,300
Uh-huh?

658
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,300
Hi. Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.

659
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,300
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.

660
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,300
Oh, the picnic.

661
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,300
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.

662
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,000
- Is something wrong?
- Uh...

663
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,400
(sneezes)

664
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,500
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?

665
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,300
- Jake's.
- Oh.

666
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,100
Yeah. Right.
l was up all night.

667
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,700
- Really?
- It’s gone into hyperzemia.

668
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,800
What's hyperzemia?

669
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,200
- It’s what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?

670
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,700
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?

671
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,400
- What's that? What's happening, Frank?
- l don't know.

672
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,700
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.

673
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.

674
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,700
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.

675
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,200
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.

676
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,000
OK. I’ll go get him.
I’ll be right back.

677
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,500
(Frank) Get him.
Somebody tackle him.

678
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,700
- Hi, sweetie. Can l get you anything?
- (Link) OK. Out of bounds on the 30.

679
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,600
Jake, why didn't you do something?

680
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,500
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.

681
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
You've got terrific whiskers.

682
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,600
Jake, will you pay attention? They're within
field-goal range. lf they make it, we're sunk.

683
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,400
No problem. Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?

684
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,600
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.

685
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,900
- Time out.
- (Liz) l appreciate it, Doctor.

686
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,400
At least you could have waited till
the game was over. l have $1 0 on Chicago.

687
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,100
- You've got it on. What's happening?
- Time out.

688
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,100
This is Dr. Wenger.

689
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,100
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
l definitely think he needs your attention.

690
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,400
All right.

691
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,200
- How did they get to the 30?
- (Link) Interception.

692
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,700
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- (TV) ...or a field goal?

693
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,400
(Liz) What do you think?

694
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,100
- l think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.

695
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,400
Hmm? Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.

696
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,700
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.

697
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,200
OK. Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.

698
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,800
Hey!

699
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Good thinking, Chicago.

700
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,300
(TV) This year. he's never missed
inside the 35-yard line.

701
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,300
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.

702
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,700
- Block that kick. Block that kick.
- (meowing)

703
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,300
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.

704
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,800
Jake, you better do something.

705
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,400
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...

706
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,800
- It’s right here, Frank.
- Huh?

707
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,500
- Give it to me, Liz. Give it to me.
- Frank, I’m just gonna hold the...

708
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,100
- I’m gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!

709
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,400
Frank, let go of the cat.

710
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,500
There's the snap. It's down.
The kick is up.

711
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,100
It's long enough.
It's straight enough. It's...

712
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,700
It's...

713
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,600
It's flat!

714
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:37,500
I've never seen anything like it. The ball
flattened out in midair. There's the gun.

715
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,600
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 2 1- 1 9.

716
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,300
l told you not to do that!

717
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,000
l only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, l do not make house calls.

718
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,800
You sure picked a dumb time
to break your rule.

719
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,700
Dr. Link!

720
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.

721
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,300
Jake. Jake, it's me, Jake.

722
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.

723
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,800
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.

724
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,700
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose. And
where does that leave this poor little guy?

725
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
He's blown his rendezvous
and my 1 500 clams.

726
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,100
That was very rude, Frank.

727
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,900
- Liz, butt out.
- What?

728
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,900
- Cancel the bet. Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.

729
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,700
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems. Speak to me.

730
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,300
Is everybody crazy?

731
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,000
The line is busy.
We'll never get through. He's taking bets.

732
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,300
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.

733
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,600
Just a minute, Frank.

734
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,500
l would like... No, l demand an explanation.
What's going on?

735
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,400
- Later, Liz.
- No. Now.

736
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,800
We have got exactly six minutes
before that game starts.

737
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,800
- Watch it, Link. I’m a black belt.
- OK. We'll tell you in the elevator.

738
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,300
Remember that meeting we had with
Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?

739
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,600
(Liz) Outer space?

740
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,400
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no. Remember that artichoke?

741
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,100
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.

742
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,400
This is Big Cheese. Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?

743
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,800
Yes, sir. Also that garbage expert
and the dame from the car pool.

744
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,700
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's
pool hall. Looks like a Mafia tie-in.

745
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,900
Mafia?

746
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,800
What kind of an operation
you running down there, Heffel?

747
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,800
Lucky! (laughs)

748
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,400
Really lucky.

749
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,000
Ernie? Ernie?

750
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Excuse me. Ernie?

751
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,100
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here. Hiya, Doc.

752
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,400
Uh, Ernie,

753
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,100
l wanna cancel my Chargers bet.

754
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,100
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.

755
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,600
Really? Why?

756
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,100
Oh, l don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.

757
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,600
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.

758
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,400
- Already?
- (cheering)

759
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,500
1 6, boss, 1 6.
Steelers just scored another one.

760
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,200
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?

761
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,700
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?

762
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,300
Well, there goes 1 20,000.
1 500 of which is mine.

763
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,900
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out. Jake, wake up.

764
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.

765
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,900
OK. OK. Isn’t there anything else
we can bet on?

766
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah. Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?

767
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,700
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?

768
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,300
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?

769
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,200
- Hockey?
- Hockey.

770
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,200
Ernie, is there a hockey game today
that we could put a few bucks on?

771
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,700
Sorry.

772
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,100
Horse race?

773
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,500
Boxing?

774
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,300
- Demolition derby? Anything to get even.
- No.

775
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,100
But if you want a little action, there's always
my good friend Sarasota Slim.

776
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,400
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.

777
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:11,200
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool
game with a slight wager on the side.

778
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,600
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?

779
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,700
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?

780
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,500
OK. It’s a bet.
What are the odds?

781
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,700
You against Sarasota Slim?

782
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,000
- Right.
- Frank.

783
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,200
Because l want to give you a chance to
break even and because l like your style,

784
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,500
let's say 8 to 1 .

785
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,300
That's all?
What about him?

786
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
- Me?
- Link?

787
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,300
Well, considering the shape he's in,
I’d say maybe 1 0 to 1 .

788
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,900
- Ohh. What about the lady?
- Me?

789
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,600
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1 .

790
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,600
- OK. You got a bet.
- Frank!

791
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,100
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.

792
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,200
Frank, l don't know anything
about this game.

793
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,500
Are you bananas? That guy can make
a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.

794
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,800
l know, but I’ve got the equalizer...
the collar.

795
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,800
- How are you gonna do that? Jake's out.
- I’ve used it, to repair the spaceship.

796
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,500
- You?
- Yes. I’ve flown.

797
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,900
Charlie, give me the special,
and heavy on the onions.

798
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,300
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.

799
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,600
Throw in a few chili peppers, huh?

800
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,300
- Frank, l don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.

801
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,900
I’m desperate. No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff. But... (clears throat)

802
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,100
But if we deliver,
look what we get in return...

803
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,500
the solution to half the problems
on this planet.

804
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,700
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.

805
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,600
We need a stake. I’ve got about 1 2 bucks.
It’s in my hip pocket. Will you get it for me?

806
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,000
- OK, that's 1 2. How much do you have?
- Me? l think l got 20.

807
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,300
- 20? Liz?
- Uh...

808
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,100
- l just have my mad money.
- Give it to us. Please?

809
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,700
Come on.

810
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,700
Boy, when this dame gets mad,
she gets mad.

811
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,200
l was going to buy
a whole spring wardrobe, Link.

812
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,200
- OK. Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.

813
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,400
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1 .
- Check.

814
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,800
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.

815
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,600
All right, you want Honest Harry,
you got Honest Harry.

816
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,700
300 at 20 to 1 .
That's 6,000 clams.

817
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,000
And here's our 300.

818
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,000
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.

819
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,800
6300.

820
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,500
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.

821
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,900
Young lady, it's your break.

822
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,600
Come on, don't be so stingy
with the onions.

823
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,700
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.

824
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,800
Link, keep your eye on him.
lf he blinks just once...

825
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,400
Miss? Do you mind?
We're waiting.

826
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,100
- Now, that's a sandwich. Right?
- (sniffs)

827
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Right.

828
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,600
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.

829
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,900
Nice break, young lady. Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,

830
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,600
- but there's always tomorrow.
- (laughter)

831
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,000
Show her how to do it.

832
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,600
OK, Slim, go get her.

833
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,900
Ooh, l can't watch this. (laughs)

834
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,700
- Frank, I’m sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

835
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,200
(ball pockets. applause)

836
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
(ball pockets. applause)

837
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
(man) Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.

838
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,200
l guess we are licked.
lf only Jake hadn't got knocked out...

839
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,600
(whispers) Frank! Frank, look.

840
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,700
Jake!

841
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,700
Jake?

842
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,900
Frank, he must have just woke up.

843
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,200
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah. Where am l? What happened?

844
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,200
I’m Liz Bartlett.
I’m responsible for your being...

845
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,700
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.

846
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,400
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.

847
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,300
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!

848
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,300
Honest Harry, guess who's here?

849
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,700
Ernie?

850
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,200
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?

851
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,800
I’m sorry. l can't do it.

852
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,400
- No bet.
- No bet?

853
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,200
It’s part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.

854
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,100
That's not fair!

855
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,500
Honest Harry?

856
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:26,400
lf the mark wants to go complete top city,
he's got a constitutional right.

857
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,000
And l stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?

858
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:34,900
It’s ridiculous. But if l didn't have
no principles, I’d say 1 00 to 1 .

859
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,100
Suppose... Suppose she gives
Sarasota Slim 1 2 balls?

860
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,500
What a sense of humor!

861
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,300
300 to 1 .

862
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,700
- And the break.
- The break?

863
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,500
500 to 1 .

864
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,800
And blindfolded.

865
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,800
- What?
- Blindfolded!

866
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,500
- 2,000 to 1 .
- You're on.

867
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,800
$60 at 2,000 to 1 .

868
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,400
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?

869
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,600
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But l thought you was putting me on.

870
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:16,100
Earnest Ernie, it would not do
your reputation any credit

871
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:22,300
if word was to circulate that you reneged
on a wager duly offered and accepted.

872
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,300
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...

873
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Get it!

874
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,400
All right.

875
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:48,300
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 1 2 balls and the break?

876
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,600
- And she shoots blindfolded.
- (laughs)

877
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,200
She'll never get to the table.

878
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,700
1 20 Gs, boss.

879
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,900
Don't put it away, Honest Harry,
you ain't gonna hold it long.

880
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,500
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.

881
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,000
Nice. Nice break, Slim.

882
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,100
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing,
but there's always tomorrow.

883
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,600
- l believe I’m up.
- Hold it. Blindfolded.

884
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,500
Oh.

885
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,200
Could you back off?

886
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,300
(applause)

887
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,400
You did it, Jake.
You did it.

888
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,000
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

889
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,800
it was really nothing.
Thank you.

890
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Frank, we won! Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, all of you. Thank you.

891
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,400
I’m sorry about things being upside down,

892
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,500
but l took these pictures
at risk of life and limb.

893
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,700
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?

894
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,600
Well, well.

895
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,400
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It’s just mind-boggling, isn't it?

896
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,600
l mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?

897
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,800
Thank you, Omar.

898
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,700
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.

899
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:23,500
it is ''mind-boggling,''
as you so graphically put it.

900
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,800
The possibilities are infinite.

901
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:34,300
A revolution in transportation, space
exploration, colonizing the planets.

902
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,800
The man who owns the secret
of this device could control...

903
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,700
The world, sir?

904
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,500
The universe.

905
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,200
Oh, my!

906
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:52,000
Well, then, sir, l don't suppose it would be
out of place to suggest a bonus.

907
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,800
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.

908
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,700
Mr. Stallwood, if l gain
the secret of that device,

909
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:05,500
you may well become a very rich man.

910
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,500
l may?

911
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,000
Oh, sir, l... really may?

912
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,800
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.

913
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,000
l must have that collar.

914
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,300
l will have that collar.

915
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,400
OK. All set, General.

916
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,400
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.

917
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,400
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.

918
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:43,300
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?

919
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,400
it is a pussycat!

920
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,100
This machine is having
a nervous breakdown.

921
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,000
Get on the ball, young man. Feed that
information through again. Reassess.

922
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,400
Yes, sir.

923
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,100
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?

924
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,700
That purchase Dr. Link made... we
checked it out. It’s a large quantity of gold.

925
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,700
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.

926
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,200
It’s a Machiavellian conspiracy.

927
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,300
Radio.

928
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:26,500
This is Big Cheese calling
Dydee One. Where are you, Dydee One?

929
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,500
Outside the suspect's apartment.

930
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,700
Don't let them out of your sight.

931
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,500
Another printout, General.

932
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,400
Of all the...

933
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,100
Wait a minute. Radio.

934
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,700
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.

935
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,500
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.

936
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,200
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.

937
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
- Colonel.
- Captain.

938
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,600
$1 20,000 in one lump sum.

939
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,600
Jake, how'd you like to hang around
and watch me parlay this into a fortune?

940
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,500
- l wish l could hang around.
- I’m sorry, Jake. The time?

941
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,800
Huh? Oh, yeah.

942
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,600
Sorry, Lucy.

943
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,400
- l guess I’d better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?

944
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,300
- What are you talking about?
- It’s a new concept in calculating mass.

945
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,800
On Jake's planet, they use a system based
on content, rather than on the quantitative...

946
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,500
Frank! You've got a whole lifetime
to explain that. I’ve got less than an hour.

947
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,900
Now, stand back, everybody.

948
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,800
- All right, don't move! All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?

949
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,300
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!

950
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,600
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.

951
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,100
And the pussycat.

952
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,500
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?

953
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,400
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.

954
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,700
You have the right to remain silent.

955
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,100
Anything you say can be used against
you in a court of law. You have the right...

956
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,800
- Good heavens.
- Frank...

957
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,500
- What happened?
- (Frank) They're frozen.

958
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,900
Holy mackerel!

959
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,700
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into
Hopscotch? You can't zap the whole base.

960
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,100
- Yeah, well, I’ll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.

961
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,600
First things first.

962
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,500
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry
about getting on the base. Now stand back.

963
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,600
OK. Here goes.

964
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,400
Ohh.

965
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,200
That is unbelievable.

966
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,700
Oh, Jake.

967
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,400
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,100
(Link) Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.

969
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:59,300
No. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. l think I’ve
got the perfect way to get us onto the base.

970
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,700
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?

971
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,300
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.

972
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:13,200
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.

973
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,300
Come in. Big Cheese.
Come in.

974
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,300
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.

975
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:36,200
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.

976
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,300
What isn't?

977
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,400
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.

978
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,700
What does it all mean?

979
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,100
it means it's exceptionally complicated.

980
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,800
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese. Come in.

981
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,000
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.

982
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,200
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
l mean, Stilton.

983
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,900
- (Frank) Wait. Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.

984
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:18,000
- How do l look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?

985
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,200
- Do l look like a general?
- Oh, well...

986
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,100
Frank, you look very commanding.

987
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,100
- That'll have to do. Let's go.
- OK.

988
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,900
He got the cat.
That's the cat!

989
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,500
Where's the general going with those two?

990
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
That's the general?

991
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,600
It’s not?

992
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,600
Open your door!
Open the doors!

993
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,600
Open the doors!

994
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,700
Halt! Halt in the name of the US...

995
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,600
Fantastic.

996
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,100
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah. Be careful.

997
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,200
- Bye, Lucybelle. Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

998
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,300
Bye.

999
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,500
- They've escaped?
- Yes.

1000
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,600
But, fortunately for us,
they left something very valuable behind.

1001
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,700
(car door opens)

1002
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,700
- General Stilton?
- Of course!

1003
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,000
Of course.
I’ll sign you in, sir.

1004
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,100
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?

1005
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,200
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.

1006
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,300
l want the hangar open. All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.

1007
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,400
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar,
how are you gonna...

1008
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,300
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir. Yes, sir.

1009
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,000
Get the hangar doors open. All personnel
out of the hangar on the double.

1010
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,800
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.

1011
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,900
..to talk to a lawyer and have him present
while you're being...

1012
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
(sniggering)

1013
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,900
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,000
Hold it right here, Frank.

1015
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,700
1 30 to countdown.

1016
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,200
Hurry. Insert the gold
in the microtransformer.

1017
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,300
Right, right.

1018
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,200
- Got it.
- Good.

1019
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,400
Now let's see if we have contact.

1020
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,000
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.

1021
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,200
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!

1022
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,100
OK, OK.

1023
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,700
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.

1024
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,600
Hi there. fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.

1025
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,200
- We had problems.
- We are 1 05 to liftoff.

1026
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,200
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.

1027
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,200
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20. Set clinometers.

1028
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:25,300
- Clinometers set. Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.

1029
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,600
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah. A real mother.

1030
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,700
- l gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?

1031
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,800
A friend of Frank Wil...
l mean General Stilton.

1032
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,500
A very good friend.

1033
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,800
Let's go.

1034
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,300
Open the gate.

1035
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,300
My car!

1036
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,600
- Them, too.
- Never mind. Let's get down to Hopscotch.

1037
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,000
- Sergeant.
- Captain.

1038
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:10,100
Colonel.

1039
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,200
- General.
- Oh, get in!

1040
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,100
- (Mother Ship) Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!

1041
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,400
Hold it, sir, right there.

1042
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,800
General, this man says...

1043
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,100
Hey!

1044
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,000
You're not General Stilton.

1045
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,600
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?

1046
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,500
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.

1047
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,700
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?

1048
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,600
He's an agent for some guy named
Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...

1049
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,400
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?

1050
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,600
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It’s the collar or Liz.

1051
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,000
- Where is she?
- I’m going with you, Frank.

1052
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,700
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on
Earth. You're responsible to your mission.

1053
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,000
- But I’m the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?

1054
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,000
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is? Let's go.

1055
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,200
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.

1056
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,400
Now, get in there.

1057
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,600
So long, buddy.

1058
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,200
Yeah.

1059
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,200
Let's go.

1060
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,200
5. 4

1061
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,100
3. 2.

1062
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,800
ignite.

1063
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,300
Bye, Jake.

1064
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,000
Drop us a card.

1065
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,900
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it. Let's go.

1066
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,300
Jake!

1067
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,700
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.

1068
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,100
You're wasting time.
The airport!

1069
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,700
General, look!

1070
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,200
(General) Good heavens!

1071
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,500
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.

1072
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,200
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!

1073
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,100
Here comes a car.

1074
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,100
It’s Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.

1075
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,600
And the cat!
They're here. They've come.

1076
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,100
Naturally.

1077
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,100
You knew they would.
You knew it. We've won.

1078
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:33,000
Now they will have turn over the cat
and we will turn over the girl.

1079
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,600
We will?

1080
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,700
We won't?

1081
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,800
it may be difficult to explain your part in this
after the young lady's gone to the police.

1082
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,600
Oh, dear.

1083
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,600
You wouldn't dare?

1084
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,200
Frank, that must be the chopper.

1085
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,500
(sirens wailing)

1086
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,000
It’s the police, sir.
It’s a trap.

1087
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,700
The fools!
Get us airborne.

1088
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,000
(Jake) Watch it!

1089
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,900
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.

1090
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,800
But look who's arriving -
the army and the police.

1091
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:47,800
We have to follow that copter. What kind of
an airport is this? Where are the planes?

1092
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,300
Follow me.

1093
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,600
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake. It’s a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.

1094
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,100
- Are you coming or staying?
- I’m coming.

1095
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,300
I’m staying.

1096
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,800
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?

1097
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,200
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous Francis?

1098
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,100
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.

1099
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,200
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?

1100
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,500
Uh...

1101
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,800
General, you're not gonna believe this.

1102
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,900
There they are.

1103
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,100
- It’s Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?

1104
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,900
The power that cat possesses is awesome.

1105
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,500
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know
what's good for you, you'll land...

1106
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,600
- Quiet!
- OK.

1107
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:25,000
Faster, Omar, faster.

1108
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,500
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.

1109
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,900
No chance. It’s taking all l got
just to keep this crate flying.

1110
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,500
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.

1111
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,800
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?

1112
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,600
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.

1113
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,000
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.

1114
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,000
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?

1115
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,300
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.

1116
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,400
Frank!

1117
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,100
Jake!

1118
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,700
(Frank screams)

1119
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,700
Jake. Jake.

1120
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,300
Jake! Jake.

1121
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,700
Jake.

1122
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,500
Turn this thing over.

1123
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,400
Jake.

1124
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,800
Jake.

1125
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,200
Jake. Jake!

1126
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,400
Jake. Jake!

1127
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,600
Frank, are you OK?

1128
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,400
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.

1129
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,300
They probably figured out
that we've got a problem.

1130
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,600
Hold on.

1131
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,600
Here they come.

1132
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,300
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.

1133
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,900
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!

1134
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,800
Whoa!

1135
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,100
(Jake) l see 'em.
l see 'em.

1136
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,800
Look out. Jake! Jake!

1137
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,900
- Here they come again. Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.

1138
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,500
Fruitcake. Frank, watch out!

1139
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,000
Jake, Jake.

1140
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,600
(Jake yowls)

1141
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,400
Uh-oh.

1142
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,400
Oh, boy.

1143
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,100
Jake.

1144
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,600
Oh, dear.

1145
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,400
Jake.

1146
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:39,800
Break off!

1147
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,600
(gasps)

1148
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:59,800
Buzz them again, Omar,
and this time, everybody open fire.

1149
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,900
(gunshot)

1150
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,800
(coughing)

1151
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,500
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!

1152
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,700
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls. They're locked.

1153
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,700
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?

1154
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,000
We have no choice.

1155
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Bail out?

1156
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,900
Where are you going?
l haven't got a parachute, either.

1157
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:52,700
- Then you have a problem.
- l haven't got a parachute either.

1158
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:55,000
Then you have the same problem.

1159
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,000
Wait! No, wait!
Wait a minute!

1160
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,500
l d... l don't want to die!

1161
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,400
Oh, swell.

1162
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,100
Frank!

1163
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,700
Frank!

1164
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,900
(groans)

1165
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,800
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.

1166
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:22,100
We're just waiting for them to land
and we'll pass that on.

1167
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,600
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?

1168
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,200
Jake is to be treated as
the representative of a friendly power,

1169
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:33,300
with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.

1170
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,400
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.

1171
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:42,800
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?

1172
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,900
Frank!

1173
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,800
Easy, Liz. Don't panic.

1174
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:16,900
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- l don't know, but l have to do something.

1175
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,800
Hand me Lucybelle!

1176
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,600
- Careful, Frank!
- l got her.

1177
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:21,000
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.

1178
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,300
Right.

1179
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,300
Liz, when we get close enough,
grab my hand.

1180
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,300
Frank, you're too far away!

1181
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,000
(Frank) Closer, Jake. Closer!

1182
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,900
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!

1183
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,500
Grab it! Liz, careful.

1184
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,300
- OK.
- Now grab my hand. Grab my hand.

1185
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,200
All right.

1186
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,300
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good. That's good.

1187
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,300
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?

1188
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,800
- Liz!
- Huh? Ohh...

1189
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:12,200
- Frank, l don't think this is gonna work.
- All right. We'll try it again.

1190
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,200
Never mind.
We'll try something else.

1191
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,800
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?

1192
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:29,900
Put your feet right there,
on my shoulders.

1193
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,100
No!

1194
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,100
Liz, do it!

1195
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,000
OK. OK.

1196
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,900
- Oh... Oh... Ohh!
- Whoa!

1197
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:55,100
You see? Everything's gonna be OK,
Lucybelle. Just relax.

1198
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,600
Jake!

1199
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:59,800
Jake, what are you doing?

1200
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:04,400
You know, when l saw you up
in that chopper, l just... Huh?

1201
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,900
Well, honey, looks like
you're stuck with me.

1202
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,200
(explosion)

1203
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,200
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.

1204
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:24,600
- Don't worry. I’ll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?

1205
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:28,900
Fortunately, l never go anywhere
without my Swiss Army knife.

1206
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Idiot!

1207
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,800
